AB  - Reticular or net-like perineuronal coatings enriched with proteoglycans (PGs) and/or glycoproteins (GPs) were demonstrated to ensheathe cell surfaces of certain neuronal circuits in the central nervous system of mammals, reptiles and fishes. In this investigation the coated or ensheathed neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of adult albino rats were quantified using a computerised analysing system. They were distributed throughout the II?IV cortical layers and comprised about 24.25% of total neurons. The perineuronal coatings were expressed with a cationic iron colloid (CIC), CIC/Bodian staining and with certain plant lectins from Vicia villosa agglutinin ?VVA?, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin ?WFA? and Glycine max agglutinin ?SBA?. The mean number of coated neurons per unit area (UA, 60.15??m2), as labelled by CIC or CIC/Bodian, VVA, WFA and SBA staining was 4.01?±?0.42, 4.43?±?0.37, 6.45?±?0.87, 5.70?±?0.73 and 3.91?±?0.53, respectively. In addition, labelling indicated by the aforementioned stains were 10.55%, 11.55%, 16.97%, 15.00% and 10.23%. Notably, the labelled retrosplenial neurons underwent a non-significant increase with progression of animal age at the first post-natal year. However, they declined thereafter toward senility. Qualitatively, there were three types of coated neuronal circuits at the RSC of rats: PGs-, GPs- and PGs/GPs- coated cells, which comprised 9%, 64% and 27%, respectively. This data indicated that the GPs- and GPs/PGs- coated neurons in the RSC of albino rats were more prevalent than the PGs- coated ones.

AB  - Introduction:? Epidermal?dermal interactions play an important role in regulation of proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and also in disease and regeneration of skin. A double paracrine regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation has been postulated and described in vitro recently. Interleukin-1 (Il-1) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF/FGF-7) and their receptors are major mediators in this epidermal-dermal signalling. Aim:? We wanted to generate evidence for a reciprocal regulation of epidermal proliferation and differentiation in the bovine claw involving Il-1 and KGF. Methods:? Tissue samples from claws of slaughtered cows, co-cultures and three-dimensional cultures of bovine hoof keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used. Immunohistochemistry for Il-1 and Il-1 receptor, KGF and KGF receptor were carried out on frozen and paraffin sections from tissue and cell culture. RT-PCR was used to study regulation at the mRNA level in dermis and epidermis (after micro separation) and in fibroblasts and keratinocytes from the cultures respectively. Results:? In claw epidermis Il-1 was accumulated and KGF receptor was detectable. Interleukin-1 receptor and KGF were present in dermal cells. Il-1 stimulated fibroblasts responded with KGF expression in vitro. Neutralization of Il-1 reduced or stopped this effect. Keratinocytes co-cultured with fibroblasts showed a significant better growth. Presence of keratinocytes increased KGF expression in the co-cultured fibroblasts. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that Il-1 is leading to stimulation of KGF expression. KGF seems to be an important stimulator of keratinocyte proliferation in our co-culture system. So far our results provide initial evidence for a reciprocal regulatory mechanism present in the bovine claw involving Il- 1 produced in the epidermis and KGF originating from fibroblasts. Future in vitro studies including mRNA analysis will provide deeper insight into the epidermal-dermal cross-talk and the involved transcriptional/translational regulation in the bovine claw.

AB  - Introduction:? Today, the claims on the anatomical education have changed with the considerable increase of modern medical imaging. For the analysis of computed tomography (CT) images, magnetic resonance (MR) images or ultrasound, the knowledge of cross sectional anatomy is an important prerequisite for proper diagnosis. Admittedly, it is difficult for students and also for practitioners to imagine three-dimensional objects in space. The possibilities and convenience of 3D-reconstructions were demonstrated by generating virtual casts of frontal sinuses. Methods:? Using a HiSpeed (DX/i Plus, General Electric) scanner transversal CT images of Persian and European Shorthair cats were acquired. The slice thickness and distance were set to 1?mm. With the software system VG Studio MAX 1.1, the obtained volumetric data was used to create volume graphics displaying object surfaces and interiors based on voxel data. Because of density value acquisition, it was possible to identify and label the objects of interest. The extension of the paranasal sinuses was analyzed and demonstrated in relation to the skull. For verification, conventional corrosion casting employing Technovit or Tensolcement, respectively, were carried out on the same specimens. Results:? The frontal sinuses of both feline breeds showed great variations in size, shape and symmetry. With models from the skull based on 3D-datasets including the virtual casts of the paranasal sinuses, it was easy to imagine spatial relations and localizations inside the head. The advantages of the virtually derived casting method are: creating the virtual casts in vivo; the method does not imply any health risks and is repeatedly applicable. Conclusion:? 3D-reconstructions based on CT-datasets are excellently suited for generating spatial sense. Additionally, a single scan series can be applied for different anatomical problems. The resulting digital 3D-objects are readily available and can be employed for educational purposes for better comprehension of the difficult spatial relations of the head.

AB  - Aims:? The even-hoofed, unguligrade tylopods display a well-developed eponymous footpad that absorbs most of the body weight in locomotion and is particularly adapted to the sandy ground surface of the natural environment of dromedaries. Considering the drastic changes in temperature occurring in the desert sand, specialised thermoregulatory vascular and nervous structures are to be expected in the modified pododerma of this footpad. Therefore, the aim of the study was to demonstrate the angioarchitecture of the camelid footpad and to detect specialised vascular structures related to these specific functions. Material and Methods:? Corrosion casting of fore and hind feet of dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius); scanning electron microscopy of micro-corrosion casts Results and Discussion:? The dense angioarchitecture of the dromedary footpad, like that of unmodified skin, can be subdivided into separate plexus arranged at different levels: a subcutaneous plexus, a profound dermal plexus, a superficial dermal plexus and a subepidermal plexus. The subepidermal blood vessels run very close to the dermo-epidermal borderline and thus the subepidermal angioarchitecture consists of densely vascularised conical papillae comprised of centrally situated papillary arteriole and venule ensheathed in a dense subepidermal capillary network. At the tip of the papillae, the central papillary arteriole and venule form a peripheral capillary loop, acting as a thoroughfare channel. This dermal angioarchitecture of the dromedary footpad is comparable to the papillary system described in the bulbs of the highly specialised digital end organs of many other odd- and even-hoofed mammals, particularly the equine hoof and the bovine claw. Within the subcutaneous and the deep dermal plexus of the dromedary foot pad, unique glomus-like vascular structures were detectable, presumably associated with cutaneous thermoregulation as described for the unmodified hairy skin.

AB  - The reported examinations were carried out on turtles, Japanese quails and chinchillas of either sex. The trigeminal nerve was studied with the modified thiocholine method and routine histological techniques. The trigeminal ganglion of the turtle is a single, compact structure connected with the trigeminal nerve. Analysis of consecutive sections showed a presence of ganglionic neurocytes only at the medial side of the trigeminal nerve. A small number of nerve cells and large number of fibres is characteristic for the investigated structure. The trigeminal ganglion of Japanese quail is a structure connected with two branches (ophthalmic and mandibular) of the trigeminal nerve. Both parts of the ganglion distinctly differ in their morphology. The part connected with the ophthalmic branch ? V1 forms a thickening of the nerve, which becomes narrow approaching the orbital cavity. The second part connected with the mandibular branch ? V2 is of regular shape. This part of the ganglion is located in the vicinity of a delicate maxillary branch. Histological investigations allow us to observe a characteristic arrangement of neurocytes with only one layer of nerve cells on the surface of the ganglion. The trigeminal ganglion in chinchilla is a single, irregular cluster of neurocytes closely connected with trigeminal nerve where this nerve divides into ophthalmic and maxillary nerves. Agglomerations of neurocytes allow us to distinguish two parts of trigeminal ganglion. From the medial aspect, the nasal part of ganglion is connected with this part of the trigeminal nerve, which is not distinctly divided into ophthalmic and maxillary branches. The caudal part of the trigeminal ganglion is connected with the mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve. These two parts are separated from each other by the motor radix of the trigeminal nerve. From the lateral side all parts of the ganglion form one structure and it is difficult to distinguish precisely different cell aggregations corresponding to the particular branches of trigeminal nerve.

AB  - Aims:? The metanephric kidneys of the pig are used as xenotransplants in human medicine. In order for transplants to fit within the host organisms, the subcapsular blastema and blood vessels are crucial for the development of new nephrons to sustain the organ functions. The aim of this study is to obtain data concerning the post-natal development of metanephric nephrons in the porcine kidney. Materials and Methods:? The metanephric kidneys of six porcine fetuses with a crown-rump length ranging from 40?mm to 220?mm of eight piglets aged between 6 to 10?weeks and of three adult pigs were studied. Eight lectins as well as anti-actin and anti-myosin antibodies were used for lectin- and immunohistochemistry to study the subcapsular metanephric blastema, to visualize the blood-urine barrier in the nephrons and collecting tubules, and to study the blood vessels in both the renal cortex and marrow. Results and Conclusions:? A subcapsular metanephric blastema was still present in the kidney of 10-week-old piglets. Dense condensation of mesenchymal cells surrounded the terminal branches of the collecting ducts and showed first signs of mesenchymal-epithelial transformation. Characteristic comma-shaped and s-shaped bodies were found in and underneath the subcapsular blastema. In the fibrous renal capsule of six-week-old piglets, a first faint binding reaction of anti-actin was visible and intensified in the fibrous renal capsule in ten-week-old piglets and in adult pigs. In addition, the smooth-muscle layers of the blood vessels were stained by the anti-actin and anti-myosin antibodies. The lectins showed various affinities to the endothelium of blood vessels and to the epithelial cells lining of the capsules of the metanephric renal corpuscles, the various parts of the renal tubules, as well as the collecting tubules and the renal pelvis. The affinity of the epithelial cells to a specific lectin varies in neighbouring cells, indicating different cell activities or cell cycles.

AB  - Pleuronectiformes or flatfishes are teleostean fishes well known for their external asymmetry, with the two eyes on one side of the body, right or left according to the species. Their internal asymmetry has not been studied in detail in various species and we report here some original observation and manipulation on the kidney of some flatfishes. In most flatfishes, the kidney is an uneven and symmetrical organ present in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity, lying on the ventral side of the vertebral column, between the haemal arches. Dorsally, the kidney bends ventrally and the whole organ is boomerang-shaped. However, in two flatfish families, the structure of the kidney appears to be different. Kobelkowsky (2000) shows that the kidney of the American soles (family Achiridae) is asymmetrical with a more developed right posterior part extending backwards between the haemal spines and the right epaxial musculature. Such an asymmetry has been mentioned in the common sole (Solea solea [Soleidae]) by Audigé (1910) and forgotten in the subsequent literature. However, it is the left side posterior part that is more developed in the common sole. This peculiar structure has been observed in dissected and plastinated specimens of several soleid species. This anatomical feature seems to be unique to flatfish species belonging to the Soleidae, a more developed left posterior of the kidney appears to be a synapomorphy of the animals belonging to this family and confirms the monophyly of this group. We hope to specify this point in a near future. The anatomy of kidney should then be taken in account in future works dedicated to flatfishes systematics. Conclusions:(1) The anatomy of soft organs is mostly unknown for flatfishes, even for those of economic importance, and examination of the structures of these species is highly needed. (2) The study of the soft anatomy reveals a new set of data for the research of flatfish phylogeny. (3) In order to make a better comparison between the different species, a process of good conservation, like plastination, is needed for preservation of the structures (Grondin and Olry, 2000; Dieckwisch, 1990). In fish, plastination is well known to preserve the internal organs (Asadi, 1998). References? Asadi, M.H., 1998: Plastination of Sturgeons with the S10 technique in Iran: the first Trials. J. Int.

AB  - At the University of Missouri-Columbia, USA, teaching the anatomy of genital organs in large (and in small) animals is clinically oriented. In the male horse, ox, and pig, the descriptive anatomy of the structures is taught in that order as they are listed in Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria. Clinical correlates are immediately mentioned in relation to each of the following structures. The testicle, epididymis, ductus deferens, spermatic cord, and tunics of spermatic cord and testis are correlated to the castration, criptorchidism, ectopic testicles, and inguinal herniae, as well as to the landmarks and approaches to different clinical techniques. The penis and male urethra are correlated to the prolapse of the prepuce, ulcerative posthitis, balanitis, penile deviation, penischisis, persistent penile frenulum, short retractor penis muscle, catheterization of the urethra, the contagious equine metritis (CEM), etc. In the female horse, ox and pig, following the similar order as in the male species, the ovary and the salpinx are correlated to the diagnosis of pregnancy by rectal exploration, ovarian hypoplasia, ectopic pregnancy, and ovariectomy. The uterus is correlated to the different aspects of metritis and endometritis, to the retained placenta, pyometra, uterine torsion, uterine prolapse and eversion, Caesarian section, diagnosis of pregnancy and different stages of oestrus by rectal exploration, double external ostium of the cervix, distocia, and the assessment of possible difficulties in the birth process. The vagina and vestibulum vaginae are correlated to the gaertneritis, vaginal and cervical prolapse, vaginitis, catheterization of the urinary bladder, and pelvimetry. The vulva and clitoris are correlated to vulvitis, balanitis, distocia, episiotomy, and transmissible genital diseases. Different kinds of udder diseases (mastitis) are based on the thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the udder including the blood and nerve supply and the lymphatic system. The two techniques of epidural anesthesia (Magda and Farquharson in ruminants) and subsacral anaesthesia (Popescu) for diagnosis and treatment purposes are explained in detail.

AB  - The oestrogen receptor beta (ERß) is largely distributed in the ovary of many species but data for the bovine ovary are scare. Therefore, the expression of ERß mRNA in the different follicles of the bovine ovary was studied using in situ hybridization. Ovarian tissue sections of three cows with different plasma progesterone concentrations were used (cow 1: 3.50?ng/ml; cow 2: 1.00?ng/ml, cow 3: 0.35?ng/ml). A 602?bp fragment of ERß mRNA was cloned, sequenced and digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled. Subsequently, in situ hybridization was performed by incubating the sections with the DIG-labelled RNA anti-sense probe. For the semi-quantitative evaluation of ERß mRNA expression the ERß mRNA score (SER) was determined for the different follicular cell types using the formula: SER = 0.n0 + 1.n1+ 2.n2 + 3.n3 with n0, n1, n2, n3 indicating the percentage of cells exhibiting a staining intensity 0 (absent), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong), respectively. High ER mRNA levels were noticed in primordial and primary follicle cells, and suggest a role of ER mRNA in early folliculogenesis. A lower SER was observed in the granulosa cells of secondary and tertiary follicles. This significant difference in the SER of follicle cells during follicular growth may be associated with cell proliferation. In obliterative and cystic atretic follicles high SER were observed, although ERß mRNA levels in obliterative follicles showed much inter-individual variation. This is suggestive for ERß mediated oestrogen action in atretic follicles. In the corpora lutea moderate ERß mRNA levels were noticed. Our findings are in accordance with studies in the ewe in which corpora lutea cells synthesize estrogen. These preliminary findings will be further elaborated in a higher number of cows to examine the role of ERß in the ovary throughout the oestrus cycle.

AB  - The morphology and function of the circumanal glands in dogs is under current discussion. They are clinically important because they rank fourth in frequency as the site of canine skin tumours. The tissue is known to be governed by steroid hormones, as the gland exhibit sexual dimorphism, castration reduces the size of the gland and lead to tumour regression. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the hormone receptors in healthy circumanal glands as well as adenomas and adenocarcinomas in intact and castrated female and male dogs of different age groups. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against androgen receptor (AR, Affinity Bioreagents, rabbit pc, 1:150) and oestrogen receptor (ER, Zymed Lab., rabbit pc, 1:200) after antigen retrieval with microwave cooking. Positive and negative nuclei were counted using Eclipse software and subsequently statistically evaluated. ER and AR-positive nuclei could be detected in healthy as well as in diseased tissue sections of the circumanal gland. The number of positive nuclei was higher in the flattened peripheral cells compared to the large polygonal cells in the centre of the lobule. There was no significant difference between male and female tissue and between healthy glands and tumours although in tumours there was a tendency to a higher number of positive cells. In tumours, the distribution of hormone receptor positive cells was more irregular and varied between single lobules. Castrated animals of both sexes showed a slightly higher number of positive nuclei than intact animals, but the difference was not significant. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of steroid hormone receptors in the canine circumanal gland. We suggest that an evaluation of steroid hormone receptors is justified before general hormonal or anti-hormonal treatment of patients.

AB  - Aim:? The aims of this study were immunhistochemical (IHC) and ultrastruktural characterization of cells involved in vaccine granuloma formation in Atlantic salmon. Methods:? Fish suffering from severe reaction 6 to 9 months after vaccination were selected. We investigated granuloma from peritoneum, at the injection site. Morphological staining techniques, IHC to visualise MHC+ cells and ultrastructural analysis were performed. Results:? Microbial investigations revealed no infective agents. Histological and ultrastructural studies revealed Russel bodies, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, melanomacrophages (MMP), mast cells (MC) and Splendore?Hoepply material in the lesions. Conclusion:? Signet ring cells identified after vaccination have been hitherto described as svollen mast cells. This study shows that these cells fit the Russel body characteristic, consistent with humoral stimulation following vaccination and foreign material precipitate, Splendore-Hoepply material. MHC+ cells were located circumferal to granuloma centers. MMP were present containing melanosomes in different developmental stages.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? The corpus luteum is one of the most intensely vascularized tissues. Luteal angiogenesis is strictly controlled and blood vessels regress completely within a short period of time. The aim of this study was to investigate vascular dynamics in relation to cellular and molecular mechanisms of luteal angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis. Material and Methods:? Endothelial cells of blood vessels in paraffin sections of bovine corpora lutea from different stages were examined by labelling with the lectin Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Angiogenesis was studied by morphometry of the capillaries, and immunolocalization of the angiogenic factor VEGF and VEGF-receptor 2. Presence of apoptotic luteal and endothelial cells was investigated using the TUNEL test and transmission electron microscopy. Results:? During development of the corpus luteum (day 3?8 of the oestrous cycle) a dense capillary network (8?12% area ratio) is established and maintained until day 17. Early regression (day 18?24) is characterized by a remarkable decrease of capillaries (1% area ratio). In the regressing corpus luteum the number of apoptotic luteal cells is closely correlated (r?=?0.9) to the number of apoptotic endothelial cells. VEGF is immunolocalized in luteal cells (day 3?17), smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of arterioles of the regressing corpus luteum. During late luteal regression, a moderate increase of capillaries (2.5% area ratio) is obvious. Conclusions:? The dynamic changes of the capillarity during development and regression of the cyclic corpus luteum correlate with VEGF and VEGF-R2 activities. In contrary to expectations the late stage of luteal regression is accompanied by angiogenesis. One reason for this phenomenon may be an increase in metabolic activity resulting in re-organization of blood vessels already regressed.

AB  - The increased use of embryo technologies, in particular in cattle, has emphasized the need for assessing embryo quality by morphological techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry for confocal laser scanning microscopy, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. By a combination of these techniques, we have demonstrated that (1) the rRNA gene activation in the 8-cell bovine embryo as monitored by nucleolar development is comparable in embryos developed in vivo and produced in vitro, whereas embryos reconstructed by cloning by nuclear transfer display deviations in nucleolar development, (2) generating bovine embryos by in vitro production and reconstruction by nuclear transfer is associated with increased occurrence of apoptosis, in particular in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, (3) the same two embryo production techniques are associated with increased occurrence of mixoplody, i.e. embryos presenting a major population of normal diploid cells and a minor population of abnormal haploid or polyploid cells, and (4) upon hatching from the zona pellucida, the inner cell mass of the bovine blastocyst differentiate into hypoblasts and epiblasts, the latter of which forms a laminin enclosed pluripotent cell niche staining positive for the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4; a morphology that resembles that maintained by bovine ES-like cells cultured through several passages in vitro.

AB  - Leishmaniases are a globally widespread group of parasitic diseases from the group of anthropozoonoses. They are caused by an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and dogs worldwide. In fact, the dog is considered one of the most important reservoir. The spleen is one of the several haematopoietic and immunocompetent organs involved. As this organ is a blood filter, the authors looked for the expression of this infection over the microvascular environment and modifications of the spleen cell population related to immunological responses to this parasitic condition. Tools:? Scanning electronic microscopy over intact tissue and corrosion casts, transmission electronic microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry (MAC 387 and CD3). Results:? Our results show three important modifications concerning the microvascular architecture of the spleen when compared to the normal pattern. A striking scarcity of the sinusoidal system sheath that surrounds the central arteries of the white pulp, a huge development of pulp venules and veins, differentiation of typical features of high endothelial venular cells. Remarks:? According to our results it seems that independent of the virulence of the parasite involved and the kind of immunity prevalent in a particular host, the spleen develops blood dynamic conditions that allows a sluggish blood flow so that cells involved in immunological processes can proliferate and differentiate and it also contributes to the trapping of lymphocytes to the area through the differentiation of typical characteristics of HEV endothelial cells.

AB  - This study was conducted on nine heads of normal adult one-humped camels. The specimens were collected from Cairo slaughterhouse. The nasal cavity in the freshly collected samples were dissected and photographed. The specimens for microscopic studies were fixed in different fixatives and prepared to examine by light and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The nasal cavity of the camel was studied grossly and by using of light and scanning electron microscope. Specimens from different regions of this cavity were subjected to different histological stains and also demonstrated by the acid and alkaline phosphatases. Gross morphological examination of this cavity showed its three parts: rostral part (the nasal vestibule) covered with skin of usual structure then it lined with smooth mucosa. The middle part (respiratory) had dorsal, middle and ventral nasal conchae, but the caudal part (olfactory) contained the ethmoidal concha. The lining mucosa of the camel nasal cavity was similar to that of other mammals, but there were some differences: the respiratory epithelium showed a small number of goblet cells and there were a mixture of acidic and neutral mucins inside the epithelial and glandular mucous cells. Strong acid and alkaline phosphatase reaction was observed in the lining epithelium of the nasal cavity. By SEM, it showed the surface epithelial layer of the nasal cavity mucosa in three regions (vestibule, respiratory and olfactory) and resulted that it was stratified cuboidal to columnar epithelium, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with few goblet cells or olfactory mucosa containing neurosensory olfactory cells. This study aimed to investigate the anatomical features, the histological and histochemical structures of the nasal cavity in one humped camel. The findings of this study were discussed with the previous works in this field with the other domestic animals.

AB  - The anatomical and clinical studies of computed tomography (CT) in Camelidae are scarce. The use of CT in large animal medicine is currently limited by the logistic problems of acquiring computed tomographic images. Several CT studies exist on adult llamas, but not in camels. Accurate interpretation of the planimetric CT normal anatomy is necessary for the study and evaluation of pathological tissues. The purpose of our work was to evaluate the thorax of the newborn camel and related structures by means of CT images and macroscopic sections. One newborn camel of one week was used. It was euthanized for medical reasons unrelated to disease of the thorax. CT images were obtained and detailed anatomy of the thorax was acquired. Different CT windows, soft-tissue and pulmonary windows, were applied in order to obtain detailed attenuation shades of the thoracic structures. The camel was frozen and sectioned using an electric saw, and we obtained high quality images of the thorax compared with CT images. Clinically relevant anatomic structures of the thorax cavity were identified and labelled in the corresponding CT and gross-section photographs. The information presented in this paper should serve as an initial reference to evaluate CT images of the newborn camel thorax.

AB  - The influence of some environmental factors and some protecting substances were tested in a laboratory trial with healthy coronary horn and compared with specimens of damaged horn from the bearing border, which had been submitted to a faeces-urine medium. Hoof horn of the best quality from the middle zone of coronary horn (3?4?cm distal of the coronary band) was submitted to different organic media or to some hoof horn varnishes or to heat. The horn specimens of defined size were treated for 36?days with urine, faeces and urine, urea, faeces or faeces and biotine and their strength was compared with untreated controls. The mentioned excrements were collected from horses. The second group comprised some hoof varnishes or hoof-conditioners (Horsepan, Isohoof Protect, Krealit, Pedalo) and were kept for 24?h in these media. The influence of heat was tested after the horn specimens were heated in an oven for 5?min to 125°C. The results of histologically unchanged horn were compared to horn specimens of the bearing border, where frequently histological changes such as microcracks occur. Two groups of 20 specimens from the bearing border were treated with a mixture of faeces and urine for 5?weeks, and their tensile strength was compared to the same number of untreated controls. The tensile strength of unchanged coronary horn remained nearly unchanged or was only slightly diminished when it was treated with the different media. The treatment with heat did not reduce the tensile strength or showed even a slight increase compared to untreated specimens. The tensile strength of bearing border specimens showed a highly significant decrease of tensile strength of about 55% after 5?weeks treatment with faeces-urine in both trials compared to the untreated controls. The results indicate that unchanged horn is much more resistant to environmental factors than bearing border horn with first damages. For prevention of severe changes at the bearing border horses should not stand for a long time in beddings with a high content of faeces and urine.

AB  - In the enteric nervous system, nitric oxide (NO) is regarded as an important messenger for the non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic neurotransmission. Synthesized mainly by the constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms NOS I and NOS III, this molecule executes pre-junctional inhibitory effects in the submucosal plexus as well as relaxation of the enteric smooth muscles. In order to elucidate the role for NO during enteric development, we looked for the expression of all three NOS-isoforms in the enteric nervous system during mouse development from E8 to E20 using immunohistochemistry. Starting around midgestation, a transient expression of the NOS-II isoform during the very early development of enteric neurones was detected in parallel to that of HNK-1 exclusively in the myenteric plexus. Similar to findings for other neuronal systems, NOS-I and NOS III isoforms could be traced starting significantly later to increase towards the end of embryonic development when NOS II immunoreactivity faded and a strong expression of the vasointestinal peptide (VIP) could be detected. In contrast to the NOSII expression, the constitutive isoforms can also be detected in the submucosal plexus. Altogether, these findings suggest NOS-II to be exclusively involved during early steps of enteric nervous system development. Absence of downstream signalling elements, such as sGC and cGMP both in neurons and in enteric muscle until the end of the second third of gestation, may indicate different effects executed by NO during development, expressed by Ca2+ dependent and independent NOS isoforms.

AB  - Surface ultrastructural observation of the thyroid gland in donkey revealed the coexistence of certain unusual follicles or cysts, the ultimobranchial (UB) follicles, which exhibited large diameters and less regular outlines. In addition, several small follicles, cell nests or solid cellular masses were also demonstrated in association with these structures. Surface of most UB follicular cells was almost hexagonal in shape, studded with sparse or dense pleomorphic microvilli, which were much denser at the cellular borders. Each follicular cell bore single cilium that projecting over the cell surface. Interestingly, bleb-like apocrine protrusion of the apical cytoplasm of some follicular cells was frequently demonstrated. These apocrine blebs (or aposomes) were varied in shape, size and showed smooth or irregular surface. In addition to such aposomes, deep to shallow circumscribed or eroded areas of the apical cell surface was frequently demonstrated. These findings indicate that the UB follicular cells in donkeys, similar to those of camels, exhibit an apocrine activity alongside with the usual merocrine mode of secretion.

AB  - Introduction and Aims:? Primary and secondary cell cultures of canine dermal fibroblasts were used to test the suitability of several senescence-linked cellular markers to characterize the chronological age of dogs. In further studies these markers will be used to test the hypothesis that senescence-linked changes at the cellular level are representative for the observed inverse relationship of body mass and life expectancy in different dog breeds. Methods:? In this study standardized skin samples of Beagles were used to analyse the cell morphology and several senescence-linked parameters as Cumulative Population Doubling Level, Highest Population Doubling Level, Culture Doubling Time and Life Span Completed to determine the replicative potential of fibroblasts. The samples were divided by the age of the donors into three groups (?young?, ?middle? and ?old?). Results:? There are notable differences between the replicative potential of young and old Beagles at the cellular level. Preliminary results show that in fibroblast cultures obtained from the young group the highest population doubling level is higher and the culture doubling time is shorter then in cultures of the old group. Cultures from the young and middle-aged group cannot be distinguished by the measured parameters. For final results the complete statistical analysis of sampled data has to be carried out. Conclusions:? Our results demonstrate a relationship between the chronological age of the skin donor and the replicative potential of the dermal fibroblasts. Therefore cellular senescence-linked markers could serve as suitable tools to compare the age of individual dogs of different breeds.
