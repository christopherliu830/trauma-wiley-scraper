AB  - The third eyelid protects the eye, contribute to the aqueous portion of the pre-ocular film and its distribution over the corneal surface, as well as removal of foreign material from the anterior surface of the eye. It is rather vulnerable during fights and clinicians often have to perform surgery for third eyelid neoplasia. In dogs, this lid has a triangular shape, being widest at its free margin. It is vascularized by branches of the malar artery. Being of such importance as an adnexa of the eye, the authors concentrated their attention on its vascularization, which is not well defined. Methods:? Scanning Electronic Microscopy of vascular corrosion casts and intact tissue. Observations:? It was quite interesting to notice the presence of two patterns of vascularization inside the third eyelid. One can say that there are two segmental levels of vessels. In one of these there is a predominance of arteries and veins, while in the other a meshwork of third order arteries, capillaries and post-capillary venules are present. In fact, the branch of the malar artery that reaches the base of the third eyelid divides into smaller branches that cross almost the complete length of the lid giving only a few collateral vessels, in a monopodical way, and only near the free margin of the lid is possible to observe dicothomical ramifications that became rather anastomotic (being anastomoses of type I and II are present) and contribute to the microvascular meshwork. This microvascular net is drained by post-capillary venules and veins that empty as a brush into bigger veins that occupy the same segmental level as the third eyelid artery. Remarks:? This uncommon angioarchitecture is probably an adaptation to the fact that in the medial canthus of the eye this lid has a smaller space and the way of obtaining an efficient vascularization is by going straight to the top of the lid.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Canine malignant haemangioendothelioma is an aggressive neoplasia that affects mostly older dogs of large breeds with a strong predilection for the spleen, liver, heart and skin. The tumour originates in the vascular endothelium and consists of transformed cells forming large and leaky vessel-like structures. Prognosis is poor because surgery and chemotherapy have limited success in prolonging survival times and increasing quality of patients. A new strategy to treat this malignancy could be anti-angiogenic therapy based on the inhibition of proliferation, migration and three-dimensional organization of transformed cells. In order to reduce animal experiments, in vitro-models are required to test the safety and efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs. So far only few models of angiogenesis are available using mostly human, rodent and bovine cells. Therefore, the aim of our study was to establish an in vitro model of canine haemangioendothelioma. Materials and Methods:? Tumours were collected from dogs during surgery or immediately after euthanasia. Isolation of cells was done from different areas of the tumours and by enzymatic digestion of the tissue. Cells were incubated in culture media with and without endothelial growth factors. Cells were characterized by lectin histochemistry using Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin and Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Moreover, RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was employed to investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its endothelium-specific receptors VEGF-R1 and -R2. Results and Conclusions:? Different populations of cells were isolated and cultured successfully from canine malignant haemangioendothelioma. Cells show characteristics of microvascular endothelial cells of an angiogenic phenotype, i.e. the formation of spheroids and tube-like structures as well as strong labelling for Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Thus, morphological and glycohistochemical results confirm the vascular character of the cells isolated. RT-PCR showed expression of VEGF. However, endothelium-specific VEGF receptors were not expressed. Loss of typical receptors is common in cancer and may correlate with increased tumour dedifferentiation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the pressure distribution under the paws of chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger) using static pedobarography. We included in our study three healthy chinchilla aged 1?3?year, both sexes, weighted 480?570?g. We performed static pedobarography (PEL 38 podometer) in each chinchilla and we took into account standing on four legs or two hind legs. We found that on standing on four legs, two types of contact area with base in chinchilla exist: first type ? the ring shape of contact area with base of forefeet with maximal pressure in forefeet at their central part and elliptic shape of foot contact area with base of hind legs (paws) with longer diameter about twice longer than the shorter one and with maximal pressure in hind legs at their posterior part (greater than pressure under forefoot paws), that a value was 98?g/cm2 In the second type of foot contact area with base a pattern of hind legs was similar to that of forefeet. During standing on two hind legs we distinguished the another type (third) of foot contact area with base that was similar to the first type with the difference made by the fact that animal was standing only on hind paws. In each animal we found also the contact area with base of a tail ? the contact area was similar to that of forefeet but the value of pressure was twice decreased. Concluding, the most frequent manner of contact area with base in chinchilla is 4 points contact with hind paws contact area twice greater than contact area of forefeet. Moreover, the fifth point of support can exist ? a tail, which is mainly important during standing on the hind paws.

AB  - Introduction:? On one hand, the distal phalanx in cattle is suspended by the wall segment of the dermis, on the other hand it is supported in the palmar/plantar region by the bulb with its specialized subcutaneous tissue. Recent results of various studies suggest that changes in tissue composition of the bulb and slackening of the suspension can lead to an unphysiological position of the distal phalanx within the horn capsule. This leads to an altered distribution of pressure and mechanically influences the dermal blood supply. In the worst case these changes may lead to sole ulcer. Aims:? The aim of this study was to develop a method to allow measuring the minimal distance between the surface of the distal phalanx and the inner surface of the horn capsule under various loading. Material and Methods:? The right front and the left hindclaws have been taken from seven healthy beef bulls (German Simmentals, average body weight 580?±?25?kg) from the local abattoir. After functional claw trimming the feet have been scanned in a computed tomograph (veterinary surgical clinics) in unloaded and the loaded state [distribution of body weight: 55% (front legs): 45 % (hind legs)]. Each distal phalanx and claw capsule have been reconstructed in both datasets via threshholding (?marching-cube-algorithm?). The minimal distance between both objects has been measured by the ?nearest-neighbour-algorithm?. Results:? No significant differences could be observed between front and hind claws and lateral and medial claws respectively. In the unloaded state there was a distance of 4?6?mm in the dorsal, abaxial and axial aspect of the distal phalanx, which almost remained constant in the loaded state. On the solear surface values increased from 3?mm at the tip of the coffin bone to 7?8?mm at the flexor tubercle where significant distance changes (approx. 3?mm) could be observed. Discussion:? A tilting movement of the distal phalanx becomes obvious with loading. Thus, especially the region of transition between the soft and the hard bulb experiences heavy compressive stress. This coincides topographically with the incidence of sole ulcers.

AB  - Introduction:? Elbow dysplasia is one of the most important orthopaedic diseases of the canine elbow joint. The medial coronoid process (MCP) and the anconeal process (AP) are involved with a high incidence. Aims:? The aim of this study was to clarify whether these processes are especially loaded resulting in osteoarthrosis. Material and Methods:? Elbow joints were examined from dogs of various breeds, with a body weight over 20?kg and an age ranging from 1 to 12?years. Only joints without damage to the articular cartilage have been included in this investigation. Articular surfaces have been evaluated macroscopically, subchondral bone density (long-term loading) and split-lines (long-term tensile loading) have been determined. Results:? In the humeral fossa olecrani, there was a distinct impression on the inner side of the lateral compared to the medial epicondyle. In the ulna, the MCP was much greater than the lateral coronoid indicating that the medial process has to support the humeral condyle to a higher extent. Subchondral split lines with a transverse orientation in the fossa olecrani gave evidence of long-term transverse tensile loading in this area. Split lines on the MCP were oriented radially as if the lateral edge was bent downwards. Subchondral bone density in the fossa olecrani was higher towards the lateral epicondyle in comparison to the medial. Furthermore, there was a bone density maximum on the medial part of the humeral condyle opposite of the MCP with its very high density. Discussion:? Gait analyses showed that there is a transverse, medially oriented force of up to 4% bodyweight acting on the paw during midstance. As the carpus is stable when slightly hyperextended during midstance loading there is a long lever arm from the ground up to an assumed rotation centre in the depth of the trochlear notch. The medially directed ground reaction force slightly rotates the forearm inwards causing a bending moment about the elbow joint, which leads to an increased pressure of the AP and the MCP. This bending in addition to sagittal loading is the reason for the high susceptibility of the MCP and AP.

AB  - This work was carried out on the parabronchi of ducks during the pre- and post-hatching periods. For this purposes, the samples were taken from the embryo of incubated eggs from the 10th to 28th?day of incubation, at regular interval, and from adult ducks under anaesthesia. The parabronchi first appeared at 14th?day of incubation as out-pouches, from the secondary bronchi, with solid free end invading the surrounding mesenchym. These pouches was lined by high cuboidal cells rested on PAS positive basal lamina, the cells showed free luminal quarter, which indicated an apocrine secretion. At 17th to 22nd?day of incubation, irregularities invading the underlying tissue were observed. This invading part was club-shape forming the future atrium and air capillaries. At 24th to 28th?day of incubation the parabronchi were observed at the center of a polygonal shape lobule (lung lobule), it was lined with squamous cells at the head of the clubs, while atrium was lined with cuboidal cells at both side of the stalk (interatrial septum), and the air capillaries was lined with attenuated squamous cells. Because of the breathing of the duck started before hatching the structure of the parabronchi was similar in post-hatching period to that of late stage of pre-hatching period. The wall of parabronchi was pierced by a number of openings leading to the atrium. The lining epithelium was followed by a layer of smooth muscles, which formed a sphincter around the opening of the atrium regulating the amount of air passed to the atrium and air capillaries to avoid hyperventilation. The E.M. picture revealed that, the epithelium of parabronchi was squamous and displayed a scarce number of microvilli, while that of the atrium was cuboidal with a large number of microvilli, the cells of both contained osmiophilic multilamiller bodies that extruded to the surface. Under the epithelium of parabronchi, there were: smooth muscle cells, macrophages, mast cells, collagen fibers, and fibroblasts, while in the interatrial septum between the epithelium on both side there were collagen fibers and fibroblasts only.

AB  - Most mammals have two different structures in which we found glomerular layers at the same time: the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Both bulbs have the same pattern of organization, but there are some differences: although the size is considerably bigger in MOB than in AOB, probably the most important difference is that the principal cells are not differentiated into mitral and tufted cells in the AOB, and are usually described as mitral/tufted cells. We have previously observed that in some mammals, like pigs and sheep, the AOB reaches maturity before birth, but this is not a rule for other species. Surprisingly, mice need several days of life to achieve full stratification of its cellular components. We have studied the chronology of this process, focusing our attention on the glomerular layer, the last to appear. We concluded that there are two critical periods, between E11.5 and E16.5 (migration phase) and between E17.5 and P3.5?7 (true morphological constitution).

AB  - The cecum is a great cul-de sac intercalated between the small intestine and the colon. It has a remarkable size in the equine and digestion of more than 30% of total cellulose and production of volatile fatty acids by anaerobic metabolism of cellulose by its micro flora were made on it. It has also a substantial number of lymphatic nodules, which in horses are located near the apex. Topographically, cecum is situated chiefly to the right of the median plane and occupies around the whole volume of there in the abdominal cavity. The histological structure of the lymphatic follicles and their distributions pattern throughout the cecum in five healthy mature miniature horses (an special species of horses lives only in north of Iran) were studied (Fig. 1a). Each cecum was divided into three parts, namely, the base, body and apex, and samples were taken from each part immediately after slaughter and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. Routine histological laboratory techniques were made and 6??m ?sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin staining and studied under light microscope. Lymphatic nodules were mostly found in the submucosa, but they disrupted the muscularis mucosa and merged into the lamina propria (Fig. 1c). The thickness of the mucosa and submucosa at these sites was smaller, and the epithelium that covered the mucosa was here modified into simple squamous or low cuboidal epithelia with dark and flattened nuclei (Figs 1b,d). The large and small lymphatic nodules were extensively accumulated in the apex, forming a nearly continuous layer in lamina propria and submucosa. However, they were less prominent at the base and least in the body of the cecum. 1 A [ Abdominal viscera of miniature horse: right view.

AB  - Transversal, horizontal and sagittal sections of the brain were stained by the ancient but efficient Mulligan method, a procedure that establishes a clear macroscopic difference between the white and grey substances. Different structures of each section were studied and most of the details were identified and named according to the NAV. All sections were projected onto the whole brain. By means of this easy and basic procedure the students increase their understanding of (1) the size and/or the form and/or the topography of several prominent structures of the brain, (2) the general distribution of the substancia alba and grisea, and they begin to understand the complexity of the brain.

AB  - One hundred and twenty years ago, Camillo Golgi described reticular or fenestrated sheaths of extracellular matrix (ECM), enwrapping the cell bodies, axon initial segments and proximal dendrites of certain pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system. Such structures, currently termed perineuronal nets (PNs), are preferentially associated with GABAergic, parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking inhibitory types of cells, and mostly expressing the Kv3.1 subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Although some neuroanatomists validated the existence of the PNs on selected neurons in the adult brain, there was a lack of agreement concerning their origin, composition and function. Recent data suggest that PNs result from the visualization of ECM molecules that are confined to the space interposed between glial processes and the nerve cells that they outline. The substance confined to these spaces could be visualized selectively by antibodies directed to glycoproteins, proteoglycans, markers for hyaluronan, some plant lectins recognizing N-acetylgalactosamine or by monoclonal antibodies directed to epitopes on unknown molecules. The PNs appear only after birth, which they could serve as recognition molecules between certain neurons and their surrounding cells. Other putative roles include stabilization of synapses, maintenance of cellular relationships in the adult brain, concentration of growth factors around certain neurons, generation of a polyanionic ion-buffering microenvironment, as well as prevention of extracellular-space occlusion and the formation of certain link with the intracellular cytoskeleton.

AB  - The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) has attracted growing interest due to its highly regulated spatiotemporal expression during development and maturation of central nervous system. The present study deals with the post-natal appearance and transformation into adult distribution patterns of the ECM components related to proteoglycans (PGs) and glycoproteins (GPs) in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of albino rats at birth (P0), 1?week (P1), P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8. The differentiating PGs and GPs components of the ECM were shown to make their appearance as early as 1?2?weeks post-natally. At this developmental stage, these components of the ECM appeared in association with some neurons and glia cells or diffusely localized at the neutrophill. Interestingly, Golgi complexes of labelled neurons were usually stained with lectin VVA or WFA, and this labelling dramatically disappeared on reaching P4. During P2?3, the pericoated neuronal cells underwent a progressive increment in number, and presented an inside-out pattern of migration and differentiation (toward the V-II cortical layers). On reaching P4, most of the coated neurons appeared distributed into the cortical layer IV and II. At a later stage (P5?8), the overall density and intensity of labelled neurons progressively increased and apparently reached the adult stage of development. They also displayed the usual differential labelling characteristics, after using the cationic iron colloid/lectin staining, for the first time at this juncture. The present findings indicated that the perineuronal ECM components are significantly correlated with age and suggest a possible developmental or biological significance including promotion of migration, as well as functional maturation of the retrosplenial neurons.

AB  - Morphology subjects taught by our department are very important parts of the veterinary medical studies. Functional anatomy, concluded with a final exam, provides knowledge of classical anatomy and is taught for three semesters. The lectures are followed by the plenary sessions where the dissection is done under a camcorder, which shows the students the methods used. Topographical anatomy is taught in the fourth semester ? mostly demonstrated on live animals ? the visible, palpable structures and the projections of the inner organs on the surface of the body. Introduction to biology summarizes the study of cell biology and also the general knowledge of developmental anatomy. Histology is also given in the second and third semesters, ending with a final exam. However, for the 25?years I have been teaching the anatomy and the subjects taught by our department, I always had the feeling that the students do not pay enough attention or show much appreciation of these studies after the initial enthusiasm. Anatomical knowledge should also be well known during the later year studies at our university. Until recently our teaching program lacked the repetition of systemic anatomical studies that is mostly for applied science. The very recently introduced elective courses, such as radiological anatomy, surgical anatomy, organogenesis and the anatomy of birds are all scheduled for the late evening hours, but the lecture hall are still always full with students of all grades. The enquirers could find the needed anatomical information in special books and atlases until now. However, practising vets say it takes a lot of time and making uncomfortable difficulties to analyse the books. Because of forgetting the details that are less important for the vet's everyday work it can be hard to find solutions for small but urgent problems. That is why we decided to picturise and make a summary in an edition for demonstrating different elements of certain species of animals. The multimedia CD-ROM was made based on clinical view providing the opportunity for the vet to analysing and studying the part that is the actually subject of his work. After 30?years long break, today there is no graduate or continuing education program without teaching anatomy, which means to give the knowledge to our colleagues applying to their needs also to their everyday work.

AB  - Introduction:? The interactions occurring between nervous and immune systems are well documented. These interactions involve several types of chemical messengers including hormones, cytokines, classic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. It has been observed that the lymphoid organs receive a dense peptidergic innervation and immune cells produce neuropeptides. Neuropeptides, in turn, are involved in the regulation of the inflammatory processes and in the maturation of the lymphoid organs. Several studies have demonstrated that the immunomodulatory neuropeptides and their receptors are expressed in the thymus and bursa of fabricius. PACAP is a glucagon/VIP/secretin family peptide. It was originally isolated from the ovine hypothalamus and then it was found in the autonomic nervous system. PACAP is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary function, neurotransmission and neuromodulation. In the immune system, PACAP is expressed in lymphoid tissues of the rat and in the lymphocytes of the duck GALT. PACAP, therefore, could be a messenger of the dialogue between nervous and immune system. It may have a role in the regulation of the inflammatory processes by stimulating histamine and serotonin and modulating the production of the cytokines in immune cells. Methods:? Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections of thymus and bursa of fabricius of the duck of different ages by using an antibody anti-PACAP38. Results and Discussion:? In the thymus, PACAP-immunoreactivity was found in lymphoid cells and, with a lesser extent, in epithelial reticular cells. The immunoreactive lymphocytes were primarily observed in the interlobular septa in close vicinity to the interlobular veins. The number of positive lymphocytes increased with ageing. In the bursa of fabricius, PACAP-IR was found in nerve fibres and in a few lymphoid cells. These results suggest that PACAP could play a role in the maturation and involution of these organs and in the immune functions.

AB  - Cell culture offers a specifically good understanding of single factors during complex signal transduction pathways, and cell?cell interactions can be examined in small scale. In the bovine synepitheliochorial placenta the peculiarity of ?restricted? trophoblast invasion is found as non-polarized trophoblast giant cells migrating into the uterine epithelium. Specific expression patterns of integrin receptors in trophoblast cells have already been shown in relation to the differentiation of the haemochorial placenta of humans and rodents. For evaluation of integrin function during the precisely controlled trophoblast invasion in cow, it is important to develop a model system, where primary cell cultures from cotyledons are compared to in vivo trophoblast cells. Uteri of pregnant cows were gathered during routine slaughtering. In parallel, placentomes were snap-frozen for the production of cryosections, and other placentomes were manually separated into fetal cotyledon and maternal caruncle. Dissociation of the cotyledonary cells was accomplished with collagenase I, and cells were cultivated in Quantum 286 (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Linz), a special medium for epithelial cells, containing 10% fetal calf serum. A population of mainly epitheloid cells was achieved by controlled trypsin/EDTA treatment, because of different adhesive forces of fibroblasts and epithelial cells to the substrate. Both, confluent growing cells and tissue sections, were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies against cytokeratin, integrin subunits α6, ?1, α and ?, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) components laminin and fibronectin. The epithelial character of the propagated cells was proven by their distinct immunostaining for cytokeratin. In vivo expressed integrin subunits α6 and ?1 were found colocalized along cell-cell borders and towards the flask ground. The corresponding ECM ligand laminin occurred in both, cells and tissue. In tissue sections fibronectin and subunits α and ?3 were not detected in trophoblast cells, however, in vitro these cells displayed a weak immunoreactivity. Summarizing, a method for the cultivation of bovine trophoblast cells was successfully established. The comparison of in vivo and in vitro expressed integrins and ECM showed that the cells in part maintained their in vivo attributes, and therefore are suitable for the study of cell?cell interactions.

AB  - Introduction:? Leg weakness causes high economic losses in commercial poultry. The unspecific term includes, amongst others, diseases of the skeletal system caused by genetic, nutritional or microbiological factors. The analysis of computed tomography images may be a new tool to discriminate and evaluate skeletal abnormalities in turkeys and can therefore provide valuable hints in the treatment of turkey stocks suffering from leg weakness. Material and Methods:? Legs of healthy turkeys and those showing clinical signs of leg weakness were examined using a Tomoscan M/EG/Compact (Philips Medical Systems) CT system. The slice thickness and distance were set to 2?mm. In addition to the evaluation of the obtained images, the software system 3D-Doctor was used to create three-dimensional objects of the investigated samples. Results:? Differences between physiological and abnormal parts of the leg bones are distinguishable in the CT-images and three-dimensional reconstructed objects. Bone density can be calculated and thus provides a base to estimate possible nutritional demands or deficiencies. The three-dimensional reconstruction compensates for the difficulties in understanding the detailed anatomical CT cross-sections by which the examiner is confronted while studying the CT images. Conclusion:? Although computed tomography of poultry is too expensive for routine herd diagnosis, and far less for single-animal diagnosis, it is a valuable tool for investigating skeletal abnormalities and is very useful in examining samples related to leg weakness.

AB  - The study in Wistar rats attempted to improve the occlusion technique of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) as a precise method for initiating stroke. In a first part it was necessary to study the exact anatomy of blood vessels of the brain in seven rats of 170-410 g body weight by corrosion cast. The lengths and diameters of defined locations of the blood vessels were measured. The temporary as well as the permanent methods were refined or replaced. The first one was completed in main training the physiological blood flow after temporary occlusion, while the permanent occlusion was performed by positioning a silicone cap in the MCA. A filament guide was introduced from the common carotid artery (CCA) via internal carotid artery (ICA) to guide the silicon cap at the branch of the MCA. Histological sections of the brain of rats showed 24 h after the permanent occlusion a reproducible infarct in the brain. This area corresponded very well with the supply of the MCA. The new occlusion method with a silicon cap was compared with the occlusion methods of CCA route and external carotid artery (ECA) route. The total infarct volume was significantly larger in the CCA route and ECA route groups than in the silicon cap group (means: CCA route 261?mm3; ECA route 191?mm3 vs. 128?mm3 silicon cap group; P?<?0,05). It could be demonstrated that the new silicon cap occlusion technique imitates the pathological situation of a cerebral infarct in man. Moreover it is less invasive for the animals and more precise and reproducible regarding the infarcted area in comparison to the other occlusion methods. Based on anatomical measurements of the blood vessels the described silicon cap method can be recommended for rats of a body weight between 340?370?g.

AB  - The anatomical and clinical studies of computed tomography (CT) in the dog are still scarce. Particularly, there are few CT studies combining the use of rapid apparatus of the latest generation, the supply of contrast medium (digestive or intravenous) and the application of regional specific CT windows with different window width (WW) and window level (WL). The use of this CT methodology is particularly recommended in the evaluation of mediastinal masses, heart pathologies, etc. In this work the mediastinum of the dog was studied by using a sixth generation spiral CT scanner (Toshiba Ex Vision), belonging to the private Medical Institute of Radiology ?Irion? of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Four mixed-breed mature dogs (4?6?years, 15?20?kg) were used, two males and two females. The dogs were anaesthetized and kept at a maximum inspiration when getting the images. Previously, the urografin? contrast had been injected by peroral and intravenous (cephalic vein) via. Dogs were placed in a stretcher in sternal recumbency. Different CT windows were applied in order to increase the quality of the images and to obtain detailed attenuation shades of the mediastinum organs: soft tissue window (WW 652; WL -34), pulmonary window (WW 928; WL -680) and mediastinal-vascular window (WW 352; WL 220). The mediastinal space was studied craniocaudally from the level of the cranial cava vein, brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery, to the caudal end of the lumbodiaphragmatic recess. The obtained images allowed a very good tomographic evidence of the great vessels, the heart, the thoracic portion of the trachea, the principal bronchi, the thoracic portion of the oesophagus, etc.

AB  - The location, size and histological structure of the ovine paraepiglottic tonsils were determined in 20 sheep. Macroscopic examination of the pharyngeal tonsils was performed in 10 sheep of 9 months of age, of which the heads were fixed in acetic acid 2% for 24?h, and in non-fixed heads of five sheep aged between 6 and 9?months. The paraepiglottic tonsil is located lateral to the epiglottis in the ventromedial segment of the pharyngeal sidewall, i. e. at the floor of the piriform recess. The tonsil appears as a cluster of small nodular elevations, which are white after fixation in acetic acid and are called hereafter tonsillar nodules. The number of these nodules per tonsil ranged from 1 through 8. The length of the tonsil varied from 5 till 14?mm, and the width ranged from 2 till 5?mm. The tonsils of 5 sheep aged between 6 and 9?months and of five sheep aged between 9 and 12?months were excised and fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde. The blocks were processed routinely for histology and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections (8??m thick) were stained with eosin and haematoxylin. Histology revealed that each tonsillar nodule consisted of several lymphoid follicles (noduli lymphatici) surrounded by parafollicular tissue. Most lymphoid follicles were secondary follicles consisting of a germinal centre, a dark zone and a mantle zone. Primary follicles devoid of germinal centres were most obvious at the periphery of the tonsillar nodules. The stratified squamous pharyngeal epithelium covering the lymphoid tissue was frequently infiltrated by numerous lymphocytes, forming a follicle-associated epithelium. Crypts were absent, but in some cases the pharyngeal epithelium was slightly infolded into the lymphoid tissue. The tonsillar nodules were almost completely encapsulated by dense connective tissue from which septa extended into the larger nodules. Acknowledgement:?
