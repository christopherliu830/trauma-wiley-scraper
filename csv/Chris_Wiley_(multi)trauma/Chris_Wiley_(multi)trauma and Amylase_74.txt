AB  - Some male seasonal breeders are known to undergo testicular growth and regression throughout the year. The periodic and fast physiological development and regression processes, with simultaneous fast changes in blood flow, appears to be stimulated by angiogenic substances and inhibited by anti-angiogenic factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of season on microvascularization and production of angiogenic factors by testicular tissue, using the male cat as a model. Monthly, testes were collected post mortem from domestic stray cats, for histology and for tissue culture. Testis explants were cultured for 18h and conditioned media were tested for their ability to stimulate mitogenesis of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was used as a positive control. Proliferative response of BAEC to samples was evaluated by determining the number of cells in each well using a Neubauer chamber. Vascular density was assessed by a computerized image analysis (?Scion Image, NIH, USA?) based on the total histological area occupied by the vascular lumen. Percentage data subjected to arcsine transformation were analysed by one-way ANOVA and post-comparison tests. There was a significant increase in microvascular areas in November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the remaining months (LSD test). All cat testicular tissue showed the capability to increase BAEC proliferation, when compared to negative controls, throughout the study. However, there was an increase in BAEC mitogenesis in February (P?<?0.05) and November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the other months. Our data show that cat testicular tissue from different periods of the year stimulates angiogenic factor(s). Furthermore, changes in angiogenesis may play a role on vascular growth and regression of the testes during the breeding and non-breeding season in the male cat.

AB  - Perineuronal nets (PNs) of condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to characterize the microenvironment of individual neurons and the chemoarchitecture of some brain regions. In the present study, PNs in the hippocampus were visualized with a cationic iron colloid method for sulphated proteoglycan content and a plant lectin from Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA) for N-acetylgalactosamine containing glycoconjugates. The ECM molecules were organized in reticular coats (PNs) around non-pyramidal cells in the Ammons horn (Corneu Ammons, CA) and subicular region, in addition to pyramidal neurons located in CA2 and CA3 regions. CA2 stratum pyramidale exhibited the most intense staining of its PNs and a diffuse intervening neutrophil labelling, while CA3 region showed a graded fashion of staining intensity. The subiculum displayed intensely stained perineuronal coats. Notably, the hippocampal perineuronal nets revealed overlapped staining characteristics with both staining methods. However, cell coats of the subicular neurons showed various degrees of labelling characteristics with both markers. It is suggested that the PNs in the hippocampus are correlated with the fast spiking inhibitory GABAergic neurons and their target pyramidal cells, and this is important to keep the excitatory elements under control and therefore control the information processes within the hippocampus.

AB  - In this study the vascularization of the wing and the two main breast muscles of pigeons was investigated using classical anatomical techniques. Three groups of 9-month-old pigeons cadavers were dissected. Each group contained six animals. The cadavers of the group no. 1 were first fixed using 4% formaldehyde solution and the arteries filled with coloured latex. After coagulation we dissected the pectoral (pectoral and supracoracoid) muscles and the supplying branches of the pectoral trunk. We followed also the subclavian, the axillary, the brachial, the radial and ulnar arteries as they vascularized the wing. The cadavers of group no. 2 were used as fresh cadavers and perfused via the brachial artery in retrograde direction with methyl?methacrylate. After the polymerization, the bodies were placed in concentrated hydrochloric acid so the microvascularization of the great breast muscles and the arteries of the wings could be investigated. The arteries of the group no. 3 were filled with BaSO4 solution after fixed with formalin and radiographed. Using this method we could represent the relation of the arteries to the bones. The breast muscles that move the wing are mainly vascularized by the pectoral trunk, which is the strongest branch of the subclavian artery and divides into the cranial, middle and the caudal pectoral arteries. Also the sternoclavicular artery is giving strong rami to the supracoracoid muscle by the lateral border of the coracoid. The subcutaneous thoracoabdominal vessels that supply the brood patches are branches of the pectoral trunk too. The brachial artery lies between the biceps and triceps brachii muscles on the medial side of the humerus and ramifies at the level proximal of the elbow joint to the stronger ulnar and weaker radial arteries. The radial lies cranially, covered by the pronator muscles and gives two branches, the deep and superficial radial arteries. The ulnar artery also gives off two: the superficial and deep ulnar arteries, which supply the flexor muscles and vascularize the distal part of the wing.

AB  - Members of the fibroblast growth factor family have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and cell differentiation during embryogenesis and invasive haemochorial placentation. The non-invasive epitheliochorial horse placenta is characterized by the occurrence of specialized areolae between the microcotyledons, where secretions of endometrial glands are imbibed by the pseudostratified trophoblast cells throughout gestation. Therefore, we hypothesize that trophoblast cells may be programmed differently depending on their location and function. The influence of FGF family members during placentation in the mare was evaluated in tissues from five mares at days 110, 121, 179, 199, and 309 of gestation. Placental samples were perfusion-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies against FGF1 and FGF2 (which have been shown to influence cells of mesenchymal origin), FGF7 which acts on epithelial cells, and an antibody against FGFR which recognizes various receptor isoforms. FGF1 immunostaining occurred in most cells of the placenta throughout gestation, with the strongest expression in vascular structures. FGF2 protein expression differed in relation to location and stage of gestation. Trophoblast and endometrial epithelial cells in the microcotyledons showed strong nuclear expression, whereas areolar trophoblast, fetal and maternal endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of large allantochorionic blood vessels all showed cytoplasmic localization of FGF2. Near term, on day 309, FGF2 expression ceased in all types of cells. FGF7 immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in the nuclei of endometrial gland cells and the cytoplasm of trophoblast cells, and to a lesser extent in the endometrial epithelium. FGFR immunoreaction occurred almost exclusively in vascular cells, such as the endothelium and smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels, and staining declined towards term. The nuclear localization of FGF2 and FGF7 suggests the presence of high molecular weight isoforms, which have been shown to be involved in specific autocrine transcription processes, like activation of endometrial glands and differentiation of trophoblast cells. In contrast, the cytoplasmic localization of FGFs indicates the presence of low molecular weight isoforms. These would represent the classic FGFR binding isoforms that may be involved in angiogenesis mediated by auto- and paracrine mechanisms.

AB  - The avian lung shows fundamental differences to its mammalian counterpart and is characterized by a larger surface area and a thinner gas-blood barrier. These features provide the morphological basis for the enhanced respiratory efficiency of the avian lung. However, they also predispose this organ to an increased risk of injury by pathogenic microorganisms. In order to investigate the host?pathogen interaction during pulmonary infection and vaccine delivery by aerosol immunization a detailed knowledge of the structure and ontogenesis of the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is required. For this reason the BALT of chickens aged from 1?day to 6?months was studied by immunohistochemistry (ICC), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as by FACS analysis. During the first 2?weeks after hatching no organized lymphatic structures were found. At this time, the defence system was based on the presence of cells of the unspecific innate immune system. In the third week after hatching lymphoid follicles begin to develop at the branching of primary and secondary bronchi. These develop into a highly organized bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) characterized by high endothelial venules and a follicle associated epithelium (FAE) with ?M-cell-like? cells. However, pathogens that have successfully crossed this initial barrier are additionally confronted with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages distributed around the parabronchi. Our results imply that the BALT is the first and most important structure encountering antigen and microbial pathogens, thus playing a central role in the initiation of a specific immune response.

AB  - Today's students belong to an interactive generation and receive information through multiple channels. Curricula in veterinary medicine are changing due to trends such as ?student centred education? and ?competence based learning?. Taking in account these changes, we were encouraged to rethink the way in which we teach and assess the knowledge of veterinary anatomy. The amount of dissection (90?h) and lecture hours (90?h) has not changed, but the way they are used and how the ?knowledge? is assessed has been revised. First, goals were defined: students have to acquire knowledge and insight in the structure, function and relationships of anatomical structures of various species. They have to be able to observe, palpate and expose the structures properly. Additionally, they must attain general skills, e.g. communication. Secondly a new learning environment was developed so students could accomplish these goals. The three main components, constituting this new environment were: the introduction of an assessment and development centre (ADC) as a means of assessing students as well as giving them feedback, the incorporation of e-learning and the raise of student-lecturer interactions during lecture hours. During the ADC the students have to go through three set-ups: they demonstrate structures, they name structures and they ?solve? a problem (e.g. cut tendon). They report their findings both verbally and written. Using checklists the student's practical skills are assessed during the dissections and during the ADC. Students receive feedback at four different times. An E-learning environment was devised, giving the students the possibility to consult photographs of the dissections, to discuss the course on a discussion board and to take self-assessment tests to monitor their progress. During the student-lecturer interactions, photographs, clinical examples, are discussed using various teaching methods, resulting in a more ?active? approach to the learning content. Students are enthusiastic about this way of teaching although they experience it as difficult. Student scores seem not different from previously. In the future the practical checklists and the ADC will be optimized.

AB  - Up to now little is known about the vascularization of the chicken fleshy comb (crista carnosa). In order to evaluate the vascularization of the crista carnosa of the cook (breed White Leghorn), corrosion casts were created by injecting Plastoid into the internal carotid as described by Schummer (1951). Specimens were investigated by stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Generally the dermis is highly vascularized by two capillary networks, which are localized beneath the epithelium and beneath the dermal papillas. The dense subepithelial network is characterized by the presence of sinusoid vessels. In the subcutaneous plexus numerous arteriovenous anastomoses of different types occur. Additionally there are arteriovenous anastomoses between the main vessels reaching the indentations of the comb. Our results show the presence of superficial and dense capillary networks and arteriovenous anastomoses are the anatomical basis for the functions of the chicken comb in mating behaviour and thermoregulation.

AB  - The origin of the vertebrate gonad and the Müllerian duct are still a matter of debate. According to the majority of recent textbooks, the gonad is a product of the proliferating coelothelium and therefore derived from the mesoderm of the lateral plate region. The Müllerian duct grows parallel to the Wolffian duct, but it is not clear to what extent the latter contributes actively to the development of the former. In the last decade, we reinvestigated early gonadogenesis and Müllerian duct development in a number of vertebrate model species using various morphological techniques (TEM, SEM, immunohistochemistry). The conclusion of our studies is that rudimentary or regressing nephrostomial tubules, particularly cells of their nephrostomes, must be regarded as the immediate precursors of the somatic cells of the gonadal crest and the Müllerian infundibular field. According to this concept, both structures are derivatives of the intermediate mesoderm. Nephrostomial tubules are regular components of the primitive pro- and mesonephros. They connect the nephric tubule or the nephric corpuscle to the coelomic cavity and open into the latter by means of a funnel-like mouth, the nephrostome (coelomostome). In the larval sterlet, Acipenser ruthenus, short, segmentally arranged nephrostomial tubules with well-developed nephrostomes are present in the region of the cranial opisthonephros. Cells of the medial nephrostomial lips proliferate, surround the germ cells that have accumulated in this location and form a continuous gonadal crest. Cells of the lateral nephrostomial lips proliferate also, spread out on the coelomic surface, replace the original flat mesothelial cells over the Wolffian duct and the cranial opisthonephros and form the Müllerian infundibular field. At about 28?days, a flat pocket begins to invaginate the infundibular field. This pocket is the primordium of the Müllerian ostium abdominale. The findings in Acipenser can be generalized and transferred to other vertebrates.

AB  - A new method of morphometric measurement has been developed (method presented as a poster at the 2002 EAVA congress). Its main originalities are (1) to use video (each horse is filmed while walking instead of being photographed at standing), (2) to be in 3-D (4 digital cameras are used; they film the horse from its lateral side, and also from the front and rear), (3) not to require skin markers (which makes the recording procedure quicker). This method is presently applied in the context of the breeding program of the Selle Français (SF) horse, through two large sample studies. Before starting the analysis of the corresponding data, a preliminary study was performed in order to settle the analysis methodology and to select the most pertinent morphometric parameters to characterize the ?model? (conformation) of sport horses. Twenty international level SF horses (jumping performance index (ISO) >= 150, group A), and 20 low-level (class D) jumping horses (group B) were compared using the 3-D method. Out of the 400 morphometric parameters calculated for each horse, about 132 revealed significant differences (Student test, P?<?0,05) between the 2 groups; P was < 0.001 for 26 of these parameters. The height of the main anatomical landmarks of the pelvic limb, acting as essential lever arms for propulsion muscles (ex: point of the hock (tuber calcanei), ischial tuber), and the height ? absolute and relative (to the withers height) ? of the croup, the length of the croup and thigh, the length of the fore cannon, the shortness of the forearm, and the relative shortness of the trunk, are all conformational traits that characterize group A compared with group B.

AB  - The lateral line system (LLS) is a sensory organ present in fishes and in the larval stage of aquatic amphibians, which provides the animal with information about its surrounding environment. Mechanoreceptive sensory cells in the LLS of fishes are grouped into neuromasts that are considered the morphological unit of this system. Structurally the neuromast consists of a central cluster of hair cells with a ring of support cells with some lateral mantle cells. The LLS is localized in both the body surface (superficial neuromast or pit organs) and in a system of canals distributed along the head, trunk and tail (deep neuromast) (Cernuda-Cernuda et al., 1996). The study of hair cells in the neuromast of fishes is becoming of a great interest, since they are similar in structure and function to the sensory cells of the inner ear and show some identical immunohistochemical properties (Foster et al., 1993). Recently, we have demonstrated the occurrence and the presence of S100 protein in the neuromast hair cells of some teleostean species (Abbate et al., 2002; Germanà et al., 2004). The zebrafish has become an ideal model for the study of developmental genetics, and the neuromast has been used as a model for the study of vertebrate auditory system (Withfield, 2002), so the need for cell selective markers has increased dramatically. Therefore, in this study we have investigated by tissue and whole-mount immunohistochemistry the presence of S100 protein in both deep and superficial neuromasts in the zebrafish larval, juvenile and adult stages. The results of this work demonstrated that the localization of S100 protein was restricted only to the hair cells of the neuromast at all the examined ages. The mantle cells and supporting cells within the neuromast were unreactive. Nevertheless, heterogeneity has been detected in the S100 protein expression by hair cells, independent of their localization within the neuromast. Our data suggest that the S100 protein is a specific marker for sensory cells in the neuromast of zebrafish at post-embryonic different stages of development, and it could be important for the analysis of development, regeneration and turnover of hair cells.

AB  - This combined light and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analyses are the first investigation of the fine morphology of the fetal membranes of the placenta in the Asian elephant. We used two term placentas with gestation periods of 634?days (Zoological Garden Leipzig) and 657?days (Zoo Hagenbeck) and selected unequal sites as specimens, particularly - free membrane of the allantois, - lateral edge of the placenta band, the ?haemophagous zone?, - allantochorion near the placental band, and allantochorion on the end of the chorioallantoic sac. Microscopically the free membrane of the allantois shows a simple, cuboidal epithelium with apical domains of microplicae and microvilli (fig. 1, inset). In the SEM analyses we documented a cobblestone-like architecture of the epithelial cells with various cell sizes, small, middle and giant (fig. 1.). Furthermore, we found pear-shaped cells with long pedicle, attached to the basement membrane and cell openings, presumably due to cell desquamation (fig. 2.). The haemophagous zone was characterized with a lamellate system between the long finger-like chorionic villi and the maternal blood lacunae. The simple, squamous and columnar trophoblast cells are here bathed in the maternal blood. In some chorionic villi brown-yellow material is deposited in the fetal connective tissue. A special result was the presence of strip-like microplicae in the middle of chorionic villi. The allantochorion near the placental band sometimes indicated simple and ramified chorionic villi with smooth, gyrus-like trophoblast cells and foamy cytoplasm. The attached allantois possesses a simple, columnar epithelium with microvilli. Furthermore, we observed villi-like projections rising up to the allantoic cavity. The white ?pustules? on the outer surface of the end of the chorioallantoic sac consist of stratified squamous epithelia. Numerous mitoses were documentedin the basal domain of the pustules. A surprisingly result was the presence of intra-epithelial capillaries. They invade the trophoblast cells to presume a nutrient exchange also outside of the placental band with its important functional metabolism. This study revealed unknown and interesting features of the epithelial layer of different locations in the placenta of the Asian elephant. Perhaps, with a detailed knowledge of the morphology of the epithelium we could convey a better understanding of functional cohesions of elephant placentation. 1 [ The free membranes of the allantois of the term placenta of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) shows a cobblestone-like architecture of the simple cuboidal epithelial cells with various sizes. The surface morphology was determined through microplicae and microvilli. ] 2 [ Numerous pear-shaped cells with long pedicle exist among the cuboidal epithelial cells, attached on the basement membrane. The cells possessed modifications of their surface, particularly microplicae. Some pear-shaped cells shows only the pedicle, perhaps that is a loss through preparation or its presumable due to cell desquamation. One erythrocyte is localized between these cells. ]

AB  - In the canine, success rates of assisted reproduction techniques are very low. Since cumulus cells are known to play an essential role during the in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of cumulus cell numbers in the course of the canine estrous cycle. Eighty-two cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were obtained from 16 bitches undergoing elective ovariectomy during proestrus, estrus, metestrus and anestrus. First, mean cumulus cell numbers during the different stages of the cycle were compared. Then the incidence of programmed cell death (apoptosis) was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP labelling (TUNEL). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the presence of apoptotic cumulus cells. Additionally, mitosis was detected by using antibodies directed against the nuclear cell proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67. The mean number of cumulus cells in the COCs increased from proestrus to estrus (168.2?±?9.2 to 265.5?±?32.7, P?<?0.01) and decreased from estrus to metestrus (265.5?±?32.7 to 139.1?±?10.7, P?<?0.01) till anestrus (150.0?±?8.3, P?<?0.01). The percentage of apoptotic cumulus cells was generally very low during proestrus and oestrus (3.3% and 12.6%, P?<?0.01) and distinctly increased during metestrus (83.1 %, P?<?0.001). The predominance of apoptosis in the cumulus cells during metestrus was confirmed by SEM, which showed a high number of cells revealing cell shrinkage, loss of membrane integrity and cell disruption. Mitosis was highest during proestrus (2.7%) and oestrus (2.6 %) and decreased in the course of metestrus (1.8%) and anestrus (0.2%, P?<?0.05). Our results imply that the distinct increase of cumulus cell numbers during proestrus and oestrus is due to increased mitosis and reduced apoptosis. The distinct reduction of cumulus cells during metestrus is predominantly regulated by apoptosis.

AB  - The expression of calbindin D-28k (CB), calretinin (CR), substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the stomach myenteric plexus of the Korean native goat stomach was investigated by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated the presence of nerve fibers and cell bodies immunoreactive (IR) to CB, CR, SP and CGRP. In tissues of rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum, some distinct neuronal populations could be distinguished according to their morphologic and neuronal chemical properties: Dogiel type I cells which have irregular lamellar dendrites and a single axon, Dogiel type II cells which have large ovoid cell bodies and several long axon-like processes, and small filamentous interneurons. CB-, CR-, SP- and CGRP-IR neurons and fibers were observed in the myenteric plexus of stomach, and varicose nerve fiber immunostained to SP and CGRP also were found in the muscle layer. In myenteric plexus of the stomach, CB- and SP-positive neurons were characterized by Dogiel type II and CR-IR neurons were classified Dogiel type I with lamellar dendrites, and immunoreactivity of CGRP was very weak in the somata. SP- and CGRP-IR nerve fibers formed dense networks within the myenteric ganglia. SP-IR cell bodies and their fibers were found in the myenteric plexus, and the immunoreactivity and number of cell bodies were more than CB-, CR-, and CGRP-IR neurons. These results suggest that SP, CGRP, CB and CR in the myenteric neurons of Korean native goat stomach may have play an important role in the dynamic movement.

AB  - Introduction and aims:? Claw diseases in dairy cows not only lead to high economic losses, but also cause pain and reduce animal welfare. Former studies pointed out that flooring properties influence the microstructure of hoof horn. In this study, we looked for correlations between different flooring systems and horn quality. We obtained horn samples from an experimental farm in Alnarp/Sweden from cows that were first kept on slatted floor and subsequently on mastic asphalt respectively on rubber mats. Methods:? Untreated horn samples were glued onto wooden blocks: 7??m sections were prepared with a Polycut-S (Leica) microtome and afterwards stained with the PAS reaction. For morphometrical analysis we used a Zeiss Axioskope, a digital camera (Progress 3012) and the Lucia 32 G software (Nikon). These data were exported into EXCEL (Microsoft) and statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS (SPSS Inc. [[Au: please provide manufacturer details for ?SPSS?: city, state code (if USA) and country]]). We measured area, minimal and maximal diameter of medulla and cortex of the horn tubules. Statistical evaluation included number of tubules and tubular area per visual field, total area of medulla and cortex and the limiting diameters. Results:? We found significant alterations of the hoof horn after moving the cows from hard to soft floor. The diameter of the horn tubules decreased significantly. The area of medulla and the ratio of medulla to cortex decreased as well. Conclusions:? Our findings indicate a higher quality of claw horn and an increased resistance against mechanical, chemical and microbial environmental influences in animals kept on soft floors. The functional implications of these observations are discussed with regard to claw health as well as the arising consequences for dairy housing systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish an in vitro model that permits in vitro infection of bovine skin with Treponema spp. and enables to study the role of treponemes in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis (DD). In all experiments, incubation with T. denticola or T. brennaborense was carried out simultaneously. Keratinocytes obtained from the claw were cultivated on cover glasses without antibiotics until they reached sub-confluence. Then they were incubated with OMIZ Pat medium containing treponemes for up to 96?h. Every 24?h two cover glasses were fixed and stained with the DAPI method. Skin explants were obtained from typical sites of DD lesions. First the explants were maintained in medium with antibiotics to eliminate bacterial contamination. Subsequently, they were rinsed thoroughly with medium without antibiotics and incubated with Treponema suspensions for 48?h. The treponemes stayed vital under culture conditions for even up to 96?h. They were still showing their typical spiral shaped morphology and adhered to the cultured keratinocytes at all time points. With prolonged incubation time cultured cells began to show morphologic damage and some cells detached from the cover glasses. Light and electron microscopical investigations of the explants revealed that treponemes were adhering to the surface of the epidermis. They were visible in often-enlarged intercellular spaces. In addition treponemes could be detected in deep epidermal layers and in very high concentrations in the dermis. In periodontal disease, spirochetes were observed in enlarged intercellular spaces. Our results support these findings suggesting that treponemes invade the deeper claw tissue via the intercellular spaces of the epidermis. We suggest that the enlargement of the intercellular spaces can improve an increased infection of deeper tissue layers and facilitates the way for infection with other anaerobic bacteria.

AB  - Fish leukocyte heterogenity with respect to morphology, morphometry and immunological function has been object of some controversy, mostly because, in lower vertebrates, there are several interspecies differences. Leukocyte enzyme cytochemistry permits cellular differentiation, which is otherwise not possible with routine stains, and may also indicate cell function. In fish, phagocytic performance is principally operated by monocyte-macrophages (M?) present in tissues and in circulating blood. Fish thrombocytes (FTHR), even if they are the equivalent of platelets in mammals, are complete cells with cytoplasm and nucleus. They vary in shape from round, like small lymphocytes, to spindle-shaped or rod-shaped cells. Several cytochemical methods, as periodic acid Schiff (PAS), naphthol chloroacetate esterase (ASD), α-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), peroxidase (PEROX), acid phosphatase (Ac. Phos.) with and without tartaric acid (ta) and alkaline phosphatase (Alk. Phos.) have been applied in Salmo gairdneri Richardson to investigate the expression of M? and FTHR enzyme patterns. Here, we compared cytochemistry between fish M? and FTHR, and between human M? and platelets/megakaryocytes, respectively, as indicated in the table. It appears that positivity to some enzyme cytochemistry is phylogenetically maintained in M?, while in FTHR the enzyme pattern has undergone modification during evolution. For instance, this is the case of ANAE, Ac. Phos. and Alk. Phos., which changed in the phylogenesis, while PAS, AS-D, PEROX are still present in the evolution.

AB  - Disturbed calcium homeostasis during the peripartal period is a major problem in domesticated ruminants. Clinical signs of hypocalcaemia shortly after calving (periparturient paresis) occur in cattle, predominately in elder animals. On the contrary, in sheep and goat, periparturient paresis is mainly evident several weeks before and only in some cases after parturition. In high-yielding dairy goats, however, periparturient paresis also occurs ? as in the dairy cow ? during the peripartal period (Ruffin et al., 2002). Vitamin D3 receptors (VDR) participate in the regulation of calcium homeostasis by increasing the efflux of calcium from bone and dietary sources into blood. The nutritional availability of calcium during the peripartal period has been examined in cattle: VDR concentrations in colon decrease with age, being significantly higher during pregnancy and lactation and are temporarily lower at parturition (Goff et al., 1991). However, similar data have not been evaluated for sheep and goat. Thus, tissue specimens of small and large intestines were collected from lambs and non-lactating, non-pregnant adult animals of both species. Formaldehyde fixed and microwave treated paraffin sections were used for VDR immunohistochemistry employing a biotinylated monoclonal rat antibody and streptavidin peroxidase technique. Preliminary results in adult sheep showed that VDR immunoreactivities generally were higher in deep parts of crypts, decreased towards openings and were low in surface epithelium. Staining was most prominent in duodenal mucosa, lower in jejunum and further decreased in ileum and colon. It was lowest in caecum. Smaller numbers of immunopositive cells and reduced staining intensities resulted in weaker immunoreactions in the latter segments of small and large intestines. In addition to nuclear tinction, cytoplasmic staining was mainly evident in duodenum, at lower levels in jejunum and negligible in ileum, colon and caecum. Immunohistochemistry of goat and lamb intestines are currently performed, thus the effects of age and species are presently unknown. Our preliminary results indicate that VDRs are highly expressed at the site of presumed maximal intestinal calcium resorption. References?

AB  - The oral cavity in vertebrates plays a very important role in food intake mechanics and also contains chemical sensors for food and environmental water. Comparative studies revealed morphological and functional inter-specific differences that can be correlated to evolutionary events and might represent the adaptation to environmental conditions present in different habitats (Iwasaki, 2002). Particularly these events are strictly dependent on the food intake mechanisms determining the success of the adaptation of vertebrates to their environment and therefore their survival (Roth and Wake, 1989). Since data about the morphology of the zebrafish oral cavity are scarce the aim of the present research was to study it by light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for some growth factor receptors, i.e. trkA and trkB. The zebrafish was chosen because as a vertebrate it has valuable features as a model for study of vertebrate development (Withfield, 2002). Adult zebrafishes were anesthesized with MS222 and the samples were taken and routinely processed for light and electron microscopy and for indirect peroxidase immunohistochemistry. The topographical and ultrastructural study demonstrated the presence of three different zones. The outer zone is characterized orally by the presence of a papilla and by an epithelium with numerous taste buds that are chemosensory endorgans consisting of modified epithelial cells. Their function is to sample potential food and selecting it according to its edibility (Hansen et al., 2002). Both in upper and lower intermediate zones, the presence of internal valves with a semi-lunar shape was evident, probably able to regulate the mouth closure. The most internal lower zone corresponds to the tongue that in zebrafish is only a thickening of the pavement mucosa with a stratified epithelium. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated both in upper and lower zones the presence of numerous taste buds that were immunoreactive to TrkA and TrkB-like neurotrophin receptors, confirming the role of these receptors in taste buds sensory cells (Germanà et al., 2004). The present results give a contribution to the morphological knowledge of the zebrafish oral cavity, an animal model commonly used for developmental studies of vertebrates.

AB  - Bone marrow derived stromal cells are of mesenchymal origin and precursor cells for skeletal tissue components such as chondroblasts and osteoblasts. Furthermore, under experimental conditions, a differentiation potency into myogenic and neuronal cells could be demonstrated. Because of their multipotency these cells represent a population of non-haematogen stem cells that can be regarded as an alternative to human embryonic stem cells for future autologous cell replacement therapies. For a closer look at the differentiation capacity of these cells, rat and human bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from the femur bone and kept in the cell culture applying different cultivation protocols. In a cultivation medium with a serum content of 20%, the majority of these cells express a variety of neuronal markers such as ß-III Tubulin and NeuN as well as the astrocyte marker GFAP, while a minority of about 20% express the marker for neural precursor cells nestin. Cultivation in a chemically defined serum free medium results in the differentiation of a markedly higher percentage of nestin positive neural precursor-like cells. Using bFGF in combination with B27 these cells can be forced to form three dimensionally organized spheres. In order to elucidate a possible therapeutical potency of the bone marrow derived cells the synthesis of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and NGF were analysed using the ELISA technique. Furthermore, they can be infected using a third generation adenoviral vector with high efficiency and show migratory activity in vitro. After injection of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells into the lateral ventricle of adult rats they adhere to the ependymocytes and pass the ependymal barrier in order to settle in the subventricular space.
