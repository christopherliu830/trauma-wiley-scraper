AB  - Efficient and well-regulated intercellular communication is essential to organize the activities of the different cell populations involved during growth and concomitant structural maturation of the skeleton. For direct cell-cell communication gap junctions composed of connexins (Cx) are present. So far 21 Cx types have been identified in mammals, which differ in molecular permeability as well as tissue expression pattern. To characterize the Cx distribution in the developing canine skeleton, samples from humerus, scapula and lumbar vertebrae of Beagle dogs aged 1.5, 3, 4.5?months and 1.5?years were fixed in Bouin's solution, decalcified with 25% EDTA and embedded in paraffin wax. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, the expression of Cx 26, 30, 31, 32, 43, and 45 was studied in bone tissue plus associated epiphyseal and growth plate cartilage. Of all bone cells, osteoblasts showed the largest Cx expression repertoire: they were positive for Cx 26, 30, 32 and 43. After transformation into bone lining cells Cx43 expression was lost while in osteocytes only Cx 26 and 32 was detected. A wide variety of Cx reactions was also found in osteoclasts: Cx 26, 30, 32, and 43. In contrast, chondrocytes showed a much more restricted Cx expression pattern. Positive reactions were only seen in hypertrophic chondrocytes of epiphyseal cartilage (Cx 26, 31, 32) and in the proliferative (Cx32) and hypertrophic zone (Cx 26 and 32) of growth plate cartilage. Additionally, Cx31 was strongly expressed in the cellular layer of the periosteum covering areas of intensive bone modelling in the puppies. Age- and microlocation-dependent variations in expression and/or staining intensity were also observed in the other Cx types. These results demonstrated that canine bone cells are capable of synthesizing a wide variety of Cx types during skeletal development, thus propagating different cellular signals via gap junctions in a differentially regulated and requirement orientated manner.

AB  - The morphology, neurochemistry and function of intramural nerve structures in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract are relatively well known, but in normal, healthy individuals. The present study was aimed at investigating the chemical coding of nerve structures in the wall of the ileum and large intestine in normal pigs (n?=?3) and in pigs undergoing dysentery (n?=?6). Dysentery was evoked by artificial infection of the clinically healthy animals per os with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. All the animals were deeply anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cryostat sections of the intestines were processed for double-labelling immunohistochemistry using antisera against PGP 9.5, GAL and VIP. In the intramural plexuses of the control pigs, the percentage of GAL-immunoreactive (GAL-IR) perykarya varied from 11% (descending colon) to 19% (centrifugal turns of the ascending colon) whereas in the dysenteric pigs, it was distinctly higher, reaching from 28% (ileum) up to 48% (cecum). In the control animals, the percentage of VIP-IR neuronal somata varied from 3% (descending colon) to 19% (ileum). In dysenteric pigs, it was from 6% (descending colon) up to 28% (cecum). In the muscular coat (MC) and mucous membrane (MM) of the normal intestine, very numerous GAL- and VIP-IR nerve fibres were observed. The nerve fibres in the myenteric plexus (MP) were even more numerous than those in the muscular coat while in the outer (OSP) and inner (ISP) submucous plexuses, they were less abundant. In the dysenteric pigs, the nerve fibres found in MC, MP and OSP were less numerous, whereas those observed in ISP and MM were more abundant than those in the control animals. The present results suggest that GAL and VIP are involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes developing in the porcine gastrointestinal tract during dysentery.

AB  - Brain injury remains a significant and potentially devastating outcome of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) under circulatory arrest. These outcomes caused by a microvasculature embolization are associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays and increased use of intermediate or long term care facilities. The administration of heparin in heart surgery during deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass is the basic prophylactic strategy for reducing or even preventing, microvasculature embolization. Unfortunately, an incidence of neuropsychological impairments (NPI) is found in as many as 25 % of the survivors. As it is suspected that these impairments are correlated with morphological alterations, in our study we use the GP IIb-IIIa receptor blocker Eptifibatide for the inhibition of platelet aggregation, in order to look for a reduction of tissue damage compared to the standard treatment. Two groups of 11 piglets (mean body weight of 15±5 kg) underwent 10-minute normothermic bypass, 40-minute cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass, 60-minutes deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) at 15°C, and 40-minute rewarming to 37°C. Group 1 was treated only with unfractionated heparin (UFH), whereas Group 2 was medicated with Eptifibatide, in addition to the UFH-treatment group 1. After rewarming, all animals underwent bilateral carotid perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Histological investigations of semi thin sections reveal a marked decrease of hippocampal alterations by using the GP IIb-IIIa receptor blocker in addition to standard UFH treatment. We detect a reduction of degenerative areas in perivascular (vessels with 10?30 ?m in diameter) tissue. These semi-quantitative data are confirmed by ultrastructural findings.

AB  - The morphological pre-requisites to sustain pressure loads and tractive forces during mastication are examined histologically in the periodontal ligament (PDL) of cheek teeth from 17 horses. The upper and lower jaws were dissected and perfused via the infraorbital and the inferior alveolar arteries with Bouin's solution or, alternatively, with Karnovsky's solution. After perfusion, the jaws were subdivided with a steel band saw and subsequently with a diamond saw to obtain PDL specimens from the first molar tooth. After decalcification, specimens were processed for (1) collagen labelling with fluorescein, (2) oxytalan-fibre staining, (3) immunostaining of vascular smooth muscle actin, and (4) TEM examinations. The periodontal ligament (PDL) of equine cheek teeth is composed of two distinct functional units: (1) a collagen-oxytalan-fibre apparatus, (2) a specific vascular system. These elements are associated with each other in characteristic ways: (1) extremely wide, ?ballooned?, venules are accompanied by collagen fibres that run parallel to the cemental surface. Plenty of oxytalan fibres are packed between the venous walls and the dental cementum. This is a typical feature for regions of the PDL that are supposed to receive compression (related data concerning entheses, osteoclasts, osteoblasts have been presented by Staszyk and Gasse, 2003, 2004*). (2) Regions that are defined to sustain tractive loads ? instead of pressure ? are distinguished by the so-called ?anchored? venules. The vessels are ?embraced? bilaterally by thick bundles of dense collagen fibres, which are orientated in an alveolo dental direction. The fibre bundles are directly linked to the venous walls by means of a complex of oxytalan fibres, veil cells, and smooth muscle cells. These different fibrovascular arrangements (a,b) represent morphological adaptations that may be suitable to withstand either compression or traction. The first (a) provides the pre-requisites for a ?hemodynamic cushion? to receive pressure forces; the latter (b) is suggested to receive tractive forces by means of an elaborate ?lateral compression? mechanism that shall be presented in detail.

AB  - Introduction:? The mammalian digital end organ has developed in three basic functional forms, i.e., claw, hoof and nail. Whereas detailed information on the ontogeny and phylogeny of the equine and bovine hooves, and the human nail, respectively, are on hand, such data are still not available for the canine claw. Because phylogenetically the carnivore claw is considered as a primary form of digital end organ, data on the organogenesis of the canine claw will complement current knowledge on onto- and phylogeny of the carnivore claw, and digital end organs in general. Materials and Methods:? Light and electron microscopy of 18 canine fetuses of 40?150?mm crown-rump-length and five puppies aged 1?day?4?weeks post-partum. Results:? The development of the canine claw can be divided into four periods. The first stage is initiated by the differentiation of the connective tissue layers of the claw anlage. The second stage is characterized by formation of the specific claw shape, and the third stage by further regional function-related modifications resulting in the development of the five different segments of the digital end organ. The fourth stage proceeds post-natally when the influence of increasing body weight and weight bearing leads to the final functional adaptation of the papillary body. Conclusion:? The organogenesis of the canine claw resembles that of the feline claw in many aspects, but also shows some specific deviations. In particular, the development of the dorsal ridge ? characteristic for the carnivore claw ? differs between both species. The results of our study therefore raise the question whether the current hypothesis on allocation of the different segments of the canine claw has to be reconsidered.

AB  - Introduction:? Histamine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are well known biogenic amines (substances), which rapidly elute from the mast cell granules under physiological conditions. They play an important role in the smooth muscle cells motility. Aim:? The aim of the study was to investigate histamine- and VIP-positive mast cells in the wall of pig kidney blood vessels in concern to their role of motility of smooth muscle cells and renal haemodynamics, respectively. Material and Methods:? Extra- and intraorgan renal blood vessels taken immediately after slaughtering of eight 6?8?months pigs were studied. Tissue samples were immersion fixed in 0.05?Mcacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5?days at 4°C. After fixation, tissue blocks were rinsed in 30% sucrose in distilled water at 4°C for 1?3?days. Cryostat sections (20?30 ?m thick) were prepared and thawed in 0.05?M cacodylate buffer, pH 2, overnight. Immunocytochemical procedure started for free-floating sections which were incubated in 1.2% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30?min, and rinsed in 0.1?M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 15?min. Afterwards, sections were incubated with the primary antibodies in a dilution of 1:100 (histamine) and in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) 1:1000 for 24?h at room temperature (RT), then rinsed in 0.1?M PBS, pH 7.4. Incubation succeeded: first, with biotinylated anti-rabbit (histamine) and anti-mouse VIP antibodies in a dilution of 1:20 for 4?h, and rinses in 0.1?M PBS, pH 7.4, and in 0.05?M tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 10?min. Peroxidase activity was localized by using a mixture of 3?mg 3,3? diaminobenzidine (DAB), in 15?ml 0.005?M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 36?ml 1 % hydrogen peroxide for 10?20?min. Finally, a rinse in 0.01?M PBS, pH 7.4, was undertaken. Immunochemicals:? The antibodies used were rabbit anti-histamine (H7403) and rabbit anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), or (PEPA41) (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA). Results and Discussion:? It was established that VIP-positive mast cells were located in the media and in the adventitia of large arterial vessels and renal vein, as well. Histamine positive mast cells were found mostly in the intima of renal artery and in the other layers of the wall. Both VIP and histamine mast cells were observed next to small arteries and veins in the fat tissue, around extraorgan blood vessels. Our finding suggest to mast cells participation in the smooth muscle cells motility and the maintenance of local homeostasis, as well.

AB  - The corpus fibulae (CF) in sheep is represented by a cartilaginous anlage during early embryogenesis, which may calcify and ossify with ongoing gestation and finally towards term is supposed to be replaced by a connective tissue cord called ligamentum fibulare (LF). A recent study in goat (Boos A and T Bartels, 2002), however, revealed that 58 % of the animals examined exhibited a pin-shaped bone within the LF. This indicates that a complete transformation of the anlage of the CF to a connective tissue cord is not performed in all goats raising the question of existing parallels in sheep. Forty-two fetuses and lower legs of 18 lambs and 100 sheep being elder than 2?years were collected at the slaughterhouse. Radiographs and macerated or enzymatically cleared and stained lower legs were assessed for the expression of a CF. In 28 of 42 fetuses (66%), 11 of 18 lambs (61%) and 48 of 100 adult sheep (48%) at least one cartilaginous ? only fetal period ? or osseous CF could be detected. Differences between groups were significant (Chi-square test, P?<?0.05). In 2, 3 and 15 animals, respectively, only a unilateral expression was evident. In early fetuses, the fibula either consisted of a long anlage having the length of the tibia or of a long proximal and a short distal part paralleling the tibia. In somewhat larger fetuses the CF was composed only of the proximal part or even completely lacked (crown rump length 7.5?±?1.5 vs. 11.2?±?2.4 and 12.2?±?2.0?cm, respectively). Pre-term fetuses, lambs and adult sheep were devoid of a CF (n?=?5/7, 7/11 and 52/100, respectively) or exhibited a pin-shaped bone of varying length within the LF. This osseous CF was either in close contact to the caput fibulae (n?=?6 animals) ? always separated by connective tissue ? or located more distally. In the latter cases the centre of the osseous pin was usually situated at a level between the proximal and intermediate thirds of the tibia. Results suggest that the corpus fibulae in sheep may persist in many individuals (50%) as a pin-shaped bone throughout life. Reference? Boos, A., and T. Bartels, 2002: Ann. Anat. 184, 289?293

AB  - Introduction:? The blood circulation in the claw plays an important role in the pathogenesis of claw diseases. The blood vessel diameter is regulated by innervation with different nerve fibre qualities. In case of inflammation or unphysiologically high mechanical load, the delicate balance of vasodilative and vasoconstrictive neurotransmitters seems to be disturbed and may aggravate the alterations. Knowledge about the innervation pattern of the dermal blood vessels could therefore help to understand some aspects in the pathogenesis of claw diseases. Material and Methods:? The lateral claws of the hind limb of cows from a local abattoir were examined. Tissue samples were taken from different segments of the claw, fixed and processed for immunohistochemistry. Antibodies against protein gene product 9.5, tyrosine-hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide were applied and colocalization studies were carried out. Results were evaluated with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Results:? Dermal blood vessels in the claw are surrounded by nerve fibres containing different neurotransmitters. Occurrence and density differ depending on the respective segment. In the bulbar segment, more vasodilative fibres are demonstrable while in the solear segment vasoconstrictive nerve fibres prevail. The highest innervation was found in all segments around specialized sphincteric arteries in the dermis just beneath the dermal surface modification. Conclusion:? The innervation pattern in the claw depends on segment-specific functional demands. The fine-tuning of the blood flow in the dermal vascular system is mediated by a combination of different nerve fibres that emit vasoactive substances. Acknowledgement:?

AB  - The endocannabinoid anandamide may regulate intestinal motility through activation of CB1 receptors. Anandamide is then inactivated by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a membrane bound enzyme. Under pathological conditions, inactivation of such enzymatic activity may lead to inhibition of the intestinal motility. Here, preliminary reports on the distribution of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) immunoreactivity in the mouse gastrointestinal neurons, and the pharmacological effects of N-arachidonoylserotonin (AA-5HT), a selective inhibitor of FAAH, are reported. FAAH was revealed by an indirect immunofluorescence. Laminar preparations containing the myenteric or the submucous plexus adhered, were peeled off after the whole gut wall had been stretched out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. They were subsequently incubated with a polyclonal anti-serum directed against a region near the N-terminus of the human FAAH and revealed by a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary anti-serum. FAAH-immunoreactive neurons were observed within the myenteric ganglia throughout the GIT. The positive nerve cells varied in size and density of immunoreactivity. Stomach and large intestine showed the highest neuronal density. AA-5HT significantly reduced both gastric emptying and gastrointestinal tract transit. Such inhibitory effect was reduced by the C1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. Both morphological and pharmacological results suggest that FAAH may play a critical role in controlling gut anandamide levels.

AB  - The lumbar spinal cord segment of the camel embryo at CVRL 2.4 to 28 cm was examined. Major changes are occurring in the organization of the lumbar spinal cord segments during this early developmental period. At the CVRL 2.4, 2.7 and 3.6?cm the three primary layers, ependymal cells layer, mantle cells layer, marginal cells layer in the developing lumber spinal cord segment were demonstrated. The mantle layer is the first to show striking differentiation, while the marginal layer is represented by thin outer rim. Proliferation and differentiation of the neuroepithelial cells in the developing spinal cord produce the thick lateral walls, thin roof and floor plates. The spinal ganglion and dorsal root of the spinal nerve are differentiated. At 2.7?cm CVRL differential thickening of the lateral walls produces a shallow longitudinal groove called sulcus limitans, which separates the dorsal part (alar plate) from ventral part (basal plate). The ventral root of the spinal nerve, the spinal cord and ganglion are embedded in loose mesenchyme, which tends to differentiate into spinal meninges. At 3.6?cm CVRL the basal plate, which is the future ventral gray horn, seem to be quite voluminous and the dorsal and ventral roots unite to form the beginning of the spinal nerve. At 5.5?cm CVRL the alar plates enlarge forming the dorsal septum. At 8.4?cm to 10.5?cm CVRL the basal plates enlarge, and bulge ventrally on each side of the midline producing the future ventral medium fissure, and the white and gray matters can be recognized. At 28?cm CVRL the lumen of the spinal cord is differentiated into the central canal bounded dorsally and ventrally by dorsal and ventral gray commissures, and therefore the gray matter takes the appearance of a butterfly.The lumber spinal nerve and their roots are well distinguished.

AB  - Gap junctional inter-cellular communication (GJIC) is known to be important in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Evidence is accumulating that GJIC plays an important role in the gastric mucosal defence system and that the loss of GJIC is associated with gastric ulcer formation. The prevalence of gastric ulceration in foals and horses is high. However, there are no studies about the presence of gap junctions in gastric mucosa of horses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution pattern of the gap junction protein 32 in normal gastric mucosa of horses. Immunocytochemical observations were made with light microscopy on cryosections of fresh frozen gastric mucosa from the fundic region, pyloric region, margo plicatus and pars nonglandularis. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by standard immunoperoxidase techniques using an anti-connexin 32 polyclonal antibody. In Situ Hybridization, Western Blot Analysis and RT-PCR were performed to confirm the presence of connexin 32. In normal horse gastric mucosa, connexin 32 was abundant in the surface epithelium and in a decreasing staining gradient extending down to the neck of the glands. Gastric surface mucous cells are formed in the neck of the glands and migrate along the foveola toward the mucosal surface. So, immature forms of surface mucous cells are found in the generative zone and in the deep part of the foveola, whereas well-matured ones cover the upper part of the foveola and the luminal surface of the mucosa. Therefore, these findings are in line with other studies, which described larger and more numerous gap junctions in mature surface mucous cells than in immature cells. These results show that gap junctions develop during the maturation of surface mucous cells and suggest that GJIC between gastric surface mucous cells plays an important role in the regulation of cell differentiation and in tissue homeostasis. Further studies are required to investigate the distribution pattern of connexin 32 in the gastric mucosa of horses with gastric ulcer.

AB  - Gap junction mediated inter-cellular communication plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis in skin. Gap junctions consist of hemi-channels (connexons), which in turn are established by transmembrane proteins (connexins, Cx). The pattern of Cx- protein expression is characteristic for tissues and depends on the differentiational and functional state. Aim:? As part of our investigations of cell biological causes for lameness in dairy cows we wanted to assess the expression of Cx-proteins in relation to differentiation in bovine claw epidermis. Methods:? We examined hoof tissue from five defined regions of the claws of 10 cows from the abattoir by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and by transmission electron microscopy. The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti- Cx26, Cx31, Cx37 (ADI, USA) and anti-Cx43 (Chemicon, USA). Immunohistochemistry was carried out on frozen and paraffin sections. Results:? Cx43 was expressed in the bovine claw epidermis in a pattern described for skin. Cx43 expression was strongest in the stratum basale in all regions. Cells of the stratum spinosum expressed lower levels, and in terminal differentiating cells Cx43 was disappearing. Expression of Cx26, 31 and 37 showed a high variation between individuals and regions. Protein expression was verified by Western blotting. The formation of gap junctions in the respective layers was confirmed by electron microscopy. Conclusion:? Our results provide evidence that Cx 43 is expressed in bovine claw epidermis in a distribution similar to skin. Cx 43 is progressively downregulated with the progress of differentiation. This suggests a role of Cx43 in cellular coordination particularly in the early stages of differentiation. Results for Cx 26, 31 and 37 will be confirmed in further studies also on the mRNA level to get deeper insight in the regulation of Cx expression in claw epidermis. We hypothesize that Cx 43 plays a similar role in controlling differentiation as in skin and may be involved in disruption of claw horn formation in claw disorders. Acknowledgement:?

AB  - Teaching veterinary anatomy continually presents new challenges. Cadaver procurement and usage comes under question from students, administration and the community. Student expectations rise while there participation wanes. Grades are hopelessly inflated. Time has been sliced away from many basic science courses. What can we do? We can run away or devise a plan. We use a tool that can make all these problems seem worse, it will take more of your time and your Dean's money, it will make some students angry with you, but it is a great hobby for those who enjoy preparing anatomical specimens. Plastination! Our lab has been using plastination for 20?years. Plastination was invented by Dr. Günter von Hagens 26?years ago at the University of Heidelberg. The silicone plastination process has four major steps. For a laboratory to be successful and remain even after you retire or get fired, the first step in the process must be done meticulously. Step 1: Specimen preparation and fixation - plan what the specimen should demonstrate. Hollow organs must be dilated and fixed in a dilated form. Specimens must be positioned in an anatomical arrangement. Step 2: Dehydration: Cold (-25°C) Acetone is preferred, however alcohol may be used. Step 3: Impregnation: Replacing the volatile solvent (acetone) with a curable polymer. Step 4: Curing, hardening, or cross-linking the polymer - also a critical step. You must know what the final product is to look like. Once cured, the specimen will remain in that position. Silicone plastination yields somewhat life-like, dry, durable, aesthetically pleasing specimens that can be used in most any circumstance and any audience. Labelling specimens and/or photographing the specimens and labelling the photograph will enhance student use. Usage: A. Anatomical instruction - Two formats have been used. 1. Plastinated specimens used with no wet dissection of that region and 2. Specimens used as a supplement and review after dissection has been completed. B. Client or public education. C. Anatomical review for Veterinarians. D. Display of anatomy area for tours. Benefits: A. Medical students and Practitioners - Specimens are dry, therefore they are convenient to use at any time even on short notice. Items that are difficult to dissect and/or visualize are good adjuncts to teaching. B. Client/Public education - Great public relations as well as seeing the involved anatomy. C. Anatomy program - The use of prosected, plastinated large animal specimens allows students access to competently prepared, long lasting study material. By not having to dissect the entire large animal cadaver, students do not rush through dissection of the equine and bovine species limbs to compensate for the reduction in laboratory time. This approach allows sufficient time for students to study the limbs of various species within the time frame dictated by the curricular revision. Disadvantage: Some students may not do a complete dissection and/or not use their wet specimens for study/review. Some students want everything to be plastinated so they can memorize one example and forget about variation. Polyester and epoxy polymers may also be used for plastination. These polymers yield are used for preparing thin body slices, which are not flexible. With the advent of MRI, CT and ultrasonography an understanding of sectional anatomy is necessary, these thin slices are an ideal tool to aid understanding images of these modalities. Plastination is a fabulous tool, which is recommended as an adjunct for teaching anatomy.

AB  - This work was carried out on the cornea of the eyeball of the donkey, cow, buffalo, camel, sheep, goat, pig and dog. The following dimensions were measured: the outer and inner dorsoventral and mediolateral dimension, also the plain, weight and the volume of the cornea and fibrous coat were recorded. The morphometric studies include also thickness of the cornea and its different layers centrally and peripherally. Generally, the thickness of the cornea is about 0.5?0.8?mm, the thickest cornea was observed in cow followed by pig and donkey, the thinnest cornea was observed in sheep followed by camel, goat and buffalo, while the cornea of the goat and buffalo has nearly the same thickness. The biometry of the cornea has been useful for assessment of certain pathologic and congenital abnormalities such as microcornea, megalocornea moreover this measurement are of utmost important when superficial keractectomy and keratoplasty are indicated.

AB  - The structure and topography of the Bursa of Fabricius (BF) differs from other central immune organs. Structural components, providing BF function are located in mucosa, which is constantly influenced by antigen stimulation. Therefore the reports, which have appeared recently, indicate that BF may function as a peripheral immune organ. The latter is known to be situated in the alimentary canal mucosa (caecal tonsils, Peyer's patches) and possess peculiar epithelium. The aim of our study was to investigate the structure and cell composition of BF epithelium in chicken, turkey, quails, ducks and pigeons using light and electronic microscopy. The studies have shown that epithelium overlying BF folds is pseudostratified columnar, but between them and in their base it might be cuboidal or columnar. Pseudostratified epithelium consists of columnar cells with a few microvilli on their apical surface, goblet cells, infrequent endocrine cells and macrophages. BF epithelium is spongious due to its infiltration by lymphoid cells. The large quantity of the latter is found in subepithelial connective tissue. Infiltration by lymphoid cells is considered to be typical for the alimentary tract mucosa, where the aggregated lymphoid nodules are situated. Thus, our study supports the thoughts that BF may have function of central and peripheral immune organ.

AB  - To find precise data about the development of the skeleton of the domestic cat (Felis catus) embryological sections cleared specimens stained for bone and cartilage and radiographs were used (for details see our upcoming publication). The pre-natal development is characterized by three main phases: the mesenchymal skeleton, already formed around stage 5 (Knospe, 2002) of the cat's development, with the notochord, somites, pharyngeal arches and limb buds, the cartilage skeleton arising during stage 14, and the bony skeleton formed by intramembranous and endochondral ossification from stage 16/17 on. The mesenchymal skeleton survives as periosteum in different ligaments, joint capsules, syndesmoses and inter-vertebral disks. The cartilage skeleton is reduced up to birth to the epiphyseal and tympanic cartilages, and survives as laryngeal, tracheal, joint, rib, sternal, nasal cartilages and synchondroses. In the newborn cat all primary centres are present, except the carpal and distal tarsal bones, secondary centres aren not established radiographically yet. The secondary and tertiary centres are formed post-natal from the first week on up to the second year. The results are presented in nine slides showing histological pictures with the main pre-natal events and schemes of the post-natal development with the skull, trunk and limb centres and their first appearance.

AB  - Investigations were performed on 10 adult individuals of chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger), midday gerbil (Gerbillus gerbillus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) and Egyptian spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus). The animals were killed with ether anaesthesia and injected with coloured acryl latex through the abdominal aorta or left heart ventricle. The heads of the animals were fixed in formalin and after decalcification in 5% HNO3, injected arteries of the base of the brain were exposed. The different types of arterial circle of the brain in investigated species were observed. The open type with morphological asymmetry in the anterior part was found in chinchilla. It depended on an unusually strongly developed anterior cerebral artery at the right side. In the midday gerbil the most common form was the closed type of investigated circle, with a lack of typical communicating artery posterior. The morphological asymmetry of the anterior part of the circle without fully developed anterior cerebral artery was found in the rabbit. Typical, the closed type of investigated structure with little individual variability was observed in guinea pig. The most individual variability connected with anterior and posterior part of the Willi's circle was found in the Egyptian spiny mouse where it was difficult to describe the typical arterial circle of the base of the brain.

AB  - Proteinaceous surface antigens of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) appear as pili, and are important virulence factors as they allow bacteria to attach to the small intestinal mucosa. Surface antigens are classified as colonization factor antigens (CFA) and coli surface antigens (CS). Known groups include CFA/I, CFA/II (consisting of CS1, CS2 and CS3), CA/III and CFA/IV (consisting of CS4, CS5 and CS6). The goal of the present study was to examine the morphology of pili by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and to localize specific surface antigens by immunolabelling. Using different strains of E. coli grown under various culture conditions, pili were visualized by negative staining and corresponding surface antigens were demonstrated by immunogold-labelling using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Expression of pili was dependent on culture conditions and sample handling. In contrast to CFA/I and CS3, CS6 pili were not detectable after negative staining. Selected antibodies, however, allowed surface antigens to be demonstrated unequivocally. These results will be of value in investigating the expression of colonizing factors in genetically modified bacterial strains.

AB  - Introduction:? In many breeds osteoarthrosis of the hip joint is the most typical orthopaedic disease. Numerous studies concerning etiology, pathogenesis and therapy of this disease still consider an exact congruity to be the basis of a physiological joint function. No data, however, are available as far as the distribution of load in the articular surfaces is concerned. Aims:? It was the aim of this investigation to describe the biomechanical features of the canine hip joint as exactly as possible with respect to long-term and momentary loading. Material and Methods:? Hip joints from 43 dogs (bodyweight >20?kg) with an average age of 6?years were investigated. The subchondral bone density was determined with the method of CT-osteoabsorptiometry. With help of cartilaginous and osseus split lines the preferential orientation of the collagen fibres could be determined. In an in vitro experimental setup the contact areas and the contact pressure distribution within the joint have been measured. Results:? In the acetabulum, maxima of subchondral bone density were distributed tricentrically: cranially, dorsally and caudally. In the femoral head, only the area close to the attachment of the ligament was highly mineralized. Cartilagineous and osseous split lines within the acetabulum gave evidence of a long-term tensile stress. In contrast to these findings, there was no clear preferential orientation in the caput ossis femoris. With load increasing initially isolated contact areas extended and became confluent at a loading force of 75% body weight. Values of maximal joint pressure (maximal joint reaction force applied: 400% bodyweight) reached 8?10?MPa. Discussion:? The findings clearly show that the articular surfaces of the hip joint are loaded inhomogeneously. For the first time, it was possible to demonstrate that the healthy canine hip joint is physiologically incongruent. Furthermore, areas of cartilage degeneration within the joint surface coincide with regions that are loaded to a higher extent a priori. From the biomechanical point of view it is recommended that all kinds of acetabular fractures ? even those affecting the caudal third of the acetabulum ? should be surgically repaired in an adequate way.

AB  - Introduction:? Neurotrophic factors constitute a group of growth factor families, which have important effects on survival and differentiation of neuronal cells. The neurotrophin family is composed of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)3 and NT 4/5. Neurotrophins act by means of high (TrkA, TrkB and TrkC) and low (p75) affinity receptors on numerous neuronal populations of central and peripheral nervous system. The family of glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) includes, besides the GDNF, neurturin (NTN), persephin (PSP) and artemin (ART). They bind to a common receptor Ret, but the binding specificity is due to a group of proteins (GFRα 1?4). These factors show a trophic effect on dorsal ganglia, motor neurons and autonomic nervous system. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the expression of NGF, BDNF and GDNF in the vas deferens and accessory genital glands of normal and castrated rats. Methods:? Immunohistochemistry, enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA), reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results and Discussion:? Immunoreactivity to NGF, BDNF and GDNF was observed in all the investigated tracts. Generally, this immunoreactivity seemed to increase in castrated rats. ELISA and RT-PCR were performed to evaluate the levels of BDNF protein and its mRNA. In the normals, the greatest concentration of BDNF was observed in the vesicular gland, the lowest in the prostate. In the castrated, the BDNF concentration significantly decreased in the vas deferens. Conversely, it increased in the vesicular gland and in the ventral and dorsal prostate. BDNF transcripts were detected in both normal and castrated rats. These results suggest that neurotrophic factors are produced by the vas deferens and accessory genital glands and, in normal conditions, they are downregulated by androgens.
