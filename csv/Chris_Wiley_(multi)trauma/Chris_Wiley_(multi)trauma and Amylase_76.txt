AB  - Disturbed calcium homeostasis during the peripartal period is a major problem in domesticated ruminants. Clinical signs of hypocalcaemia shortly after calving (periparturient paresis) occur in cattle, predominately in elder animals. On the contrary, in sheep and goat, periparturient paresis is mainly evident several weeks before and only in some cases after parturition. In high-yielding dairy goats, however, periparturient paresis also occurs ? as in the dairy cow ? during the peripartal period (Ruffin et al., 2002). Vitamin D3 receptors (VDR) participate in the regulation of calcium homeostasis by increasing the efflux of calcium from bone and dietary sources into blood. The nutritional availability of calcium during the peripartal period has been examined in cattle: VDR concentrations in colon decrease with age, being significantly higher during pregnancy and lactation and are temporarily lower at parturition (Goff et al., 1991). However, similar data have not been evaluated for sheep and goat. Thus, tissue specimens of small and large intestines were collected from lambs and non-lactating, non-pregnant adult animals of both species. Formaldehyde fixed and microwave treated paraffin sections were used for VDR immunohistochemistry employing a biotinylated monoclonal rat antibody and streptavidin peroxidase technique. Preliminary results in adult sheep showed that VDR immunoreactivities generally were higher in deep parts of crypts, decreased towards openings and were low in surface epithelium. Staining was most prominent in duodenal mucosa, lower in jejunum and further decreased in ileum and colon. It was lowest in caecum. Smaller numbers of immunopositive cells and reduced staining intensities resulted in weaker immunoreactions in the latter segments of small and large intestines. In addition to nuclear tinction, cytoplasmic staining was mainly evident in duodenum, at lower levels in jejunum and negligible in ileum, colon and caecum. Immunohistochemistry of goat and lamb intestines are currently performed, thus the effects of age and species are presently unknown. Our preliminary results indicate that VDRs are highly expressed at the site of presumed maximal intestinal calcium resorption. References?

AB  - Abstract First-hand and second-hand tobacco smoke are causally linked to a huge number of deaths and are responsible for a broad spectrum of pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, and eye diseases as well as adverse effects on female reproductive function. Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of different chemical species, which exert their negative effects on macromolecules and biochemical pathways, both directly and indirectly. Many compounds can act as oxidants, pro-inflammatory agents, carcinogens, or a combination of these. The redox behavior of cigarette smoke has many implications for smoke related diseases. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (both radicals and non-radicals), reactive carbonyl compounds, and other species may induce oxidative damage in almost all the biological macromolecules, compromising their structure and/or function. Different quantitative and redox proteomic approaches have been applied in vitro and in vivo to evaluate, respectively, changes in protein expression and specific oxidative protein modifications induced by exposure to cigarette smoke and are overviewed in this review. Many gel-based and gel-free proteomic techniques have already been used successfully to obtain clues about smoke effects on different proteins in cell cultures, animal models, and humans. The further implementation with other sensitive screening techniques could be useful to integrate the comprehension of cigarette smoke effects on human health. In particular, the redox proteomic approach may also help identify biomarkers of exposure to tobacco smoke useful for preventing these effects or potentially predictive of the onset and/or progression of smoking-induced diseases as well as potential targets for therapeutic strategies. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compile a listing of the theses and dissertations completed in colleges and universities of home economics in the United States during 1983 and 1984. The 1,990 titles, received from 87 institutions, are listed by subject-matter area and degree for each year; and the author, institution, and availability of the document are reported. Information about graduate research in home economics is summarized through presentations of totals for each in stitution, by subject matter categories, and through rankings for the institutions reporting the largest number of theses and dissertations. Of all the titles, 25 percent were for dissertations for both years. For both years, the largest number of titles was reported nutrition, while family relations and child development ranked second.
