AB  - Introduction Numerous oral joint supplements are available, but there is limited research into their efficacy. This study evaluated the effect of an oral joint supplement on orthopaedic evaluation scores and limb kinematics in horses. Methods 24 mature horses (71% 1?4/10 lame) were included. Exclusions were poor body condition, health problems, or lameness >4/10. Supplement S (FlexAbilityTM, Science Supplements, containing chondroitin sulphate 162?g/kg, glucosamine 190?g/kg, vitamin C 80?g/kg, methyl sulphonyl methane 256?g/kg, DHA 66?g/kg); EPA 34?g/kg; or placebo P (carrier/flavours only) were fed to horses for 21 days each in a random order triple-blind crossover design. Horses were evaluated at day 0 (baseline), 21 (after first treatment) and 42 (after second treatment). Clinical orthopaedic evaluation for straight line and lungeing circle (walk and trot), and during ridden exercise (walk, trot and canter) was performed. Side-view high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) determined midstance tarsal flexion, carpal extension and fetlock extension for straight line trotting. All evaluators were blinded to treatment. Effect of treatment, sequence, limb and interactions were investigated using linear mixed models. Results S was associated with significantly lower lameness grade in a straight line (P?=?0.001) with individual horses improving up to 2/10 grades and circle (P?=?0.010) than either P or baseline. For horses with hindlimb lameness, supplement S was associated with significantly greater tarsal flexion than baseline (4.2% greater, P<0.02) or P (2.7% greater, P<0.037). Conclusions Oral administration of supplement S was associated with less lameness than P or baseline. Increased midstance tarsal flexion of lame limbs may indicate improved mobility or comfort during peak loading.

AB  - Introduction Pressure plate analysis has been limited to measurements on a hard surface, whereas horses routinely perform on a soft substrate. Methods Five sound unshod ponies were walked and trotted over a pressure plate under 2 different conditions: first, the plate was covered with a 5-mm rubber mat, and then with an additional 50-mm layer of sand/synthetic fibres. Peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), peak vertical pressure (PVP), contact area (CA) and stance duration (ST) were obtained. Toe-heel and medio-lateral hoof balance curves of the vertical force were calculated (126?Hz). Hard vs. soft surfaces were compared using ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons. Results PVF, VI, PVP and ST decreased on the soft substrate, while CA increased (P<0.001). At impact, there was more even load distribution between the toe and heel region on the soft vs. hard surface, both at walk (P<0.001) and trot (P?=?0.039), and between the lateral and medial zone at walk (P?=?0.006), but not at trot. At mid-stance, there was more loading of the toe region on the soft vs. hard surface at walk (P?=?0.044) and at trot (P?=?0.005), while the medial and lateral zone were loaded equally. Conclusions The differences observed may be due to dampening effects, measurement errors or gait adaptations. Due to the lack of simultaneous force plate data this cannot be definitively identified, but the first option seems most likely. This study opens perspectives for evaluation of the effects of conformational deficits and therapeutic farriery on hoof loading in relation to arena composition.

AB  - Introduction Manipulation of the equine ilium and sacrum is utilised to assess range of motion at the SIJ. Motion of the ilium and sacrum during manual force application to the equine pelvis has been measured previously in vitro. The aim of this study was to measure the amount and direction of motion in vivo including comparison of bone fixated and skin mounted sensors. Methods Orientation sensors were skin-mounted over tuber sacrale (TS) and 3rd sacral spinous process (SP) of six standing Thoroughbred horses. Orientations of each TS and sacrum were recorded by one investigator during six trials of manual force applied to the pelvis, inducing cranial, caudal and oblique rotations. The study was repeated with the sensors mounted onto pins implanted into TS and SP. Mean values were reported in Euler angles for the three orthogonal planes lateral bend (LB), flexion-extension (F-E) and axial rotation (AR). Correlation between skin and bone fixated markers (Spearman R) was determined with significance set at P<0.05. Results The largest mean values recorded during rotations applied to the pelvises were for F-E (2.08?±?0.35o) with bone fixated sensors. Axial rotation gave the largest values recorded with skin-mountings (1.70?±?0.48o). There was poor correlation between skin-mounted and bone implanted markers. Conclusions Bony kinematics during external movement applied to the pelvis cannot be predicted from skin-mounted sensors, due to differences between skin- and bone-mounted sensors. Manipulation of the equine pelvis can be expected to produce motion in the plane of F-E, but axial movement should be interpreted with caution due to the potential effects of skin motion.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the trot may occur or increase during endurance rides due to lameness, pain or fatigue. By visual inspection of the movement it is difficult for veterinarians, riders and researchers to distinguish between fatigue and low-grade lameness, which make objective movement analysis relevant for this purpose. The aim of this study was to determine changes in movement symmetry during long-term exercise. Methods Movement symmetry of 45 horses finishing endurance rides of 120?160 kilometres was determined by tri-axial accelerometry according to an earlier published method. Data was collected in Denmark and Germany from 5 international competitions between 2011 and 2013. Movement was assessed at trot on a straight-line in-hand on the day before the race and 30?mins to 3?hrs after passing the final veterinary examination. An overall symmetry index S was calculated on the basis of trunk accelerations measured at 240?Hz during 8 strides. All trotting sequences were recorded on videotape. A paired t-test was performed comparing symmetry indices before and after racing for each individual horse. Results A significant decrease in post-ride symmetry was detected (P?=?0.0042). This is seen as a lower S-index before racing (-6.18; SD?=?0.86. CI [-6.427; ?5.923]) compared to after racing (-5.67; SD?=?0.79; CI [-5.908; ?5.434]). Conclusions This study indicates that the biomechanical method applied allows quantification of the symmetry of movement during field conditions. Most horses had decreased movement symmetry after the race. Accordingly the study provides the basis for further investigation of the causes, including surface, climate and fitness; and the possible health consequences of asymmetric movement developed during long-term exercise. Ethical Animal Research The study was pre-approved by the FEI, the local organizing committees, ground jury, and Danish riding association (DRF).

AB  - Introduction Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most important Brazilian horse breed. Functional evaluation of MM horses is performed in marcha competitions, where horses must perform 4-gaited exercise at 13?km/h for 70?min. The aim of this work was to test a training protocol to prepare MM horses for marcha competition. Methods Eight untrained MM mares, in randomized blocks with Split plots, were trained for 84 days. Three days/week horses were ridden for one hour (10?min walk, then an individual amount of marcha exercise at 13?km/h established in a previous test, then walk to complete one hour total exercise time). Two days/week, horses walked for one hour. Before training and every 21 days a marcha test (MT) was performed, totaling 5 tests in the experimental period. During the MT, mares were exercised at 13?km/h using a heart rate monitor. Every 10?min heart rate (HR) and blood lactate concentration [La] were recorded. The MT was stopped at 70?min of exercise, or if HR was ≥150?bpm and [La] was ≥4?mmol/L, or if Marcha Time was reached. Blood samples for hemogram, lactate, glucose, triglyceride and CK, LDH, AST determination were collected. Individual time used for training was 10?min less than the exercising time in the previous MT. Regression was used to analyze the results. Results From MT 1 to 4, the positive effect of training was shown on HR, [La] and marcha time (from 9.52?min to 70.5?min, CV?=?26.41). There was not an increase in marcha time on test 5. Conclusions MM mares trained for 63?days with the described protocol are ready to compete in marcha competition.

AB  - Introduction Poll flexion may play an important role in the development of dynamic upper respiratory tract (URT) collapse. However, limited investigations have been performed in Standardbred racehorses. Methods Eight Standardbreds were examined during training, once flexed and once in extension, using a randomised crossover design. Head position was maintained using modified check-reins and head-neck angle was recorded. On each occasion horses performed 2 rounds of exercise of 2400?m at ?35?km/h. Speed and heart rate (HR) were measured and blood obtained before and after exercise. URT endoscopy was performed during the second round. Videos were blinded and URT function assessed. HR, plasma lactate (Lac) and speed were compared for different head positions using paired t-tests. Cortisol was analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA and URT function using Fisher's exact tests and paired t-tests (P<0.05). Results Data were excluded for one horse where head-neck angle could not be measured. Flexed and extended head-neck angles differed significantly (mean: 85.0° vs 97.8°; P?=?0.001). All horses showed some form of URT collapse during exercise, although this was only deemed clinically significant in 4 horses with a history of abnormal noise. These horses showed additional abnormalities during flexion. However, mean severity scores did not reach statistical significance (P?=?0.08). No significant difference was found for speed, HR or Lac. A significant increase in cortisol was found with exercise (P<0.001). The interaction between time and head position approached significance (P?=?0.09) with higher concentrations of cortisol generally occurring in extension rather than flexion. Conclusions URT abnormalities may be exacerbated with poll flexion. The use of equipment to modify head position may induce a stress response.

AB  - Introduction Healthy and poorly performing horses can display arrhythmias during exercise and immediately afterwards. The relationship of arrhythmias to exercise intensity or type, and their frequency of recurrence, are poorly understood. Clarification of these issues was the objective of this investigation. Methods Electrocardiograms were recorded on 9 Thoroughbreds during maximal and submaximal exercise on a racetrack (RA) and treadmill (TM). The frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias for RA and TM were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Results 65 workouts (TM?=?46, RA?=?19; median[range]: 4/horse[2?14]) were performed. Exercising arrhythmias were detected in 4/9 horses (12/65 workouts) and there were post-exercise arrhythmias in 7/9 horses (20/65 workouts). A single exercising electrocardiogram per horse often did not display all arrhythmias detected over several workouts. 3/9 horses exhibited arrhythmias during the first and second runs while the other 6 had none. 4/9 had 1 post-exercise arrhythmia. Of 6 horses with >3 runs, 1 displayed arrhythmias each time, 3 never had arrhythmias and 2 sometimes showed arrhythmias during exercise (1/9 and 4/8 workouts, respectively). All 6 intermittently had post-exercise arrhythmias (median[range]: 50% [9?75%] of workouts). Presence of arrhythmias was positively related to intensity and all occurred at ≥94%HRmax. The frequency of arrhythmias following RA (29%) and TM (12.5%) was not statistically different. Conclusions Gallops on TM or RA were equally effective for detecting arrhythmias. The presence/absence of exercising arrhythmias was more repeatable than post-exercise arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are more likely to be detected at maximal or near-maximal intensities. A larger population needs to be studied before firm conclusions are drawn. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.

AB  - Introduction Previous research suggests stalling may have a negative influence on bone mineral content (BMC). Yet slow, long-distance exercise has not been successful in improving BMC compared to free-choice exercise. Still, it is a common practice to stall horses with light exercise and minimal turnout. We hypothesized stalled horses, despite ?weekend? turnout and light exercise, would have lower estimated BMC compared to pasture turnout. Methods Thirteen mature horses were split into two groups, Control (C, n?=?6) and Stalled (S, n?=?7). Digital radiographs were taken of the third metacarpal for estimation of BMC by radiographic bone aluminum equivalence (RBAE). After a 42-d period (P1) additional radiographs were taken and S-horses stalled for 4-d (receiving light under-saddle exercise), followed by 72-h pasture turnout. This pattern repeated for an additional 42-d (P2) followed by radiographs. Radiographs were analyzed for optical density of bone cortices and total BMC compared to an aluminum step-wedge on each cassette. Changes in BMC were analyzed using PROC mixed in SAS with repeated measures. Results No treatment differences were observed in the medial (P?=?0.72) or lateral (P?=?0.46) cortices. Dorsal and palmar cortices exhibited a treatment by period interaction (P<0.01, P<0.02), remaining unchanged in C but S decreased over P1 and returned to baseline in P2. Total RBAE was not different by treatment or period. Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, horses stalled with light exercise and ?weekend? turnout maintained BMC compared to themselves and controls at pasture. Such management may be considered for maintaining BMC when horses must be stalled for weekday riding or training. Further research is necessary to determine minimum turnout and exercise needs to maintain BMC when stalling.

AB  - Introduction One of the causes of injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is assumed to be repeated high intensity loading of the tendon. Earlier fatigue of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) in comparison to the time of fatigue of the superficial digital flexor muscle (SDFM) is also assumed to increase load on the SDFT during long distance running. This study evaluated the fatigue of SDFM and DDFM with maximal exercise. Methods Two wire electrodes were inserted into the SDFM and DDFM of 6 Thoroughbred horses (461?557?kg). Electromyogram (EMG) and hoof strain gauge signals were recorded at 2,500?Hz with horses on an inclined treadmill (6%), and filter processing was applied (high-pass 10?Hz for EMG and low-pass 200?Hz for strain gauge). Integrated EMG (iEMG), the median frequency (MF) of EMG, and the stride frequency (SF) were compared using paired t-test during 100?105% heart rate max exercise and trotting before and after maximal exercise. Results The SF significantly decreased and iEMG of SDFM tended to decrease during maximal exercise (P?=?0.055), while MF of EMG in SDFM and DDFM did not change. The iEMG of SDFM and DDFM significantly decreased and MF of EMG in DDFM tended to decrease at a trot after maximal exercise (P?=?0.063). Conclusions The DDFM may fatigue earlier than SDFM during long distance running. Further study is needed to evaluate the relationship between the decrease in iEMG of SDFM and DDFM during maximal exercise and the injury to SDFT.

AB  - Introduction Selecting the appropriate nutritional supplements for performance horses is difficult, due to significant gaps in the current scientific evidence. Our hypothesis was that nutritional supplements are chosen based on owner's perception of discipline specific health and performance problems. Methods A mixed methods (open and closed questions) online questionnaire was distributed through British Eventing and Dressage websites, to collect data on demographics of owners and their horses, supplements used, and their opinion on health and performance problems in their discipline, and in their own horses. Data was evaluated using descriptive analysis and Sign and Fisher's exact tests for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results 599 responses met the inclusion criteria, of which 441 were or had competed in dressage, and 158 in eventing (unaffiliated novice to affiliated advanced levels). Participants had been riding for 26.4 (3?60) (mean (range)) years, currently competed 1.2 (0?10) horses, and used 2 (0?12) supplements in their top horse. Participants ranked the most important health and performance issues as (1) Energy and behaviour, (2) Lameness, (3) Back and muscle problems for dressage, and (1) Lameness, (2) Energy and behaviour, (3) Stamina and fitness for eventing horses. The most common reason supplements were used in individual horses were (1) Joints and mobility, (2) Behavioural problems for dressage, and (1) Electrolytes, (2) Joints and mobility for eventing. Conclusions There was discrepancy between participants' opinions of the main health and performance problems within their discipline, and their reasons for using supplements.

AB  - Introduction In Thoroughbreds, genetic variation in myostatin (MSTN g.66493737C/T) is highly predictive of optimum race distance and influences mRNA expression, precocity, skeletal muscle development, two-year-old earnings, speed variables and skeletal muscle fibre type. The aim of this study was to investigate MSTN variation associations with VO2peak in untrained yearling Thoroughbreds. Methods Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbred yearlings (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) from one flat racing yard (November-December). Data was collected as horses freely travelled up an all-weather gallop (2% incline) with no rider. VO2 was measured using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask and associated customized software validated for field testing. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded. MSTN genotypes were determined using a customised Taqman SNP genotyping assay. Tests of association between genotype and phenotype were performed using PLINK software. Results Average exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, and HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm. MSTN genotypes and VO2peak based on 6 breaths were n?=?16 CC, VO2peak?=?119.49?±?21.8; n?=?22 CT, VO2peak?=?116.40?±?-27.2; n?=?3 TT, 115.08?±?20.2.There was no association (P>0.05) between genotype and VO2peak. Conclusions In yearling Thoroughbreds no association between MSTN genotype and untrained peak oxygen consumption was observed. This may be a function of the small number of TT genotype individuals evaluated or a reflection of a requirement for MSTN-associated skeletal muscle entrainment in VO2peak changes resulting from a period of exercise training. Such changes may be associated with MSTN genotype and this requires further investigation. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.

AB  - Introduction PGC-1α and irisin, encoded by the PPARGC1A and FNDC5 genes, play key roles in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise. PPARGC1A gene expression is induced by exercise and has been shown to upregulate FNDC5 expression. Higher levels of FNDC5 have been observed in young male human athletes compared to sedentary controls. FNDC5 gene expression has also been shown in some species to be modulated by myostatin (MSTN), a growth factor that limits muscle hypertrophy. In horses MSTN variation (g.66493737C>T) affects gene expression and racing performance. Thoroughbreds homozygous for the C-allele have significantly higher levels of MSTN?mRNA than homozygous T?:?T horses. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of PPARGC1A and FNDC5 in skeletal muscle to exercise and investigate the relationship with MSTN genotype. Methods Skeletal muscle (gluteus medius) biopsies were taken from untrained yearling Thoroughbreds (n?=?27) at rest and after a ten month period of training at two-years-old. Skeletal muscle gene expression was measured using real-time qRT-PCR assays and data was analysed using qBase software. Results A significant increase in both PPARGC1A (P?=?0.0001, FC?=?1.82) and FNDC5 (P?=?0.039, FC?=?1.72) was observed post-training. A significant positive correlation was found between FNDC5 and PPARGC1A expression levels post training (P?=?0.01, R2?=?0.22). There was no relationship between PPARGC1A or FNDC5 gene expression and MSTN genotype. Conclusions These data indicate a coordinated role for PGC-1α and irisin in the skeletal muscle response to exercise in Thoroughbred horses. Their known roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and brown fat metabolism suggest important roles in the adaptive response to exercise, which is independent of MSTN-determined muscle type.

AB  - Introduction NaHCO3 has been administered prior to racing in an attempt to enhance performance but it remains unclear whether potential ergogenic effects may be due to increased buffering capacity or expanded extracellular fluid volume. Methods Solutions of 1?g/kg of NaCl, KCl, NaHCO3, or KHCO3 in 8?L of water were administered via a nasogastric tube 60?min prior to a high intensity treadmill exercise test (12?m/s to fatigue) to 4 horses in a randomized fashion. Changes in mixed venous plasma electrolyte concentrations (NOVA Biomedical analyser) and run time to fatigue were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Administration of Na and K salts increased Na and K concentrations before and during maximal exercise, respectively. Administration of bicarbonate salts attenuated acidosis and the decrease in bicarbonate concentration during exercise, as compared to Cl salts. Of interest, run time to fatigue was longer (P<0.001, power?=?0.98) after administration of KCl (5.1?±?0.6?min) as compared to both bicarbonate salts (3.7?±?0.6 and 3.6?±?0.8?min for NaHCO3 and KHCO3, respectively), but was not different than run time after NaCl administration (4.3?±?0.8?min). Conclusions Preloading with large amounts of Na and K salts produced expected changes in mixed venous Na and K concentrations but preloading with bicarbonate did not improve performance. Observation of longer run times to fatigue after administration of NaCl or KCl was unexpected and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Introduction The objective was to compare, using a dynamometric horseshoe (DHS), the longitudinal and vertical components of the reaction force and corresponding impulses in the leading and trailing forelimbs of horses landing after a jump on a competition surface. Methods Both forefeet of 3 horses were equipped with a DHS. 1000?Hz films of the right forefoot at landing were synchronized with the DHSs recordings. Within a corridor delimited on a sand arena, each horse jumped a 1.20?m (horse 1) or 1.10?m (horses 2 and 3) high fence while cantering alternatively at both leads. Data were pooled and 37 strides analyzed both for the leading (LF) and trailing (TF) forelimbs. In addition to peak forces and impulses (integral of force over time) in the hoof reference frame, the forces on the right forelimb were projected in the track reference frame to determine true retardatory (TR) and propulsory (TP) phases. Differences between LF and TF were estimated with linear regression models, using generalized estimating equations to adjust for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (for all results, P<0.0005). Results Maximal vertical force and loading rate were respectively 1.2 and 1.4 times higher on TF. TR-longitudinal impulse was 21 times, and TR-vertical impulse 8 times higher in LF, whereas TP-longitudinal impulse was 4 times, and TP-vertical impulse 2 times higher in TF. Conclusions Despite a lower maximal vertical loading, LF plays a major part in the retardatory (load-absorption) phase, while TF is mainly involved in propulsion. Loading of anatomical structures is therefore different in both limbs, which provides insights for interpreting horses' preferred lead at landing depending on which structure is affected.

AB  - Introduction Lungeing is an important part of lameness examination since the circular path is thought to accentuate low-grade lameness. Circle dependent, compensatory movement, and pain related asymmetries make lameness evaluation complex. Subjective evaluation, by watching the horse in motion, is standard practice but studies have shown that inter-observer variation is high when assessing lameness (straight line movement). The aim was to estimate inter- and intra-rater agreement between equine practitioners evaluating lameness from videos of sound and lame horses during lungeing. Methods Equine practitioners (n?=?86), including 43 deemed as experienced, participated in a web-based survey. Horses (n?=?23, including two horses with solar-pressure induced lameness) [defined as forelimb-, hind limb-lame or sound from objective kinematic straight line measurements] trotted on a circle in both directions on soft/hard ground surfaces (one condition/video). Of 104 recordings, 60 were selected of which 10 were repeated (numbers chosen to make compliance possible). The practitioners were asked to report which limb was most lame on each video. Kappa statistics were used to analyze the inter-rater and intra-rater agreement. The ? agreement was set to poor <0.3, acceptable 0.31?0.5, good 0.51?0.8, excellent >0.8. Results Inter-rater agreement kappa (n?=?86) was 0.31 (0.38/0.25 for experienced/less experienced). Evaluating forelimb compared to hind limb lameness agreement increased 11%. Intra-rater agreement kappa (percentiles) was (P10-50-90, 0.21, 0.57, 0.84). Conclusions Since identification of the lame limb/limbs is a prerequisite for successful diagnosis, treatment and recovery, the high inter-observer variation when evaluating lameness during lungeing may decrease the accuracy of lameness examinations.

AB  - Introduction When horses are trotted in-hand, this is predominantly performed with the handler on the horse's left side. In the context of objective gait analysis, this study investigated whether the side a horse is led from affects movement symmetry measures used to quantify lameness. We hypothesised that the side which horses were handled from would have no effect on head and pelvic movement symmetry. Methods Vertical movement of head and pelvis was quantified in 23 horses during trot in-hand with a validated inertial sensor gait analysis system. Established movement symmetry measures commonly used to quantify lameness were calculated for a minimum of 27 strides per condition. Each horse was assessed three times, twice handled from one side, once from the other side, with the initial handling side randomly assigned. Differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments led from the same side were compared to differences when led from the opposite side using a paired t-test (P<0.05) Results Which side a horse was led from had no significant effect on either head (all P>0.754) or pelvic (all P>0.514) movement symmetry. Mean differences for head (and pelvic) movement asymmetry were below 2% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for repeat assessments from the same side and below 4% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for opposite side leads. Conclusions The side from which a horse is led does not significantly affect differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments. Data analysis should be restricted to trials with consistent head carriage and a minimum of 27 strides (previously reported to give a representative estimate of stride-to-stride variability).

AB  - Introduction Rider movement may influence horse-rider interaction, yet little is known about what physical attributes affect postural stability. This study aimed to compare pelvic control and postural stability of riders on the floor and whilst riding. Methods 33 riders were assessed by a physiotherapist and subjectively graded according to ability to tilt the pelvis in isolation: 1?=?poor, 2?=?better plus compensations, which were either A?=?lumbar spine inclusion B?=?full body lean, 3?=?good. Riders wore markers on (1) greater trochanter of the femur, (2) iliac crest, (3) greater tubercle of the humerus. A marker was placed over the horse's tuber sacrale (4). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) recorded four strides of collected sitting trot in a straight line from the left side. Distance between markers was measured at midstance, maximum hindlimb protraction and retraction. Synchronisation was determined by the difference in time (secs) between the tuber sacrale of the horse and pelvis of the rider at these stride points. One-way ANOVA was used to compare synchronisation between groups. Student's independent t-test was used to compare marker distance. Results For pelvic tilt, no grade 3 riders were seen. Grade 2 riders were more synchronised with the horse during left hind diagonal suspension phase (P?=?0.011) and had smaller horizontal distances between markers 1?2, 2?3 and 1?3 respectively at all points of the stride (midstance: P<0.042; hindlimb protraction: P<0.049; hindlimb retraction: P<0.013). Comparing compensation types, grade A riders were better synchronised with the horse at midstance phase (P?=?0.014). Conclusions Results suggest that control of pelvic movement may have an impact on horse-rider synchronisation.

AB  - Introduction Lameness is the most common health problem of racehorses and may affect both welfare and performance. The aim of this study was to investigate if locomotion asymmetry in a group of young horses was related to delayed qualification for races. Methods Locomotion asymmetry was measured every 1?3 months with a wireless inertial sensor based lameness evaluation system in 16 horses fourteen times between September of the year they were 1-year olds and May of the year they were 3-year olds. As 3-year-olds they passed their qualification race and after this, two subgroups were created for the study based on whether they passed their qualification race before June 21st (early group, n?=?6) or after September 19th (late group, n?=?6). The groups were compared with respect to the differences in vertical head (forelimbs) and pelvis (hindlimbs) movement (as measured by the Lameness Locator, Equinosis) during each stride cycle at trot. The vector sums (VS) of maximum and minimum difference from each sensor were calculated and used for statistical analyses. ANOVA (Proc mixed model including individual {random}, date and group) was used to analyse differences between groups. Results The late group had higher VS for forelimbs (16.0?±?1.0) than the early group (12.6?±?1.0) (P?=?0.04) in total over the whole period. The VS for hind limbs did not differ between groups. Conclusions Front limb locomotion asymmetry in young horses in training is associated with delayed qualification for races. However, further studies are warranted to investigate causality.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies allow the assessment of variations in body position during jumping. This study evaluated changes in kinematic variables in horses during a jumping test. Methods Eight horses equipped with reflective skin markers were submitted to a jumping test consisting of 70 jumps in 4 series of 10, 15, 20 and 25 times each over a 1.10?m vertical obstacle. Six jumps per series were recorded; a heart rate of ≤ 90?bpm was the criterion to begin the next series. A 25?Hz calibrated camera was placed 10?m from the fence, and 2D images were analyzed. The variables were: overtracking at jumping; take-off and landing distances; jump length; distance between lowest point of the fore and hind limb and the fence; height of head, withers and croup in relation to the ground when passing the fence; and maximum withers height at jumping. Data were analysed with an ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test (P<0.05). Results There was a reduction in take-off distance (1.65?m to 1.46?m, P?=?0.03), landing distance (1.99?m to 1.71?m, P?=?0.001), jump length (4.51?m to 4.11?m, P?=?0.005), left forelimb distance height above the fence (9.4?cm to 5.1?cm, P?=?0.03) and maximum withers height at jumping (2.0?m to 1.95?m, P?=?0.001) from the first to the third series. Overtracking before jumping increased from 32?cm to 48?cm (P?=?0.003) and there was a reduction of right forelimb height above the fence from 7.3?cm to 2.9?cm (P?=?0.04), and of withers and croup height above the fence from 2.0?m to 1.95?m (P?=?0.001) and 1.93?m to 1.86?m (P<0.0001) respectively from the first to fourth session. Conclusions The increase in the number of jumps resulted in a decrease of take-off and landing distances, and in the distance between forelimb and fence and the withers and croup height, all indicating decreased jumping efficiency.

AB  - Introduction Lungeing is part of the standard lameness examination, however it systematically affects movement symmetry even in sound horses. We evaluated a method for objective lameness detection on the circle accounting for this asymmetry bias. Methods Twenty-six horses undergoing lameness examination were equipped with inertial sensors (Xsens) on head, sacrum and tubera coxae. Asymmetry in vertical displacement was quantified for trot on straight line and circle using multiple measures. Horses were classified lame when falling outside the directional reference range of sound horses (directional?=??normal? margins and lame limb depending on rein and sign of measure). Objective classification on the circle was compared to subjective evaluation, final diagnoses and objective classification on the straight calculating the proportion of matches. Regression analysis evaluated the association of change in asymmetry between straight line and circle and baseline asymmetry on the straight. Results The match between objective classification on the circle and the exact fore-/hindlimb(s) scored lame subjectively was 81% / 79%. The match with the diagnosed limb(s) was 71% / 85%. There was a high frequency of false positives compared to subjective evaluation. Objective evaluation on the circle added new information compared to assessment on the straight line in 70% (forelimb) / 58% (hindlimb) of instances (contralateral limb lame, bilateral lameness, lame on circle but sound on straight). Change in asymmetry was not associated with baseline lameness (P≥0.062). Conclusions Objective lameness evaluation on the circle makes a valuable contribution to patient assessment: e.g. subtle lameness falling within the margins of ?normal? on the straight or bilateral lameness could be identified. In future, the predictive value of the proposed technique should be determined. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.
