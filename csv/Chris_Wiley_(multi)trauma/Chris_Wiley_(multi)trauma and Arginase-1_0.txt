AB  - Summary Critically ill patients display a state of immunosuppression that has been attributed in part to decreased plasma arginine concentrations. However, we and other authors have failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of L-arginine supplementation. We hypothesize that, in these critically ill patients, these low plasma arginine levels may be secondary to the presence of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSC), which express arginase known to convert arginine into nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. Indeed, in a series of 28 non-surgical critically ill patients, we showed a dramatic increase in gMDSC compared to healthy subjects (P?=?0·0002). A significant inverse correlation was observed between arginine levels and gMDSC (P?=?0·01). As expected, gMDSC expressed arginase preferentially in these patients. Patients with high gMDSC levels on admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) presented an increased risk of death at day 7 after admission (P?=?0·02). In contrast, neither plasma arginine levels, monocytic MDSC levels nor neutrophil levels were associated with overall survival at day 7. No relationship was found between body mass index (BMI) or simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score or gMDSC levels, eliminating a possible bias concerning the direct prognostic role of these cells. As gMDSC exert their immunosuppressive activity via multiple mechanisms [production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-10, arginase, etc.], it may be more relevant to target these cells, rather than simply supplementing with L-arginine to improve immunosuppression and its clinical consequences observed in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown that treatment with a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is neuroprotective after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), limiting post-traumatic neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory microglial activation and promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. However, the specific molecular mechanisms governing this anti-inflammatory shift in microglia remain unknown. Here we show that the mGluR5 PAM, VU0360172 (VuPAM), regulates microglial inflammatory responses through activation of Akt, resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3?. GSK-3? regulates the phosphorylation of CREB, thereby controlling the expression of inflammation-related genes and microglial plasticity. The anti-inflammatory action of VuPAM in microglia is reversed by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. Using a well-characterized TBI model and CX3CR1gfp/+ mice to visualize microglia in vivo, we demonstrate that VuPAM enhances Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling in the injured cortex, as well as anti-inflammatory microglial markers. Furthermore, in situ analysis revealed that GFP + microglia in the cortex of VuPAM-treated TBI mice co-express pCREB and the anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype marker YM1. Taken together, our data show that VuPAM decreases pro-inflammatory microglial activation by modulating Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. These findings serve to clarify the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of mGluR5 PAM treatment after TBI, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for post-traumatic neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract Macrophages are critically involved in wound healing, from dampening inflammation to clearing cell debris and coordinating tissue repair. Within the wound, the complexity of macrophage function is increasingly recognized, with adverse outcomes when macrophages are inappropriately activated, such as in fibrosis or chronic non-healing wounds. Recent advances in in vivo and translational wound models, macrophage-specific deletions and new technologies to distinguish macrophage subsets, have uncovered the vast spectrum of macrophage activation and effector functions. Here, we summarize the main players in wound-healing macrophage activation and function, including cytokines, apoptotic cells, nucleotides and mechanical stimuli. We highlight recent studies demonstrating cooperation between these factors for optimal wound healing. Next, we describe recent technologies such as cell tracking and single-cell RNA-seq, which have uncovered remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity in blood-derived or tissue-resident macrophages and discuss the implications for wound healing. Lastly, we evaluate macrophage dysfunction in aberrant wound healing that occurs in aging, diabetes and fibrosis. A better understanding of the longevity and plasticity of wound-healing macrophages, and identification of unique macrophage subsets or specific effector molecules in wound healing, would shed light on the therapeutic potential of manipulating macrophage function for optimal wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Bone repair after trauma or surgical intervention involves a tightly regulated cascade of events that starts with hemostasis and an inflammatory response, which are critical for successful healing. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are routinely prescribed for pain relief despite their potential inhibitory effect on bone repair. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of administration of the non-selective NSAID diclofenac in the inflammatory phase of bone repair in mice with or without lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. Repair of femoral window defects was characterized using micro computed tomography imaging and histological analyses at 2 weeks postoperative. The data indicate (a) impaired bone regeneration associated with reduced osteoblast, osteoclast, and macrophage activity; (b) changes in the number, activity, and distribution of mast cells in regenerating bone; and (c) impaired angiogenesis due to a direct toxic effect of diclofenac on vascular endothelial cells. The results of this study provide strong evidence to support the conjecture that administration of NSAIDs in the first 2 weeks after orthopaedic surgery disrupts the healing cascade and exacerbates the negative effects of systemic inflammation on the repair process.

AB  - Summary Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and injury and are critical for antimicrobial host defense. Through the generation of reactive oxidants, activation of granular constituents and neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils target microbes and prevent their dissemination. While these pathways are beneficial in the context of trauma and infection, their off-target effects in the context of tumor are variable. Tumor-derived factors have been shown to reprogram the marrow, skewing toward the expansion of myelopoiesis. This can result in stimulation of both neutrophilic leukocytosis and the release of immature granulocytic populations that accumulate in circulation and in the tumor microenvironment. While activated neutrophils have been shown to kill tumor cells, there is growing evidence for neutrophil activation driving tumor progression and metastasis through a number of pathways, including stimulation of thrombosis and angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, and impairment of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. There is also growing appreciation of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, with distinct neutrophil populations promoting cancer control or progression. In addition to the effects of tumor on neutrophil responses, anti-neoplastic treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and growth factors, can influence neutrophil responses. Future directions for research are expected to result in more mechanistic knowledge of neutrophil biology in the tumor microenvironment that may be exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) tissues, including the brain, the eye, and the spinal cord, are immune-privileged, secluded from the circulation by a complex of barriers, and equipped with their own myeloid cell population, the resident microglia. Based on the classical perspective of immune?brain interactions and on the contribution of such interactions to the progression of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS, infiltrating macrophages were traditionally viewed as an enemy of the nervous system. However, over the past two decades, research has revealed the pivotal role of monocyte-derived macrophages in CNS repair, and opened up a new era in understanding and treating CNS pathologies. Here, we gather current knowledge regarding macrophage broad spectrum of activities in the CNS, whose two poles correspond to the classical pro-inflammatory M1 and the ?alternatively-activated? M2 cells previously described in various non-CNS pathologies, and their diverse, multi-functional contribution in various neurological conditions, ranging from acute traumas to neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The diverse functions are manifested by induction and resolution of inflammation as well as their involvement in neural tissue regeneration and renewal, matrix remodelling, debris clearance, and angiogenesis. A special focus is devoted to current evidence suggesting that resident microglia and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are functionally non-redundant cell types. Taken together, these recent advances reveal a dramatic therapeutic opportunity for controlled harnessing of macrophages for repair of the damaged CNS following acute insults, in neurodegenerative conditions, and in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Summary In cases of arginine depletion, lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and CD3? chain expression are all diminished. In addition to myeloid suppressor cells, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) also exert T-cell immune suppressive effects through arginase-induced l-arginine depletion, especially during pregnancy. In this study, we investigated how arginase/l-arginine modulates neonatal lymphocyte proliferation. Results showed that the neonatal plasma l-arginine level was lower than in adults (48·1 ± 11·3 versus 86·5 ± 14·6 ?m; P = 0·003). Neonatal PMN had a greater abundance of arginase I protein than adult PMN. Both transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation were responsible for the higher arginase I expression of neonatal PMN. Exogenous l-arginine enhanced neonate lymphocyte proliferation but not that of adult cells. The RNA-binding protein HuR was important but was not the only modulation factor in l-arginine-regulated neonatal T-cell proliferation. l-Arginine-mediated neonatal lymphocyte proliferation could not be blocked by interleukin-2 receptor blocking antibodies. These results suggest that the altered arginase/l-arginine cascade may be one of the mechanisms that contribute to altered neonatal immune responses. Exogenous l-arginine could enhance neonate lymphocyte proliferation through an interleukin-2-independent pathway.

AB  - Microglia in the central nervous system are usually maintained in a quiescent state. When activated, they can perform many diverse functions which may be either beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. Although microglial activation may be accompanied by changes in morphology, morphological changes cannot accurately predict the function being undertaken by a microglial cell. Studies of peripheral macrophages and in vitro and animal studies of microglia have resulted in the definition of specific activation states: M1 (classical activation) and M2 (sometimes subdivided into alternative activation and acquired deactivation). Some authors have suggested that these might be an overlapping continuum of functions rather than discrete categories. In this review, we consider translational aspects of our knowledge of microglia: specifically, we discuss the question as to what extent different activation states of microglia exist in the human central nervous system, which tools can be used to identify them and emerging evidence for such changes in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Macrophages are central to the inflammatory response and its ability to resolve effectively. They are complex cells that adopt a range of subtypes depending on the tissue type and stimulus that they find themselves under. This flexibility allows them to play multiple, sometimes opposing, roles in inflammation and tissue repair. Their central role in the inflammatory process is reflected in macrophage dysfunction being implicated in chronic inflammation and poorly healing wounds. In this study, we discuss recent attempts to model mathematically and computationally the macrophage and how it partakes in the complex processes of inflammation and tissue repair. There are increasing data describing the variety of macrophage phenotypes and their underlying transcriptional programs. Dynamic mathematical and computational models are an ideal way to test biological hypotheses against experimental data and could aid in understanding this multi-functional cell and its potential role as an attractive therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions and tissue repair.

AB  - Abstract Problem Asherman's syndrome (AS) is characterized by endometrial fibrosis leading to intrauterine adhesions and symptoms like hypomenorrhea, infertility, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Macrophages are key regulators of inflammation, tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. However, the role of macrophages in AS remains unclear. Method of study Endometrial biopsies of AS patients and controls were collected during the late proliferating phase of menstrual cycle. Fibrosis and proliferation markers were detected by Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry. Macrophages were examined by immunostaining and flow cytometry. The expression levels of CCL2, CSF1, CSF1R, and GM-CSF were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. A well-differentiated endometrial cell line Ishikawa (IK) was used for in vitro studies. Macrophages differentiating from THP-1 monocytic cells were polarized by IL-4/IL-13. Their culture supernatants (M(IL-4/13)-S) were applied to H2O2 or bleomycin-damaged IK cells. Results In AS patients, endometrial stroma was replaced by fibrous tissue and cell proliferation was reduced. Macrophages in endometrial tissue were mainly alternative activated macrophages and their number was significantly decreased in AS patients. The CSF1 expression level was reduced in AS patients. M(IL-4/13)-S promoted the growth and migration of IK cells and inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis. M(IL-4/13)-S protected IK cells from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Conclusion Macrophages are critical cells involved in the process of endometrial repair and fibrosis. The decreased amount of endometrial macrophages may be attributed to the reduced expression level of CSF1. Manipulation of macrophage activation/function may provide a novel therapeutic target for AS.

AB  - Objective Inflammation is a well-known consequence of surgery. Although surgical debulking of tumor is beneficial to patients, the onset of inflammation in injured tissue may impede the success of adjuvant therapies. One marker for postoperative inflammation is IL-6, which is released as a consequence of surgical injuries. IL-6 is predictive of response to many cancer therapies, and it is linked to various molecular and cellular resistance mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to establish a murine model by which therapeutic responses to photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be studied in the context of surgical inflammation. Materials and Methods Murine models with AB12 mesothelioma tumors were treated with either surgical resection or sham surgery with tumor incision but no resection. The timing and extent of IL-6 release in the tumor and/or serum was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared to that measured in the serum of 27 consecutive, prospectively enrolled patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who underwent macroscopic complete resection (MCR). Results MPM patients showed a significant increase in IL-6 at the time MCR was completed. Similarly, IL-6 increased in the tumor and serum of mice treated with surgical resections. However, investigations that combine resection with another therapy make it necessary to grow tumors for resection to a larger volume than those that receive secondary therapy alone. As the larger size may alter tumor biology independent of the effects of surgical injury, we assessed the tumor incision model. In this model, tumor levels of IL-6 significantly increased after tumor incision. Conclusion The tumor incision model induces IL-6 release as is seen in the surgical setting, yet it avoids the limitations of surgical resection models. Potential mechanisms by which surgical induction of inflammation and IL-6 could alter the nature and efficacy of tumor response to PDT are reviewed. These include a wide spectrum of molecular and cellular mechanisms through which surgically-induced IL-6 could change the effectiveness of therapies that are combined with surgery. The tumor incision model can be employed for novel investigations of the effects of surgically-induced, acute inflammation on therapeutic response to PDT (or potentially other therapies).

EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Use of the physiological mechanisms promoting midbrain DA (mDA) neuron survival seems an appropriate option for developing treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). mDA neurons are specifically marked by expression of the transcription factors Nurr1 and Foxa2. We show herein that Nurr1 and Foxa2 interact to protect mDA neurons against various toxic insults, but their expression is lost during aging and degenerative processes. In addition to their proposed cell-autonomous actions in mDA neurons, forced expression of these factors in neighboring glia synergistically protects degenerating mDA neurons in a paracrine mode. As a consequence of these bimodal actions, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery of Nurr1 and Foxa2 in a PD mouse model markedly protected mDA neurons and motor behaviors associated with nigrostriatal DA neurotransmission. The effects of the combined gene delivery were dramatic, highly reproducible, and sustained for at least 1 year, suggesting that expression of these factors is a promising approach in PD therapy.
