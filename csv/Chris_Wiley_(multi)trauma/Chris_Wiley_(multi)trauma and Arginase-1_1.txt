AB  - Summary:? The interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts is regulated by reciprocal survival strategies, including competition for essential nutrients. Though paradoxical, mammalian hosts have learned to take advantage of amino acid catabolism for controlling pathogen invasion and, at the same time, regulating their own immune responses. In this way, ancient catabolic enzymes have acquired novel functions and evolved into new structures with highly specialized functions, which go beyond the struggle for survival. In this review, we analyze the evidence supporting a critical role for the metabolism of various amino acids in regulating different steps of both innate and adaptive immunity.

AB  - Background: Various inflammatory mediators have been identified as potential contributors to complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1), but these mediators do not entirely explain certain manifestations of the syndrome, such as pain. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of amino acids in the pathogenesis of CRPS1. Methods: We used HPLC to determine plasma concentrations of 16 amino acids, especially those related to the NMDA receptor (e.g., glutamate and glycine) and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (e.g., arginine and citrulline) in patients with CRPS1 (n=64) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=51). Patients rated pain intensity (visual analog scale) and the subjective experience of pain intensity (McGill Pain Questionnaire). Psychological dysfunction was assessed using the SCL-90. Results: Relative to controls, in CRPS1 patients, plasma levels of glutamate, arginine, taurine, and glycine were increased, and plasma levels of glutamine and the ratio of citrulline to arginine were decreased. Remarkably, in CRPS1 patients there was a highly significant inverse correlation between glutamine and glutamate, although the sum of molar concentrations of glutamate and glutamine remains unchanged. Subjective measures of pain and indicators of psychoneuroticism and emotional instability did not correlate with amino acid levels. Conclusion: This study shows for the first time a pronounced increase in amino acid levels in this chronic pain syndrome. The marked differences in glutamate, glutamine, glycine, taurine and arginine levels between patients and controls suggest the involvement of both the NDMA receptor and the endothelium-dependent arginine-NO system in CRPS1.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic osteolytic disease that shares pathogenic inflammatory features with other conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation. A hallmark of PD is inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. Myeloid cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages (Mac), are essential players in PD by control of gingival biofilm pathogenicity, activation of adaptive immunity, as well as nonresolving inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Despite mounting evidence of significant innate immune implications to PD progression and healing after therapy, myeloid cell markers and targets for immune modulation have not been validated for clinical use. The remarkable plasticity of monocytes/Mac in response to local activation factors enables these cells to play central roles in inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis and provides opportunities for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery for management of chronic inflammatory conditions, including osteolytic diseases such as PD and arthritis. Along a wide spectrum of activation states ranging from proinflammatory to pro-resolving, Macs respond to environmental changes in a site-specific manner in virtually all tissues. This review summarizes the existing evidence on Mac immunomodulation therapies for osteolytic diseases in the broader context of conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation, and discusses osteoimmune implications of Macs in PD.

AB  - Laser therapy has been considered useful for the treatment of chronic wounds. Different research groups have been working with fibroblastic metabolism, after culture irradiation with red and infrared sources of laser. Previously it has been demonstrated that lasers stimulate collagen synthesis and [3H]tymidine uptake when fibroblasts are irradiated and grown in the presence of fetal bovine serum (5?10%). Our group has been evaluating the in vitro effects of low-level laser (??=?650?nm) activity on fibroblast metabolism. In this work, fibroblast activity was evaluated after 24, 48, and 72?h from G0 using synchronized fibroblast cultures previously irradiated with a single dose of low-level laser at different power densities (3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30?mW/cm2), during different times of exposure (15, 30, 60, and 120?sec). Proliferation was measured by [3H]tymidine uptake, and ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 were evaluated by ELISA. Significant changes in proliferation were only observed after 48?h when 'cultures were irradiated during 30?sec with 3.75, 7.5, and 15?mW/cm2, or during 60 seconds at 15?mW/cm2. However, ProMMP-1 diminished significantly after 24 and 48?h when cultures were irradiated with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 30 and 60?sec, and with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 15 seconds, after 48?h. TIMP-1 expression was significantly lower than the control during each dose and they were assayed 24?h after each irradiation. Based on the above data, fibroblast proliferation is stimulated 48?h after irradiation, using low-level laser to incorporate cells from G0 to the cell cycle, almost in the absence of serum (1%), although ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 responses were observed 24?h after irradiation with the same doses. These results indicate that low-level laser can stimulate normal human fibroblasts to reduce collagen turnover, and consequently can be useful to stimulate normal fibroblast activity in a wound. As a result, this therapy could be administered every 2 days and may be more effective.

AB  - Abstract Oligodendroglial cell death and demyelination are hallmarks of neurotrauma and multiple sclerosis that cause axonal damage and functional impairments. Remyelination remains a challenge as the ability of endogenous precursor cells for oligodendrocyte replacement is hindered in the unfavorable milieu of demyelinating conditions. Here, in a rat model of lysolecithin lysophosphatidyl-choline (LPC)-induced focal demyelination, we report that Neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1), an important factor for oligodendrocytes and myelination, is dysregulated in demyelinating lesions and its bio-availability can promote oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. We delivered recombinant human Nrg-1?1 (rhNrg-1?1) intraspinally in the vicinity of LPC demyelinating lesion in a sustained manner using poly lactic-co-glycolic acid microcarriers. Availability of Nrg-1 promoted generation and maturation of new oligodendrocytes, and accelerated endogenous remyelination by both oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell populations in demyelinating foci. Importantly, Nrg-1 enhanced myelin thickness in newly remyelinated spinal cord axons. Our complementary in vitro studies also provided direct evidence that Nrg-1 significantly promotes maturation of new oligodendrocytes and facilitates their transition to a myelinating phenotype. Nrg-1 therapy remarkably attenuated the upregulated expression chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) specific glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix of demyelinating foci and promoted interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by immune cells. CSPGs and IL-10 are known to negatively and positively regulate remyelination, respectively. We found that Nrg-1 effects are mediated through ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptor activation. Our work provides novel evidence that dysregulated levels of Nrg-1 in demyelinating lesions of the spinal cord pose a challenge to endogenous remyelination, and appear to be an underlying cause of myelin thinning in newly remyelinated axons.

AB  - Abstract Following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), further mild impacts can exacerbate negative outcomes. To compare chronic damage and deficits following increasing numbers of repeated mTBIs, a closed-head weight-drop model of repeated mTBI was used to deliver 1, 2 or 3 mTBIs to adult female rats at 24 h intervals. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months following the first mTBI. No gross motor, sensory or reflex deficits were identified (p > 0.05), consistent with current literature. Cognitive function assessed using a Morris water maze revealed chronic memory deficits following 1 and 2, but not 3 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05). Oxidative damage to DNA was assessed immunohistochemically in the dentate hilus of the hippocampus and splenium of the corpus callosum; no changes were observed. IBA1-positive microglia were increased in size in the cortex following 1 mTBI and in the corpus callosum following 2 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05); no changes were observed in the dentate hilus. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocyte immunoreactivity was assessed in all three brain regions and no chronic changes were observed. Integrity of myelin ultrastructure in the corpus callosum was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. G ratio was decreased following 2 mTBIs compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05) at post hoc level only. The changing patterns of damage and deficits following increasing numbers of mTBI may reflect dynamic responses to small numbers of mTBIs or a conditioning effect such that increasing numbers of mTBIs do not necessarily result in worsening pathology.

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - Abstract There are increasing reports of using bone marrow-derived stem cells to treat advanced liver disease. We consider several critical issues that underlie this approach. For example, are there multipotent stem cell populations in human adult bone marrow? Can they develop into liver cells or supporting cell types? What are stromal stem/progenitor cells, and can they promote tissue repair without replacing hepatocytes? Does reversal of end-stage liver disease require new hepatocytes, a new liver microenvironment, both, neither or something else? Although many of these questions are unanswered, we consider the conceptual and experimental bases underlying these issues and critically analyze results of clinical trials of stem cell therapy of end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response and immune reactions. In the central nervous system (CNS), IL-10 is mainly produced by astrocytes and microglia and it is upregulated after various insults, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, middle cerebral artery occlusion, excitotoxicity and traumatic brain injury. To better understand the effects of IL-10 in the normal and injured CNS, we generated transgenic mice (termed GFAP-IL-10Tg) that expressed the murine IL-10 gene under the transcriptional control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. Previous studies demonstrated marked changes in the microglial phenotype in these mice under basal conditions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of local astrocyte-targeted IL-10 production on glial activation, neuronal degeneration and leukocyte recruitment after axotomy. GFAP-IL-10Tg mice had marked changes in the phenotype of activated microglial cells, as well as in the number of microglial clusters and in microglial cell density. These microglial changes are accompanied by a twofold increase in lymphocyte infiltration in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice and around twofold decrease in neuronal cell death at 21 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggested that astrocyte-targeted production of IL-10 impacted the microglial response and lymphocyte recruitment and culminated in a beneficial effect on neuronal survival.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)
