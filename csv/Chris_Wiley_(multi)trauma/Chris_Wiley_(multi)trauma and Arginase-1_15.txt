AB  - Previous studies have shown that cyclic mechanical stretching exerts anti-inflammatory effects on rabbit chondrocytes. But whether mechanical stretching has similar effects on human tendon fibroblasts are not known. This study therefore aimed to test the hypothesis that cyclic mechanical stretching regulates IL-1? induced COX-2 gene expression in a stretching magnitude-dependent manner. In custom-made silicone dishes, human patellar tendon fibroblasts (HPTFs) were grown on microgrooved culture surfaces, with which the shape and organization of HPTFs in vivo were closely mimicked. To induce inflammatory responses in HPTFs, 10?pM of IL-1? was added to the culture medium. A 4% or 8% cyclic uniaxial stretching was then applied to silicone dishes for 4?hrs using a custom-design stretching apparatus. After the end of stretching, total RNA of stretched and nonstretched tendon fibroblasts was collected, and RT-PCR was performed for measuring COX-2?mRNA expression levels. We found that tendon fibroblasts subjected to 4% stretching decreased COX-2?mRNA expression level by 20%(p?=?0.0002; n?=?6) compared to that of nonstretched, IL-1?-treated cells. However, cells subjected to 8% stretching showed a 39% increase (p?=?0.007, n?=?6) in COX-2?mRNA expression. Thus, the results of this study suggest that small stretching (4%) has anti-inflammatory effects on HPTFs in a mildly inflammatory environment such as that induced by 10?pM of IL-1?. In contrast, large stretching (8%) may amplify inflammatory responses of tendon fibroblasts. Therefore, physical therapy with low levels of tendon stretching may be beneficial in reducing mild tendon inflammation. Supported by the Arthritis Investigator Award and NIHAR049921 (JHW)

AB  - Tissue repair and wound healing are complex processes that involve inflammation, granulation, and tissue remodeling. Angiogenesis plays a central role in wound healing. Previously, we have shown that picroliv, a natural product obtained from the roots of Picrorhiza kurrooa upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and insulin like growth factor (IGF) in rats during hypoxia (Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 1999; 56: 348?55). In the present study, we have investigated the effect of Picroliv in an ex vivo rat aorta ring model of angiogenesis. Picroliv enhanced the sprouting and migration of endothelial cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of picroliv in both unimpaired and dexamethasone (DX)-induced impaired cutaneous healing in a full thickness punch wound model in rats. The animals in the impaired healing group having been pretreated with DX. We studied the tissues by histology and morphometry. The data showed picroliv treatment resulted in improved reepithelialization, neovascularization, and migration of various cells such as endothelial, dermal myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts into the wound bed. Immunohistochemical localization showed an increased VEGF and alpha smooth muscle actin staining consistent with increased number of micro vessels in granulation tissue. These findings suggest that picroliv accelerated wound repair and thus could be developed as a therapeutic angiogenic agent for the wound healing.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars can be reduced by application of silicone dressing; however, the detailed mechanism of silicone action is still unknown. It is known that silicone gel sheets cause a hydration of the epidermal layer of the skin. An in vitro coculture experiment has shown that hydration of keratinocytes has a suppressive effect on the metabolism of the underlying fibroblasts resulting in reduced collagen deposition. We tested the hypothesis that silicone gel sheeting in vivo has a beneficial effect on scar reduction by a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation, with a resulting reduction in dermal thickness. Silicone adhesive gel sheets were applied to scars in our rabbit ear model of hypertrophic scarring 14 days post wounding for a total of 14 days. Scarring was measured in this model by the Scar Elevation Index (SEI), a ratio of the scar height over normal skin, and the Epidermal Thickness Index (ETI), a ratio of the epidermal height of the scar over normal epidermis. Ultrastructural changes were investigated using electron microscopy (EM). SEIs were significantly reduced after only 2-week applications of silicone gel sheets versus untreated scars (1.18?±?0.05 vs. 1.45?±?0.09, respectively; P?<?0.05)? corresponding to a 48.8% reduction of scar hypertrophy. The epidermal layer in scars was in general thicker than in unwounded skin. However, ETIs of untreated scars increased by 103% versus 71% after silicone gel treatment ? corresponding to a significant reduction of epidermal thickness by 24.4%. EM showed a basal layer in untreated scars that was very different than normal skin with many vacuoles at the basement membrane level, while silicone gel-treated scars had a basal cell layer which resembled unwounded epidermis. Our findings demonstrate that 2 weeks of silicone gel application at a very early onset of scarring reduces dermal thickness which appears to be due to a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation. These findings are consistent with our coculture results.

AB  - Fibroblasts from a healing ligament likely have differential phenotypical expression from those in an intact ligament, because fibroblasts at the healing site need to repair/regenerate the wounded matrix around them caused by injury, whereas normal fibroblasts just maintain an intact matrix. This study was designed to determine the differences in proliferation, collagen production, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, and contraction between healing and normal fibroblasts. Transected and sham-operated rat medial collateral ligaments (MCL) were used to obtain healing and normal fibroblasts, respectively. It was noted that healing and normal MCL fibroblasts in culture were seen to have a similar morphology. However, healing fibroblasts in monolayer culture proliferated 1.4-fold faster at 48 hours and had 1.7-fold greater protein expression of α-SMA than normal fibroblasts. In addition, it was noted that the proliferation of healing fibroblasts in collagen gels was not significantly different from that of normal fibroblasts at 24 hours, but it was at 48 hours. Furthermore, in collagen gels, healing fibroblasts produced 10% more type I collagen than normal fibroblasts and generated 1.6- and 1.7-fold larger contractile forces at 15 and 20 hours, respectively, than their normal counterparts. Taken together, the results of this study show that healing fibroblasts possess a differential proliferation, α-SMA protein expression, and contraction than normal fibroblasts. This study also highlights the importance of using healing fibroblasts to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ligament healing.

AB  - Electrospinning is a nonmechanical processing strategy that is used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of submicron diameter, banded fibrils of collagen. Fiber diameter and porosity can be manipulated over a wide range simply by regulating the concentration of collagen present in the starting electrospinning solutions (Table). Collagen Concentration Fiber Diameter Pore Area 40?mg/ml TFE 113?±?51?nm 184?±?87.6?nm2 60?mg/ml TFE 302?±?74?nm 1,598?±?1,272?nm2 80?mg/ml TFE 909?±?272?nm 4,420?±?3,193?nm2 100?mg/ml TFE 1,389?±?446?nm 10,950?±?9,758?nm2 120?mg/ml TFE 1,533?±?448?nm 24,032?±?32,581?nm2 To examine how fiber diameter regulates microvascular endothelial cell migration/infiltration into a tissue engineering scaffold of electrospun collagen, we conducted in vitro migration assays. Electrospun scaffolds were prepared, cut into disks (150?300 microns thick), seeded with human microvascular endothelial cells and recovered at intervals. Varying fiber diameter from 100 to 2000?nm induced the expression of three distinct phenotypes. Scaffolds composed of fibers less than 300?nm in diameter exhibited a confluent layer of flat, stellate-shaped cells at all time points. The bulk of the cells were confined to the scaffold surface. At intermediate fiber diameters (300?nm?900?nm) the cells displayed a more rounded cell shape. By day 3 aggregates of these cells were clustered throughout scaffold in a capillary-like pattern. In scaffolds prepared with large diameter fibers (>1000?nm) the cells displayed an elongated, fusiform cell-shape and appeared to be uniformly scattered throughout the scaffold. These results parallel our in vivo studies that suggest fiber diameters of less than 300?nm reduce, but do not completely suppress, the infiltration of endothelial cells in a full thickness dermal injury model in the guinea pig.

AB  - The Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) system has been characterized as the principal tissue level response to hypoxia. Posttranslational regulation of HIF-1alpha has been reported to act though a Hypoxia Responsive Element (HRE) promoter region on a range of hypoxia-induced genes. A plasmid was constructed consisting of a fivefold HRE repeat conjugated to a luciferase gene, used as a marker for HRE activation. Plasmid HRE-luciferase was then transfected into a well-established ischemic rabbit ear wound healing model. Ischemia was induced using a variety of published models for interruption of arterial inflow and compared with a nonischemic control. Central artery, caudal artery and rostrocaudal artery models were tested for induction of ischemia. Tissue specimens were harvested from the transfected areas and solubilized. Luminescence of each specimen was measured using a standard luminometer to quantify luciferase induction. To provide correlation on a regional level, tissue level oxygen tension was measured directly for each wound model. Profound and statistically significant differences were found in the induced luciferase production. Marked differences in the tissue hypoxia between the various ischemic wound healing models correlated in graded fashion with the ischemia induced on an anatomic basis. The least ischemic model showed no significant difference in hypoxia readings versus control. The intermediate model showed a significant fourfold greater ischemia signaling. The most ischemic model showed a highly significant 72-fold greater ischemic response compared to controls. The use of gene transfection is described as a sensitive and effective method for quantification of tissue hypoxia at a cellular level in ischemic wounds. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Tissue ischemia is a common occurrence in many disease processes including chronic wounds, stroke, solid tumors, and myocardial infarction. The application of gene delivery for healing of wounds has demonstrated increasing therapeutic promises in animal models. Adenoviral vectors have been successfully used for gene delivery to the ischemic wound. However, these vectors typically demonstrate short, transient transgene expression while eliciting significant cytotoxic immune response. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) do not have those limitations; however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. The goal of this study was to compare AAV vector with adenoviral vector in terms of relative efficiency of gene delivery and cytotoxic immune response in ischemic wounds. Reporter constructs Ad5-LacZ and AAV-LacZ (108?pfu/wound) were injected onto the dermis of rabbit ear prior to creation of ischemic wounds. Wounds were harvested at postoperative day 10. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with an in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed with both vectors; however, transduction rates with AAV vector was approximately 10-fold lower than Adenovirus. Unlike Adenovirus, no noticeable inflammatory cell infiltration was observed with AAV injection. Even when the dosage of AAV was increased to 109?pfu/wound inflammatory cell infiltration remained negligible. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and adenoviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in ischemic tissues. The particular advantage of AAV is the ability to transfect with higher doses while at lower dose maximal transfection rate seems to be more with Adenovirus.

AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. In vitro cell culture bioactivity experiments are planned. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated.

AB  - Wound repair is described as a delicately balanced and well-orchestrated progression of events, which ultimately results in healing in the majority of acute cases. However, time taken to complete healing can vary greatly between patients and any alteration in this physiological process could delay healing further. Thus, a wound treatment, which facilitates healing independent of wound type and in patients where healing is compromised or impeded, would be extremely advantageous. Previous studies suggest a beneficial role for biomaterials such as collagen/ORC in modifying the chronic wound environment; however, their effect on the acute wound environment is unknown. While it is generally accepted that acute wounds heal at an optimum rate due to a positive wound environment, we wanted to determine if current advanced wound healing treatments could augment or impact this healing rate. In this study we evaluated the effect of advanced wound therapies in the presence of acute wound fluid on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. We hypothesize that an enhanced effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid may be indicative of a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute wounds. Results demonstrate that of the wound treatments tested only collagen/ORC containing therapies exhibited a positive effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid. We conclude, therefore, that collagen/ORC biomaterials, already shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wounds, may also be a valuable therapy in the treatment of acute wounds.

AB  - Introduction:? There is growing clinical evidence that moist wounds show improved wound healing in terms of less scar tissue formation and better cosmesis. Increased levels of wound fluid improve migration of keratinocytes along the wound surface. Occlusive dressings provide such a hydrated wound environment. However, the underlying mechanisms on how occluded wounds exert the clinical observed effect are yet barely understood. We hypothesized, that keratinocytes play a keyrole in hydrated wounds by sending cytokine signals to upper epidermal layers and even more important to the dermis. We therefore focused on connexins, intercellular channels that are strongly involved in cell-cell communication, hemostasis, and small molecule exchange. Methods:? Full thickness incisions to the panniculus carnosus were made on female Fisher rats. Both incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 5-0 polypropylene suture. One incision on each rat was randomly covered with an occlusive dressing until harvest. Wounds were harvested on PODs 3, 7, and 10. RNA was selectively extracted from both the epidermis and dermis. Histo'logy slides were preliminary evaluated by using a 0?4 scale rating cellularity count in the epithelium, subepithelium, and peripanniculous as well as epithelial thickness. Results:? Cellularity count was significantly reduced in the epithelial and subepithelial compartment of occluded wounds as well as the epithelial thickness in occluded wounds (p?<?0,05). QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of Cx30-mRNA on POD10 in occluded wounds versus nonoccluded wounds. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that occlusion promotes epithelialization and maturation of incisional wounds most likely through hydration. Up-regulation of Connexin30 on POD10 supports that thesis, as it suggests an advanced communication process in keratinocytes in occluded wounds.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - Background:? Activation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been linked to dermal wound healing in fetal and adult tissue. Activation of this pathway has been previously linked to interleukin (IL)-1? expression. This study addresses the mechanism by which IL-1? regulates both production of and response to PGE2 in cultured human fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts. Hypothesis:? IL-1? regulates fetal and adult dermal fibroblast PGE2 signaling. Methods:? Fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts were isolated from human skin explants. Secretion of soluble mediators was assayed using ELISA kits. Expression of COX-2 as well as the various PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4) was analyzed at both the mRNA and protein levels. Results:? Compared to adult fibroblasts, fetal fibroblasts produced decreased levels of IL-6 and IL-8, but similar levels of PGE2. IL-1?1 caused up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in both fetal and adult fibroblasts. However, administration of IL-1?, tumor necrosis factor-α or interferon-? did not significantly alter the mRNA or protein levels of any PGE2 receptor subtype. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results. IL-1? causes up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts, but does not alter the expression of PGE2 receptors. Therefore, proinflammatory mediator-induced changes in both fetal and adult skin fibroblasts appear to act through increased production of the signal molecules and not through increased or altered receptor expression for PGE2. This finding raises the possibility of increased autocrine signaling in the context of dermal inflammation, such as that associated with a wound healing response. Acknowledgments:? The authors would like to thank Children?s Hospital of Pittsburgh for providing funding for this research.

AB  - Permeability of the endothelium occurs early in the angiogenic process, resulting from the initial loss or disruption of endothelial cell-cell adhesions, which is followed by endothelial cell contraction, forming paracellular gaps. We are interested in the angiogenesis and endothelial permeability induced by inflammation; thus, we have chosen to study mechanisms involved in the endothelial permeability stimulated by the angiogenic chemokine Interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8). We have found that IL-8 induces permeability in a receptor-dependent process requiring the activation of Gαi and the regulation of PKA activity. Pertussis toxin abolishes the effect of IL-8 on endothelial permeability, while a PKA inhibitor, H89, results in a similar effect. Thus, regulation of the level of PKA activity appears critical in IL-8-induced permeability, potentially due to the differential regulation of molecules downstream of PKA, such as SREBP and RhoA. PKA and cAMP are thought to inhibit the activation of SREBP, a protein involved in lipid metabolism; we have also found, using inhibitors of SREBP that this molecule is likewise necessary for the permeability stimulated by IL-8. Furthermore, SREBP inhibitors block IL-8-induced activation of RhoA, a GTPase that has been implicated in permeability induced by multiple factors. Taken together, our results indicate a possible signal transduction pathway downstream of the IL-8 receptors, in which the inhibition of cAMP production, and, thus, of PKA activation, by Gαi increases SREBP activity, resulting in increased RhoA activity, leading to endothelial cell contraction and gap formation, increasing endothelial permeability. Because IL-8 plays important roles in the permeability observed in inflammatory disorders, knowledge of the signaling mechanisms induced by this chemokine during permeability increases may be used to identify targets for drug development.

AB  - Cellular interaction with biomaterials determines the fate of the implant. Naturally derived biomaterials such as small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and renal capsule matrix (RCM) may provide optimal structure and composition for cellular repopulation in certain wound healing applications. Porcine renal capsule matrix (RCM) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix undergoing characterization and preclinical investigation for the treatment of soft tissue injury. Early studies have demonstrated that RCM constructs induce host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. RCM consists primarily of collagen, although the other proteins have been detected, including the growth factors basic FGF, VEGF, and CTGF. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to envision the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that RCM is a dense, heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse following lyophilization, much of the native structure seen in the hydrated isolate is preserved. These differences are maintained following rehydration in normal saline. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture likely facilitates host interaction at the cellular level. Further compositional characterization is under way. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated, West Lafayette, IN.

AB  - Fibroblasts in chronic wounds, and in skin in which ulcers develop, have been reported to show characteristics of senescence, presumably induced by conditions predisposing to chronic wounds or the wound environment. In monolayer culture, secretion of IL-8 declines to zero as the cells approach senescence (at about generations 50?55 in the cells tested). In three-dimensional scaffold-based tissue culture, fibroblasts, at about 30?35 population doublings, upregulate the IL-8 gene by comparison with monolayer cultures and secrete large amounts of IL-8 (30?50?ng/106 cells/day). However, it is inferred that a decline in secretion, similar to that seen in monolayer also occurs in three-dimensional culture and in the senescent fibroblasts of chronic wounds. This will result in decreased influx and activation of neutrophils. The hypothesis is proposed that chronic wounds arise because fibroblasts, following injury to ulcer-prone skin, do not recruit and activate neutrophils sufficiently to prevent bacterial colonization. As the result of the persistent presence of live bacteria, inflammatory cells or keratinocytes in a wound site may be expected to trigger mechanisms to inhibit keratinocyte migration and reepithelialization, leading to chronic ulceration.

AB  - Delayed healing can result for a number of reasons; however, one important factor in the wound healing process is the role of bacteria. An imbalance in the wound bioburden may lead to infection, and thereby severely delay healing. Thus to ensure healing progresses in a timely manner, it is necessary to maintain a healthy microbial balance and prevent any impending infection. Dermal cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes generate numerous chemokines and growth factors that regulate the immune response and the phases of healing. While topical antiseptics and antimicrobials can kill bacteria and are therefore used to help manage infection in wounds, they may also be cytotoxic to these important cell types. Cytotoxicity is acceptable when overt clinical infection is present, due to a greater need for bacterial balance. However, clinical signs of infection in chronic wounds may not be present, making it difficult to correctly determine diagnosis and appropriate use of these antimicrobial products. In these cases, a product which addresses both the antibacterial action of topical antiseptics/antimicrobials and their impact on key healing factors, (i.e., cytotoxicity to host cells), could help reduce the incidence of wound infection without impacting the rate of healing. In this study we investigated the effect of silver-ORC and an ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. The antimicrobial properties of the dressing was also investigated, in in vitro studies using common bacterial wound pathogens. While other silver-releasing dressings address the bioburden of nonhealing wounds, their in vitro cytotoxicity suggests that the rate of healing may not be optimal if the presence of infection is questionable. In contrast this in vitro work suggests the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC is not cytotoxic, but is still capable of controlling wound pathogens, suggesting it may be used on a broad spectrum of wounds independent of their bacterial bioburden.

AB  - Despite the use of antibiotics, antiseptics, and improved sterile techniques, infection remains one of the most frequent complications of wound healing. Infection must be avoided to permit proper wound healing. Systemic and topical antibiotics and antiseptics with broad antimicrobial spectra have been used. Antiseptics have not generally been reported to develop bacterial resistance like antibiotics. Several reports have suggested that antiseptics exhibit significant cytotoxicity toward wound bed cells and may interfere with the normal wound healing process. Thus, for chronic ulcers, the standard of care is debridment and moist dressing with saline. We will describe the properties of a new topical antimicrobial solution, NVC-101. These include its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against gram positive, gram negative bacteria, yeast and fungi pathogens, and its lower toxicity as compared to commonly used topical antiseptics. In addition, we will describe the in vivo safety profile of NVC-101 in the rabbit eye and guinea pig sensitization models, as well as 28-day application to full thickness wounds in rats and mini-pigs. Based on these findings, multicenter Phase II clinical trials on infected chronic ulcers are under way.

AB  - The goal of this study was to specifically estimate the effectiveness of Becaplermin, which is recombinant human platelet derived growth factor (rhPDGF). This was the first FDA-approved growth factor therapy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer (DNFU). The previously published pivotal trials have shown that those who used rhPDGF were about 35%(i.e., a relative risk (RR) of about 1.35) more likely to heal by the 20th week of care. In our study treatment effectiveness was estimated in a retrospective cohort study, controlling for treatment selection bias using propensity scores derived from logistic regression. The cohort that we studied were patients with a DNFU treated at a Curative Health Services-affiliated wound care center between 1998?2004. We noted 25,098 individuals with a DNFU and overall about 10% received rhPDGF. We were able to successfully create a propensity score model such that the distributions of patient age and gender, wound duration, wound area, wound grade, treating center, and wound location were evenly balanced between those who received rhPDGF and those who did not. The RR for a wound to heal after treatment with rhPDGF as compared to standard care after 20 weeks of care at a wound care center was 1.33 (1.28, 1.38). With respect to amputation, the RR for having an amputation after receiving rhPDGF was 0.86 (0.77, 0.97). In conclusion, rhPDGF is more effective than standard therapy in both helping a wound to heal and preventing amputation. The effectiveness of rhPDGF with respect to getting a wound to heal is similar ?in this real-world setting? as the efficacy estimates from the previously published randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - To investigate changes in the mechanical properties of skin with injury, tissue was evaluated 70 days following full thickness wounding in juvenile female Yorkshire pigs (N?=?14). Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions, for both scar tissue and uninjured skin. The samples were evaluated mechanically in vitro using a protocol of stress relaxation followed by tensile failure, in an INSTRON universal test machine. Specimens were subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period, after which they were returned to the original length and failed in tension. Axial normal skin exhibited a smaller force at 10% elongation (?58%, p?=?0.002), and higher failure load (p?=?0.027) and displacement (p?=?0.028) than transverse. Scarring reduced the failure strength on average by 60% in the axial and 65% in the transverse directions (p?<?0.001), with large decreases (>50%) in displacement at failure in both directions (p?<?0.001). Elongation of 10% produced a larger force in axial scars (p?<?0.001) than their normal counterparts, indicating a reduction in small-displacement compliance. Axial scars exhibited greater failure strength (p?=?0.009) than transverse scars, yet no significant differences were observed in elongation to failure or load at 10% elongation. These results indicate that normal skin exhibits higher compliance and failure strength in the axial direction. Following injury, the strength and compliance of the tissue are greatly reduced, and the strong compliance directionality originally observed, is lost. Therefore it appears that the healing response leads to increases in tissue stiffness, such that small displacements result in larger tissue loads. This is further complicated by the reduced ability of the scar to resist failure. Taken together, these findings illustrate the compounding negative effects of scar on tissue integrity and function.
