AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Management of surgical defects following excisional and Mohs micrographic surgery for malignant skin lesions consists of autografting, skin flaps, primary closure, and healing by secondary intention. A fully differentiated bilayered cell-based therapy (BLCT/Apligraf), expresses multiple growth factors, provides a biologically active matrix, and appears to be immunologically inert. BLCT is FDA approved for venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. BLCT is effective in hard-to-heal venous ulcers and, in diabetic foot ulcers, it is significantly associated with less amputations and osteomyelitis. A previous open-label trial showed BLCT to be safe and effective in surgical excision wounds. However, we have been interested in rigorously identifying differences in chronic compared to acute wounds when using BLCT or other skin substitutes. In this report of a multicenter randomized study, we enrolled and treated 181 patients eligible for secondary intention healing after Mohs or excisional surgery for skin cancer, with 172 completing the study. Face wounds were excluded. In total, 84 patients were treated with BLCT and 88 with dressings alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was the quality of the healed wound using the Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment Scale (VBSAS). Pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and scar heights were assessed by the investigator and an independent observer as 0 (no scar) to 15 (worst scar). Scores of?≤?4 were assigned to 57 (65%) of BLCT-treated patients by both the investigator and observer, and to 60 (65%) and 54 (58%) of control patients according to the investigator and observer, respectively. There was no difference in healing time, and no severe adverse events or rapid cancer recurrence were observed in either group. In this randomized controlled trial of full thickness excision wounds after skin cancer removal, BLCT/Apligraf was safe and well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction:? Liposomal gene transfer is an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of several pathophysiologic states. The purpose of the present study was to define whether the biological or chemical structure of a liposome influences cellular and biological regeneration in the skin and to determine by which mechanisms possible changes occur. Methods:? Rats were inflicted a full-excision acute wound and divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of DMRIE liposomes plus the Lac-Z gene, or DOTAP/Chol liposomes plus the Lac Z gene, or saline. Planimetry, immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical 'techniques were used to determine molecular mechanisms after gene transfer, protein expression, dermal, and epidermal regeneration. Results:? DOTAP/Chol increased IGF-I and KGF protein concentration and caused concomitant cellular responses, e.g., by increasing IGFBP-3, p?<?0.05. DOTAP/Chol liposomes improved epidermal regeneration by exhibiting the most rapid area and linear wound reepithelization compared to DMRIE or control, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol and DMRIE exerted promitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on basal keratinocytes, p?<?0.05. Dermal regeneration was improved in DOTAP/Chol treated animals by an increased collagen deposition and morphology, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol liposomes increased VEGF concentrations and thus neovascularization when compared with DMRIE and saline, p?<?0.001. Summary:? In the present study we showed that different liposomes have different effects on intracellular and biological responses based on its chemical and molecular structure. For gene transfer in acute wounds the administration of DOTAP/Chol liposomes appears to be beneficial. Acknowledgments:? Clayton Foundation for Research

AB  - Venous leg ulcers are characterized by chronic inflammation and in consequence high extracellular matrix turnover, avoiding epithelialization. In this work we evaluated maltodextrin/ascorbic acid powder versus standard care for the topical treatment of noninfected venous leg ulcers, smaller than 25?cm2. All patients received daily micronized diosmin/hesperidin and they were recommended an appropriate diet, an exercise program, cleaning of the ulcer, etc., except for compression stocking, since they are not available in the clinic. Both treatments were administered daily during 12 weeks. Clinically, most of the patients were colonized by Staphylococcus aureus; patients who received maltodextrin/ascorbic acid reported less pain than controls and they improved significantly twice and thrice the lesion size in weeks 8 and 12, respectively, when compared with the standard care, (% wound closure: maltodextrin group 78.7?±?21.6 vs. standard care 36.7?±?45.4). In order to know changes in cytokine expression in the wound fluid, ulcers were covered with an impermeable film for 24?h, at the beginning and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and the fluids were tested for IL-1?, TNF-α, IL-10, and PDGF-AB by ELISA. Important changes in wound closure were observed when TNF-α and IL-10 changed, increasing their expression in maltodextrin group, meanwhile those cytokines were diminished in the controls. Finally, histological assessment was performed from the two biopsies taken before and after 8 weeks of treatment to each patient. Type III collagen showed an increase, but type I collagen decreased in the tissues derived from maltodextrin group, opposite to the data obtained from standard care group. In conclusion, maltodextrin/ascorbic acid powder is an important topical treatment for chronic wounds, and it has demonstrated to improve wound closure when it was compared with the standard of care, even without compression.

AB  - Vulnerable populations generally have decreased access to health care, often present with advanced disease processes and experience poorer health outcomes compared to the general population. Here we report on the epidemiology and economics of a vulnerable population with chronic wounds served by an academic medical center that is the tertiary health care provider and referral center for the state of Mississippi. Data are being collected to determine if aggressive management and treatment improves health outcomes. The epidemiology of our population indicates that 48% are over 60 years of age; 45% are between 41?59 years of age; and 7% are under 40 years of age. About 61% are female and almost 39% male. Our vulnerable population is composed of 51.6% African Americans; 6.5% Native Americans; and 3.2% Hispanic Americans; with the remaining population or 38.7% Caucasian. The etiologies of wounds seen are 31% diabetic/neuropathic and 28.5% venous; followed by smaller percentages of surgically treated diabetic and venous wounds. We have found that this population commonly presents with a single wound, but that more than half (>50%) present with two or more wounds. A majority of these individuals (77%) visit the clinic more than two times, with most, or 44% visiting the clinic from two to five times. A smaller percentage, or about 30% visit the clinic six or more times. About 61% are either Medicare or Medicaid, or a combination, while the remainder are covered by private insurance (23%), workman?s compensation (3.2%), or are self-pay (12.9%). Despite this profile, the aggressive integration of a social worker in our clinic results in 35.5% being followed by home health. Thus, we will present data on whether the opening of a specialized treatment center results in better health outcomes in vulnerable populations once individuals receive appropriate referral and treatment.

AB  - We previously showed that Calreticulin (CRT), a chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum, has profound effects on the process of wound healing by increasing both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of impaired porcine and murine repair. In the present study, using the scratch plate assay as an in vitro model of wound repair, we show that CRT (10?6?10?9?M) induces cell migration/wound closure in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts that is equivalent to EGF (positive control). Furthermore, by an MTS proliferation assay, CRT stimulated cellular proliferation of human keratinocytes (2-fold), fibroblasts (100-fold), and vascular endothelial cells (1.2-fold). Markedly increased cellular proliferation was confirmed by anti-ki67 immunostaining (IHC) which was confined to basal keratinocytes in the CRT-(5?mg/ml) treated porcine and murine wounds during reepithelialization and in numerous cells of the granulation tissue. Also, CRT increased dermal depth and granulation tissue formation between days 6?14 following injury (p?<?0.05). The effect of CRT on the dermal layer was qualitatively different than PDGF or PBS as there was a remarkably higher number of dermal cells that reconstituted the CRT-treated pig wounds, a more organized pattern of collagen organization by picrosirrius red staining, and greater fibronectin and TGF-?3 by IHC. CRT also increased tensile strength in a rat incisional wound model (p?<?0.005 @ 21 days). By Mac-138 IHC of porcine wounds, we observed an increase in macrophages in the wound bed compared to PDGF (p?<?0.013). Since the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is a CRT-dependent process, this finding suggests a potential role for CRT as a bacteriocidal and/or debriding agent. Unlike PDGF, CRT positively affects both the epithelial and dermal aspects of repair. Our studies suggest that CRT accelerates and improves the rate and quality of wound repair by affecting many cells involved in the repair process.

AB  - Extended healing time and lack of documented effective treatments of sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease create substantial problems. Locally applied zinc oxide has been reported to promote wound healing. We have compared topical zinc oxide (3%) with placebo meshes for pilonidal wounds healing by secondary intention in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Sixty-four consecutive patients, 53 males, aged between 18 and 60 years (median 26 years) with excised pilonidal wounds were centrally randomized to local zinc oxide (30?mg/g, n?=?33) or to placebo (n?=?31) mesh treatment. Patients were followed with strict recording of beneficial and harmful effects. The median healing times were 54 days (42?71 days, interquartile range, n?=?33) for the zinc group and 62 days (55?82 days, n?=?31) for the placebo group. This difference was not statistically different (p?=?0.32). Based on Cox regression analysis initial wound volume influenced healing negatively (p?=?0.016) while smoking (p?=?0.011) was associated with faster wound healing. Significantly (p?<?0.01) more placebo (n?=?12) than zinc oxide-treated patients (n?=?3) needed antibiotics postoperatively. Although topical zinc oxide increased (p?<?0.001) wound fluid zinc levels (1830?±?405??M, mean?±?SEM) compared with placebo (3.1?±?1.6??M) serum-zinc levels did not differ significantly between the zinc (13.5?±?0.4??M) and placebo (12.8?±?0.4??m) groups on postoperative day 7. No adverse events were recorded. Topical zinc oxide treatment did not accelerate time to closure of open pilonidal wounds but was associated with reduced antibiotic usage.

AB  - It has been known for many years that low levels of laser or noncoherent light (LLLT) accelerate some phases of wound healing. LLLT can stimulate fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and migration. It is thought to work via light absorption by mitochondrial cytochromes, increase in reactive oxygen species and consequent gene transcription. However, despite many reports about the positive effects of LLLT on wound healing, its use remains controversial. Our laboratory has developed a model of a full thickness excisional wound in mice that allows quantitative and reproducible light dose healing response curves to be generated. We have found a biphasic dose response curve with a maximum positive effect at 2?J/cm2 of 635-nm light and successively lower beneficial effects from 3?25?J/cm2, the effect is diminished at doses below 2?J/cm2 and gradually reaches control healing levels. At light doses above 25?J/cm2 healing is actually worse than controls. Although analysis of action spectra revealed the most effective light to be 635?nm, dose response curves are likely to be of similar shape for different wavelengths of light but at different absolute fluences. We found no difference between filtered 635?±?15-nm light from a lamp and 633-nm HeNe laser. Light alone (or a combination with other agents such as photosensitive dyes or matrix degrading enzymes) could be used for stimulation of wound healing. Our future work will be focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying effects of light on wound healing processes. We propose to examine various knockout and overexpressing mice to determine the precise mechanisms operating and to study mouse models of impaired wound healing to more closely define which patients might most benefit from LLLT.

AB  - Homeobox genes are transcription factor that form nested patterns in specific regions throughout the body. Homeobox genes are important for wound healing study because some have been shown to be related to scarless fetal wound healing. Muscle segment homeobox-2 (Msx-2) is a homeobox gene commonly expressed at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during tissue morphogenesis. Overexpression of Msx-2 leads to craniosynostosis, epidermal dysplasia, and abnormal hair growth. A knockout of this gene causes pleiotropic defects in bone growth, cyclic alopecia, and a thinner dermis. While Msx-2 has been found to play many critical roles in development, no functional study has been conducted on Msx-2 and wound healing. We hypothesize that Msx-2 regulates skin morphogenesis during wound repair which was tested by studying excisional skin wound closure. Isolated keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of Msx-2 WT and KO mice were also studied to determine the effects of Msx-2. Results showed that Msx-2 mRNA was induced in epidermis and dermis during wound repair. Additionally, Msx-2 KO mice exhibited enhanced re-epithelialization and faster wound closure than the WT control. These repair phenotypes may be attributed to keratinocyte motility and fibroblast interaction with collagen matrix as, in vitro, Msx-2 KO keratinocytes exhibited increased motility, and fibroblasts show stronger collagen matrix contraction and expressed higher levels of α2?1 than WT control. Msx-2 KO fibroblasts were refractory to BMP4 in collagen matrix contraction, demonstrating a disruption in the Msx-2 pathway. In conclusion, Msx-2 may regulate skin morphogenesis during repair at both epithelial and mesenchymal levels. This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM055081(TLT).

AB  - A novel biopolymer composed of porcine gelatin and dextran was used in a randomized controlled pilot clinical trial to treat diabetic foot ulcers to establish safety profile and evaluate effect on wound closure. Fifty-six patients were prospectively randomized at 10 centers (control?=?25; E-Matrix?=?31). Control patients received routine sharp debridement, off-loading, and hydrogel dressings applied daily. E-Matrix patients received identical wound care with the addition of monthly subcutaneous injections of E-Matrix under the wound surface. Patients were monitored for 12 weeks using wound planimetry and photography. Primary endpoint was safety as measured by adverse event reporting and clinical laboratory analysis. Secondary endpoint was wound closure based on intent to treat. There was no significant difference in the rate of adverse events between treated and control subjects. Overall closure rate for E-Matrix treated wounds was 42%(13 of 31 subjects) compared to 32%(8 of 25 subjects) for controls. Subgroup analysis suggested that E-Matrix may be more effective than control for treatment of larger (>2?cm2) and older (>17 weeks duration) wounds (see table). Parameter Treatment Group N Closed %Closed Size >2?cm E-Matrix 17 8 47% Control 14 4 29% Ulcer duration >17 weeks E-Matrix 15 6 40% Control 15 3 20% Although the study is insufficiently powered to evaluate statistical significance, E-Matrix demonstrated a similar safety profile to control treatment with trends toward improved healing in larger and older wounds. Further randomized trials are necessary to confirm these promising initial results.

AB  - The MRL mouse is the only known strain of mouse that can regenerate cardiac lesions and completely heal ear punches without scarring. To determine if the MRL also has greater regeneration capabilities in amputated digit tips, right paw digit tips of neonatal mice were dissected, with the left front paws as uncut controls. Controls used for regeneration comparison were the DBA, B6, C3H, and 129 inbred mouse strains. Consecutive X-ray images were captured of the left and right paws at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postamputation. MRL mouse digit tips regenerated greater in comparison to all strains tested (p?<?0.05). We next undertook whole genome microarray analysis to identify the genetic mechanisms that contribute to differences in digit tip regeneration. Over 400 genes out of 15,000 were significantly differentially expressed (p?<?0.05) in MRL and DBA mice at day 4 in comparison to day 0 control tissue. Of these, 170 genes were upregulated and 280 were downregulated in both mouse strains. Pathway analysis reveals that genes in the BMP/TGF pathway are differentially expressed in both mouse strains (p?<?0.05). Multiple differences between MRL and DBA strains were found in transcription factors that are implicated in gastrulation, including FMN2 and SHRM. Additional differentially expressed genes include NET1 in the WNT signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry indicates that these proteins are highly expressed in the nuclei of chondrocytes in regenerating digits. We conclude that MRL mice show greater regenerative capacity to heal digit tips and that the increased regenerative capacity of MRL mice may be due to strain specific increased expression of genes involved in the WNT pathway and genes involved in embryonic pattern formation.

AB  - TGF?1 is a multipotent secreted cytokine that plays a pivotal role in wound healing. Previously, both positive and negative effects of TGF?1 on cutaneous wound healing have been reported. The mechanisms underlying these effects of TGF?1 remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we used a mouse model to examine the effects of cutaneous wound healing, wherein the latent form of TGF?1 is constitutively expressed in basal keratinocytes of the mouse epidermis, targeted by the keratin 5 promoter (K5.TGF?1). In wild-type mice with 6-mm full thickness excisional cutaneous wounds, TGF?1 protein levels were elevated immediately after wounding, and reached a peak level on day 3 postwounding, which was 3?5-fold higher than that in the nonwounded skin, and sharply declined afterward. This elevated expression pattern suggests that only transient TGF?1 overexpression is required for normal wound healing. In contrast, K5.TGF?1 mice with prolonged TGF?1 transgene expression at the level equivalent to the above peak level in wild-type mice exhibited a significant delay in healing of 6-mm full thickness excisional wounds when compared to wild-type mice. Histological analysis of wounds revealed delayed reepithelialization, increased inflammation and prolonged granular tissue accumulation in K5.TGF?1wt mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed excessive leukocyte infiltration in transgenic wounds when compared to wild-type wounds. Understandably, the accumulation of leukocytes was also accompanied by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, angiogenic factors and fibrotic factors as determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Although the above factors override the growth inhibitory effect of TGF?1 on epidermal proliferation away from the wound edge, proliferation at the leading edge of the migrating keratinocytes was reduced in transgenic skin compared to the nontransgenic skin, evident by PCNA staining. Keratinocyte proliferation was also reduced in vitro when assessed by H3-thymidine incorporation. To assess the direct effect of TGF?1 on keratinocyte migration, we performed an in vitro migration assay and found that K5.TGF?1 keratinocytes had delayed migration when compared with wild-type cells. Our study suggests that prolonged TGF?1 expression in keratinocytes delays cutaneous wound healing by excessive inflammation, coupled to a direct inhibitory effect on keratinocyte proliferation and migration.

AB  - The use of fresh platelets has gained value in medicine as an essential part of wound treatments. This is not surprising since platelets contain a number of bioactive factors that contribute to the process of wound healing, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF). Fresh platelets? short shelf life limits platelet-based therapies. If platelets can be stabilized in freeze-dried form (FDP) then long-term storage as well as pathogen inactivation methods become possible. Adlyfe and Oregon Freeze-Dry have been developing technology to stabilize freeze-dried human platelets that can be subjected to gamma irradiation and stored for a long duration. Upon reconstitution, irradiated FDP retained growth factors PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-B1 in quantities similar to fresh platelets as judged by capture ELISA. The rehydrated FDP promoted new DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation of primary human dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs) similar to fresh platelets. The FDP also promoted remodeling of extracellular matrix by accelerating fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels and stimulated HUVECs to undergo angiogenesis and form capillary structures in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that FDP and fresh platelets have comparable in vitro wound healing potential. Preclinical wound healing stud'ies in diabetic mice are under way and further development will allow FDP to be a safe and well-suited alternative to fresh platelets for wound healing applications.

AB  - Chronic wounds fail to heal in the timely, ordered continuum demonstrated by acute wounds. The hostile biochemical environment of the chronic wound is one of the well-documented differences, which is thought to be responsible for the delay in healing. Overproduction of proteases, in particular matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases, are thought to destroy essential wound healing components including growth factors, shifting the balance in favor of tissue destruction rather than deposition. Chronic wound management must, therefore, aim to restore a more normal local wound environment. In wounds with an imbalance in bioburden, the origin of destructive proteolytic enzymes may be bacterial as well as host. Therefore, treatment to achieve a biochemical balance may need to address, not only, the level of microorganism, but also, the virulent factors they produce. An ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC addresses the wound micro'environment specifically targeting excess proteases. In this study we investigated the effect of ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on serine and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as, its ability to preserve growth factors, as exem'plified by Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) from host and bacterial 'proteolytic degradation. The ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC inactivated serine and matrix metalloproteinases from chronic wound fluids, as well as the proteolytic enzymes present in bacterial supernatants. It is also capable of preserving PDGF from proteolytic degradation. When compared to other commonly used wound dressings this is a unique characteristic of ORC/collagen, demonstrating their exclusive ability to absorb noxious components of wound fluid and restore a more normal wound healing environment.

AB  - We have developed a human fetal digit model of response to tip amputation to simulate the clinical phenomenon of digit tip regrowth or regeneration in children. We reported previously that younger estimated gestational age (EGA) digits respond to tip amputation with several layers of cells covering the phalangeal anlage, compared to older digits where such coverage comprises fewer cell layers or is absent. The proximal cut end of excised digits does not demonstrate such a response. We report here that the transcription repressor MSX1 is expressed beneath the developing nailfield in younger human fetal digits (57 to 67 days EGA), as has been shown in the mouse, and that cells expressing MSX1 are found at the digit tip by 4 days postamputation. Further, expression of keratins K14 and K19 is found, suggesting reforming of an epithelium. These findings are consistent with the mouse model of digit tip regeneration where MSX1-expressing cells are hypothesized to migrate to the amputation site and reconstitute the missing tip, and with the general observation that a wound epidermis is required for either regeneration or wound healing. 57?d EGA digits; left, MSX1 expression, control; left center, MSX1 and center, K19 expression, day 4 posttip amputation; right center, MSX1 and right, K19 expression, day 7 postamputation

AB  - Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has found substantial clinical utility as a commercially available wound matrix. In the present study, the utility of two natural, nonsynthetic and noncrosslinked ECMs, porcine renal capsule material (RCM) and SIS, were compared to no-fill controls in a rat full thickness skin wound model. Groups of rats had surgically created wounds filled with SIS, RCM, or left unfilled (ten/treatment/time point). Wound diameters periodically measured at 3?30 days after wound creation and sites sampled at 3?56 days after wound creation were numerically graded for degree of histologic change including the formation of adnexa and for collagen content based on intensity of trichrome staining. Wounds in both ECM groups had statistically significant (P?<?0.001) greater wound diameters than unfilled controls at days 7, 12, and 17 with no differences between RCM- and SIS-treated wounds at any time point. At 56 days, SIS-filled and RCM-filled wounds were completely closed with cornified epithelium covered by a keratinized layer. Healing was largely complete, with normal numbers of adnexal structures present in most sections, while unfilled control wounds were similar though fewer adnexal structures were present. Though histology scores suggested more robust healing with either RCM or SIS, no significant differences with unfilled control wounds were found. From this study, it appears that RCM and SIS enhance wound healing in terms of wound tissue collagenization and maturation of adnexal structures while clearly impeding wound contraction. Natural ECMs have utility for dermal wound repair and may lessen clinical contracture formation caused by rapid wound contraction. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - We find that the ELR-negative CXC chemokines, CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11(IP-9), expressed during wound repair, with IP-9 being produced by redifferentiated keratinocyte. Immunohistochemical analysis for IP-9 on human full thickness wound tissues collected from day 5 confirmed that IP-9 is a wound response protein. We have shown in in vitro coculture systems that IP-9 can serve as an autocrine factor promoting motility in keratinocyte while limiting motility in dermal fibroblasts. These effects occur via modulation of the intracellular proteases calpain isoforms that regulate cell adhesion during motility. Thus, the function of these chemokines in vivo is not obvious. To probe this, we have explored wound repair in mice lacking the receptor for these ligands, CXCR3. Quantitative analysis of IP-9 expression in wounds of these mice collected from day 2 to day 20 showed a significant increase in IP-9 levels in CXCR3-/- mice compared to wild type, which is expected if receptor-mediated feedback attenuation is lost. Full and partial thickness wound healing experiments on these mice showed a significant delay in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Histochemical analysis of tissues collected from both full and partial thickness wounds demonstrated differences in epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and angiogenesis in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Collagen, the major extracellular matrix protein organization were analyzed by trichrome and picrosirus red staining methods. We are also examining the effect of this lost receptor on promotility signaling from EGF receptors. These in vivo and in vitro studies confirm the pathophysiologic role of the chemokines IP-9 and IP-10 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 during wound repair.
