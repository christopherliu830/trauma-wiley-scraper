AB  - Introduction:? Based on the results of a study showing increased healing rates in a rabbit wound healing model, a clinical study was initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of a new electric stimulation bandage (POSiFECT dressing). Four patients have completed the study for the first-generation system and two are currently enrolled in the evaluation of the second-generation system. Materials and Methods:? Spinal cord-injured pressure ulcer patients were treated with the POSiFECT dressing in a randomized double-blind crossover study. During the first 8 weeks, subjects received a dressing supplying 50??A of current or one with an unconnected battery. During the treatment, bandages were changed every other day and wounds were assessed weekly to determine size, depth, and condition. At the end of 8 weeks the patients were unblinded and the control group was treated with working bandages for 8 weeks. After cessation of treatment, assessments continued each month for 2 months. Results:? The treatment led to statistically significant increases in healing rates during the first week (0.19?±?0.11?cm/wk) and the first 2 weeks (0.10?±?0.07?cm/wk) compared to both the control group (?0.03?±?0.0?cm/wk) and the follow-up period (?0.02?±?0.08?cm/wk). For each patient, however, there was a time frame during the 3rd to 5th week of treatment in which significant decreases in healing rate occurred (?0.31 to ?0.096). Conclusions:? The POSiFECT dressing appears to increase healing during the first few weeks after application. A modified clinical study is under way with a new dressing design as well as a treatment protocol providing 3 weeks of stimulation followed by 2 weeks without stimulation and then 3 more weeks of stimulation. Acknowledgments:? This project was funded by Biofisica and the CDC through NCIPC.

AB  - Several lines of evidence demonstrate that limited inflammation is key for scarless healing to take place in early fetal skin. Because inflammation and angiogenesis are often linked in pathological processes, we hypothesized that angiogenesis may play a significant role in the regulation of scar formation. A mouse model of fetal wound repair was utilized to study angiogenesis in wounds generated at either embryonic day 15 (E15), when scarless healing takes place, or embryonic day 18 (E18), when significant scarring occurs. CD31 immunohistochemical staining and image analysis were used to calculate blood vessel density at 7 days post-wounding. Wounds generated at E15 showed no increase in vessel density above levels found in unwounded, age-matched skin. In contrast, wounds generated at E18 displayed a 45% increase in vessel density compared to control skin, similar to what is seen during adult wound healing. Increased protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 3 day wounds generated at E18 (8.06?±?1.89?pg VEGF/?g protein compared to 1.99?±?0.4 in wounds made at E15) likely contribute to the increase in vascularity. In addition, injection of E15 wounds with 0.05??g of VEGF resulted in the production of a scar, compared to control wounds which healed without a scar. To further explore the idea that VEGF may contribute to scarring, we examined the effects of VEGF neutralization on scar formation in adult murine skin. Anti-VEGF antibody injections resulted in a significant reduction in scar formation compared to control scars based on histological and ultrastructural analysis. Our studies suggest a novel role for VEGF in promoting scar tissue deposition, and suggest that VEGF inhibitors may be useful for limiting cutaneous fibrosis.

AB  - Scarless fetal wound healing in connective tissue is characterized by organized collagen deposition that leads to regeneration and apparently normal tissue structure and function. In contrast, adult wound healing is characterized by the deposition of unorganized collagen that leads to scar formation and a loss of functionally relevant structural organization. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis and deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix molecules, and the subsequent remodeling and contraction during the wound healing process. Therefore, fibroblasts play a key role in the different outcomes observed in fetal and adult wound healing. The hypothesis is that fetal fibroblasts, relative to adult fibroblasts, have an altered capacity to contract collagen gels and remodel collagen fibrils due to inherent differences in their contractile phenotype. In this study, an anchored collagen gel model was used to evaluate matrix contraction and remodeling by these different fibroblast phenotypes. Video microscopy was used to measure the changes in surface area of contracting collagen gels. Collagen gel reorganization was evaluated using a fitting algorithm to predict the distribution and orientation of collagen fibrils from scanning electron microscopy images. In addition, fibroblast morphology and proliferation on contracting collagen gels were examined. Understanding these phenotypic variations will elucidate key differences in the wound healing process that can be used for potential clinical applications involving cell therapy and tissue engineered constructs.

AB  - Currently, skin cells or tissues intended for therapeutical or cosmetic applications are typically cultured using standard in vitro culture techniques. The avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has been traditionally used for many years to assess angiogenesis of exogenous substances. Avian embryos have also been used to generate viruses for vaccine development. Most of the uses of the avian CAM cultures are typically conducted in ovo. However, xenobiotic cultures of ex ovo avian embryos and explanted organs, tissues or cells from human or other mammalian origin have not been used in the past with the explicit purpose of achieving the appropriate extent of expansion, differentiation or vascularization required for therapeutic or cosmetic implantation into humans or animals. Here, a novel method of xenobiotic skin culture was developed that can be employed for wound healing studies or for tissue engineering applications to sustain the culture of live skin explants through the benefit of a xenobiotic vascularization. The method uses fertile Japanese quail (Cortunix cortunix japonica) eggs. The eggs were incubated for at least 3 days in ovo using a static egg incubator. On day 3 the egg is opened under sterile conditions through the air chamber and placed in a cylindrical culture dish slightly larger than the overall diameter of the egg yolk. The embryo was then cultured at 37?°C for an additional 24 to 48 hours until a well-vascularized CAM covers the entire surface of the culture dish. Next, fragments of skin were placed directly over the CAM. The cultures were continued for 8 days and then the skin explants were transferred to new CAMs. These changes, every 8 days, were done at least five times allowing the skin to be maintained in culture for several weeks without apparent damage in viability. The skin fragments remained viable and capable of reepithelialization when wounded. Skin explants from both mouse and human were successfully cultured in this manner. Because immunological response cannot occur in the embryonic culture environment, it was possible to xenotransplant skin fragments without risk of rejection. The ensuing embryonic vessels developed into the xenotransplanted skin and generated a permeable vascular network that provided oxygen and nutrients necessary to ensure viability and promote proliferation and differentiation. Viability of the explants was evaluated by immunohisto chemical methods using proliferation and apoptosis markers (Caspase-3, BrdU, and PCNA). Vascularization was assessed using species-specific anti endothelial antibodies (anti-PECAM human and mouse and QH1 and QH2 monoclonal antibodies). The new method described herein has the distinct advantage of sustaining live, functional skin cultures by means of a rich vascular supply that provides cells with nutrients and oxygen.

AB  - Exposure to cigarette smoke has detrimental effects on the early stages of wound repair but not much is known about the effects of smoke on the development of the healing (granulation) tissue. Cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and deposition of ECM are critical processes for normal granulation tissue (GT) formation. Here we investigate the effects of MSW (?first-hand smoke?) and SSW (the main component of ?secondhand smoke?) smoke on wound healing in mice that have been smoking for 9 months. We show that both MSW and SSW smoke adversely affect wound contraction and closure. The keratinocytes accumulate at the edge of the wound and the GT is deficient in fibroblasts and ECM. Moreover, by immunolabeling for α-SMA, we found that the myofibroblasts remained at the edges of the wound rather than penetrating the GT, potentially contributing to the lack of wound contraction. To test the possibility that smoke inhibits cell migration, we plated primary human fibroblasts in between two interstitial collagen gels, treated the cultures with the smoke solutions and found that cell migration into the gels was inhibited. Furthermore, using the collagen gel contraction assay, we showed that cigarette smoke components inhibit gel contraction. To further decipher which components of the smoke contribute to delayed wound closure, we fractionated SSW smoke solutions into polar and nonpolar components using solid phase extraction cartridges. We show that both the polar and nonpolar fractions delay wound closure in vivo and that the nonpolar fraction inhibits cell migration whereas the polar faction increases cell survival. We are currently pursuing these studies by further fractionation of these two phases with the goal of identifying the specific component(s) in each fraction that cause these effects on cell migration and survival. Identification of the components in cigarette smoke that lead to delayed wound healing and eliminating them from cigarettes could help those exposed to secondhand smoke heal faster.

AB  - The typical management of ?sternal infection? is sternectomy and flaps. Healed wounds and low mortality are the rule, but problems of surgical morbidity, chest instability, respiratory mechanics, and upper extremity function complicate these procedures. However, when pathophysiology of sternal failure is critically assessed, and contemporary good bone and wound care are applied, results improve. Specifically, the sternotomy is a fracture. Sternal biomechanics after sagittal osteotomy promote nonunion. When the poor fixation of twist wires fails, sternal dehiscence and wound bursitis ensue, typical of any pseudarthrosis. Commonly misinterpreted as ?infection,? the bone remains intrinsically healthy, and these wounds simply need proper wound management until they can be reclosed, and then stable bone fixation with hardware. Experience.? 28 patients had plate-and-screw fixation of the sternum. Original operations: heart surgery, 26?pts (21?m/6?f, ages 44?82); thoracic cancers, 2?pts (42?m, 39?f). Presentation: dehiscence, abscess, open wound, 20?pts (variable acuity, variable surgery-until-complication intervals); healed wounds with instability symptoms, 8?pts. Ten pts had rewirings or other prior procedures which failed. For open wounds or abscess, debridement was followed by a period of open wound care (often outpatient) until suitable for closure. In all but the first 4 patients, hardware fixation used a mandibular plating system with 2.7?mm screws. Flaps and nonautogenous bone grafts were used as needed to fill gaps. Results.? Two early closures failed during intense coughing. The other 26 repairs withstood all postoperative stresses, and the fractures healed. Instability symptoms and disabilities were corrected. Bedside debridements and outpatient wound care kept utilization low in permissible circumstances, with no inpatient days for a few. The habitual indiscriminate designation of all sternal complications as ?infection? is inconsistent with well-understood principles of bone and wound pathology. Most sternums fail due to mechanical dehiscence. With bone preserving wound care followed by rigid internal fixation, as is practiced for all other fractures, outcomes, by all measures, are improved.

AB  - Angiogenesis is a dynamic process that requires interaction of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. Several methodologies have been used to evaluate this process. The quail chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a suitable model to explore angiogenesis in vivo. Recently, the morphometric parameters of fractal dimension (Df) and grid intersection (?) are used to quantify angiogenesis in CAM. However, more information is necessary to understand angiogenic mechanisms. New methods to measure additional parameters such as the average blood vessel thickness, tortuousity, total branch length and complexity (junction node number), are described herein. For the analysis, CAM images were obtained from ex ovo culture of E8-E9 quail embryos. MatLab?(The MathWorks, Natick, MA) software was used for the analyses of branches nodes, thickness and length of the forming branches. Conventional morphometry was done using IPLab (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). To validate the new parameters, leptin, VEGF and neutralizing antibodies were evaluated. Leptin and VEGF treated CAM had increased complexity and vascular densities (Df?=?1.5?±?0.005; ??=?12.3?±?0.689) and (Df?=?1.6?±?0.006; ??=?14.3?±?0.465), respectively, compared to PBS control (Df?=?1.3?±?0.035; ??=?8.6?±?0.439). There was a corresponding decrease antileptin and anti-VEGF antibodies. The node-structural map applied to CAM images reveled 53% increase in the number of one-branch nodes and 50% increase in three-branch nodes with leptin compared to controls. Additionally, the total branch length was 30% greater with leptin along with a decrease in vessel thickness, The analyses allowed quantification of branching, tortuousity, thickness, and length of the new blood vessels. Together with the conventional morphometric parameters, these new analyses will help understand the mechanisms exerted by angiogenesis-modulating molecule.

AB  - Introduction:? There is extensive data implicating the role of the TGF-beta pathway in hypertrophic scarring. However, few studies have examined the temporal expression of the various TGF-beta cytokines and their receptors. Purpose:? This study sought to determine the temporal mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TGFR-I, TGFR-II, Smad-3, and collagen I in a rabbit ear model of hypertrophic scarring compared to smaller, nonhypertrophic control scars. Methods:? In an established model of hypertrophic scarring, 7?mm (hypertrophic) and 5?mm (nonhypertrophic control) punch wounds were made on the ears of 12 rabbits. Wounds were harvested at days 7, 15, 28, and 40. Histologic evaluation was performed on all scars in order to validate the model. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to compare mRNA expression between the various time points. Results:? At day 7, the 5?mm wounds had epithelialized to a greater extent than the 7?mm wounds. At day 28 and 40, the 7?mm scars were hypertrophic compared to the 5?mm control scars. In both 7?mm and 5?mm scars, TGF-beta1 and beta3 levels declined over time. In 7?mm scars, TGF-beta2 peaked at day 28, TGFR-I levels peaked at day 15, and TGFR-II and Smad-3 remained stable over time. As expected, collagen I expression peaked at day 28. In the 5?mm scars, TGF-beta2 levels remained stable, TGFR-I levels peaked at day 28, while levels of TGFR-II and Smad-3 declined slightly over time. Collagen I expression peaked at day 15. Conclusions:? The up-regulation of TGF-beta2 mRNA expression in hypertrophic but not flat scars indicates that it may be important to scar hypertrophy. The sustained expression of TGFR-II and Smad-3 in hypertrophic scars compared to controls suggests that the role of the TGF-beta family in the process of hypertrophic scarring is complex. This study was supported by an NIH grant (5R01GM063825-03) awarded to T.A. Mustoe.

AB  - The role of the EGF superfamily of growth factors and their receptors during wound healing continues to unfold. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of overexpression of erbB3 in wound healing and whether topical application of its various ligands enhances repair. Partial thickness porcine wounds were transfected with recombinant adenoviral particles containing erbB3 receptor gene or a vehicle ?-galactosidase gene (Lac Z). Highly similar ligands: Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Epiregulin (EPR), Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), Heregulin (HER) were topically applied to wounds boosted with erbB3 receptors. Enhanced wound healing parameters were assessed 5 days after initial treatment for reepithelization, dermal depth, macrophage infiltration, proliferating cells, angiogenesis, and apoptotic cells. Treatment with EPR and HB-EGF promoted greater resurfacing of the epidermal layer than EGF, HER, erbB3 only or vehicle treated wounds. Neodermal formation as measured by dermal or granulation depth was significantly different in the EPR and HB-EGF treated wounds compared to EGF, HER, erbB3 only or vehicle. Numerous hallmarks of enhanced wound maturity (fewer infiltrating macrophages, significant reductions in neovascularization, fibroblastic proliferation) were noted in EPR- and HB-EGF-treated wounds transfected with erbB3 as compared to vehicle controls. Only erbB3 wounds treated with these particular ligands showed significant increases in apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that wounds treated with this erbB3 receptor form supplied with topical application of EPR and HB-EGF exhibit synergistic and accelerating reparative effects on porcine partial thickness wounds as compared to vehicle. These in vivo findings suggest the complexity and evidence of synergism between the erbB receptor and its various ligands on wound healing. (This research work was funded by the NIH GM40437.)

AB  - This study examined adult hospitalized patients? responses to wound care pain and its treatment. Wound care included dressing change, packing, irrigation, and debridement. The subjective experience of pain intensity was measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS) prior to, immediately after, and 10 minutes after completion of the procedure. The sample was composed of 412 subjects. Most were male (52.3%), white (73.9%), had one wound (59.5%), and had undergone surgery (73.9%). When pain intensity was compared over time, pain intensity was greatest (NRS 4.4, SD 3.2) during the procedure (p?<?.023), and nonsurgical patients experienced significantly greater pain than surgical patients (p?=?.002)(NRS 5.3, SD 3.0, NRS 4.1, SD3.2, respectively). Most patients underwent multiple wound care procedures. When the pain intensity of undergoing only a dressing change (n?=?61), only packing (n?=?41), or ≥2 procedures (n?=?258) was examined by whether subjects had undergone surgery or no surgery, nonsurgical patients reported greater pain intensity with dressing change (p?<?.001) and ≥2 procedures (p?<?.001). Few subjects received analgesics (7.3% surgical patients 5.9% nonsurgical); there was no difference by group in the amount of opioid administered (p?=?.821). Sedatives and NSAIDS were rarely used. Treatment with pain medication was examined over time. Those with least pain received significantly less pain medication when compared with those who received premedication only and those who received medication prior to and during the procedure (p?<?.05). Findings show wound care is painful and wound care pain is undertreated. Further research is needed to address the effect of pain on wound-related patient outcomes and strategies to minimize pain.

AB  - Angiogenesis plays a critical role in wound healing. In wound healing new blood vessels are generated, then later in scar-resolving stages of the repair process, these newly formed blood vessels undergo destabilization and significant regression. ELR-negative chemokines have been shown to have angiostatic properties and are produced in high concentration late in the granulation tissue and resolving stage of wound repair. The receptor for the ELR-negative chemokines, CXCR3, is expressed on endothelial cells but its function is not known. To understand the physiologic role CXCR3 plays in regulating endothelial function, we analyzed the ability of the CXCR3 ligand, IP-10, to inhibit endothelial cell tube formation. IP-10 was able to inhibit endothelial cell tube formation alone and prevent VEGF-induced tube formation on Matrigel?. Treatment of endothelial cells with IP-10 significantly inhibited endothelial motility. Thus, the ELR-negative chemokines inhibit angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial motility. To identify the signaling pathway(s) mediated by CXCR3 that inhibit endothelial cell motility, we looked at the regulation of key processes. As CXCR3 is a receptor known to generate cAMP, as we show in these cells, we examined PKA-mediated inhibition of calpain. Treatment of endothelial cells with VEGF induced the activation of m-calpain but costimulation with IP-10 significantly decreased m-calpain activity. Using cAMP analogs, 8-Br-cAMP, a PKA activator, is able to inhibit VEGF- induced motility and Rp-8-Br-cAMP, a PKA inhibitor, is able to reverse the inhibitory effects of IP-10 on endothelial migration and calpain activation. To further demonstrate that m-calpain is important in endothelial motility we show that siRNA knockdown of m-calpain inhibited VEGF induced migration. These data indicate that activation of CXCR3 inhibits endothelial migration through the PKA-mediated inhibition of m-calpain. These findings provide new targets to modulate the resolution phase of wound repair.

AB  - Introduction:? There are several proposed animal models of hypertrophic scarring. However, most are quite dissimilar from the actual human event. It has been shown that wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars. We are attempting to fully validate this model. A fourfold increase in mast cells and formation of collagen nodules have been described as characteristics of human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized the occurrence of nodules and mast cells in Duroc scars is similar. Methods:? For nodules, we biopsied human hypertrophic scars (47 cases) taken 5 to 67 months from injury and Duroc scars (six animals) taken 0 to 5 months from injury. For mast cells, we biopsied human hypertrophic scar (five cases) taken 24 to 30 months from injury and Duroc scars (five animals) taken 5 months from injury. We stained the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (nodules) and Giemsa (mast cells) and counted intact mast cells in the upper papillary dermis in 20 and recorded nodules as present or absent. Results:? The results are included the table below.

AB  - Background:? Both passive and active dressings and technologies are proposed for treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. A quantitative assessment of healing is needed. Measurement of scattering and absorption characteristics of healing tissue, by Diffuse Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) may provide such a method. Methods:? 20 rats were divided into an induced diabetic and a control group (N?=?10 each). Full thickness wounds were made on the dorsal surface and biopsies sent for histologic analysis. Wounds were interrogated at twice per week intervals using a frequency domain near infrared device with three wavelengths of incident light. Amplitude and phase of scattered light were obtained at four different source-detector distances at each wavelength. The probe was positioned at six different locations. Tissue absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were calculated from amplitude and phase data. Wound dimensions were calculated by cross and parallel polarization. Results:? Thirty-eight wounds were evaluated during the experiment. Wound size decreased at twice the rate in control. Average absorption coefficient was higher, by a factor of 2, in diabetics. The average value of reduced scattering coefficient was 30% higher in diabetics as well. During healing, both scattering and absorption coefficient increased faster in diabetics. Discussion:? Higher absorption in diabetic rats suggest impaired blood flow. Scattering reflects tissue disorganization observed in delayed wound healing. Conclusion:? These data suggest that near-infrared spectroscopy can detect the difference in oxygen delivery to the wound and assess wound healing progression. Further analysis is planned to investigate pathologic correlates with spectroscopic data.

AB  - Pigs have been accepted as good models for skin wound healing research due to their anatomical similarities to humans. The healing response of excisional wounds in juvenile female Yorkshire (Y) pigs closely resembles normal healing in humans. In contrast, identical wounds in female red Duroc (RD) pigs contracted significantly more, resulting in an 80?90% reduction in wound area. This hypercontraction was associated with marked hyperpigmentation at the wound margins, and some features of the RD healing phenotype, such as increased collagen deposition, are similar to hypertrophic scar formation in humans. Recent investigations have begun to elucidate the genetic transmissibility of the RD healing phenotype. Skin wounds were created on Y???RD F1 female animals (N?=?8), and while hyperpigmentation was not observed, the hypercontraction prevalent in the RD persisted in 100% of animals studied. Further, the degree and kinetics of contraction observed in the F1 animals was significantly greater than in the RD. All F1 animals were subsequently bred to a single Yorkshire boar, producing a cohort of 20 female backcross animals. Healing in the backcross animals generally followed the Y phenotype with regard to wound contraction and pigmentation. However, between days 28 and 56, the backcross animals demonstrated significantly less contraction than the Yorkshire animals. These results suggest that the regulation of wound contraction is controlled by a restricted number of major genes and an unidentified number of other genes, which may positively or negatively modulate the influence of the major genes, as observed in the F1 and backcross animals. These studies have begun the process of elucidating the molecular basis for abnormal skin wound healing and scarring. Further ongoing studies are using genomic and proteomic approaches to further elucidate candidate genes potentially involved in the RD healing phenotype. Acknowledgments:?
