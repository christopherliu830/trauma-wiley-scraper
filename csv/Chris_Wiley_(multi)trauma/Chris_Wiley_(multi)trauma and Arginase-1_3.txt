AB  - Abstract Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient required for the activity of metalloenzymes. It is an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN), but requirements are low. Mn status is difficult to assess, with the commonest method being measurement of its concentration in whole blood. This method has limitations, including artifactually high concentrations resulting from contamination of specimen tubes. Mn toxicity is a well-recognized complication of PN, the risk of which increases if there is cholestasis or if the patient has received high doses. It usually presents with parkinsonian-like symptoms but may be detected presymptomatically as hypermanganesemia or as increased signal intensity of the basal ganglia upon T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Caution is necessary when providing Mn for patients on long-term PN (>1 month). It is advisable to withhold supplementation if hypermanganesemia or cholestasis develops. Deficiency of Mn is rare in patients treated with PN. PN regimens are contaminated with Mn in amounts likely to meet requirements. Consequently, it is debated whether PN should be routinely supplemented with Mn. The currently recommended dose of Mn in adults treated with PN is 55 ?g/d, but the doses provided by most currently available multi?trace element products exceed this. In response to calls for new products to be developed, 2 new multi?trace element products are currently available in Europe that provide Mn doses of 55 ?g/d. Once these products are in general use, it is likely that the incidence of Mn toxicity will decrease.

AB  - Summary This chapter illustrates the metabolic processes involved in the overall metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein including the catabolic processes to produce energy and urea and anabolic processes to form tissue protein and energy stores, glycogen and lipids. It considers the following amino acid disorders: phenylketonuria (PKU) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiencies, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), homocystinuria (HCU) and tyrosinaemia. For each condition, the prevalence, biochemistry, genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome and non dietetic treatment is described separately. All these amino acid conditions share the same principles of dietary management. Therefore, the dietary management for all conditions is considered in the chapter. A low protein diet is an essential part of the management of organic acidaemias (OAA), e.g. isovaleric acidaemia (IVA), glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1); and the urea cycle disorders (UCD). The chapter describes the provision of a low protein diet and acute management, common to these disorders.

AB  - Introduction:? Compelling evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO?) plays an important role in wound healing. Not only does it possess cytotoxic properties, but also regulatory functions on various cells involved in inflammation and proliferation. In wounds, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) catalyzes arginine to citrulline and NO?, whereas arginase converts arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine is an essential substrate for the synthesis of polyamines, which are important in cellular proliferation and repair. A model for regulation of wound healing proposes the importance of a strict reciprocal control of these enzymes in wounds. Human studies using impaired wound healing models, however, are lacking in this area. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate arginine metabolism in wound fluids of patients with pressure ulcers on Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.?) therapy. Methods:? Wound fluid extracts from 11 patients with stage III or IV pressure ulcer were analyzed for cytokines and metabolites of arginine. Sample age ranged from 31?92 years. Wound fluid was collected prior to V.A.C.? application and post-V.A.C.? within 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days. Subjects served as their own control in this quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Spectrophotometric quantification of nitrates and nitrites using the Griess diazotization reaction method was performed. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, and proline were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Results:? There was no significant differences between pre- and post-V.A.C.? concentrations of NO?, citrulline, ornithine, and proline. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in arginine levels measured at baseline and day'3 of V.A.C.? treatment. Also, NO? measured at 24 hours of V.A.C.? placement decreased significantly at day 7 of therapy. Furthermore, post-V.A.C.? levels of TNF-α decreased significantly from baseline. A less cytotoxic environment is created, thus indicating a healing wound following 1 week of V.A.C.? therapy. Discussion:? Arginine and its metabolites are detectable in wound fluids from patients with pressure ulcers. To our knowledge, the metabolism of arginine has not been described in human subjects with pressure ulcers on V.A.C.? therapy. The determination of NO? in these wound environments provides baseline information on the mechanisms involved in aberrant wound healing.
