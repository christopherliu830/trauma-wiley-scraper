AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - We studied the transcripts that are increased by stress and injury in mouse kidney transplants, focusing on transcripts increased in parenchymal cells?injury and repair-induced transcripts (IRITs). We compared four types of stressed kidneys: isografts, allografts, host kidneys of mice with isografts and nontransplant kidneys with ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). After excluding transcripts associated with infiltrating cells and interferon-?-induced transcripts, we defined 790 IRITs in isografts. IRITs were remarkably heterogeneous in timing and mechanisms. Some were increased in host as well as donor kidneys, reflecting systemic influences (wounding, anesthetic). Most reflected local stress, resembling changes in ATN despite the lack of ATN histopathology. Mathematical decomposition of IRIT expression patterns confirmed heterogeneity, separating IRIT changes into component subsets, with an early peak (day 1) showing systemic effects and late peaks that resembled ATN, manifested Tgf-ß1 effects and recapitulated embryonic development. In allografts IRITs were initially similar to isografts but diverged due to allogeneic injury. The allospecific induction of IRITs was T-cell-dependent but perforin-granzyme-independent, compatible with delayed type hypersensitivity. The alloresponse strikingly and selectively increased the late IRITs but not the IRITs that peak early, indicating that rejection triggers parenchymal responses similar to those in ATN.

AB  - Abstract Neutrophils are one of the most important effector cells of the innate immune response (1). They are traditionally seen as a homogenous population of short-lived cells mainly involved in the defence against extracellular microorganisms by phagocytosis and intracellular killing (1,2). The cells contain a large armamentarium that aids in this function and ranges from the production of reactive oxygen species by a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase to cytotoxic proteins and peptides residing in the different granules present in the cytoplasm (3). Recently, the view of neutrophils belonging to a homogenous population of cells has been challenged, and several neutrophil phenotypes have been described that exhibit specialized functions, such as involvement in tissue repair, tumour killing and immune regulation (4). It is not clear whether these cells belong to separate parallel lineages originating from the bone marrow or that neutrophils become instructed in the distant tissues, thus changing their phenotypes. In addition, functional heterogeneity in a phenotypically homogenous population of neutrophils adds to the complexity of neutrophil phenotypes(5). This article will review the current literature describing the heterogeneity within the neutrophil compartment with respect to both phenotype and function in health and disease.

AB  - Charcoal-based odor-absorbing dressings for management of odiferous chronic wounds have been marketed for many years. However, the presence of wound serum deactivates the charcoal and inhibits the adsorption of odor molecules. Charcoal dressings also generally need adjunct fixation to hold them in place. Avery Dennison Medical has developed a new series of hydrocolloid adhesives that provides an alternative technology for the adsorption of chronic wound odors. Dressings incorporating this technology are suitable for direct wound contact. In presence of serum, superior odor absorption with these new 'materials in comparison with charcoal dressings has been demonstrated in vitro. These new dressings have significant fluid absorption potential, are self-adhesive, and require no additional fixation. Some of the factors affecting performance of these new materials in vitro will be presented, as well as preliminary results from in vivo performance on chronic wounds. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.
