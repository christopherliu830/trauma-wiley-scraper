AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 [alpha], IL-1 [beta]) have been shown to play a significant role in early stages of wound healing. Previous studies also indicate that mucosal wounds heal faster in males. The purpose of this study was to assess gene expression of inflammatory cytokines before and during wound healing. Younger and older volunteers received two small oral wounds on the hard palate. One of the wounds (3.5?mm in diameter) was videographed daily until healed. The other wound (1???5?mm) was biopsied either 6 or 24?h postwounding. Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000 SDS) was performed on the unwounded and wounded tissues to study gene expression. Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to unwounded tissue, wounding induced rapid gene expression for these cytokines. In males, IL-1 [beta] gene expression peaked at 6?h and was higher than in females. Since males have been shown to heal this type of wound faster than females, this earlier peak of IL-1 [beta] may be beneficial to wound healing. Regardless of gender, IL-1ra and IL-1 [alpha] levels peaked at 6 and 24?h, respectively. Interestingly, cytokine levels in unwounded tissue correlated with wound healing parameters (e.g., wound sizes, time to heal), but in females only. Specifically, women with higher basal levels of IL-1 [beta] and IL-1ra, and lower levels of IL-1 [alpha] tended to heal faster. Thus, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in unwounded mucosal tissue may play a determinant role in wound healing outcomes. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - To better understand the mechanisms of dermal restoration in burn wound we examined the mRNA expressions, using a porcine secondary-degree burn wound model, of major dermal matrices including type I, III collagens and elastin, basement membrane components of collagen IV and laminins, regulatory Matrix Metalloproteinase MMP 1 and MMP 9, as well as growth factors of bFGF, CTGF, TGF?, and VEGF. Fresh skin burn wound samples from six pigs were collected at days 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) were used with gene-specific primers. RT-PCR products were run on ethidium bromide gel and analyzed under UV light with Bio-Rad Gel Document 2000 system. One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. The results showed:'1) There were increases of all dermal extracellular matrices and growth factors tested; 2) A significant increase of type IV collagen occurred the earliest, while expressions of type I collagen and elastin increased at the latest; 3) A dramatic induction of MMP 1 and MMP 9 was observed shortly after wounding, which lasted through entire experiment; 4) The increased expression of VEGF, which is critical to angiogenesis, occurred early with peak at days 1 and 4, respectively. The expression pattern of bFGF, which has strong promoting effects on both endothelial cells and fibroblasts, is similar to that of VEGF; 5) For growth factors important for matrix deposition, both TGF beta 1 and 3 expressions increased gradually with sustained high level during entire experiment. The expression of CTGF, which is important in matrix production and remodeling, increased in later stage. This study showed the correlation between growth factor expression and dermal matrix deposition, which may have implications in developing strategies to improve burn wound healing. This study was supported by grants from DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.

AB  - Chronic nonhealing wounds have been long associated with an imbalance between the degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Human and animal studies have shown psychological stress to impair healing and differentially regulate gene expression. We hypothesized that psychological stress-impaired healing is mediated by altered expression of MMP and TIMP. SKH-1 mice were subjected to restraint stress 3 days before and 5 days after placement of 3.5?mm biopsy wounds. The wounds were biopsied at various time points and analyzed for gene expression by real-time PCR. The wounds of stressed mice showed significantly delayed healing when compared to the wounds of controls through day 5 postwounding. There was a significantly higher expression of MMP-8 in the stressed groups on days 1 (172%, p?<?0.0003) and 3 (204%, p?<?0.0003) postwounding. Stress decreased MMP-9 expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.02), but showed no significant difference to controls on the other days. TIMP-1, which is known to inhibit most activated MMPs, had significantly lower expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.0003). TIMP-2, which is constitutively expressed, did not show any difference in expression between the stress and the control groups. During stress, increased MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) activity is in agreement with previous studies in our model that have demonstrated a increase in neutrophil recruitment on days 3 and 5 postwounding. Likewise, lower expression of TIMP-1 during stress is similar to findings in chronic wounds as opposed to healing surgical wounds. Hence, altered expression of the metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, may lead to increased damage early in healing and decreased repair later in stress-impaired wound healing.

AB  - Background:? The cytokine signals that regulate myofibroblast differentiation and the resulting reorganization of matrix are incompletely understood. We studied the response of fibroblasts to mediators known to affect matrix reorganization, TGF-? and TNF-α in a collagen matrix. Further, we sought to determine if any cell phenotype changes resulted in quantifiable alterations in the mechanical performance of the matrix. Methods:? Normal human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in collagen type I lattices for 1 and 5 days in DMEM with .5% FBS and TGF-?(1?ng/ml), TNF-α(10?ng/ml), or combinations TGF-?(1?ng/ml)?+?TNF-α(1,5, and 10?ng/ml). Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to determine α-SMA expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure α-SMA mRNA. An indentation mechanical method was used to measure Young?s modulus which represents matrix stiffness. Results:? TGF-? increases α-SMA, while TNF-α alone has no effect on basal α-SMA expression. When TGF-??+?TNF-α were both added, the expression of α-SMA returned to basal levels. Immunohistochemistry showed α-SMA is incorporated into prominent stress fibers only in the TGF-? group. Real-time PCR showed that TNF-α did not affect α-SMA mRNA, while TGF-? increased α-SMA mRNA 19-fold. Combination treatment reduced mRNA level by 16-fold, to 2.7-fold compared to control. Indentation testing showed that, in all treatment groups, lattices after 5 days in culture were stiffer. TNF-α appeared to reduce the stiffness of the lattices on both day 1 and 5 compared to control. Conclusion:? TNF-α decreases TGF-? induction of α-SMA expression at the transcriptional level and decreases lattice stiffness. The cellular responses to cytokines are reflected in both biochemical and mechanical behaviors. Understanding both will be necessary to understand how tissues remodel into functional tissue and scar.

AB  - Introduction:? Cyclophilin C-associated protein (CyC-AP) expression is up-regulated during wound healing. CyC-AP deletion causes greater expression of TNFα, MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14 during cutaneous repair. Furthermore, CyC-AP is a mediator for fibronectin-fragment induced MMP-13 expression. In order to understand the effects of the deletion of CyC-AP at the cellular level, we investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathways of CyC-AP null and wild-type mice during skin wound healing. Methods:? Two-month-old CyC-AP null or wild-type mice were anesthetized and two 0.6?cm diameter excisional skin wounds were made on the dorsum of each mouse. Wounds were collected up to 10 days after injury. Total protein was purified from each wound and the protein expression of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE), integrin beta 1, ERK 1, ERK 2, p38, PCNA, and smooth muscle actin (sm-actin) was analyzed by immunoblot. Results:? TNFα expression was higher in CyC-AP null mice in unwounded skin. However, the elevated TNFα in CyC-AP null wounds was lower compared to the wild-type mice. To further understand the relationship of CyC-AP and TNFα, TACE expression was examined. TACE expression was less in the skin of CyC-AP null mice compared to wild-type mice. Expression of p38 and PCNA increased while sm-actin decreased in both unwounded and wounded CyC-AP null skin compared to wild type. PCNA expression in CyC-AP null fibroblasts was also higher compared to wild type, supporting our in vivo observations. In addition, the expression of integrin beta 1 was lower during wound healing. Conclusion:? The increased PCNA and decreased sm-actin expression suggests that CyC-AP null fibroblasts have higher proliferation and lower differentiation rates compared to wild types. These effects might be regulated through the p38 signaling pathway, which was increased in CyC-AP null mice. The decreased TACE expression in CyC-AP null skin suggests CyC-AP may also regulate TACE via the altered expression of integrin beta 1. Our data suggest CyC-AP is involved in TNFα activation.

AB  - Fibrin clot formation during normal wound healing is essential to hemostasis. Fibrin clots also serve as a scaffold for cells, such as fibroblasts, invading the wound bed. The mechanical characteristics of this fibrin ? fibroblast tissue over a period of time, as the fibrin is replaced with collagen, is not well understood. In this paper, we attempt to measure specific mechanical characteristics in these systems over a period of 10 days by using fibrin ? fibroblasts constructs prepared in a culture dish. We have also examined the effect of fibrinogen and thrombin concentration in the final fibrin clot on these characteristics. A well-established indentation protocol was used to determine the nominal elastic modulus of the cell-fibrin constructs at specified time points. Human fibroblast cell line CRL-2522 was used. Fibrin clots with different fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were prepared as described in Cox et al. (Tissue Engineering, Vol. 10 (5/6): 942) with cell concentration of 50,000 fibroblasts per fibrin clot. Four constructs were prepared for each of the following days 1, 5, and 10. 1?mL of a serum ? containing medium was added to each well, and plates were transferred to a 5% CO2 incubator at 37?°C. On days 1, 5, and 10, the fibrin ? fibroblast constructs were subject to a compressive indentation protocol. This involved applying a circular, flat-ended silica indenter to the surface of the cell/fibrin constructs through controlled displacements until reaching a specified maximum displacement, u*. An Instron 3365 Universal Testing Machine equipped with a 2.5?N load cell with a load resolution of 0.1?mN was used. Displacement rates in the range of 5?10?mm/min were used with peak displacements, u*?=?0.1?5?mm. The force required to maintain these displacements was automatically recorded and analyzed for indentation stiffness over the fixed displacement range of 1.0?1.5?mm at 50?msec intervals. Our results indicate that for the unpopulated fibrin, there was a linear (R?=?0.983) relationship between the indentation stiffness and fibrinogen concentration. Also, there was a nonlinear relationship between indentation stiffness and concentration of collagen in the fibrin/collagen constructs. Finally, we found in one of the cell-populated formulations a steady decrease in the indentation stiffness with increasing incubation time (1?10 days), suggesting that the cells exerted a significant effect on the construct structure and hence mechanical function.
