AB  - Abstract Background Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes motor and sensory defects, has strong impact on life quality and still has no effective therapy. Miconazole is one of the most widely used antifungal drugs; the aims of the study were to investigate the effects of miconazole during sciatic nerve regeneration in a mouse model of sciatic nerve crush injury. Methods We established peripheral nerve crush model and investigated the effects of miconazole by multiple aspects. We further studied the potential mechanism of action of miconazole by Western blotting, fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and PCR analysis. Results Miconazole improves the symptoms of crushed nerve by improving inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelinating myelin of sciatic nerve. Affected by miconazole, the proportion of inflammatory M1 macrophages in the distal part of the sciatic nerve was reduced, and the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was increased. Finally, the neuroprotective properties of miconazole may be regulated by the nuclear factor (NF)-?B pathway. Conclusions Our data suggest that miconazole can effectively alleviate PNI, and the mechanism involves mediating a phenotype change of M1/ M2 macrophages. Thus, miconazole may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for nerve crush injury.

AB  - Extracellular matrix laminins are the major noncollagenous components in the basement membrane zones (BMZ) and influence a variety of important biological processes including cell attachment, migration, and tissue development. A newly discovered laminin family member, laminin 10 (alpha 5, beta 1, and gamma 1), is found a major laminin present in the BMZs at the dermal-epidermal junction and dermal microvascular vessels. We examined the roles of laminin 10 in cutaneous wound repair in vitro and in vivo. Purified laminin 10 protein promoted human keratinocyte spreading and attachment, which is mediated by integrins. In human wound lesions, immunoperoxidase staining, with antibody 4C7 specific to laminin alpha 5 chain, stained strongly positive for laminin 10 in newly formed BMZs of epidermis and dermal blood vessels. Using a laminin 10 alpha 5 chain knockout mouse, excisional wounds in this model had abnormal reepithelialization and decreased granulation tissue formation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the BMZ of the mutant skin showed discontinuous lamina densa formation in areas between hemidesmosomes. In a porcine burn wound model, Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis found significant higher expression of laminin 10 shortly after wounding and persisted through day 21, peaking at day 10. This expression pattern is consistent with the reconstitution of BMZs in the epidermis and microvascular blood vessels. These studies indicate that laminin 10 plays important roles in wound healing by promoting cell migration, BMZ assembly, reepithelialization, and angiogenesis. This study was supported by grants from NIH/NIAMES, DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.

AB  - Removal of necrotic tissue is essential for wound-bed preparation for the treatment of chronic wounds. Enzymatic debridement appears to be most useful in the removal of eschar when surgical techniques cannot be utilized. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of papain?urea chlorophyllin ointment compared to moist wound care using an infected, acute, porcine full thickness wound model. Twenty full thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of domestic pigs. Following hemostasis, the wounds were contaminated with wound-isolated bacteria then treated with test articles and dressed with moisture-retentive dressing. All the wounds were evaluated 1, 4, 8, 11, 14,18, and 21 days postsurgery for epithelialization and biopsies were obtained for microscopic evaluation. The results showed no adverse effect in reepithelialization in acute wounds when using papain?urea chlorophyllin 'ointment compared to moist wound care, TEWL measurements also showed no adverse affects from the treatment. Microscopic examination reveals an increase in the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis of the treated pigs as well as an increase in the depth of rete pegs. New blood vessel formation was increased at all examined time points in the papain?urea chlorophyllin ointment treated pigs, which was verified with CD31 and von Willebrand Factor staining. VEGF was increased after 1 week in the wound fluid from treated wounds compared to moist control. While the reepithelialization rate does not appear to be inhibited by papain?urea-chlorophyllin combination in acute wounds, the healing appears to be more complete based on the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis and the extensive rete peg formation. The wounds also appear to have enhanced vascularization which is vital in supplying nutrients to the newly healed wound.

AB  - One of the well-known enzymatic debriders is a papain?urea-chlorophyllin ointment. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of this ointment compared with single variable Papain-urea, Copper chlorophyllin, or Urea base ointment and moist wound care in porcine full thickness wounds. Twenty full thickness wounds were made on the dorsum of domestic pigs. Following hemostasis, the wounds were contaminated with wound-isolated bacteria, treated with test articles, and dressed with moisture-retentive dressing. All the wounds were evaluated 1, 4, 8, 11, 14, 18, and 21 days postsurgery visually and biopsies were obtained for microscopy. The results showed no impairment in the rate of epithelialization of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin treatment, nor with single variable actives compared with moist wound care. Microscopic examination revealed an increase in the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain-treated wounds, and an increase in the depth of rete pegs. Blood vessel formation was increased in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin, papain, and Copper chlorophyllin groups compared to the moist control tissue as seen with CD31 and von Willebrand Factor staining, and was most evident in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin-treated tissues. VEGF was increased after 1 week in the wounds treated with papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain compared to vehicle, indicating a possible mechanism for neovascularization. The increase was not seen in the Copper chlorophyllin group, indicating the possibility of another mechanism for blood vessel formation in this group. The healing appears to be most complete in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin group based on epidermal morphology and enhanced vascularization, which is vital in supplying nutrients to the newly healed wound.

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Electrospinning is a nonmechanical processing strategy that is used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of submicron diameter, banded fibrils of collagen. In biocompatibility tests these fibers are nonimmunogenic. Fiber diameter can be manipulated over a wide range by regulating the concentration of collagen present in the starting electrospinning solutions. Table 1 illustrates average fiber diameters and pore dimensions achieved under different conditions. Collagen Concentration Fiber Diameter Pore Area 40?mgs/ml TFE ???113?±?51?nm ????184?±?87.6?nm2 60?mgs/ml TFE ???304?±?120?nm ?1,311?±?384?nm2 80?mgs/ml TFE ???761?±?276?nm ?4,913?±?3978?nm2 100?mgs/ml TFE ???745?±?314?nm ?5,039?±?2947?nm2 120?mgs/ml TFE 1,534?±?448?nm 19,154?±?20809?nm2 We prepared four 1?cm2 full thickness dermal injuries on the dorsum of the guinea pig. Electrospun scaffolds composed of different fiber diameters were cut to fit the defects, sutured in place and then recovered at 7 and 14 days. Injuries treated with scaffolds composed of electrospun collagen fibers greater than 300?nm in diameter exhibited extensive tongue formation, dense dermal cell infiltration and functional capillary beds. Dermal regeneration was substantially complete by 14 days. Scaffolds prepared with individual fiber diameters of less than 300?nm were well epithelialized but, less densely 'populated by dermal fibroblasts and capillaries. Fibrils of electrospun gelatin, a collagen isolate that is heat denatured prior to electrospinning, lack the banded appearance of electrospun collagen. Scaffolds of electrospun gelatin were less densely infiltrated than electrospun collagen at all fiber diameters and pore dimensions, and induced inflammation. We conclude that banded fibrils of electrospun collagen have unique biological activity. Funded in part NIH R01 EB003087. US & International Patents Issued and Pending.

AB  - Introduction:? Myofibroblasts are a subtype of fibroblasts, which appear temporally during wound healing. Young hypertrophic scar contains a large number of myofibroblasts and the number declines over time. It has been shown that deep partial-thickness wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars, which is similar to hypertrophic scar. As part of our validation of the Duroc model of hypertrophic scarring, we evaluated myofibroblasts in wounds on the Duroc pigs. Methods:? Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of 12 Durocs. Biopsies were taken at weeks 1, 2, 4, 15, and 21 postwounding. Samples were analyzed by immunochemical staining for alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA, for myofibroblasts) and heat-shock protein (HSP47, for fibroblasts). HSP47 positive cells were counted at 40X and the fraction of a-SMA positive cells out of fibroblasts was evaluated at 10X. Statistical significance was calculated with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results:? The counts of HSP47 and a-SMA positive cells are shown in the table below. In brief, in deep wounds most of the HSP47 positive cells were a-SMA positive at 1 and 2 weeks but this declined rapidly thereafter. In shallow wounds there were far fewer cells positive for a-SMA and the decline was even more rapid. 1W 2W 4W 15W 21W Number Shallow 105?±?22 151?±?59 106?±?23 ?57?±?20 44?±?4 HSP47 Deep 524?±?45 449?±?35 231?±?73 108?±?30 55?±?8 P value <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Percent Shallow 23% 3% 0 0 0 a-SMA Deep 90% 74% 10% 0 0 P value <0.05 <0.05 Conclusions:? a-SMA positive fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) are present in deep Duroc wounds and the temporal pattern is similar to that reported for human hypertrophic scar. This further validates the female red Duroc model of human hypertrophic scarring.

AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during wound healing. The chemokine IL-8 is a well-known inflammatory and angiogenic factor. We found that IL-8 stimulates activation of SREBPs, molecules that are critical for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and that this activation is markedly increased during IL-8-induced angiogenesis. Two important processes in the early stages of angiogenesis are increase in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, we tested whether IL-8 stimulates these processes in a SREBP-dependent manner both in vivo and in culture. Our data show that IL-8 stimulates SREBP-1 and -2 gene expression which leads to an increase in both the precursor and the mature forms of these proteins in human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC). In addition, several genes downstream of SREBPs are also up-regulated by IL-8 stimulation, in particular 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCA). Furthermore, SREBP-1 was abundant in the neovasculature of wound healing skin, and this expression could be suppressed by local application of antibodies to IL-8 or to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. To test whether SREBP activation is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by IL-8 during angiogenesis, we used either RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi for maturation (activation), or treated endothelial cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Both SCAP RNAi and 25-HC significantly inhibited IL-8-induced SREBP activation during endothelial cell migration and proliferation indicating that SREBPs are critical components of the signaling pathways leading to IL8-induced angiogenesis. In addition, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, 25-HC markedly inhibited both developmental- and IL-8-induced angiogenesis in 7-day and 10-day CAMs, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-8-induced angiogenesis that is mediated by SREBPs.

AB  - Summary Toxic, nutritional and metabolic derangements can cause damage to the nervous system by a variety of mechanisms and lead to a wide spectrum of characteristic neurological disorders. This chapter includes a review of the effects of accidental and deliberate exposure to industrial and environmental toxins and drugs of addiction including alcohol. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) occurs in the liver and ovaries of puffer fish, toad fish and some types of crabs. Exposure to radiation occurs naturally but this is low intensity and carries few risks. Direct high pressure injury to the CNS leads to a progressive rest or intention tremor, myoclonus, hyper-reflexia and transient cognitive and memory disturbance. Alcohol abuse is extremely common and is associated with important cultural, economic and environmental influences and consequences. The chapter presents neurological disease seen in adult patients with inherited disorders of metabolism. It discusses the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, investigation and management of adult onset leukodystrophy.

AB  - Abstract Resolution of inflammation is a coordinated and active process aimed at restoration of tissue integrity and function. This review integrates the key molecular and cellular mechanisms of resolution. We describe how abrogation of chemokine signalling blocks continued neutrophil tissue infiltration and how apoptotic neutrophils attract monocytes and macrophages to induce their clearance. Uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages reprograms macrophages towards a resolving phenotype, a key event to restore tissue homeostasis. Finally, we highlight the therapeutic potential that derives from understanding the mechanisms of resolution.
