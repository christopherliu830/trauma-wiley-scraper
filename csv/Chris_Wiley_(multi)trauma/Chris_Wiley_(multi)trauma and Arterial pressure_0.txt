AB  - Summary.? Background:?Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for almost a decade for hemophilic patients with inhibitors. Its off-label use as a hemostatic agent in massive bleeding caused by a wide array of clinical scenarios is rapidly expanding. While evidence-based guidelines exist for rFVIIa treatment in hemophilia, none are available for its off-label use. Objectives:?The aim of this study is to develop expert recommendations for the use of rFVIIa in patients suffering from uncontrolled bleeding (with special emphasis on trauma) until randomized, controlled trials allow for the introduction of more established evidence-based guidelines. Methods:?A multidisciplinary task force comprising representatives of the relevant National Medical Associations, experts from the Medical Corps of the Army, Ministry of Health and the Israel National Trauma Advisory Board was established in Israel. Recommendations were construed based on the analysis of the first 36 multi-trauma patients accumulated in the prospective national registry of the use of rFVIIa in trauma, and an extensive literature search consisting of published and prepublished controlled animal trials, case reports and series. The final consensus guidelines, together with the data of the first 36 trauma patients treated in Israel, are presented in this article. Results:?Results of the first 36 trauma patients: The prolonged clotting assays [prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)] shortened significantly within minutes following administration of rFVIIa. Cessation of bleeding was achieved in 26 of 36 (72%) patients. Acidosis diminished the hemostatic effect of the drug, while hypothermia did not affect it. The survival rate of 61% (22/36) seems to be favorable compared with published series of similar, or less severe, trauma patients (range 30%?57%). Conclusions:?As a result of the lack of controlled trials, our guidelines should be considered as suggestive rather than conclusive. However, they provide a valuable tool for physicians using rFVIIa for the expanding off-label clinical uses.

AB  - Background: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptaminei agonist (sumatriptan). Methods: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan: 0.01 mg·kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg·kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg·kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg·kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro. Results: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro. Conclusion: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.

AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Lung hyperinflation is a technique used by physiotherapists to mobilize and remove excess bronchial secretions, reinflate areas of pulmonary collapse and improve oxygenation. Hyperinflation may be delivered by the ventilator or manually, by use of a manual resuscitation circuit, depending upon the respiratory and cardiovascular status of the patient. The effects of manual hyperinflation, with respect to excess bronchial secretions and static lung compliance, have been well-established. There is, however, only limited evidence as to the efficacy of ventilator hyperinflation as a physiotherapy treatment technique. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation on static pulmonary compliance and sputum clearance in stable intubated and ventilated patients. Method Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied. This was a double crossover study where all patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences over two days. The first sequence involved manual hyperinflation followed two hours later by ventilator hyperinflation and the order was reversed on the second day. In the second sequence, ventilator hyperinflation preceded manual hyperinflation. The variables of static pulmonary compliance and sputum wet weight were analysed by use of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results There was no significant difference in sputum wet weight production between either technique or on either day of treatment. Static pulmonary compliance improved with both hyperinflation techniques (p < 0.05). Conclusions Hyperinflation as part of a physiotherapy treatment can be performed with equal benefit using either a manual resuscitation circuit or a ventilator. Both methods of hyperinflation improve static pulmonary compliance and clear similar volumes of pulmonary secretions. Copyright ? 2002 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aimed to determine factors related to ICU mortality in critically ill patients transferred by Adult Retrieval Victoria (ARV) medical staff. Patients who died in ICU after interhospital transfer were compared against those who survived. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of ARV cases between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010. Retrieval data were linked with data from the ANZICS CORE APD (Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation Adult Patient Database). Victoria Data Linkage (VDL) performed linkage of data. Data included demographic and clinical data obtained during transfer and clinical data recorded in ICU. Results Of the 601 cases transferred by ARV during the study period, 549 cases were eligible for linkage to 25?543 ANZICS APD case records for the same period. VDL matched 460 of these cases (83.8%). Mortality rate in the matched sample was 13.9%. Variables associated with mortality were: advanced age (odds ratios [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00?1.04, P = 0.02), principal referral problem cardiac (OR 1.84, 95%CI 1.02?3.32, P = 0.04), lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95?0.99, P = 0.005) and tachycardia (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00?1.03, P = 0.008) on arrival at destination hospital. Conclusions Advanced age, lower mean arterial blood pressure and tachycardia towards the completion of transfer were associated with increased ICU mortality in this population. Clinicians should be aware of the additional risk for cardiac patients.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.
