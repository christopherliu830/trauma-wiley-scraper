AB  - Introduction: Mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs. When it results in congestive heart failure (CHF), MVD becomes an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Markers for determining the severity of cardiac injury and the heart's response to therapy might provide valuable information regarding the overall prognosis early in the course of CHF. This information might also provide a means for identifying those dogs with MVD that are at risk for CHF and those that might benefit from specific therapeutic interventions. In this study, we propose to investigate markers of cardiac myocyte injury in dogs that present in advanced (or Class IV) CHF due to MVD. Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and cardiac troponin T (CTnT) are markers specific for cardiac myocyte damage, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP and pro-BNP), for myocyte stretch. These markers have shown predictive value in human and veterinary medicine, however further investigation is required. It is our hypothesis that one or more of these markers will be elevated at presentation compared to established laboratory normal values. Methods: Fifteen dogs that presented with Class IV CHF due to MVD based on physical examination findings, thoracic radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound had a blood sample drawn to measure serum levels of CTnT, CTnI and BNP, and pro-BNP at a commercial laboratory using immunoassays. Results: Our results show that 1 of 15 dogs had an elevated CTnT, 6 had an elevated CTnI, 0 had an elevated pro-BNP, and 3 had and elevated BNP level above laboratory normal values. Conclusions: There was no consistent elevation of CTnI, CTnT, BNP or pro-BNP in dogs with class IV CHF due to MR at time of presentation. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate these makers in dogs with CHF due to MR at varying intervals after admission to determine their potential benefits as markers of cardiac injury and response to therapy.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) in unselected critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Methods: Prospective, observational cohort study in 25 intensive care units in Finland. This study included a total of 602 patients with laboratory samples from 958 consecutive patients with ARF treated either with invasive or with non-invasive ventilatory support (the FINNALI study). Plasma NT-pro-BNP samples were drawn after the onset of ventilatory support (day 0) and on the morning of the second day. Results: The median [interquartile ranges (IQR)] NT-pro-BNP-values were significantly higher at baseline in 90-day non-survivors than the survivors, 4378?pg/ml (1400?13,943?pg/ml) vs. 1052?pg/ml (232?4076?pg/ml), respectively. The median (IQR) NT-pro-BNP values were significantly higher in patients with chronic cardiac disease or cardiac surgery than in non-cardiac patients, 1947?pg/ml (801?4687?pg/ml) vs. 417?pg/ml (153?1735?pg/ml), respectively, if renal function was normal. With deteriorating renal function, the NT-pro-BNP values showed a significant increase. The area under curve for baseline NT-pro-BNP predicting 90-day mortality was moderate: 0.718 (95% confidence interval 0.674?0.761). Baseline NT-pro-BNP over 1765?pg/ml was independently associated with 90-day mortality by logistic regression analysis (P<0.001). Conclusions: NT-pro-BNP on admission is commonly elevated and independently associated with 90-day mortality in critically ill ARF patients. However, the routine use of NT-pro-BNP for prognostic purpose does not seem to add value to clinical data in ARF patients.

AB  - Background:? The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the haemodynamic profile of patients with extensive burns during the early fluid resuscitation phase, (2) evaluate myocardial performance by invasive monitoring and echocardiography and (3) analyze the relations between serum cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and natriuretic peptide (ANP, BNP) concentrations and myocardial function in these patients. Methods:? Prospective, clinical study in a tertiary care burn centre. Invasive haemodynamic measurements including a pulmonary artery catheter, echocardiography, blood samples for cytokine and atriopeptide analyses. The follow-up time was up to 72?h postinjury. Results:? According to echocardiography, patients were hypovolaemic despite aggressive (median 7,9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 3.3?11.7) fluid resuscitation and adequate urine output (median 0.9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 0.46?1.35) during the first day postinjury. There were no consistent findings of hyperlactatemia, metabolic acidosis or low mixed venous oxygen saturations. Daily highest and lowest values of cardiac index and stroke volume index increased and the lowest and highest values of systemic vascular resistance decreased. Cardiac performance (stroke volume index) improved during the study period even though there were no initial signs of myocardial depression in echocardiography. Three patients received a dobutamine infusion based on clinical judgement. There was no consistent association between haemodynamic changes and plasma cytokine concentrations. Conclusion:? Persisting hypovolaemia is evident in the resuscitation phase of extensive burns despite aggressive fluid therapy and the lack of classic signs of hypoperfusion. Cardiac performance improves during the first days after extensive burn injury without association with plasma cytokine profile.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in infants and children with acute lung injury (ALI), and to investigate associations between BNP levels and clinical outcome. Design Prospective observational study. Subjects After informed consent, plasma was collected from 48 pediatric patients on day 1 of ALI. Methodology Plasma BNP levels were measured by immunoassay on day 1 of ALI in 48 pediatric patients. Associations between BNP levels and outcome were determined. Results The mean PaO2/FiO2 at the onset of ALI was 155 (±74) and BNP values ranged from 5 to 2,060?pg/ml with a mean of 109 (±311). BNP levels were inversely correlated with ventilator-free days (Spearman rho ?0.30, P?=?0.04), and positively correlated with exhaled tidal volume (Spearman rho 0.44, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were higher in patients receiving inotropic support (n?=?12) than patients not receiving inotropic support (n?=?33, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were correlated with PRISM III scores (Spearman rho 0.55, P?<?0.001) and PELOD scores (Spearman rho 0.4, P?=?0.006). Mortality for the cohort was 15%. BNP levels were higher in non-survivors (n?=?7) than survivors (n?=?41, P?=?0.055). Conclusions BNP levels are elevated in children with ALI/ARDS early in the disease course, and increased levels are associated with worse clinical outcome.

AB  - Aims Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy. Methods and results This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

AB  - Abstract Acute poisonings represent a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prognostic utility of the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters combined with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in acute poisoning with different xenobiotics, upon admission in the hospital, was not evaluated. This prospective observational cohort study included 229 acutely poisoned non-diabetic adults, with a median age of 44 years (range 18?90 years), 50.7% women, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 8.7%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, the left ventricle kinetic abnormalities, the E-wave deceleration time (EDT) and BNP correlated significantly with mortality in acutely poisoned patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that only EDT [odds ratio (OR) 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54?7.69, p 0.003], BNP (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02?2.55, p 0.04) and age (OR 2.66, 95% CI: 1.23?5.76, p 0.013) are predictive for mortality. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis proved EDT [area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.85; CI: 0.76?0.94; p 0.001], BNP (AUC, 0.83; CI: 0.75?0.91; p 0.001) and age (AUC, 0.82; CI: 0.74?0.90; p 0.001) as indicators for fatalities. In hospitalized patients acutely intoxicated with undifferentiated poisons, EDT as a parameter of left ventricle diastolic function and BNP are useful to early predict mortality.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.

AB  - This study aimed to assess whether the combination of a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level with various noninvasive hemodynamic parameters can help physicians more quickly and accurately diagnose congestive heart failure and determine the type of left ventricular dysfunction present in patients presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea. Subjects were 98 men (aged 64.57±1.23 years) that presented to the VA San Diego Healthcare System. Hemodynamic parameters were measured using impedance cardiography, and BNP levels were quantified using a rapid immunoassay. All patients with a BNP <100 pg/mL (n=37) had no evidence of congestive heart failure 97% of the time. In those with a BNP >100 pg/mL (601 ±55 pg/mL; n=61), a cardiac index of 2.6 L/min/m2 is 65% sensitive and 88% specific in determining systolic dysfunction. In patients with a BNP >100 pg/mL, a multivariate model consisting of noninvasive hemodynamic measurements was able to predict cardiac deaths, readmissions, and emergency department visits within 90 days with 83% accuracy. The authors conclude that, in patients presenting to an emergency department with dyspnea, the addition of impedance cardiography measurements to BNP level measurements will more effectively diagnose congestive heart failure and determine both the type of heart dysfunction and the severity of illness.

AB  - Aims Previous evaluations of natriuretic peptide (NP) levels in patients with acute dyspnoea presenting to the emergency department (ED) have selected only a minority of patients for echocardiography. We aimed to evaluate the association between NPs and more subtle echocardiographic findings and to assess the potential for NPs to provide additional prognostic information beyond that provided by echocardiography in ?all-comers? with acute dyspnoea. Methods and results Prospective echocardiograms were performed on 338/412 patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnoea. B-type natriuretic peptide and NT-proBNP were measured on presentation. Patients were followed-up for 1 year. Decompensated heart failure was diagnosed in 37% of patients and 13% died. The diagnostic accuracy (c-statistic) of BNP and NT-proBNP for identifying LVEF ≤ 40% was 0.88 (P < 0.001) and 0.86 (P < 0.001), respectively. The c-statistics for BNP and NT-proBNP for identifying diastolic dysfunction were 0.67 (P < 0.001) and 0.67 (P < 0.001); but only 0.57 (P = 0.09) and 0.60 (P = 0.02) in patients with LVEF ≥ 50%. Natriuretic peptides, but not LV mass or diastolic parameters, independently predicted mortality at 1 year in all patients and in those with an LVEF ≥ 50%. Conclusion In an acute dyspnoea population with ?all-comers? undergoing echocardiography, NPs correlate strongly with structural abnormalities and identify those with preserved LVEF at highest risk for death. Careful interpretation of elevated NP values is needed in the presence of preserved systolic function.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives.? The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the circulation is approximately 10- to 50- fold higher than B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). We sought to compare the accuracy of midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) measured with a novel sandwich immunoassay with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) in the diagnosis of heart failure. Design.? The diagnosis of heart failure was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists using all available clinical data (including BNP levels) in 287 consecutive patients presenting with dyspnoea to the emergency department (ED). MRproANP and NTproBNP levels were determined at presentation in a blinded fashion. Results.? Heart failure was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 154 patients (54%). Median MRproANP was significantly higher in patients with heart failure as compared to patients with other causes of dyspnoea (400 vs. 92?pmol?L?1, P?<?0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of MRproANP was very high with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 and was comparable with that of NTproBNP (0.92, P?=?0.791). Moreover, MRproANP provided incremental diagnostic information to BNP and NTproBNP in patients presenting with BNP levels in the grey zone between 100 and 500?pg?mL?1. Conclusion.? Midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide is as accurate in the diagnosis of heart failure as NTproBNP. MRproANP seems to provide incremental information on top of BNP or NT-proBNP in some subgroups and should be further investigated in other studies.

AB  - Abstract Anti-infectives used to treat chronic exuding wounds are diluted by wound exudates, absorbed into dressings, metabolised by proteases and destroyed by pH. In order to mimic such effects of exudates, the efficacy of six topical wound agents was assessed undiluted and at 10% concentrations, including povidone-iodine ointment and a silver-impregnated wound dressing, to remove biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-species biofilms of Candida albicans and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reactor. Povidone-iodine was also diluted to 3·3% and 33·3% of the commercial concentrations. Viable microorganisms in each preparation were quantified by colony count. No viable P. aeruginosa biofilm material was recovered after 4 and 24 hours of treatment with povidone-iodine ointment at the 100% and 10% concentrations. No C. albicans/MRSA biofilm material was recovered after 4 and 24 hours of treatment with povidone-iodine ointment at the 100% concentration. In general, following dilution, povidone-iodine ointment appeared to exhibit greater biofilm removal than the other agents tested. Further research involving different microorganisms in vitro and in vivo over a longer period of time will help elucidate the full potential of povidone-iodine ointment and liposomal hydrogel.

AB  - Summary Nesiritide is a recombinant formulation of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Preliminary experience in the adult population has shown nesiritide to be an effective agent in the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) in adults. Given its physiological effects, it may be an effective agent in other clinical scenarios. We report the use of nesiritide in two infants during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In one patient, nesiritide in doses up to 0.09??g·kg?1·min?1 were used to control mean arterial pressure while in the other patient, doses of 0.01?0.03??g·kg?1·min?1 were used to augment urine output. The potential applications of nesiritide and dosing regimens for this agent in the ECMO population are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Aims To estimate the incremental cost, cost-effectiveness and benefit?cost ratio of incorporating a significant other (SO) into motivational intervention for alcohol misuse. Design We obtained economic data from the one year with the intervention in full operation for patients in a recent randomized trial. Setting The underlying trial took place at a major urban hospital in the United States. Participants The trial randomized 406 (68.7% male) eligible hazardous drinkers (196 during the economic study) admitted to the emergency department or trauma unit. Intervention The motivational interview condition consisted of one in-person session featuring personalized normative feedback. The significant other motivational interview condition comprised one joint session with the participant and SO in which the SO's perspective and support were elicited. Measurements We ascertained activities across 445 representative time segments through work sampling (including staff idle time), calculated the incremental cost in per patient of incorporating an SO, expressed the results in 2014 US$, incorporated quality and mortality effects from a closely related trial and derived the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Findings From a health system perspective, the incremental cost per patient of adding an SO was $341.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) = $244.44?437.74]. The incremental cost per year per hazardous drinker averted was $3623 (CI = $1777?22 709), the cost per QALY gained $32 200 (CI = $15 800?201 700), and the benefit?cost ratio was 4.73 (95% CI = 0.7?9.66). If adding an SO into the intervention strategy were concentrated during the hours with highest risk or in a trauma unit, it would become even more cost-beneficial. Conclusions Using criteria established by the World Health Organization (cost-effectiveness below the country's gross domestic product per capita), incorporating a significant other into a patient's motivational intervention for alcohol misuse is highly cost-effective.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents in a continuum of severity that spans from incidentally discovered subsegmental PE to massive PE resulting in cardiogenic shock and death. The main cause of death in patients with large PE is right ventricular failure, cardiogenic shock, and refractory hypoxemia. Rapid recanalization of the pulmonary arteries is the ultimate goal of all therapies for acute PE, regardless if pharmacologic, surgical, or catheter-based. All patients presenting with PE should be risk-stratified with the goal of: identifying patients who are at high risk of dying if they do not receive treatment with thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy; and identifying patients who are likely to develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Normotensive patients with acute PE who have any of the following factors at presentation are at increased risk of death and clinical deterioration: RV systolic dysfunction, RV dilatation, elevated plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or evidence of myocardial injury.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.
