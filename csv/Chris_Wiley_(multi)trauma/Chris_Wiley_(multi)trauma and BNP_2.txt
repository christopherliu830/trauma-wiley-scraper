AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of the current literature that examines impulsivity in individuals with eating disorders (ED). Studies were obtained from Embase, Pubmed and Psycinfo, and were included if they assessed impulsivity in individuals over 18 years of age with an ED diagnosis and published in the last 10 years. The methodological quality of the studies was rated. Twelve studies were included in this review, with methodological quality varying across studies. Findings suggest that impulsivity is best assessed multi-modally, with a combination of self-report, behavioural and physiological measures. In general, impulsivity was found to differentiate individuals with EDs from controls, as well as across diagnostic subtypes. The current findings have important clinical implications for our understanding and treatment of both impulsivity and eating disorders.

AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism is a major public health issue, for it is responsible for an estimated 60,000 annual deaths in the United Kingdom. Up to 30% of those affected by deep vein thrombosis have post phlebitic syndrome. Of these 55% are hospital ? acquired, the majority of which can be prevented by appropriate thromboprophylaxis. The main risk factors for venous thromboembolism include immobility, venous perturbation and a prothrombotic state. This chapter covers the diagnosis and immediate management of acute venous thromboembolisms including in pregnancy and in those with an underlying malignancy. The principles of primary and secondary prevention are also discussed.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Summary The end-stage renal disease patient on dialysis is susceptible to a variety of emergent medical problems. This chapter reviews the disorders that bring these patients to the emergency department (ED) and the special considerations in their diagnostic evaluation and initial management. The care of these patients is very complex and close collaboration between the emergency physician and the nephrology team is mandatory.
