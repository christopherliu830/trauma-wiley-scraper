AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by multiple genetic and/or environmental etiologies. Because differences in the genetically determined pathogenesis may cause differences in the phenotype, we examined age at onset and age at death in 90 subjects with dominantly inherited AD due to different mutations (amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1, and presenilin-2 genes). We found that among patients with dominantly inherited AD, genetic factors influence both age at onset and age at death. Ann Neurol 2000;48:376?379

AB  - Abstract The detection of 14-3-3 protein by Western immunoblot is a sensitive and specific cerebrospinal fluid marker of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). We developed a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that reliably detects 14-3-3 in cerebrospinal fluid. In a prospective study of 147 cerebrospinal fluid samples, the mean 14-3-3 concentration among pathologically confirmed CJD patients (28.0 ± 20.6 ng/ml, n = 41) is significantly higher than the mean in the cerebrospinal fluid of those with other neurological disorders (3.1 ± 2.9 ng/ml, n = 84). At a cutoff value of 8.3 ng/ml, the ELISA has a sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 97.6%. The 14-3-3 ELISA supports a diagnosis of CJD in patients who fulfill clinical criteria for possible CJD. Ann Neurol 2000;48:395?398

AB  - Abstract Recently, a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) with end-plate acetylcholine receptor (AChR) deficiency due to missense mutations in the genes for the AChR subunit was described. The first observed patient with this CMS was heteroallelic for the two ε-AChR subunit mutations ε1101insT and ε1293insG. This patient had only a moderate phenotype with mild muscle weakness and abnormal fatigue. We have now found homozygosity for the ε1293insG mutation in a severely affected CMS patient, who lost the ability to walk in midchildhood and shows profound weakness and muscle wasting. Our observation allows a genotype-phenotype correlation illustrating how differences in the AChR mutation haplotype can profoundly influence disease severity. Ann Neurol 2000;48:379?383

AB  - Abstract We report on the pathological findings in the brains of 8 Parkinson's disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (6 cases) and subthalamic nucleus (2 cases). DBS was performed continuously for up to 70 months. All brains showed well-preserved neural parenchyma and only mild gliosis around the lead track compatible with reactive changes due to surgical placement of the electrode. We conclude that chronic DBS does not cause damage to adjacent brain tissue. Ann Neurol 2000;48:372?376

AB  - Abstract Two infants developed unilateral hippocampal swelling on magnetic resonance imaging after prolonged seizures of temporal origin. Subsequent images suggested hippocampal sclerosis. The first child had febrile status epilepticus with exanthem subitum and developed refractory complex partial seizures. Histological findings after temporal lobectomy confirmed hippocampal sclerosis but also revealed sequelae of a focal encephalitis and microdysgenesis of the hippocampus. The second child had signs of brain dysgenesis, but acquired hippocampal damage affecting each side successively was documented by serial magnetic resonance imaging. These cases illustrate that different clinical conditions combining preexisting and acquired pathological characteristics can lead to hippocampal sclerosis. Ann Neurol 2000;48:384?387

A common polymorphism within ACT and IL-1? genes affected plasma levels of ACT or IL-1?, and AD patients with the ACT T,T or IL-1? T,T genotype showed the highest levels of plasma ACT or IL-1?, respectively. The concomitant presence of the ACT T,T and IL-1? T,T genotypes increased the risk of AD (odds ratio: 5.606, confidence interval: 1.654?18.996) and decreased the age at onset of the disease. Ann Neurol 2000;48:388?391

AB  - Abstract Based on surrogate assays of peripheral red blood cells, reports state that widely prescribed doses of donepezil hydrochloride provide nearly complete inhibition of cerebral cortical acetylcholinesterase activity in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To test this, direct positron emission tomography measures of cerebral acetylcholinesterase activity were made in AD patients before and after treatment with donepezil (5 and 10 mg/day) for at least 5 weeks and compared with similar measures in normal controls who were untreated or after acute administration of another AChE inhibitor, physostigmine salicylate (1.5 mg/hr). After physostigmine, acetylcholinesterase inhibition averaged 52% in normal cerebral cortex. After donepezil, cerebral cortical inhibition in AD brain averaged only 27%. Clinical trials of this donepezil dose schedule are not testing the effect of nearly complete cerebral cortical inhibition. Ann Neurol 2000;48:391?395

AB  - Abstract Diuretics are agents that increase urine output or flow. The effects of diuretic agents on electrolyte and water excretion in the kidney for the treatment of edema, congestive heart failure, ascites, and hypertension are reviewed. The structure and function of the kidney in the formation of urine are presented using the functional unit of the kidney, the nephron. The various sites where absorption, secretion, and the passive and active transport of water and electrolytes alter the composition of the glomerular filtrate from Bowman's capsule as it passes through the lumen of the nephron to the collecting ducts on its way to becoming urine are described. Diuretics are classified as low ceiling, high ceiling (loop), and potassium-sparing diuretics, natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide potentiators, osmotic diuretics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, methylxanthines, organomercurials, and aquaretics. The pharmacology, mechanisms or site of action in the nephron, and clinical effectiveness are discussed. Included is a discussion of the risk factors and side effects of diuretic agents.

AB  - Abstract Bone and cartilage tissue engineering is an integrative approach that is inspired by the phenomena associated with wound healing. In this respect, growth factors have emerged as important moieties for the control and regulation of this process. Growth factors act as mediators and control the important physiological functions of bone regeneration. Herein, we discuss the importance of growth factors in bone and cartilage tissue engineering, their loading and delivery strategies, release kinetics, and their integration with biomaterials and stem cells to heal bone fractures. We also highlighted the role of growth factors in the determination of the bone tissue microenvironment based on the reciprocal signaling with cells and biomaterial scaffolds on which future bone and cartilage tissue engineering technologies and medical devices will be based upon.

AB  - Objective To ascertain contemporary overall and differential thirty-day mortality (TDM) rates after all types of nephrectomy in the UK, and to identify potential new risk factors for death. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the 110 deaths that occurred within 30 days of surgery out of the total of 21 380 nephrectomies performed, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for TDM based on peri-operative characteristics. Results The overall TDM rate was 110/21380 (0.5%). The TDM rates after radical, partial, simple nephrectomy and nephro-ureterectomy were 0.6% (63/11057), 0.1% (4/3931), 0.4% (11/2819) and 0.9% (28/3091), respectively. TDM increased with age, stage, estimated blood loss (EBL), operating time and performance status. EBL of 1?2 L was associated with a greater risk of TDM than EBL of 2?5 L (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.03?2.24). Conversion from minimally invasive surgery was associated with higher risk than non-conversion (OR 2.53; 95% CI 1.14?4.51. Curative surgery was safer than cytoreductive surgery (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.18?0.54). There was an association between surgical volume and TDM. Conclusions This study provides contemporary insights into the true risks of all types of nephrectomy. The TDM rate after nephrectomy in the UK appears acceptably low at 0.5%. Established risk factors were confirmed and the following novel risk factors were identified: modest EBL (1?2 L) and conversion from minimally invasive surgery.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating, and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the Committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Seventh Edition, like its predecessor, has consistently applied the category and grading system definitions in the fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was used since the fourth edition has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. The Seventh Edition discusses 87 fact sheets (14 new fact sheets since the Sixth Edition) for therapeutic apheresis diseases and medical conditions, with 179 indications, which are separately graded and categorized within the listed fact sheets. Several diseases that are Category IV which have been described in detail in previous editions and do not have significant new evidence since the last publication are summarized in a separate table. The Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue serves as a key resource that guides the utilization of therapeutic apheresis in the treatment of human disease. J. Clin.
