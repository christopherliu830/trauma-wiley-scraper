AB  - Diagnostic ultrasound in the early pregnancy deals with the recognition of normal anatomy and/or the detection of anomalies in very early viable pregnancies. There are clinical situations where the position of the embryo does not allow imaging of the optimal section of a certain organ. This is often the case with the transvaginal approach, where movements of the transducer are limited. Deriving new 2D images by anyplane slicing is an important presentation mode of embryonic 3D ultrasound. Geometric 3D reconstructions can also be helpful for the understanding of the embryonic anatomy. High quality 2D tomograms are the prerequisite of 3D imaging of the tiny embryo and its organs. Such ultrasound tomograms can be achieved by using annular array transducers, which have a thin elevation plane due to symmetric focussing. Examples of multiplane imaging and geometric volume reconstructions in the assessment of the embryonic anatomy will be presented, and the limitations will be discussed.

AB  - Intrauterine allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used for the prenatal treatment of severe combined immunodefiency syndrome. However, this treatment has not been successful in other conditions in which the fetus is immunologically competent. The main obstacles to success are lack of competitive advantage of donor vs. host stem cells preventing stable engraftment and graft rejection by the host immune system. Strategies to overcome these hurdles include, among others, early transplantation before 12?weeks of gestation, and increase of cells dose in the target organs (fetal liver and fetal bone marrow) which might be best achieved by the intravascular administration route. However, whilst ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal administration of the graft in the first trimester is feasible, access to the fetal circulation in the first trimester is more difficult. Combined ultrasound-guided/embryofetoscopic approach is a promising technique to achieve this goal. Thin-gauge embryofetoscopes allow the exact visualization of the optimal funipuncture site and the intravenous insertion of a 25G needle through a side-port. They thus provide an additional tool to deliver the stem cell graft to the preimmune fetus.

AB  - Background The possibility that the hyperstimulatory effect of gonadotropins may be important etiologically in the genesis of some cases of ovarian cancer is still under discussion. Few flow and image cytometric studies report on DNA aneuploid granulosa cells in follicular fluid from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The reports are very controversial. The aim of the study was to analyse relationship between ultrasound-determined follicular size and DNA ploidy of granulosa cells from gonadotropin-stimulated follicles. Method The granulosa-luteal cells were obtained from women undergoing an IVF-ET program at the University Department of obstetrics and Gynecology Ljubljana. Seventy aspirates of individual follicles (transvaginal determined size, range 15?mm ? 30?mm in diameter) from gonadotropin-stimulated cycles were analysed. Cytospins were prepared and fixed in delaunay fixative. All the slides were stained by the feulgen thionin method. Image DNA analyses was performed on automated high-resolution image cytometer. The DNA index was calculated to define DNA ploidy. Results All granulosa cell samples were found to be diploid. Conclusion Regardless of different ultrasound-determined size of follicles, all analysed granulosa cells have diploid DNA content.

AB  - We have researched operative histeroscopy in treating endometrial abnormalities as a cause of marital infertility. A group of 320 infertile patients was included in the study. Color Doppler examination detected endometrial abnormalities (subseptus, polyp, synechiae, myoma, uterus bicornuate, and uterus arcuate). The controlling group consisted of 100 patients suffering endometrial abnormalities, who have not underwent the operation. In research group, there were 9 pregnancies following operative histeroscopy over a period of 18?months. That is 34.6%, out of which 89 (27.8%) have been carried out and delivered. We have also studied the surgical risk of operative histeroscopy. According to the results, operative histeroscopy is minimally invasive, surgically comfortable, economically acceptable. The influence of histeroscopy on the endometrium during pregnancy and delivery is such that there is no significant difference in comparison to the patients that were not operated. The pregnancy following operative histeroscopy is phsysiological. The delivery has no implication of pathological nature, nor difference in duration, type, or any other component. The enonathological parameters do not differ from physiological
