AB  - Background To assess particular features of fetal extremities evaluation using three-dimensional ultrasound. Methods Total of 276 patients were selected from our routine outpatient clinic or sent for supervision from other clinics because of a suspected fetal anomaly. Patients were examined during a three year period (Jan1997-Dec1999). Pre-selected patients were examined with standard 2-D ultasonic devices, and their gestation age ranged between 12 and 40?weeks. 3-D ultrasound devices were Combison 530D and Voluson 530D MT (Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria) with a 3?5?MHz annular array transducer for three dimensional volume scanning. Results In 28/276 patients the initial diagnosis was suspected by 2-D sonography at entry in the study. In 18/28 suspected cases diagnosis was determined after examination by 3-D sonography (15/28 clubfoot, 3/28 other limb anomalies). The diagnosis of clubfoot was confirmed In 17/28 cases after delivery or termination of pregnancy, meaning that 2/18 cases of clubfoot were not detected using ultrasonography. In all of 3 other cases the sonographic diagnoses of hand contractures and micromelia were confirmed after termination of pregnancy. Conclusion 3-D sonography accurately visualized angular and structural limb anomalies. In two cases of severe oligohydramnios we missed clubfoot by 3-D sonography.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of fetal venous Doppler in detection of fetal hypoxia and timing of the delivery. Methods The study group consisted of patients with increased risk for developing fetal hypoxia. These were patients with diagnosed fetal intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and patients with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), or a combination of both problems. All patients had Doppler assessment of fetal arterial (umbilical artery, aorta, middle cerebral artery) and venous circulation (ductus venosus and umbilical vein), and cardiotocography 24?h before delivery. Collection of postnatal data included pH of umbilical chord blood, admission in neonatal intensive care unit, and perinatal death. Results A total of 360 patients were included in the study (IUGR 48%, PIH 20%, IUGR +?PIH 32%). Deterioration in fetal venous return developed after fetal arterial circulation had been severely compromised. The decrease in end-diastolic flow in ductus venosus anticipated development of umbilical vein pulsatile flow. Patients with pulsations in umbilical vein blood flow had high incidence of perinatal acidosis, morbidity, and mortality. Conclusion Delivery should be performed before umbilical vein pulsations develop. Careful monitoring of ductus venosus blood flow is helpful predictor of this event.

AB  - Diagnostic ultrasound in the early pregnancy deals with the recognition of normal anatomy and/or the detection of anomalies in very early viable pregnancies. There are clinical situations where the position of the embryo does not allow imaging of the optimal section of a certain organ. This is often the case with the transvaginal approach, where movements of the transducer are limited. Deriving new 2D images by anyplane slicing is an important presentation mode of embryonic 3D ultrasound. Geometric 3D reconstructions can also be helpful for the understanding of the embryonic anatomy. High quality 2D tomograms are the prerequisite of 3D imaging of the tiny embryo and its organs. Such ultrasound tomograms can be achieved by using annular array transducers, which have a thin elevation plane due to symmetric focussing. Examples of multiplane imaging and geometric volume reconstructions in the assessment of the embryonic anatomy will be presented, and the limitations will be discussed.

AB  - Intrauterine allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used for the prenatal treatment of severe combined immunodefiency syndrome. However, this treatment has not been successful in other conditions in which the fetus is immunologically competent. The main obstacles to success are lack of competitive advantage of donor vs. host stem cells preventing stable engraftment and graft rejection by the host immune system. Strategies to overcome these hurdles include, among others, early transplantation before 12?weeks of gestation, and increase of cells dose in the target organs (fetal liver and fetal bone marrow) which might be best achieved by the intravascular administration route. However, whilst ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal administration of the graft in the first trimester is feasible, access to the fetal circulation in the first trimester is more difficult. Combined ultrasound-guided/embryofetoscopic approach is a promising technique to achieve this goal. Thin-gauge embryofetoscopes allow the exact visualization of the optimal funipuncture site and the intravenous insertion of a 25G needle through a side-port. They thus provide an additional tool to deliver the stem cell graft to the preimmune fetus.

AB  - Background The possibility that the hyperstimulatory effect of gonadotropins may be important etiologically in the genesis of some cases of ovarian cancer is still under discussion. Few flow and image cytometric studies report on DNA aneuploid granulosa cells in follicular fluid from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The reports are very controversial. The aim of the study was to analyse relationship between ultrasound-determined follicular size and DNA ploidy of granulosa cells from gonadotropin-stimulated follicles. Method The granulosa-luteal cells were obtained from women undergoing an IVF-ET program at the University Department of obstetrics and Gynecology Ljubljana. Seventy aspirates of individual follicles (transvaginal determined size, range 15?mm ? 30?mm in diameter) from gonadotropin-stimulated cycles were analysed. Cytospins were prepared and fixed in delaunay fixative. All the slides were stained by the feulgen thionin method. Image DNA analyses was performed on automated high-resolution image cytometer. The DNA index was calculated to define DNA ploidy. Results All granulosa cell samples were found to be diploid. Conclusion Regardless of different ultrasound-determined size of follicles, all analysed granulosa cells have diploid DNA content.

AB  - We have researched operative histeroscopy in treating endometrial abnormalities as a cause of marital infertility. A group of 320 infertile patients was included in the study. Color Doppler examination detected endometrial abnormalities (subseptus, polyp, synechiae, myoma, uterus bicornuate, and uterus arcuate). The controlling group consisted of 100 patients suffering endometrial abnormalities, who have not underwent the operation. In research group, there were 9 pregnancies following operative histeroscopy over a period of 18?months. That is 34.6%, out of which 89 (27.8%) have been carried out and delivered. We have also studied the surgical risk of operative histeroscopy. According to the results, operative histeroscopy is minimally invasive, surgically comfortable, economically acceptable. The influence of histeroscopy on the endometrium during pregnancy and delivery is such that there is no significant difference in comparison to the patients that were not operated. The pregnancy following operative histeroscopy is phsysiological. The delivery has no implication of pathological nature, nor difference in duration, type, or any other component. The enonathological parameters do not differ from physiological

AB  - Early detection of breast cancer is of paramount importance for its management. Therefore, new diagnostic tools are continously searched, including 3D-US and 3D Power Doppler, and for later management, the study of the sentinel node. 3D ultrasonography (3-D US) may be of value in the differential diagnosis of the following conditions. Cysts Not all cysts display a typical US appearance. Small cysts may lack the distal sound enhancement. Inflammatory cysts may exhibit a thickened wall. However, the major problem it the not so rare presence of intracystic echoes, which may be either real or artifactual. Fibroadenomas A refraction artifact (edge shadowing) is often noted at each lateral margin of smooth-marginated fibroadenomas. Contours are irregular in about 25% of cases, and in about 5% shadowing makes it impossible to rule out malignancy. Carcinomas Shadowing is associated only with those carcinomas that have a significant amount of fibrosis (<?50% of cases in our experience). Some partial shadowing seen with some carcinomas may also be caused by beam scattering by jagged margins, with 3D scan potentially useful for diagnosis. The sentinel node. Axillary lymph node status is the most important pathological determinant of prognosis in early breast cancer, whereas local axillary lynphadenectomy is the most reliable staging procedure. However, routine axillary dissection does not benefit the majority of patients with early breast cancer who are node-negative, thereby sustaining the potential morbidity of the procedure. Sentinel node is the first regional node to receive lymph from the breast and accurately represents the metastatic status of the primary cancer. Sentinel node biopsy appears to offer an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection for staging patients with breast cancer. (Supported in part my MURST and CNR, Italy)

AB  - Fetal oncology is a chapter of the Obstetrics non well known yet. Fortunately, the improvements in the ultrasonography has let us to obtain an intrauterine diagnosis and to follow its evolution in order to choose the most appropriated obstetrical way. A total of 1326 fetal abnormalities has been diagnosed in the last 10 years in the Hospital ?La Paz?, Madrid, and we have found 54 cases of fetal tumours detected by ultrasonography (cyst and solid tumours included). This number of fetal tumours is estimated to be the 4.07% of all fetal abnormalities. Most frequent tumours include the fetal central nervous system, fetal lung, fetal heart, fetal genitourinary system, fetal gastrointestinal system. We have reviewed these fetal tumours histology, location and behaviour, trying to study the best obstetrical conduct and its chirurgical treatment. Ultrasonographic characteristic of each fetal tumour has been specified. Besides, we describe the possible differential diagnosis, maternal complications (preeclamptic status, mirror syndrome), obstetrical complications (polyhydramnios, preterm labour and delivery or placentomegaly) and fetal complications (cardiovascular failures, hydrops or death). Finally, we perform the indications for the spontaneous delivery or the preterm delivery induction depending on each case. Although we have not experience in intrauterine surgery, we believe that the best results are obtained in the neonatal surgery, always after an individual study and in agreement with the whole perinatal equipment.

AB  - Unstimulated cycles offer a simpler, quicker and less invasive form of IVF and ICSI than the most conventional stimulated cycles. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches for follicle monitoring in unstimulated cycles. This monitoring includes studies of follicle growth during the follicular and luteal phase of the cycle, measurements of blood flow in perifollicular vessels and studies of perifollicular perfusion in vascular network using power Doppler. These studies include 3D analysis of follicular growth, development and its vascularization. A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing IVF and ICSI in unstimulated cycles at our institution was performed. The outcome measurements used were oocyte recovery rate, fertilization rate, implantation and delivery rate. Unstimulated cycles monitored by ultrasound only were compared with those monitored with different protocols of ultrasound monitoring combined with serum estradiol level and urinary LH. IVF and ICSI were performed in 708 unstimulated cycles. A higher pregnancy rate and lower cancellation rate was obtained when hCG was applied in lower values of serum E2 and smaller follicle diameter. The actual pregnancy rate per embryo transfer in IVF cycles was 23.8% and 26.4% in ICSI cycles when embryo transfer was performed on day?+?2 or day?+?3. When blastocyst stage embryo transfer was performed the implantation rate per embryo transfer was 37.5%.

AB  - Background This study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound combined with vaginal and endometrial cytology in detecting endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women. Method In all patients who underwent dilatation and curettage (D & C) for postmenopausal bleeding during four years endometrial thickness, vaginal and endometrial cytology were evaluated. Results Accuracy of endometrial thickness in detecting pathologic condition, like as polyp, hyperplasia and carcinoma was high sensitive but with low specificity. Combined use transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology show very high sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer. The combined use of three diagnostic methods show no benefit for other pathologic conditions. Conclusion Combination of transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology can not absolutely replace histologic findings obtained by D & C. However, in the cases with thin endometrium and negative cytology D & C could be avoided. Usefulness of these three methods has to be found in providing more information resulting in better understanding of endometrial condition.

AB  - In North America second trimester genetic ultrasound is offered to patients at risk for trisomy 21 and other chromosomal abnormalities who decline invasive testing. In most major studies in which the prevalence of ultrasound markers used for genetic ultrasound are reported, congenital heart defects are identified in less than 10% of fetuses. When one considers that over 50% of fetuses with trisomy 21 and 90% of fetuses with trisomies 13 and 18 have structural malformations of the heart, the question should be raised as to why the wide discrepancy in prevalence and detection rate of heart defects in these fetuses. The purpose of this presentation is to review the prevalence of CHD in fetuses with trisomy 21, trisomies 13 and 18, and all fetuses with chromosomal defects that were identified following second trimester amniocentesis. To ascertain the presence or absence of CHD, each fetus underwent a fetal echocardiographic study using real-time and color Doppler ultrasound at the time of genetic amniocentesis. The results of the study demonstrated the following: The detection rate for trisomy 21 (n?=?80) increased from 62% to 91% when examination of the fetal heart was performed. The detection rate for trisomy 18 (n?=?30) increased from 84%% to 97% when the cardiovascular system was evaluated. For fetuses with any chromosomal abnormality (n?=?103) advanced maternal age were examined, the examination of the heart increased the detection rate from 61% to 85%. Given the above findings, the inclusion of the fetal echocardiographic evaluation of the fetus significantly increased the detection rate for the above three groups of fetuses. If physicians and/or sonographers desire to increase the ultrasound detection rate for chromosomal abnormalities, examination of the fetal cardiovascular system must occur.

High resolution 2 T MRI was used to assess structural reorganisation; 20 children suffering unilateral perinatal brain damage (MCA infarct.) were followed up (neurodevelopmentally, transcranial CD and US/CT, MRI); 25 children with CD findings (C/U ratio <?1) during pregnancy underwent prospective follow-up postnatally by age 2. Results All children with H-I lesions have still at age 16 one or more severe handicaps, while 39 children with mild grade of hemorrhage had minor neurological dysfunction, 15 were normal. MRI revealed destructive and/or atrophic lesions in all children with H-I lesions and mild atrophy and/or signs of preiventricular haemorrhage in rest children. 20 children with unilateral perinatal brain damage have contralateral hemiparesis and various accompanying neurodevelopmental disorders. There were no strict correlation between size, site, hemispheral involvement gestational age and neurodevelopmental outcome of children examined. Out of the 25 children having pathological CD findings during pregnancy, 7 revealed mild grade (I?II) of peri-intraventricular haemorrhage, 10 children isolated or combined H-I and haemorrhagic lesion, 7 children have no apparent perinatal brain damage. Short-term neuro-developmental outcome revealed mild delay and/or disorders in 10 infants and in the rest normal status.

AB  - Background To evaluate the preoperative clinical, laboratory and sonographic characteristics of struma ovarii. Method A retrospective review of gynecologic patients operated for mature cystic teratoma over a 10-year period, identified 16 cases of struma ovarii. These cases were the subject of this study and were compared to 32 cases of ovarian dermoid cysts. Results The incidence of struma ovarii among all cases of dermoid cysts was 4.8%. Most patients were menopausal, the mean lesion diameter was 57.3?mm, occurred more frequently (68.8%) in the right adnexa and presented with normal CA-125 level. Blood flow signals were detected from the center of the lesions in all cases. Rare cases presented with elevated tumor marker and low-resistance blood flow. In dermoid cycsts, blood flow had a higher resistive index. In addition, no blood flow could be detected from the center of the echogenic lesion in dermoid (P?<?0.0001). Conclusion It is difficult to distinguish between struma ovarii and dermoid cysts, based on their sonographic appearance. Nevertheless, Doppler flow may aid in the preoperative diagnosis of struma ovarii. Blood flow signals, detected from the center of the echogenic lesions and low resistance to flow may be more common in struma ovarii.

AB  - Legal regulation of the safety of medical applications of ultrasound is important for protection of the patients and physicians. The matter of ultrasound safety has recently been regulated in Croatia within the framework of the law on nonionising radiation protection. The law as approved by the parliament regulates the general principles and material cornerstones while the details are defined by rules and regulations issued by the Ministry of Health. Apart from medical applications ultrasound is used in plastic and metal welding, food processing, cleaning, electroplating, drilling and metal flaw detection, to mention but some. The law had to be general and sufficiently cover the whole spectrum allowing for the special medical exception. Namely, the medical professional may breach the integrity of human body and even harm the patient if the expected net final result of the whole proceeding is expected to help the person who seeks help. The law in Croatia states that ultrasound may not increase the temperature of the human body to more than 38.5?°C and may not induce cavitation there. However medical applications of ultrasound are specifically excluded from this limitation. The requirement is the application of the ALARA principle. The specifics of the regulation of the total field of medical applications of ultrasound are now being prepared under consideration of the existing and the presently processed IEC from IEC committees TC 62 and TC 87 documents and taking into account the present regulation in the USA.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common symptom of many possible maternal-fetal pathologies and/or the expression of a genetic alteration; by far, the most common etiology is related to chronic fetal hypoxemia. Fetal hypoxemia may be the result of different feto-maternal pathophysiological processes which can produce completely different fetal hemodynamic modifications, not only in relation to the quality but particularly in relation to the chronology of the hemodynamic events. However, fetal hypoxia is mostly due to placental vascular insufficiency and it is important to point-out that fetal hypoxemia-acidemia is part of the terminal pathway starting from placental functional and structural alterations, through fetal IUGR, leading to intrauterine fetal death. Doppler evaluation of fetal arterial districts is important for the diagnosis of the fetal hemodynamic adaptation to the hypoxemia. Our observations suggest that, in the evaluation of fetal hemodynamics, it is important to consider also the intracardiac and the venous hemodynamics, focusing the study on the evaluation of the output tracts, the atrio-ventricular flow and on vessels like the ductus venosus, inferior vena cava, umbilical vein. Keeping the time of the hemodynamic alterations in these vessels and/or districts, which are characteristic signs of the incipient heart failure, may be one of the key for the solution for one of the main obstetrical problem: the diagnosis of fetal decompensation phase.

AB  - Objective Neonatal outcome was studied in 169 infants from diamniotic monochorionic (DAMC) and diamniotic dichorionic (DADC) twin pregnancies in relation to a measure of blood flow redistribution, the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). Study design Two groups were assessed, 50 infants from DAMC, and 119 infants from DADC twin pregnancies. Targeted ultrasound and Doppler recordings of umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were obtained. The resistance index (RI) and CPR were calculated for each fetus. Results DAMC twins had lower birth weight (1979 vs. 2223?g for DADC, p≤.01) and prolonged lengths of nicu stay (8.5?days vs. 3.5?days for DADC, p≤.05). For total group, DAMC compared with DADC twins spent greater numbers of days on a ventilator. SGA infants were significantly more frequent in DAMC twins compared to DADC twins. Among antenatal Doppler variables only the CPR demonstrated a significant difference between twin types. For DAMC twins CPR was 1.15 vs. 1.21 for DADC twins, p≤.05. Conclusions Monochorionic twins from the lower birth weight groups demonstrate a greater number of growth restricted infants and prolonged hospitalizations compared to DADC twins. Among Doppler measures, the CPR is superior to UA-RI, and/or MCA-RI for the prediction of adverse events.

AB  - Background Three-dimensional imaging of superficial fetal abnormalities is well established. We prospectively evaluated if a technique of sectional planar imaging could interrogate nonsurface fetal abnormalities without changing transducers or requiring postrendering software. Method Patients referred for perinatal consultation received traditional 2-D scanning and simultaneous volume mode imaging. Fetal abnormalities were visualized with a sectional technique similar to ?tomogram? slices. No post image rendering manipulation was required. Twelve patients had correlative MRI scanning. Neonatal images were obtained when possible. Results Structural fetal abnormalities amenable to volume rendering were found in 192 of 600 referral patients. Of these, 49% (94/192) benefited from 3-D planar imaging. Consistently improved counseling occurred with abdominal wall defect (11/11), cystic hygroma (8/8), neural tube defect (8/8), skeletal dysplasia (5/5), hydrops (5/5), ovarian mass (4/4), myoma (9/11), and fetal chest mass (2/3). Moderate image concordance was seen for nuchal thickness (4/8), renal dysgenesis (27/50), and placental mass or separation (7/12). Lowest concordance was seen for echogenic bowel (0/17), isolated SUA (0/9), and CPC (4/41). Conclusion Complex syndromes with superficial and deep architecture are accessible with a simple volume mode planar scanning technique. The additional information is immediately available and useful in counseling of these syndromes.

AB  - Background The study of fetal and placental circulation has focused on the interaction betweens fetal hypoxia and abnormal flow regulation. The assessed methods including spectral and color Doppler US. However, their uses in the depiction of angioarchitecture to make the specific diagnosis are limited. Methods We use three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler sonography (Voluson 530D, Medison; and HDI 3000, ATL) a to detect and visualize the fetal vasculature since 8?weeks gestation. We also use the same method to render the angioarchitecture of placenta as early as 5?weeks gestation. The scanning methods were using either free-handed or built-in mechanical probe. We also assess its application in decision making for difficult cases. Results Power Doppler provides excellent visualization of fetal circulation (including umbilical vein, portal vein systems, ductus venosus, hepatic veins, etc.). Furthermore, these data can be rendered in 3D perspectives, which is more comprehensive for understanding the complicated vasculature of fetus. It can correlates the embryonic findings in vivo, therefore can confirm the normalcy and also contribute in the diagnosis of pathological state. Conclusion Our results indicate 3D power Doppler is a promising tool in evaluation of complicated fetal and placental anatomy, and might help to make decision in clinical dilemmas.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to compare sonographic measurements of subcutaneous tissue (SQ) in fetuses of gestational diabetic mothers (GDM), and in normal fetuses. Methods SQ was measured as the subcutaneous tissue area of mid upper arm (FMA), mid-thigh (FMT) (cross sectional area minus bone and muscle area), abdominal (FA) and subscapular fat (FS), thickness. Fifty-six GDM were enrolled in the study. Normal values were obtained from fetuses of normal pregnancies (BMI 21.3?±?0.64 Kg/m2; one hour glucose test <?140?mg/dL) (30 patients). Treatment was based on diet alone, or diet plus insulin according to postprandial glicemia. Longitudinal ultrasound examinations were performed every four weeks, in normal pregnancies, and in GDM pregnancies. Results Fetal SQ measurements were significantly correlated to gestational age both in normal and GDM fetuses (P?<?0.05). At the time of diagnosis GDM fetuses had significantly higher values for all SQ measurements compared to AGA fetuses; these differences were not found during therapy. 26?32?weeks diagnosis 32?36?weeks therapy normal GDM normal GDM p FA 0.32?±?0.01 0.38?±?0.01 Ns 0.45?±?0.02 0.47?±?0.02 0.001 FS 0.28?±?0.01 0.36?±?0.17 Ns 0.41?±?0.36 0.44?±?0.02 0.001 FMA 1.97?±?0.12 2.55?±?0.19 Ns 3.83?±?0.33 4.24?±?0.21 0.01 FMT 3.12?±?0.20 4.10?±?0.37 Ns 5.91?±?0.42 6.94?±?0.43 0.01 Conclusions GDM is associated with increases in fetal SQ from the second trimester. A strict glycemic control can reduce these differences to negligible values. These new measurements can be adopted to monitor the efficacy of therapy in GDM pregnancies.

AB  - Background The aims of this study were to assess the activity of the human fetal atrial natriuretic peptide system in hypertensive pregnancies with and without signs of increased fetal systemic venous pressure and to investigate the association between severe placental insufficiency and fetal myocardial cell destruction. Method Control group consisted of 50 newborns with uncomplicated pregnancy and labor. In group 1, 22 newborns after hypertensive pregnancies were included. Doppler ultrasonography revealed abnormal umbilical artery (UA) blood velocity waveform in five cases, and normal nonpulsatile umbilical vein (UV) blood velocity profile in every case. Group 2 consisted of five newborns after pregnancies complicated by maternal hypertensive disorder. Atrial pulsations in the UV and retrograde diastolic blood velocity pattern in the UA were detected in every case. Immediately after birth blood samples were collected from the UA and plasma N-terminal peptide of proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and serum cardiac specific troponin-T concentrations were measured. Results In group 1, nt-proANP concentrations were higher (P?<?0.001) than in the control group. In group 1, newborns with abnormal UA blood velocity pattern had higher (P?<?0.006) NT-proANP concentrations than newborns with normal UA Doppler findings. Troponin-T concentrations in group 1 did not differ from the control group. In group 2, NT-proANP (P?<?0.002) and troponin-T (P?<?0.0001) concentrations were higher than in the control group and study group 1. Conclusion Maternal hypertensive disorder stimulates fetal atrial natriuretic peptide production, being greatest in fetuses with severe placental insufficiency and a rise in systemic venous pressure. These fetuses also have evidence of myocardial cell destruction.
