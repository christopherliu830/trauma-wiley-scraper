AB  - An HRT-associated reduction of the pulsatility index (PI) has been reported in the literature, although cross-sectional studies have shown conflicting data. In a prospective, controlled study we randomized 30 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 52?±?3?years) into two groups. Women in the HRT group (N?=?15) received 1?mg micronized 17?-estradiol daily (E2) sequentially combined with 5 or 10?mg dydrogesterone for 14?days of each 28-day cycle during 12?months, and, thereafter, 2?mg E2 combined with 10?mg dydrogesterone for a period of 3?months. The control group (N?=?15) received no treatment. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to measure the impedance to flow (pulsatility index [PI]) within the uterine, central retinal and ophthalmic arteries in the E2-phase at baseline and after 3, 12 and 15?months. Compared to controls, 12 months of HRT was associated with a significant decrease in the mean PI of the uterine artery of ?39% (HRT ?25%, controls +14%) and in that of the central retinal artery of ?29% (HRT ?9%, controls +20%). After 3?months this effect was already evident. During HRT, the reductions in mean PI of the uterine and central retinal arteries vs. baseline were larger (both P?=?0.002) in the women with high pretreatment PI values when compared to those with low pretreatment values. The baseline PI of the uterine artery correlated positively with age and with duration of amenorrhoea (r?=?0.42, P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.48, P?=?0.008, respectively). Our 12-month study expanded on earlier reports of a reduced PI of the uterine artery. We used a combined regimen containing a low-dose of oestrogens. These results are important because the recent trend is to recommend combined HRT that contain lower dosages of oestrogens than before. Furthermore, a 29% reduction of the PI of the central retinal artery was observed, which suggests that HRT has a positive influence on the impedance of the cerebral circulation. From the point of view of atherothrombotic risk these observations are beneficial and possibly helpful in understanding the decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and of the impairment of cognitive functions associated with oestrogens in epidemiological data.

AB  - Objective In pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) there are essentially two causes of perinatal death: prematurity and lung hypoplasia. We used ultrasound to try to predict these complications. Design and methods The cervical length was measured by transvaginal ultrasound in 167 pregnancies complicated by pPROM <?32?weeks of gestation. Further in 20 pregnancies with pPROM before 24?weeks of gestation peripheral pulmonary artery (PPA) waveforms were recorded by Doppler technique at weekly interval until delivery and the Pulsatility Index (PI) calculated. Pregnancies were managed conservatively according to an Institutional management protocol. The occurrence of preterm delivery and pulmonary hypoplasia was evaluated and related to ultrasound findings. Results The cervical length at admission predicts the time interval elapsing between pPROM and delivery. Significant differences in PI values from PPA were present from 2?weeks onwards the pPROM between the fetuses who developed pulmonary hypoplasia and those with a normal outcome. Conclusion The measurement of the cervical length and of PPA velocity waveforms may help to establish the risk of developing prematurity and pulmonary hypoplasia in pregnancies complicated by pPROM.

AB  - Traditionally, the prenatal assessment of the umbilical cord (UC) is limited to the assessment of the number of vessels and to the evaluation of umbilical artery blood flow parameters. Morphologic aspects of the UC have usually been studied by pathologists and retrospectively correlated with the perinatal outcome. The introduction of more sophisticated imaging techniques have offered the possibility to investigate the UC characteristics during fetal life from early to late gestation. A number of investigations have demonstrated that an altered structure of the UC can be associated with pathologic conditions (i.e. preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, diabetes, fetal demise). Nomograms of the various UC components have been generated and allow the identification of lean or large umbilical cords, entities frequently associated with fetal growth abnormalities and diabetes, respectively. Of note, lean UC in the second and third trimester differs from normal UC not only from a structural point of view but also in the umbilical vein blood flow characteristics. On the other hand a thin UC in the first trimester seems to be a marker for identifying a subset of fetuses at risk for spontaneous abortion and pre-eclampsia. A Wharton's jelly reduction has also been invoked as a possible cause of fetal death in the presence of single umbilical artery. Prenatal morphometric and morphologic UC characteristics as well as UC arterial and venous blood flow parameters in normal and pathologic conditions will be presented and discussed.

AB  - Objectives Our purpose was to evaluate the risks of malignancy in surgically removed ovarian cysts that preoperatively were characterized as unilocular by transvaginal sonography. Study design This prospective analysis included 1307 women operated at two European university Hospitals between January 1992 and December 1997. Based on ultrasonographic findings the cysts were characterized either as echo-free, without solid parts or papillary formations (group I) or cysts with solid parts/papillary formations or echogenic cyst content (group II). Ultrasonographic and macroscopic appearance of the cysts were compared with histopathological diagnosis. Results In group I seven of 670 (1.1%) proved to be borderline or malignant, and all measured ≥?75?mm in diameter. The corresponding figures for cysts in group II were 24 of 634 (3.8%). The frequency of borderline/malignant cysts increased significantly with the size of the cysts. Conclusion Unilocular, echo-free cysts (group I) with a mean diameter above 50?mm and all unilocular cysts with solid parts/papillary formations should be removed surgically. Serial ultrasound follow-up should be the standard procedure of unilocular, echo-free cysts less than 50?mm.

AB  - Background Intracardiac echogenic foci are controversially discussed whether or not they are marker for chromosomal aberrations. The possible association with fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) and its impact were not yet analyzed extensively. Method During 30?months, prenatally detected structural CHD were prospectively analyzed for the presence of EF. Frequency, localization, number, association with chromosomal defects and pattern of CHD were assessed. Results 279 fetal CHD could be examined and EF were found in 31 cases (11.1%). The localization was in 17 cases (54%) the left, in 7 (22%) the right, and in 7 (22.5%) both ventricles. Multiple EF were found in 10 cases. 14 cases (42%) were associated with a chromosomal aberration (T18 n?=?2; T21 n?=?5, T13 n?=?3, Triploidy n?=?2, Del22q n?=?1, others n?=?1). Among the remaining 17 fetuses with normal chromosomes following heart defects were found: 3???VSD, 3???Left-persistent SVC, 2???TGA, 2???TOF, 2???Coarctation, and 1???PS, PA, Ebstein, TAC, AS each. Conclusions Compared to low-risk groups EF are more frequent in the presence of CHD and show another distribution involving more right ventricular or bilateral EF. The combination of EF and CHD is highly associated with aneuploidies. Since associated CHD include also conotruncal anomalies EF can be considered as an indication for targeted fetal echocardiography especially when EF is localized in the RV or in both ventricles.

AB  - At present there are four concepts guiding the sonographic examination of the fetal heart: (1) the fetal echocardiogram (FEC) is difficult to perform and time-consuming, (2) FEC should be performed only in high risk pregnancies, (3) the optimal time to perform FEC is 18?22?weeks gestation, (4) FEC relies on several sonographic still views. In our lecture, we will present a new systemic ?video? approach to the great vessels and the four chambers in early pregnancy using transvaginal sonography. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the cardiovascular system was performed in 36?323 consecutive fetuses using a dynamic ?video? multidirectional approach. Cardiovascular anomalies were detected in 173 fetuses giving an overall incidence of 1 in 210 pregnancies and 1 in 238 low-risk pregnancies. Fifty-six percent of the fetuses had associated anomalies. The prenatal diagnosis was confirmed in 90 cases. In 10 fetuses a different cardiac anomaly was observed. In four fetuses the cardiovascular anomaly was not detected in early pregnancy. In the remaining cases, postmortem examination was not performed. Early fetal heart examination is suggested in all pregnancies. Conclusions Fetal ECC should be performed: (a) transvaginally, (b) in early pregnancy (14?16?weeks), (c) in every pregnancy , (d) using the video multidirectional approach.

AB  - Background Fetal growth is determined by its genetic potential and growth support. The aim of our prospective study was to find out does the growth support (placental factor and blood flow) or genetic potential play a primary role in fetal growth. Method From 27 to 41 gestational weeks an umbilical artery (RI1), a middle cerebral artery resistance index (RI2) and umbilical-cerebral (U/C) ratio were measured. Several US measurements in 3?4?week intervals of the same pregnancy were done. After delivery, fetuses were divided into the three groups (AGA, LGA, SGA) according to their birth-weights. Pregnancies with gestational diabetes were excluded from the study. Results There were not statistically significant differences between the average values of RI1 (age related) in the groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. However, the mean values of RI1 (according to gestational age) in the mentioned two groups of fetuses were significantly lower than in the group of SGA fetuses, as well as their mean values of U/C ratios. Conclusion Placental factor is equally and efficiently functioning in the both groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. The genetic regulating factor of fetal growth can be adequately expressed in conditions of appropriate uteroplacental and umbilical blood supply. In other words, in identical or at least similar conditions of umbilical blood supply, fetal growth is exclusively influenced by its genetic potential.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is now defined as a condition in which the fetus does not reach the optimal condition of his growth. In this situation the birthweight can be reduced below the 10th percentile or can be superior to that threshold especially when the restriction took first place in late part of the pregnancy. Therefore it is possible to identify two groups of IUGR according to the intrauterine observation and the birthweight assessment: SGA and AGA IUGR. The most important complication of IUGR is represented by the hypoxaemia caused by placental vasculopathy. Hypoxaemia is present in about 30% of IUGR fetuses with not significant difference between SGA and AGA IUGR cases, and is the major cause of the poor perinatal outcome. After recognition of the growth restriction it is necessary to apply second level tests in order to assess the presence or absence of hypoxaemia. When hypoxaemia is present the first mechanism of fetal adaptation is represented by the redistribution of the circulation. This phenomenon is easily observable by using Doppler technology. When applying the same technique on the umbilical arteries it is possible to detect an increase in the peripheral resistance proportional to the obliteration of the placental vascular bed that is the cause of the fetal hypoxaemia. By using the information offered by Doppler study on fetal and umbilical vessels it is therefore possible to optimize the clinical management of the IUGR fetuses.

AB  - Objective The 3D Color Histogram gives quantitative informations about (changes) of perfusion and vascularisation packed in indices. Aim of the presentation is to illustrate the information gained by the vascularisation and perfusion indices. In addition, to show the reproducibility of the indices according to published studies, preliminary results (transvaginal) obtained in ovarian tumors and preliminary results in phantom measurements to correct the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation using a 3D abdominal probe. Results Color Histogram indices are reproducible. Differences of perfusion and vascularisation between benign and malignant ovarian tumors could be observed in a limited number of investigations. The physical component of the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation could be calculated by mathematical algorythms according to first phantom measurements. Conclusion The 3D Color Histogram gives new possibilities to analyse neoangiogenesis.

AB  - Background Two methods are presented for the assessment of fetal behaviours under the application of Doppler effects: (a) Measurement of the velocity wave of fetal limb by vibroacustic stimulating. (b) Hydrodynamic evaluation of the transnasal amniotic velocity wave and its relation to gastric peristalsis. Method A Doppler device was employed to assess the velocimetry wave from the ?FEMORAL BONE? in motion, following vibro-acoustic stimulation in 138 phisiological pregnancy and Doppler-aided evaluation of transnasal amniotic hydrodynamics. Results and conclusion Assessment of normal fetal behaviour. Quantification of patterns of reactivity of any body structure. Reduction in the duration of explorations for biophysical profiles. (3?4?min). Fetal reflex responses slow down and become increasingly complex as maturation carries on. Both mean velocity and acceleration of fetal reactive responses experience a gradual decline throughout gestation. The time a fetus takes to respond to a stimulus increases directly with gestational age. Simultaneousness between fetal respiration episodes and phases of gastric distention and activity. (physiological conditions). Fetal active respiration can be unequivocally accounted for by Doppler assessment of the activity of intake/release of amniotic fluid along the high respiratory branches of the pulmonary tree. Amniotic respiratory dynamics are always transnasal in physiological conditions. Velocities of transnasal, decreasing steadily from the 32nd gestational age to the end of gestation.

AB  - Aim To assess agreement between fetal cord blood Hb concentration by Doppler velocimetry and a formula (Oepkes et al, Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1994; 101:680?4), and the actual Hb concentration by cord blood sampling. Material and methods A prospective cohort of 31 Rh isoimmunised fetuses undergoing Doppler cord blood velocity measurements within the 24 hs previous to cordocentesis or delivery was included. Mean aortic velocity at descent fetal aorta and maximum umbilical vein flow at intrahepatic portion were measured blindly by a single operator with pulsed Doppler and a 3.5 Mhz transducer. Cord Hb was the gold standard. Abnormality and normality were defined as a Hb level lower and higher, respectively, than the cut-off point (<7, <8, <9, <10, <11 and <12 g/dL were tested).

AB  - The prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformations seems to be a very difficult challenge, mainly for those who are beginning with the practice of ultrasound. As it would be impossible to refer to so many fetal malformations the presentation will cover a few interesting issues. These cases are not frequently diagnosed and in many cases present controversial aspects referred to their prognosis and management. Those topics are: Unilateral ventricular dilatation Fetal hyperechogenic lung lesions Umbilical vein varix Facial clefts Unilateral ventricular dilatation may be a difficult diagnosis and its prognosis is variable Fetal hyperechogenic lesions include a broad range of anomalies with a variable behaviour. Even large lesions can disappear in utero but often the lesion can persist with severe prognosis for the fetus. Varix of the umbilical vein is a relatively uncommon abnormality that carries an increased risk for fetal demise, chromosomal abnormality and hydrops. Facial clefts are a relatively common malformation and the fetal face must be properly scanned in every fetal study. 3D ultrasound helps a lot in the diagnosis of these and other malformations and we'll discuss some examples concerning this new technology.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to compare sonographic measurements of subcutaneous tissue (SQ) in fetuses of gestational diabetic mothers (GDM), and in normal fetuses. Methods SQ was measured as the subcutaneous tissue area of mid upper arm (FMA), mid-thigh (FMT) (cross sectional area minus bone and muscle area), abdominal (FA) and subscapular fat (FS), thickness. Fifty-six GDM were enrolled in the study. Normal values were obtained from fetuses of normal pregnancies (BMI 21.3?±?0.64 Kg/m2; one hour glucose test <?140?mg/dL) (30 patients). Treatment was based on diet alone, or diet plus insulin according to postprandial glicemia. Longitudinal ultrasound examinations were performed every four weeks, in normal pregnancies, and in GDM pregnancies. Results Fetal SQ measurements were significantly correlated to gestational age both in normal and GDM fetuses (P?<?0.05). At the time of diagnosis GDM fetuses had significantly higher values for all SQ measurements compared to AGA fetuses; these differences were not found during therapy. 26?32?weeks diagnosis 32?36?weeks therapy normal GDM normal GDM p FA 0.32?±?0.01 0.38?±?0.01 Ns 0.45?±?0.02 0.47?±?0.02 0.001 FS 0.28?±?0.01 0.36?±?0.17 Ns 0.41?±?0.36 0.44?±?0.02 0.001 FMA 1.97?±?0.12 2.55?±?0.19 Ns 3.83?±?0.33 4.24?±?0.21 0.01 FMT 3.12?±?0.20 4.10?±?0.37 Ns 5.91?±?0.42 6.94?±?0.43 0.01 Conclusions GDM is associated with increases in fetal SQ from the second trimester. A strict glycemic control can reduce these differences to negligible values. These new measurements can be adopted to monitor the efficacy of therapy in GDM pregnancies.

AB  - Background The aims of this study were to assess the activity of the human fetal atrial natriuretic peptide system in hypertensive pregnancies with and without signs of increased fetal systemic venous pressure and to investigate the association between severe placental insufficiency and fetal myocardial cell destruction. Method Control group consisted of 50 newborns with uncomplicated pregnancy and labor. In group 1, 22 newborns after hypertensive pregnancies were included. Doppler ultrasonography revealed abnormal umbilical artery (UA) blood velocity waveform in five cases, and normal nonpulsatile umbilical vein (UV) blood velocity profile in every case. Group 2 consisted of five newborns after pregnancies complicated by maternal hypertensive disorder. Atrial pulsations in the UV and retrograde diastolic blood velocity pattern in the UA were detected in every case. Immediately after birth blood samples were collected from the UA and plasma N-terminal peptide of proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and serum cardiac specific troponin-T concentrations were measured. Results In group 1, nt-proANP concentrations were higher (P?<?0.001) than in the control group. In group 1, newborns with abnormal UA blood velocity pattern had higher (P?<?0.006) NT-proANP concentrations than newborns with normal UA Doppler findings. Troponin-T concentrations in group 1 did not differ from the control group. In group 2, NT-proANP (P?<?0.002) and troponin-T (P?<?0.0001) concentrations were higher than in the control group and study group 1. Conclusion Maternal hypertensive disorder stimulates fetal atrial natriuretic peptide production, being greatest in fetuses with severe placental insufficiency and a rise in systemic venous pressure. These fetuses also have evidence of myocardial cell destruction.

AB  - Background Multiple malformation syndromes are generally heterogeneous diseases with inappropriate clinical delineation most cases. Geneticists are facing problems with lack of proper knowledge inspite of the overwhelming information available regarding a certain syndrome. Emphasis should be placed on the characteristic features of the suspected syndrome, or any major or detectable minor anomaly with significant effect on the course of the pregnancy. Conclusion Detailed ultrasonography by experienced personnel provides a valuable tool in diagnosing morphological alterations of the fetus in mid-gestation. After termination of the pregnancy, the effected fetus must be examined thoroughly by an experienced fetopathologist. Careful and comprehensive examinations reveals all major and minor morphological alterations that might outline a certain syndrome or other multiple abnormality entity. Computer based syndromological programs are important in this process, for they help geneticists and fetopathologists by matching the most suitable syndrome to the given case. Genetic counseling can be completed only with the establishment of the most probable diagnosis. Declaration of recurrence rate and possible application of other prenatal diagnostic methods must be included in the counseling. Different types of multiple malformation syndromes of the fetus will be presented in the lecture.

AB  - Background The aim of the study was a retrospective analysis of fetal heart disproportion. Method From the database of 3941 fetuses disproportion based on 4 chamber view was diagnosed in 136 fetuses (3.5%). There were 96 fetuses with the complete neonatal follow-up. Results Fifty-nine fetuses presented with different extracardiac malformations. Three other fetuses presented with heart defects. Thirty-four fetuses with disproportion had ?normal heart anatomy? and no extracardiac malformations. Gestational age at the time of diagnosis was 26?40?weeks (mean 35). Out of 34 fetuses with ?pure? disproportion, 15 cases (44%) did not have any clinical or postnatal ECH0 abnormalities. In 19 cases (54%) structural or functional abnormalities were found: 6 neonates presented with ASD secundum, 4 with CoA, 2 with lungs abnormalities (cong. pneumonia and cong. lung emphysema), one neonate had PDA, one had aorto-pulmonary window +?PDA. In other 5 neonates tricuspid insuffciency was diagnosed. Conclusions Disproportion in fetal heart was the relatively frequent abnormality at the referral center for fetal echocardiography (3.5%) and in majority of cases it was related to the presence of structural or functional abnormalities. In 44% of neonates fetal disproportion had no clinical implications. The most common neonatal heart defect in cases who prenatally presented with disproportion was ASD?sac, followed by CoA (4/19, 21%).

AB  - Background Vesicoamniotic shunting may be difficult or impossible in selected cases of fetal lower obstructive uropathy (LOU). The purpose of this paper is to describe the performance of fetal hydrolaparoscopy (FHL) and endoscopic fetal cystotomy (EFC) in fetuses with complicated LOU. Method FHL-EFC was performed in one patient with a markedly thickened bladder that could not be entered percutaneously. A peritoneoamniotic shunt was also placed. FHL-EFC was performed in a second patient with a collapsed bladder from a previous vesicocentesis, as vesicoinfusion resulted in further ascites. Fetal cystoscopy was performed after EFC, and posterior urethral valves were ablated with YAG-laser. A vesicoamniotic shunt was inserted. Results Adequate bladder drainage was obtained in both cases. The first baby required bilateral nephrostomies and a permanent cystotomy at birth, and is scheduled for a bladder expansion procedure at one year of age. The second patient had premature rupture of membranes and fetal demise from treatment of this complication 5?days after the original procedure. Conclusion FHL-EFC can be performed in complicated LOU cases. The procedure involves the creation of a defect in the bladder dome under direct endoscopic visualization within a hydroperitoneum. Peritoneo or vesicoamniotic shunting, or ablation of posterior urethral valves may then be performed. FHL-EFC should be reserved only for complicated cases of LOU where conventional vesicoamniotic shunting is not possible.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether a systematic stream-lined approach could be routinely used in the evaluation of the fetal intracranal anatomy, and which could be used to effectively and efficiently exclude all major intracranial malformation. Three planes were determined to be independent without overlay. Following the establishment of these three independent oblique planes across the intracranial anatomy, there were applied clinically to determine whether such planes would be sufficient to diagnose the major intracranial abnormalities. After retrospectively examining the various imaging levels taken, it was independently determined that three levels of intracranial imaging provided the greatest anatomic view of the entire fetal brain: the lateral ventricular level (Level I); the medial-thalamic level (Level II); and the inferior-posterior fossa view (Level III). We examined 131 cases of intracranial abnormalities that were prenatally diagnosed between 14 and 24?weeks gestation. One investigator was given the three-level view protocol to determine if the anomalies could be identified using this system. It was determined that, of the 131 abnormal cases, 126 (96.2%) were diagnosed using Levels I, II or III, independently or in combination. There were no false-positive test results. The present study investigated the efficacy of a three level view (TLV) imaging of the fetal brain representing a complete 2-D examination. We found this approach to be applicable throughout pregnancy and suitable for visualization of normal intracranial structures as well as the identification of abnormalities.

AB  - Color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis ultrasonography were used to scan 44 patients with an overt ovarian mass immediately before laparotomy. Sections of malignant tumors were analyzed for the cellular expression of TP and the intratumoral density of microvessels by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to TP and Factor VIII related antigen, respectively. Moreover, apoptotic index (AI) was evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling methods. The proportion of Stage I tumors that was TP positive (16%) was significantly lower (P?=?0.022) that the corresponding value for Stages II?IV (44%), although the values for microvessel count, AI, and peak systolic velocity (PSV) were similar. AI was significantly lower in TP-positive tumors than that in TP-negative tumors (P?=?0.015). The PSV was significantly higher in TP-positive tumors (P?=?0.02). There was a significant correlation between the microvessel count and the PSV (r?=?0.34, P?=?0.024). Moreover, AI was significantly inversely related to the PSV (r?=?0.35, P?=?0.023). The PSV in a subgroup with a high microvessel count and low AI was significantly higher than that in a subgroup with a low microvessel count and high AI (P?=?0.0006). These findings significantly associated with TP expression (P?=?0.024). The intratumoral PSV, as determined by color Doppler imaging and spectral analysis might reflect the coordination of angiogenesis and apoptosis, associating with TP expression in epithelial ovarian cancer.

AB  - For a number of years the teaching of ultrasound principles has relied on slides of static, nonreal-time images. Although ultrasound originally employed only still images, the development of real-time ultrasound ushered in a new imaging modality. Unfortunately, the presentation of real-time images has not been incorporated into most presentations because of the difficulty of preparing and editing video tape recordings of the examination. With the advent of multimedia programs available for the laptop and desktop computer, it is now possible to display real-time motion sequences that duplicate the actual scanning environment. To accomplish this, however, requires the physician to become versed in the various techniques required to capture video and audio sequences from the ultrasound machine. In addition, the proper computer software must be used to optimize these images. The purpose of this presentation is to review the methodology required to (1) acquire the highest quality video images from the ultrasound machine, (2) convert the ultrasound images from a analog-to-digital format, (3) review programs required to optimize the converted digital images, and (4) examine the software programs to optimally display these images for the Windows and Macintosh platforms. At the conclusion of the presentation, the physician should be able to accomplish these tasks.
