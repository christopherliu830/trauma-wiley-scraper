AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.

AB  - Spectral Doppler velocimetry supported by directional color Doppler imaging became the method of choice for recording blood velocity signals from the maternal uterine arteries during the third trimester of gestation. Normally, the uterine artery waveforms show a high proportion of diastolic flow without any early diastolic notch and with a low resistance (RI) or pulsatility (PI) index. With increasing gestation, there is a slight decrease in the resistance to flow in the placental circulation. The placental side of the uterus shows lower values of the waveform indices than the nonplacental. In high-risk pregnancies, the abnormally high PI or the presence of notch is predictive of the adverse outcome of pregnancy. Recently, a Uterine Artery Score (UAS) has been presented based on a combined evaluation of RI and notch (Sekizuka et al., J Mat Fet Invest 1997; 7:?197). We have modified this approach, using PI and a uniform cut-off value for definition of the abnormal PI, disregarding the placenta location. The modified UAS in combination with the umbilical artery Blood Flow Classes possess a high predictive value with regard to the perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies, especially in those with placental hemodynamic dysfunction. In cases of intrauterine growth restriction, the combined examination of the uterine and umbilical circulation improves the clinical value of the third trimester Doppler velocimetry.

AB  - The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the complications, safety and accuracy of midtrimester amniocentesis (MTAcz) in multiple pregnancy (MP). The indications and complications of MTAcz are the same for singleton pregnancies (SP) and MP, but what's different is the technique of the procedure and frequency of complications. Various techniques are here quoted, the purpose of which is to prove that samples have been taken from separate sacs. In general, the efficacy in amniotic fluid collection is 92?98%, and 95.6% in autors' cases. The number of insertion needles may have the influence on the abortion rate, but the opposite opinion also exists. The rate of spontaneous abortions has been analysed retrospectively in a group of SP with and without amniocentesis. The same parameters were also evaluated for MP. The risk of spontaneous abortions following MTAcz is nearly 2.5 times higher in MP (1.7% vs. 3.89%) than in SP, but is still within the range of normally elevated biological risk (4.5%) of this group of subjects.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D US) can improve the diagnostic ability in a routine check-up of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in an office practice. Methods Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasound were performed on 267 patients undergoing IVF on the first visit, during ovulation induction and aspiration of the oocytes. Patients with suspected uterine anomalies and/or abnormalities of the endometrium (N?=?108) were treated by operative hysteroscopy. On the day of oocyte collection, multiplanar imaging and 3-D reconstruction demonstrated cumuli in follicles greater than 15?mm. Cumulus assessment inside the ovarian follicles was correlated to the number of mature oocytes. Power Doppler reconstruction was performed in the cases when superponing vessels did not allow correct placing of the puncture needle. Results Of 108 patients with suspected uterine abnormality, the diagnosis was correct in all cases of endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, arcuate uteri and septate uteri, as confirmed by an office hysteroscopy. Intrauterine synechiae was correctly diagnosed preoperatively in one out of the four cases. The mean (±?SD) number of follicles >?18?mm was 8.2?±?5.8, and total number of follicles demonstrating cumulus in all three planes was 6.4?±?5.1. The ratio cumuli/retrieved oocytes, cumuli/fertilised oocytes and cumuli/mature oocytes was 6.2?±?4.2, 5.4?±?2.8 and 5.9?±?2.6, respectively. Conclusions Three dimensional ultrasound can become a standard of routine check-up of infertility patients allowing improved recognition of the uterine anatomy, characterisation of the surface features, and precise depiction of the ovaries during stimulation cycles. It can enhance and facilitate the morphologic and functional evaluation of the anatomic structures of the inner reproductive organs, thus avoiding the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. Various puncturing procedures can be more precisely performed. The built-in application of live 3-D mode may be very helpful in performing invasive procedures, such as oocyte collection.

AB  - Physiologic change of spiral arteries is important adaptation of maternal vascular network for ongoing pregnancy. It is characterised by destruction of muscular layer of these vessels changing them to a low resistance vascular channels. Physiologic change was found to be incomplete in pregnancies complicated by pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). These changes were detected in vitro in histrologic studies but recently were investigated in vivo using Doppler ultrasound. In normal pregnancy the impedance to blood flow in spiral arteries measured by resistance (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indices significantly decrease toward the mid trimester (P?<?0.05) and then remains stable. Similar observation was found in pregnancies complicated by PIH and IUGR. Both of these represent the second wave of trophoblastic invasion of spiral arteries. In pregnancies complicated by PIH and IUGR measured impedance indices were significantly higher compared to the matched normotensive women with normal fetal growth (P?<?0.05), representing ht failure of the complete physiologic change of the spiral arteries. This is in concordance with histologic studies. Comparing the significance levels of blood flow in proximal and distal parts of uteroplacental circulation between investigated groups, the higher significance levels were obtained in terminal parts. This can have serious implication in designing further research protocols of the screening programmes for the PIH and IUGR based on the blood flow in uteroplacental circulation.

AB  - Introduction In this screening program, 2D color Doppler (2D CD) was used as the first, and CA-125 and 3D power Doppler (3D PD) were used as second-line screening tools when 2D scoring system indicated possible malignancy. The study was designed to show whether early stages of ovarian cancer can be correctly diagnosed by 3D PD and whether 3D would perform better than CA-125. Methods All patients were either postmenopausal, or premenopausal with positive family history, or they had a persistent ovarian cyst. They were all examined by 2D CD and if values of scoring system were over cut-off point, 3D PD analysis was performed and CA-125 was tested. Results A total of 108 patients (97 postmenopausal and 11 premenopausal with family history) had a 2D scan. In 5 cases 2D scoring indicated possible malignancy after which 3D analysis was done as well as test for CA-125. In 2 cases 3D PD scoring was negative, as well as CA-125 and the lesions were simple cyst surrounded by chronic inflammatory process in the first patient and ovarian fibroma in the second. In 3 cases 3D PD scoring was positive while CA-125 measurement showed increased values only in 1 case. PHD analysis confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma in all three lesions. 3D PD correctly predicted benign or malignant nature of the lesion, while CA-125 failed to do so in two stage 1 ovarian cancers. Conclusion Although now expensive and in most hospitals unavailable, 3D power Doppler is a future screening tool in ovarian cancer screening programs. However, a lot more women should be screened before proper statistical analysis could be done.

AB  - The purpose of the first study was to evaluate whether number and size of antral follicles can predict the outcome of IVF-ET. A total of 113 patients was prospectively included into this study. After 19?days of downregulation number and size of follicles were determined by using recent three dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (3-D) technology. We demonstrated that patients with a higher number of follicles between 5 and 10?mm showed a significantly higher pregnancy rate (PR), whereas patients with antral follicles >?11?mm have a higher cancellation rate due to ovarian low-response. Ultrasound visualization of the cumulus has been demonstrated years ago as an occasional finding during follicle scanning. It has never been proven, however, that cumulus-like intrafollicular structures as seen on ultrasound correlated with the recovery of mature oocytes. It was therefore our aim to investigate this possibility by using recent three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D) technology: Cumulus visualization by 3D ultrasound seems to be an indicator for mature oocytes and the fertilization rate. Follicles without visualization of the cumulus in all three planes are unlikely to contain mature, fertilizable oocytes. In the third part we wanted to evaluate the possibility of puncturing procedures under three-dimensional ultrasound control in close to real time using a new commercially available system, and to describe the technique. It will be demonstrated for follicle punctures that recent technology enables the carrying out of three-dimensional puncture procedures in real time; but this will be of more importance in other fields, e.g. in fetal medicine, oncology, and surgery.

AB  - Aim To investigate the role of 3D-ultrasound in estimating the likelihood of conception in an IVF programme. Materials and methods We studied a total of 152 women during their stimulation cycle. Apart from conventional 2D-parameters we assessed endometrial and uterine volume (sub-)endometrial blood flow (sub-)endometrial vessel density and ovarian volume by 3D-ultrasound. Results With regard to subendometrial blood flow on day 1 of the stimulation cycle, all 3D-indices were significantly lower in the conception vs. non-conception group. On the day of oocyte retrieval, any difference between the two groups failed to reach statistical significance. The same applied to endometrial volumes. The latter showed a significant corrrelation with uterine size. Ovarian volumes ≤?3?mm (1 SD below the mean) on day 1 of the stimulation cycle were associated with a nonsignificant lower conception rate. Conclusion Quantitative assessment of spiral artery blood flow and vessel density may be an early predictor of IVF success.

AB  - Objectives To compare the use a simplified ultrasound based infertility investigation of the infertile couple with the current use of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. Study design Thirty-three infertile couples underwent transvaginal ultrasound and hystero-salpingo-contrast-sonography. A diagnosis was formulated based on the results of the ultrasound investigations, a semen analysis and endocrine parameters. The following day all subjects underwent a laparoscopic chrompertubation and hysteroscopy by a surgeon unaware of the ultrasound findings. A diagnosis based on the findings at laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, the same semen analysis and endocrine parameters, was then made. The two diagnoses were compared. Results A 90.9% agreement was found between the diagnoses made from the two methods used. When considering laparoscopic diagnosis the Gold Standard of tubal patency, the sensitivity to diagnose occluded tubes using hystero-contrast-sonography was 92.8%. The corresponding figures for specificity, PPV and NPV were 96.2%, 92.8% and 98.1%, respectively. Conclusions A simple, ultrasound based approach to investigate the infertile couple, can be used effectively as an initial examination modality during the couple's work-up. However, there is a need for a larger study to confirm these results.

AB  - Fetal echocardiography including colour and spectral Doppler facilitates the diagnosis of the great majority of major structural and functional cardiac abnormalities in the late first and early second trimester of gestation. Based on more than 4000 echocardographic examinations between 10 and 16?weeks of gestation (4/1993?3/2000) following data are demonstrated: 1. The four-chamber view and cross-over of the pulmonary trunk and aorta were visualised in 44% of the fetuses at 10?weeks and in 100% at 13?weeks of gestation. 2. Normative biometric data of the fetal heart has been established. The ratio of the right and left ventricle and of the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta were constant during this period of pregnancy (approximately 1.00 and 1.10, respectively). 3. The detection rate for cardiac malformations was greater than 60%. Colour Doppler increased the detection rate by easier demonstration of the great arteries and of abnormal cardiac blood flow pattern (valvular incompetence and stenosis). 4. In fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (=?3?mm) (30% of those with general hydrops) the rate of aneuploidy was twice as high in fetuses with abnormal echocardiographic findings compared to fetuses with normal echocardiogram. In some aneuploid fetuses with normal cardiac structures transient tricuspid regurgitation was observed. 5. Some complex cardiac malformations were diagnosed which are very rare in later gestation, e.g. absent pulmonary valve syndrome with patent ductus arteriosus, polyvalvular stenoses of the semilunar valves.

AB  - The intrauterine development of the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most interesting fields in perinatology. The brain has three-dimensional structure and rapidly changes its appearance during pregnancy. Therefore, the fetal brain should be evaluated three-dimensionally with consideration of gestational age. Sonoembryology has been established by high-frequency transvaginal sonography. Premature brain structure and ventricular system of early fetuses can be clearly demonstrated and prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies has been done earlier and earlier. Application of transvaginal approach to the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters has enabled brain imaging from fetal parietal direction through fontanelles and cranial sutures, and ?neurosonography? has been established. Recent introduction of 3D ultrasound in neurosonography produced skull imaging, serial parallel images of the brain structure, volume extraction of target organ and brain circulatory images. Furthermore, advanced technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate CNS morphology including the brain stem, which is not clearly depicted by sonography. By using all those technologies, prenatal diagnosis of CNS abnormalities has been more objective and accurate. Intracranial changes in cases with CNS anomalies have been objectively demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, intrauterine acquired brain damage such as periventricular leukomalacia, which is one of the controversial issues in perinatology, has been proven by sonography in a few cases. Further case studies will be required for investigation of CNS pathology in utero.

AB  - Background The aim of the present study is to individuate sonographic markers which make it possible to distinguish borderline ovarian tumors from benign and malignant cysts, thus allowing conservative treatment. Method We reviewed transvaginal sonograms in 23 women who presented borderline ovarian tumors histologically confirmed. Sixteen were premenopausal and 7 postmenopausal. The size and morphologic criteria of each mass and color flow Doppler characteristics were evaluated. We compared these findings with those of 337 patients with benign ovarian tumors and those of 40 patients with malignant ovarian tumors. Results Of the 16 borderline ovarian tumors in premenopause 6 were mucinous cystoadenomas and 10 serous cystoadenomas. Of the 7 borderline tumors in postmenopause 3 were mucinous cystoadenomas and 4 serous cystoadenomas. The analysis of grey scale morphologic findings revealed the presence of solid tissue in 92.5% of malignant masses, in 13.3% of benign tumors (P?<?0.01) and in 31% of LMP tumors (P?<?0.01 vs. malignant, P?=?n.s vs. benign tumors). The presence of papillae within the cysts was significantly higher in borderline tumors (21%) compared to benign and malignant tumors. Three unilocular cysts with a diameter >?5?cm were borderline tumors. Conclusion The most frequent diagnostic imaging was that of a papillae inside a cyst without other signs of complexity and also the presence of septa was frequent. Neither papillae nor septa constituted sensitive sonographic markers.

AB  - Background Urinary tract anomalies are among the most common sonographically identified anomalies in utero with the incidence about 1/250?1/1000 pregnancies. The obstruction can be unilateral or bilateral at the level of urethra, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), ureterovesical junction (UVJ). Method Obstructive uropathy cases diagnosed antenatally have been retrospectively evaluated in terms of short and long-term outcome. It is important to make early diagnosis and intervention in order to save organ function as possible. Results During last 7?years in our Department, 58 cases with fetal obstructive uropathy were examined and performed 12 interventions. They were diagnosed antenatally with different type of obstruction including posterior urethral valve syndrome, unilateral and bilateral hydronephrosis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, multicystic kidney. Intervention was performed in 12 cases at different stage of gestation including needling, vesico-amniotic shunting and pelvic shunting. Out of 12 procedures, there was mortality in 5 cases antenatally or neonatally. Conclusion Early diagnosis of the obstruction is very important before the kidney becomes dysplastic. The type of anomalies, level and starting time of pathology and duration of severe obstruction are the main factors for prognosis. Early diagnosis and referral to tertiary center is to be encouraged in order to have early management and intervention in the case of severe obstruction and to save kidney function as early as possible.

AB  - In the context of an implementation study of nuchal translucency (NT) screening for Down's syndrome special attention was devoided to the psycho-social aspects. The impact of age, parity, religion, education together with the reasons for opting in or out for the NT measurement were recorded in 5895 patients. On a sample of 800 patients more specific aspects were addressed such as the level of knowledge about prenatal diagnosis before and after screening, the reaction to the offer of NT screening and the general women's opinion on whether this form of screening should be offered to all pregnant women. Questionnaires devised to measure the anxiety and depression produced by screening (hads) were filled before screening, at 20?weeks' gestation and after delivery by the same group of patients and by 200 controls. Preliminary results are available. 80% of the asked women, with no differences in age, religion and parity choose for NT screening. Main reason for having the NT measured was the hope of avoiding invasive testing and the wish of having more information on their pregnancy. The majority of women experienced positively NT screening even in case of an increased measurement and irrespectively of whether they would terminate an affected pregnancy or not. A slight increase in anxiety level produced by the screening normalized by 20?weeks' gestation.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the changes in flow velocity waveforms in the mid-cerebral artery and in the transverse cerebral sinus in growth restricted fetuses and to correlate these changes between them and with (1) flow velocity waveforms in the ductus venosus and (2) changes in computerized analysis of fetal cardiotocogram. Design Fetuses between 22 and 37?weeks' gestation with an estimated fetal weight below the 5th centile were included in this prospective longitudinal study. Doppler measurements in the umbilical artery, descending aorta, middle cerebral artery, transverse cerebral sinus and ductus venosus were recorded. Fetal heart rate was analyzed by a computer system according to the Dawes-Redman criteria. Results Blood flow within the midcerebral artery and that in the cerebral transverse sinus follow a mirror image distribution. Arterial redistribution is already present when alteration in the venous cerebral circulation develops. We measured a significant correlation between pulsatility index in the transverse cerebral sinus and in the ductus venosus over the study period and at delivery. There was a negative correlation between these indices and short and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate. There was a parallel increase in pulsatility in the ductus venosus and the transverse cerebral sinus. These changes were inversely correlated with fetal heart rate variability and preceded fetal distress. Conclusion Cerebral venous blood flow in IUGR fetuses may be a useful additional investigation to (1) understand better the mechanism of cerebral redistribution in hypoxemic IUGR and (2) to discriminate between fetal adaptation and fetal decompensation in chronic hypoxemia.

AB  - Background Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) complicates 10?15% of monochorionic (MC) and is associated with high perinatal mortality and morbidity. Method Sixteen MC twin pairs were evaluated between 10?14 weeks for delta nuchal translucency (?NT) and Doppler blood flow in ductus venosus (DV). Sequential scans were performed to identify TTTS. Results Neither the 12 cases with ?NT<0.7 mm/normal flow, nor the two cases with ?NT>0.7 mm/normal flow in DV, developed TTTS. The two cases that combined ?NT>0.7 mm and abnormal flow in DV eventually developed TTTS. Conclusion The presence of abnormal blood flow in the DV in MC twins, at 10?14 weeks, may be a precocious anticipatory sign of TTTS.

AB  - We have been studying fetal centralization in the toxemic/IUGR model since 1992, by means of Doppler of the umbilical and middle cerebral arteries and ductus venosus, computerized CTG and cordocentesis. The natural history of fetal centralization may be divided into 3 phases: normoxemic centralization, hypoxemic centralization and decompensation. The natural history of fetal hypoxemia in these models and the patterns of computerized CTG were also described. Having analysed 105 cases of very high-risk pregnancies in the toxemic/IUGR model with fetal centralization, we tried to define the best parameter to indicate the ideal timing for delivery, and the presence of centralization after 28?weeks gestation appears to seems to indicate it.

AB  - Objectives To assess the value of first trimester scanning for the diagnosis of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Population/methods An unselected group of 7447 pregnant women who had a first trimester scan in our unit. In all the cases an anatomical survey was performed and the nuchal translucency was measured. Four thousand and 84 women also had second trimester biochemical screening. We assessed the performance of first trimester scanning in the detection of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Results The incidence of anomalous fetuses was 1.4%, including 43 chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate for structural abnormalities was 59% (37/63). Seventy-eight percent of chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed at 11?14?weeks either because of a nuchal translucency measurement above the 99th centile or due to the presence of structural abnormalities. Second trimester biochemical screening detected half of the fetuses with trisomy 21 which were missed by first trimester screening, increasing the sensitivity to 90.5% (19/21; 95%C.I. 69.6% to 98.8%). However, the positive predictive value of the biochemical test was very low (0.5%). Conclusion First trimester NT measurement is an effective screening test for the prenatal detection of fetuses with structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the measurement of biochemical markers in the second trimester can detect additional affected fetuses this may be out-weighted by the delay in diagnosis, the extra visits and cost so that the right time for biochemical screening still needs to be determined. Second trimester anomaly scanning should continue to be an essential part of a prenatal screening programme.

AB  - Remarkable changes and continuous growth and development of the early maternal-fetal circulation could be studied by Doppler ultrasound. This approach seems to give more light in understanding of the early pregnancy development. Doppler ultrasound was reported accurate to separate different segments of uterine blood flow during pregnancy. Color flow is used to anatomically locate arcuate, radial and spiral arteries. Pulsed Doppler is then used to study different flow patterns of visualized vessels. Studies of maternal-fetal circulation in early pregnancy may help for better understanding of physiological and pathophysiological hemodynamic changes in the circulation. Investigation of maternal (main uterine, arcuate, radial and spiral) arteries; placental (umbilical, chorionic arterioles) vessels and embryonic/fetal (heart, aorta and intracranial circulation) arteries flow patterns may help to diagnose abnormal implantation and embryonic development. More studies are necessary in order the Doppler technique to be used for clinical assessment in early pregnancy. Safety aspects should also be considered. However, potentials of this technique are promising in study of early pregnancy failure, chromosomal abnormalities, development of pre-eclampsia and IUGR.
