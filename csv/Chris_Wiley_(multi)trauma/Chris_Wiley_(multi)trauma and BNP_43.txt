AB  - Our first purpose was to describe embryonic anatomic structures by use of IUS with a 20-MHz flexible catheter-based, high resolutions, real-time miniature transducer. The number and the clarity of structures increased from 7 to 8?weeks of gestation; however, the image quality was degenerated because of the increasing fetal size at 9?weeks. At 8?weeks secondary brain vesicles, spine, midgut herniation, liver, upper and lower limb buds, and sacral tail were visualized in all fetuses. The four-chamber view was first identified at 8?weeks, as were fingers or toes. The stomach was first noted at 9?weeks. Second purpose was to compare the ultrasound visualization of the early first-trimester embryo using TVS and IUS as 6?8?weeks of gestation. The ability to view most organs was better with IUS compared to TVS, and this was especially true for the brain, spine, heart, liver, midgut herniation, extremities, and sacral tail. Moreover, it was possible to obtain finer image quality of very small embryonic structures with IUS than with TVS. Third purpose was to evaluate embryonic organ growth (liver, heart, and brain vesicles) using IUS in the early first trimester of pregnancy. The significant good correlation between each parameter and gestational age was obtained. Fourth purpose was to visualize normal embryonal surface anatomic structures using 3D-IUS at 7?9.9?weeks gestational age. At week 8, prominent forehead was evident, and upper and lower limbs and midgut herniation were clearly depicted. At week 9, fingers and toes were depicted as small digital rays, and the sacral tail protruded caudally. At week 10, embryonic face and fingers were clearly shown.

AB  - Background The optimal time at which to perform obstetric ultrasound remains controversial. Late first trimester imaging offers the possibility for early diagnosis of structural and genetic abnormalities. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) allows the entire first trimester conceptus to be contained within one or two volumes of data. Subsequent processing of this data allows optimized views of the fetus, placenta and cord to be obtained. Method Late first trimester (?12?week) pregnancies were imaged with transvaginal 3DUS. A fetal structural survey was performed, standard biometry obtained and nuchal translucency thickness (NTT) measured. The time taken to perform and assess the scans was recorded. Results A comprehensive fetal survey was obtained, fetal measurements made and NTT measured in most fetuses with average scan times of less than one minute and average volume assessment times of less than 10?min in all cases. There were no abnormal findings in this series. Conclusion 3DUS appears to be a useful tool in the ultrasound evaluation of the 12?week fetus. A detailed examination of the fetus may be performed with minimal scan time offering exciting possibilities for the use of transvaginal 3DUS as a ?one step? screening examination.

AB  - An HRT-associated reduction of the pulsatility index (PI) has been reported in the literature, although cross-sectional studies have shown conflicting data. In a prospective, controlled study we randomized 30 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 52?±?3?years) into two groups. Women in the HRT group (N?=?15) received 1?mg micronized 17?-estradiol daily (E2) sequentially combined with 5 or 10?mg dydrogesterone for 14?days of each 28-day cycle during 12?months, and, thereafter, 2?mg E2 combined with 10?mg dydrogesterone for a period of 3?months. The control group (N?=?15) received no treatment. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to measure the impedance to flow (pulsatility index [PI]) within the uterine, central retinal and ophthalmic arteries in the E2-phase at baseline and after 3, 12 and 15?months. Compared to controls, 12 months of HRT was associated with a significant decrease in the mean PI of the uterine artery of ?39% (HRT ?25%, controls +14%) and in that of the central retinal artery of ?29% (HRT ?9%, controls +20%). After 3?months this effect was already evident. During HRT, the reductions in mean PI of the uterine and central retinal arteries vs. baseline were larger (both P?=?0.002) in the women with high pretreatment PI values when compared to those with low pretreatment values. The baseline PI of the uterine artery correlated positively with age and with duration of amenorrhoea (r?=?0.42, P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.48, P?=?0.008, respectively). Our 12-month study expanded on earlier reports of a reduced PI of the uterine artery. We used a combined regimen containing a low-dose of oestrogens. These results are important because the recent trend is to recommend combined HRT that contain lower dosages of oestrogens than before. Furthermore, a 29% reduction of the PI of the central retinal artery was observed, which suggests that HRT has a positive influence on the impedance of the cerebral circulation. From the point of view of atherothrombotic risk these observations are beneficial and possibly helpful in understanding the decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and of the impairment of cognitive functions associated with oestrogens in epidemiological data.

AB  - Objective In pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) there are essentially two causes of perinatal death: prematurity and lung hypoplasia. We used ultrasound to try to predict these complications. Design and methods The cervical length was measured by transvaginal ultrasound in 167 pregnancies complicated by pPROM <?32?weeks of gestation. Further in 20 pregnancies with pPROM before 24?weeks of gestation peripheral pulmonary artery (PPA) waveforms were recorded by Doppler technique at weekly interval until delivery and the Pulsatility Index (PI) calculated. Pregnancies were managed conservatively according to an Institutional management protocol. The occurrence of preterm delivery and pulmonary hypoplasia was evaluated and related to ultrasound findings. Results The cervical length at admission predicts the time interval elapsing between pPROM and delivery. Significant differences in PI values from PPA were present from 2?weeks onwards the pPROM between the fetuses who developed pulmonary hypoplasia and those with a normal outcome. Conclusion The measurement of the cervical length and of PPA velocity waveforms may help to establish the risk of developing prematurity and pulmonary hypoplasia in pregnancies complicated by pPROM.

AB  - Traditionally, the prenatal assessment of the umbilical cord (UC) is limited to the assessment of the number of vessels and to the evaluation of umbilical artery blood flow parameters. Morphologic aspects of the UC have usually been studied by pathologists and retrospectively correlated with the perinatal outcome. The introduction of more sophisticated imaging techniques have offered the possibility to investigate the UC characteristics during fetal life from early to late gestation. A number of investigations have demonstrated that an altered structure of the UC can be associated with pathologic conditions (i.e. preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, diabetes, fetal demise). Nomograms of the various UC components have been generated and allow the identification of lean or large umbilical cords, entities frequently associated with fetal growth abnormalities and diabetes, respectively. Of note, lean UC in the second and third trimester differs from normal UC not only from a structural point of view but also in the umbilical vein blood flow characteristics. On the other hand a thin UC in the first trimester seems to be a marker for identifying a subset of fetuses at risk for spontaneous abortion and pre-eclampsia. A Wharton's jelly reduction has also been invoked as a possible cause of fetal death in the presence of single umbilical artery. Prenatal morphometric and morphologic UC characteristics as well as UC arterial and venous blood flow parameters in normal and pathologic conditions will be presented and discussed.

AB  - Objectives Our purpose was to evaluate the risks of malignancy in surgically removed ovarian cysts that preoperatively were characterized as unilocular by transvaginal sonography. Study design This prospective analysis included 1307 women operated at two European university Hospitals between January 1992 and December 1997. Based on ultrasonographic findings the cysts were characterized either as echo-free, without solid parts or papillary formations (group I) or cysts with solid parts/papillary formations or echogenic cyst content (group II). Ultrasonographic and macroscopic appearance of the cysts were compared with histopathological diagnosis. Results In group I seven of 670 (1.1%) proved to be borderline or malignant, and all measured ≥?75?mm in diameter. The corresponding figures for cysts in group II were 24 of 634 (3.8%). The frequency of borderline/malignant cysts increased significantly with the size of the cysts. Conclusion Unilocular, echo-free cysts (group I) with a mean diameter above 50?mm and all unilocular cysts with solid parts/papillary formations should be removed surgically. Serial ultrasound follow-up should be the standard procedure of unilocular, echo-free cysts less than 50?mm.

AB  - Background Intracardiac echogenic foci are controversially discussed whether or not they are marker for chromosomal aberrations. The possible association with fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) and its impact were not yet analyzed extensively. Method During 30?months, prenatally detected structural CHD were prospectively analyzed for the presence of EF. Frequency, localization, number, association with chromosomal defects and pattern of CHD were assessed. Results 279 fetal CHD could be examined and EF were found in 31 cases (11.1%). The localization was in 17 cases (54%) the left, in 7 (22%) the right, and in 7 (22.5%) both ventricles. Multiple EF were found in 10 cases. 14 cases (42%) were associated with a chromosomal aberration (T18 n?=?2; T21 n?=?5, T13 n?=?3, Triploidy n?=?2, Del22q n?=?1, others n?=?1). Among the remaining 17 fetuses with normal chromosomes following heart defects were found: 3???VSD, 3???Left-persistent SVC, 2???TGA, 2???TOF, 2???Coarctation, and 1???PS, PA, Ebstein, TAC, AS each. Conclusions Compared to low-risk groups EF are more frequent in the presence of CHD and show another distribution involving more right ventricular or bilateral EF. The combination of EF and CHD is highly associated with aneuploidies. Since associated CHD include also conotruncal anomalies EF can be considered as an indication for targeted fetal echocardiography especially when EF is localized in the RV or in both ventricles.

AB  - At present there are four concepts guiding the sonographic examination of the fetal heart: (1) the fetal echocardiogram (FEC) is difficult to perform and time-consuming, (2) FEC should be performed only in high risk pregnancies, (3) the optimal time to perform FEC is 18?22?weeks gestation, (4) FEC relies on several sonographic still views. In our lecture, we will present a new systemic ?video? approach to the great vessels and the four chambers in early pregnancy using transvaginal sonography. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the cardiovascular system was performed in 36?323 consecutive fetuses using a dynamic ?video? multidirectional approach. Cardiovascular anomalies were detected in 173 fetuses giving an overall incidence of 1 in 210 pregnancies and 1 in 238 low-risk pregnancies. Fifty-six percent of the fetuses had associated anomalies. The prenatal diagnosis was confirmed in 90 cases. In 10 fetuses a different cardiac anomaly was observed. In four fetuses the cardiovascular anomaly was not detected in early pregnancy. In the remaining cases, postmortem examination was not performed. Early fetal heart examination is suggested in all pregnancies. Conclusions Fetal ECC should be performed: (a) transvaginally, (b) in early pregnancy (14?16?weeks), (c) in every pregnancy , (d) using the video multidirectional approach.

AB  - Background Fetal growth is determined by its genetic potential and growth support. The aim of our prospective study was to find out does the growth support (placental factor and blood flow) or genetic potential play a primary role in fetal growth. Method From 27 to 41 gestational weeks an umbilical artery (RI1), a middle cerebral artery resistance index (RI2) and umbilical-cerebral (U/C) ratio were measured. Several US measurements in 3?4?week intervals of the same pregnancy were done. After delivery, fetuses were divided into the three groups (AGA, LGA, SGA) according to their birth-weights. Pregnancies with gestational diabetes were excluded from the study. Results There were not statistically significant differences between the average values of RI1 (age related) in the groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. However, the mean values of RI1 (according to gestational age) in the mentioned two groups of fetuses were significantly lower than in the group of SGA fetuses, as well as their mean values of U/C ratios. Conclusion Placental factor is equally and efficiently functioning in the both groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. The genetic regulating factor of fetal growth can be adequately expressed in conditions of appropriate uteroplacental and umbilical blood supply. In other words, in identical or at least similar conditions of umbilical blood supply, fetal growth is exclusively influenced by its genetic potential.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is now defined as a condition in which the fetus does not reach the optimal condition of his growth. In this situation the birthweight can be reduced below the 10th percentile or can be superior to that threshold especially when the restriction took first place in late part of the pregnancy. Therefore it is possible to identify two groups of IUGR according to the intrauterine observation and the birthweight assessment: SGA and AGA IUGR. The most important complication of IUGR is represented by the hypoxaemia caused by placental vasculopathy. Hypoxaemia is present in about 30% of IUGR fetuses with not significant difference between SGA and AGA IUGR cases, and is the major cause of the poor perinatal outcome. After recognition of the growth restriction it is necessary to apply second level tests in order to assess the presence or absence of hypoxaemia. When hypoxaemia is present the first mechanism of fetal adaptation is represented by the redistribution of the circulation. This phenomenon is easily observable by using Doppler technology. When applying the same technique on the umbilical arteries it is possible to detect an increase in the peripheral resistance proportional to the obliteration of the placental vascular bed that is the cause of the fetal hypoxaemia. By using the information offered by Doppler study on fetal and umbilical vessels it is therefore possible to optimize the clinical management of the IUGR fetuses.

Aim of the presentation is to illustrate the information gained by the vascularisation and perfusion indices. In addition, to show the reproducibility of the indices according to published studies, preliminary results (transvaginal) obtained in ovarian tumors and preliminary results in phantom measurements to correct the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation using a 3D abdominal probe. Results Color Histogram indices are reproducible. Differences of perfusion and vascularisation between benign and malignant ovarian tumors could be observed in a limited number of investigations. The physical component of the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation could be calculated by mathematical algorythms according to first phantom measurements. Conclusion The 3D Color Histogram gives new possibilities to analyse neoangiogenesis.

AB  - Background Two methods are presented for the assessment of fetal behaviours under the application of Doppler effects: (a) Measurement of the velocity wave of fetal limb by vibroacustic stimulating. (b) Hydrodynamic evaluation of the transnasal amniotic velocity wave and its relation to gastric peristalsis. Method A Doppler device was employed to assess the velocimetry wave from the ?FEMORAL BONE? in motion, following vibro-acoustic stimulation in 138 phisiological pregnancy and Doppler-aided evaluation of transnasal amniotic hydrodynamics. Results and conclusion Assessment of normal fetal behaviour. Quantification of patterns of reactivity of any body structure. Reduction in the duration of explorations for biophysical profiles. (3?4?min). Fetal reflex responses slow down and become increasingly complex as maturation carries on. Both mean velocity and acceleration of fetal reactive responses experience a gradual decline throughout gestation. The time a fetus takes to respond to a stimulus increases directly with gestational age. Simultaneousness between fetal respiration episodes and phases of gastric distention and activity. (physiological conditions). Fetal active respiration can be unequivocally accounted for by Doppler assessment of the activity of intake/release of amniotic fluid along the high respiratory branches of the pulmonary tree. Amniotic respiratory dynamics are always transnasal in physiological conditions. Velocities of transnasal, decreasing steadily from the 32nd gestational age to the end of gestation.

AB  - Aim To assess agreement between fetal cord blood Hb concentration by Doppler velocimetry and a formula (Oepkes et al, Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1994; 101:680?4), and the actual Hb concentration by cord blood sampling. Material and methods A prospective cohort of 31 Rh isoimmunised fetuses undergoing Doppler cord blood velocity measurements within the 24 hs previous to cordocentesis or delivery was included. Mean aortic velocity at descent fetal aorta and maximum umbilical vein flow at intrahepatic portion were measured blindly by a single operator with pulsed Doppler and a 3.5 Mhz transducer. Cord Hb was the gold standard. Abnormality and normality were defined as a Hb level lower and higher, respectively, than the cut-off point (<7, <8, <9, <10, <11 and <12 g/dL were tested). Likelihood ratio was also calculated. Results Interval between Doppler study and cordocentesis/delivery was 24?48 hs.

AB  - The prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformations seems to be a very difficult challenge, mainly for those who are beginning with the practice of ultrasound. As it would be impossible to refer to so many fetal malformations the presentation will cover a few interesting issues. These cases are not frequently diagnosed and in many cases present controversial aspects referred to their prognosis and management. Those topics are: Unilateral ventricular dilatation Fetal hyperechogenic lung lesions Umbilical vein varix Facial clefts Unilateral ventricular dilatation may be a difficult diagnosis and its prognosis is variable Fetal hyperechogenic lesions include a broad range of anomalies with a variable behaviour. Even large lesions can disappear in utero but often the lesion can persist with severe prognosis for the fetus. Varix of the umbilical vein is a relatively uncommon abnormality that carries an increased risk for fetal demise, chromosomal abnormality and hydrops. Facial clefts are a relatively common malformation and the fetal face must be properly scanned in every fetal study. 3D ultrasound helps a lot in the diagnosis of these and other malformations and we'll discuss some examples concerning this new technology.

AB  - Objective Since August 1998 we used the integrated 3-D software with the Siemens Elegra in order to evaluate fetoplacental vessels in the 3-D mode. Aim of the evaluation was to examine the feasibility of the application and to demonstrated potential clinical advantages. Methods In our antenatal clinic we recruited pregnant women between 12 and 38?weeks of gestation to take part in a feasibility study in order to evaluate the free-hand 3-D application using the 5.0?MHz transducer for routine antenatal scanning. We examined vasculatore within the placenta, intrathoracoabdominal and intracranial fetal vessels with the integrated powermode. Acquisition time for a volume date set is between 3 and 20?s depending on the resolution selected. Results Three-dimensional examination of the fetoplacental vessels is easily available using the Siemens Elegra, because no change in transducer is necessary. Our preliminary data show that we are able to demonstrate the complexity of intraplacental vasculature, which may be clinically helpful in the evaluation of twin placentas. Within the fetus the spatial arrangement of the vessels and their relation to each other can be depicted. This allows to study the fetal vascular tree and clearly discloses vascular anomalies. Conclusions Application of the integrated 3-D software within the Siemens Elegra for the first time allows the examination of the complex fetoplacental vascular tree in vivo. This may be clinically helpful in the differential diagnosis of fetal anomalies.

AB  - Doppler velocimetry give possibility of making noninvasive evaluation of the vascular modifications from the beginning of pregnancy. We have studied following vessels: Retrocorial arteries The flow increases since sixth to twelfth weeks, progressively which is explained by the increment of the conductancy and the reduction of resistance. Trophoblastic invasion of spirals arteries in the coral bed, and hormones produced during the gestation affect both values. Uterine arteries The resistance of the uterine arteries diminish since sixth to twelfth weeks, in normal pregnancy. The low increment depends on the modifications in the coral bed and of hormonal vasodilator effect. OVF Luteum gravidicus When ovary flow is greater in first stage of pregnancy suggest a favorable early gestation, and vice versa, a regress in those measures had a negative character. We could evaluate the role of Doppler examinations in the following situations: ? Abortion in any stage and variations ? Blighted ovum ? Ectopic pregnancy In all these conditions, Doppler showed to be a trusty, predictive, prognostical and diagnostical instrument of great utility. Clinical application of Doppler Uterus Corial could be used in a preventive way when the increment of the resistance in the uterine arteries appears before clinical abortion symptoms. We also applied Doppler exploration in AVF patients confirming that the deficit in uterine perfusion is significantly related with the failures in embryonary implantation. Recently, we are performing endovaginal color Doppler in the diagnoses of early ectopic gestation and trophoblastic disease with very satisfactory results.

AB  - Subacute or chronic fetal hypoxia is associated with an increase in fetal erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis irrespective of the etiology of hypoxia. Amniotic fluid (AF) EPO level is often elevated in diabetic pregnancies (especially in macrosomic fetuses), and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension (HT), pre-eclampsia (PE) or/and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). It is shown that cerebro-umbilical arterial flow ratio (RIC/RIU) is often abnormal (less than 1) in the case of fetal hypoxia. We studied AF EPO levels in 29 diabetic pregnancies, 18 pregnancies with HT, PE or/and IUGR and 19 healthy controls. The samples were obtained during the elective amniocenteses in the case of suspected fetal hypoxia or during caesarean sections. Doppler measurements were performed not more than 24?h before amniocenesis. AF EPO levels were significantly elevated in diabetics with abnormal fetal growth (either macrosomia or IUGR) and nondiabetics with HT, PE or/and IUGR as compared with healthy controls or diabetics with normal fetal growth. AF EPO levels of fetuses with normal fetal growth in diabetic mothers were not different from those of healthy controls. There was no correlation between AF EPO levels and RIC/RIU in any of the diabetic or nondiabetic group. However, 5 fetuses had either absent end-diastolic or reversed umbilical flow. All had elevated AF EPO levels (range 16?15?800?mU/ml). We conclude that both fetal macrosomia and IUGR in diabetic pregnancies seem to cause chronic fetal hypoxia. Normal fetal growth in diabetic pregnancies is not associated with chronic fetal hypoxia. Single measurement of RIC/RIU is of little value in the diagnosis of chronic fetal hypoxia in abnormal pregnancies.

AB  - Objective Treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is complicated by the lack of readily available measures of the fetal thyroid status. Both hyper- and hypo-thyroidism of the fetus may have short and long-term detrimental effects and thus should be avoided. We therefore followed the fetal thyroidal size during treatment of maternal thyroid disorders and correlated the data with treatment and thyroidal status in the mother. Methods During 24-month period 20 patients with thyroid disorders were referred for serial fetal thyroid measurements. Thyroid size was measured by transvaginal ultrasonography between 14 and 17?weeks' of gestation and by abdominal ultrasonography between 18 and 38?weeks' gestation. Results In five women with Grave's diseases correlation between thionamide dosage and fetal thyroid size were noted. Two fetuses had an increase in the size of thyroid gland above the upper 95% confidence interval, one of them developed neonatal Grave's of which it was the only prenatal sign of fetal thyroid abnormalities. In all other three fetuses changes inthyroidal size aided in determining the dosage of the antithyroidal drugs. Conclusions Inutero ultrasonographic measurements of the fetal thyroid size can be used as a noninvasive tool for the proper management of maternal hyperthyroidism.

AB  - The color and Power Doppler gives us the opportunity to investigate the vascular anatomy as an angiography and furthermore lets us ?see? hydro jets. This singular ability leads us to make some diagnosis and confirm others. During this lecture we will show our experience in the diagnosis of some fetal anomalies such as renal agenesis, urachal cysts, megacystis microcolon Hypoperistalsis syndrome, renal displasia, Galeno vein aneurysm, anterior wall defects such as omphalocele and gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, duodenal atresia, coartation of the aorta, single umbilical artery Dandy Walker Malformation, and some fetal tumors.

AB  - Aim To prevent the syndrome of severe ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF/ET cycles at high risk for the syndome of ovarian hyperstimulation by early timed unilateral ultrasound guided aspiration of one ovary (12?h after hCG). Method. We evaluated the preventive effect of ETFA by analysing the data on 821 cycles at high risk for SOHSS performed during the years 1987?99. In all cycles the high risk for SOHSS was defined by the estradiol values >?3000?pg/ml and more than 8 follicles >?14?mm plus intermediate and small follicles in each ovary on ultrasound. Results In the group of :729 female infertility cycles at high risk for SOHSS with preventive ETFA there were no cases of SOHSS. In the control group of 92 IVF/ET female infertility without ETFA there were 12 cases of SOHSS (P?<?0.0001). No difference in live birth rate (17% vs. 16%) was noted. The results prove the preventive effect of ETFA. It is based on early timed withdrawal of paracine substances which are present in the follicular fluid. Conclusion The vaginal ultrasound guided ETFA is another successful option to decrease the incidence of severe OHSS in assisted reproduction.
