AB  - Background To review the literature of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow and serum hormonal profile in the patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO) compared to the patients with normal menstrual cycles undergoing in-vitro fertilization treatment. Method Pertinent studies were identified through a computer MEDLINE search. References of selected articles were hand-searched for additional citations. Results The vascular impedance to uterine artery blood flow is higher during the luteal phase of PCO patients compared to the normally cycling patients and it does not show any dynamics throughout the menstrual cycle. In the normally cycling patients the active ovary shows dramatic hemodynamic changes during the cycle, therefore the vascular impedance to ovarian artery blood flow is almost constant throughout the menstrual cycle in the inactive ovary. In PCO patients the ovarian arterial blood flow in both ovaries is about the same as in inactive ovaries in the normally cycling patients. High vascular impedance to utero-ovarian arterial blood flow is associated with typical low vascular impedance of stromal ovary vascularization in PCO patients. In stimulated cycles a strong negative correlation between the vascular impedance to the uterine artery blood flow and the serum E2 concentration is found on the day of HCG administration. Taking only anovulatory PCO cycles into consideration, the above correlation is not confirmed. Conclusion Doppler analysis can be a valuable method for the assessment of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow in spontaneous and in stimulated cycles.

AB  - Background Twin-to-Twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a severe complication in monochorionic twin pregnancies. Particularly severe fetal and neonatal cardiac dysfunction is complicated in recipient twin and attended with high perinatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the abnormal echocardiographic features and clinical complications of cardiac disease in TTTS. Method We studied 20 pregnancies complicated with TTTS. Serial fetal and neonatal echocardiography were carried out and evaluated the following parameters: cardiothoracic area ratio, aortic and pulmonary artery Doppler peak velocities, umbilical arterial resistance index, preload index of inferior vena cava, ventricular valve regurgitation and structural heart abnormalities. Result In recipients, all features had cardiomegaly, tricuspid valve regurgitation and high preload condition with increased preload index of inferior vena cava. Aortic and pulmonary artery peak velocities were increased in the recipients than those in the donors. Three cases of recipients had pulmonary valve stenosis and received balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Furthermore, three cases of donors had coarctation of aorta and also received surgical repair. Conclusion In addition to the severity of cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary stenosis and coarctation of aorta would be the important factors to evaluate perinatal prognosis of TTTS.

AB  - Background Absent enddiastolic flow (AEDF) velocities are associated with fetal distress and adverse fetal outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate perinatal findings of fetuses with an AEDF in fetal vessels and to investigate the neurological long-term-outcome. Method The analytical program ?Munich functional developmental diagnostics? (MFDD) was applied to the 90 children at different time intervals. The results of 40 children with an AEDF (Gr. I) and 20 children with pathological S/D-Ratio (Gr. II) were compared to the group of 30 children with normal Doppler-flow-findings (Gr. III) with the same pregnancy weeks at birth. Results The rate of C-section (92% vs. 71% vs. 36%), birthweight (1140g vs. 1725g vs. 2570g), 5?min. APGAR-Score (31% vs. 5% both) were significantly different in three groups. Brain sparing effect in the middle cerebral arteries was found in 81% in Gr. I, in 21% Gr. II and only 8% in Gr. III. At the time of neurological assessment the age of children was between 12 and 36?months. The developmental age for each functional category was evaluated and the difference between corrected age and developmental age was calculated. In 33% of all infants with a AEDF had a pathological neuromotoric development vs. 22% in Gr. II and only 15.3% in Gr. III. Conclusions The children with pathological Doppler-flow-measurements during pregnancy have not only very high risk of perinatal abnormality but also show a distinctly increased risk of impaired growth and neurodevelopmental disability comparing to the cases with a normal Doppler-flow-finding. Most of these fetuses showed brain-sparing effect. These aspects are very important to be discussed with the parents before the definitive perinatal decision is made.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to evaluate arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow in infertile patients. Methods Seventy-six FSH stimulated cycles in 39 patients participating in a timed intercourse or iui program were studied. Transvaginal color and pulsed Doppler measurement of the dominant follicle and corpus luteum resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic velocity (PSV), maximum venous velocity (MVV) and serum p levels during mesoluteal phase were recorded. Velocimetric parameters were established and then used to classify ovarian function in normal ovulatory cycle (NOV; n?=?52), luteal phase defect (LPD; n?=?15) and luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF; n?=?9). Results The luteal PSV and MVV in the nov and LPD cycles were significantly higher (NOV: 24.3?±?12.2 vs. 13.1?±?6.5 and 8.1?±?3.30 vs. 3.6?±?1.1; LPD: 29.8?±?10.3 vs. 14.4?±?4.8 and 5.7?±?1.5 vs. 4.3?±?1.2) and luteal RI and PI were significantly lower (NOV: 0.45?±?0.06 vs. 0.55?±?0.08 and 0.62?±?0.15 vs. 0.83?±?0.22; LPD: 0.46?±?0.05 vs. 0.54?±?0.06 and 0.62?±?0.10 vs. 0.81?±?0.15) than follicular ones. LUF cycles did not show significant changes during the ovarian cycle (follicular vs. luteal PSV; MVV; RI and PI: 14.4?±?4.8 vs. 14.9?±?7.3; 4.3?±?1.2 vs. 4.2?±?2.1; 0.47?±?0.07 vs. 0.58?±?0.12 and 0.66?±?0.12 vs. 0.89?±?0.29) and no ?luteal conversion? of the Doppler signal was identified. There was significant correlation between luteal MVV and serum p (r?=?0.36). Conclusions Arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow remain unaltered during LUF cycles and P levels correlate with luteal MVV. This makes Doppler an effective noninvasive test to assess ovulation and luteal function.

AB  - Background The purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of three-dimensional power Doppler imaging (3D-PDI) in the assessment of the patency of the fallopian tubes during hystero-salpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy). Methods HyCoSy using contrast medium echovist was done on 67 subfertile women. 3D-PDI and two-dimensional (2D) gray-scale imaging were used to visualize the contrast medium in the tubes. Results Contrast medium echovist produced prominent signals on the 3D-PDI image. Free spill of the fallopian tubes which had had the proximal part visualized was demonstrated in 114 (91%) tubes using 3D-PDI technique and in 58 (46%) tubes using conventional HyCoSy. The mean duration of imaging procedure was less than 3D-PDI. A significantly lower volume of contrast medium (5.9?+?0.6?ml) was used for 3D-PDI in comparison with volume (11.2?+?1.9?ml) used for conventional HyCoSy. Conclusions The 3D-PDI method appeared to have advantages over the conventional HyCoSy technique, especially in terms of visualization of spill from the distal end of the tube which was achieved twice as often with the 3D technique. The shorter duration of the imaging and lower volume of the contrast medium used suggested that the 3D-PDI technique may have a better side-effect profile. The 3D-PDI technique allowed better storage of the information for re-analysis and archiving than 2D scanning.

AB  - Background Ultrasound malformations of the fetal genitourinary tract are well documented in the sonographic literature. However, we would like to report on some specific observations. These will include a survey of fetal pelvic kidneys, an association between single umbilical artery (SUA) and absence of one of the kidneys, and the ?Tulip sign?? an ultrasonic marker for severe penoscrotal hypospadias. Method All records of patients with ectopic kidneys over a 5-year period (1995?99) have been perused. Sonographic parameters of ectopic kidney have been evaluated. The same was done for cases of SUA and agenesis of one kidney and for cases with severe penoscrotal hypospadias. Results Pelvic kidney was diagnosed prenatally in 35 cases, of which, bilateral pelvic kidney was detected in 2 cases. There was no predilection for fetal gender, and no tendency to side of appearance. Most cases were diagnosed in late 2nd trimester of pregnancy. The association of SUA and absent kidney was detected in 6 cases. In all cases the diagnosis was made in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. In 6 cases, the specific ?Tulip sign? was detected prenatally and proven postnatally. Conclusions Unique presentations of renal anomalies can be detected prenatally. Pelvic kidney is easily dealt with, however, the association of SUA and absent kidney requires further evaluation of the fetus to exclude the VATER association. The ?Tulip sign? is helpful in diagnosing severe hypospadias.

AB  - Aim To investigate the potential usefulness of contrast enhanced three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler sonography in the differentiation of benign and malignant adnexal lesions. Methods A total of 31 patients with complex adnexal lesions of uncertain malignancy at transvaginal B mode and/or color Doppler sonography were prospectively evaluated with three-dimensional power Doppler sonography before and after injection of the contrast agent. Presence of a penetrating pattern and a mixed penetrating and peripheral pattern suggested adnexal malignancy. The results were compared with histopathology. Results There were 10 cases of ovarian malignancy and 21 benign adnexal lesions. Of the 10 ovarian cancers, 6 (60%) showed vascular distribution suggestive of malignancy at nonenhanced 3D power Doppler sonography. After injection of contrast agent, a penetrating vascular pattern and/or a mixed penetrating and peripheral pattern were detected in all cases of ovarian malignancy with two benign lesions (fibroma and cystadenofibroma) which were misdiagnosed as malignant. The use of a contrast agent with three-dimensional power Doppler sonography showed diagnostic efficiency (96.7%) that was superior to nonenhanced 3D power Doppler sonography (93.5%). Conclusion Contrast enhanced 3D power Doppler sonography provides better visualizatoin of tumor vascularity in complex adnexal masses. If used together with 3D morphological ultrasound assessment, enhanced 3D power Doppler imaging might precisely discriminate benign from malignant adnexal lesions.

AB  - Background Ultrasonography is an effective diagnostic tool for identifying fetal urinary tract anomalies (UTA). Serious obstructive or dysgenetic abnormalities are often clearly detected and their implications well known. Less clear is the meaning of borderline (asymptomatic at birth) UTA, including: mild pyelectasis (MP), unilateral renal agenesis (URA), unilateral multicystic kidney (UMK) and ectopic kidney (EK). Method We determined the outcome of pregnancies and long-term renal function in 120 cases of prenatally detected borderline UTA. A prospective protocol was proposed to the parents which comprised ultrasound evaluation every 3?months until the age of 24?months, and renal function assessment in case of suspected worsening of prenatal findings. Results A total of 120 fetuses had a borderline UTA (MP n?=?58, URA n?=?14, UMK n?=?32, EK n?=?16). Eighteen of them showed some postnatal complication including: associated anomalies (3 cases), need for surgical intervention (6 cases), vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR, 5 cases) and repeated infection (4 cases). Conclusions Fetal pyelectasis, rarely requires neonatal intervention if the diameter of pelvis is included between 5 and 10?mm in the second trimester. Nevertheless, the risk of associated chromosome abnormalities should be ruled out if other risk factors are present. Unilateral multicystic kidney carries a high risk of nephrectomy and contralateral VUR, whereas unilateral agenesis or ectopic kidneys seem to carry limited, if any, negative implications, with the exception of possible undetected, associated anomalies.

AB  - The acronym ared indicates two characteristic patterns of the Doppler Velocity Waveform (DVWF) namely the observation of absence (EDFA) or reverse (RF) blood flow in diastole. ARED flow are usually observed in fetuses presenting severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or sometime are concomitant to fetal abnormalities like hydrops. The fetal condition is always severely affected mainly by hypoxaemia and/or acidaemia but at different levels according to the two patterns that are observed. Usually in the literature ared cases are presented and discussed without making difference between the two possible conditions. This approach cannot be considered correct because large differences in many clinical aspects are evident when evaluating separately EDFA or RF in 94 cases observed in our Institute. Gestational age, mean birth weight are significantly lower while perinatal mortality rate and prevalence of handicaps among survivors are significantly higher in the group presenting RF as compared to EDFA cases. As a consequence the clinical management is also different. In case of EDFA the timing of the delivery should be taken into consideration but it is not always urgent. On the contrary when RF is observed intrauterine death has to be expected within few days. Therefore the delivery should be immediate at the first observation of RF. The critical point is that also applying this policy the prevalence of handicaps among survivors is very high (35%). As a consequence when facing those clinical condition a careful and complete information must be offered to the family before choosing, if no maternal indications are present, an aggressive management.

AB  - Purpose No randomized controlled trials of treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) exist. Since severely preterm neonatal survival has increased over time, survival as an outcome measure is confounded by calendar time. The diagnosis-to-delivery interval is a calendar year independent measure of success of treatment. We wished to evaluate whether treatment of TTTS is associated with a lengthening of the diagnosis-to-delivery interval. Methods MEDLINE search supplemented by careful reference review. All TTTS series were included where the following information on each patient was available: survival, fetal demise, gestational age (GA) at diagnosis and diagnosis to delivery interval in days. Inclusion criteria GA?≤?29?weeks and diagnosis by ultrasound in the absence of maternal symptoms. Cases undergoing multiple types of treatment were excluded. Data were evaluated by Kruskal?Wallis anova, logistic regression & Wilcoxon rank sum testing. Results The 8 publications used included the following cases: controls (n?=?16), amnioreduction (n?=?61), septostomy (n?=?12), and fetoscopic laser occlusion of chorioangiopagus vessels (FLOC) (n?=?51). FLOC therapy showed a significantly longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction (median 75 vs. 56?days) (p?=?0.01). There was no difference in overall survival, at least one survivor, or number of fetal deaths between the 4 groups. Logistic regression using at least one survivor as the dependent variable revealed a positive association with GA at diagnosis and with diagnosis to delivery interval, a negative correlation with fetal death, and no correlation with treatment group. Conclusions FLOC therapy for TTTS is associated with a longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction without a significant increase in survival. The lack of increase in survival appears to be due to a small sample size.

AB  - Background To decrease perinatal mortality and morbidity rate in case of multifetal pregnancy fetal reduction (MFPR) in the first trimester was introduced. Methods Combine ultrasound and Doppler evaluation of fetal chromosomal abnormality markers, fetal structure and biometry, chorionicity and amnionicity, arterial and venous circulation in fetal-placental-maternal functional system were introduced as an algorithm before MFPR. Results 355 fetuses in 112 women were examined before 141 MFPR. NT thickness was above 2.5?mm in 1,7% of fetuses and one fetus had reverse DV flow. But no fetal chromosomal defects were detected after CVS. No specific severe complications for multifetal pregnancy were registered in completed pregnancies. Average gestational age at birth was 35,5 w that was less then in essential twins but perinatal mortality rate was 5.8? and 12.8? correspondingly. Conclusion MFPR with combine fetal examination seems to be the way to improve multifetal pregnancy outcome.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to identify sources and clinical significance of 3DUS artifacts on patient diagnosis and to increase clinician and sonographer awareness to reduce misdiagnosis in 3DUS studies. To accomplish this 3DUS data were acquired and reviewed interactively. Artifacts were cataloged according to origin: B-mode, color/power Doppler or unique to 3DUS (acquisition, rendering or volume editing). Original scan planes, re-sliced planes and rendered images were evaluated. Overall our results showed a variety of artifacts. B-mode artifacts included drop-out, shadowing, etc. and depending on relationships between slice and imaging plane orientation. Color/power Doppler artifacts were related to gain, aliasing, and flash and could add apparent structure or confusion to the volume images. Rendering artifacts were due to parameter adjustment, shadowing and motion. Important structures could be removed by improper editing. In conclusion 3DUS and 2DUS are prone to similar artifacts plus others unique to 3DUS. Diagnostically significant artifacts can mimick abnormal development, masses, or missing structures thus requiring careful study before reaching a diagnosis.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to compare the application of 2D neurosonography (USG) and 3D USG in newborns with respect to the time required to obtain the data for analysis. Method All newborns in whom neurosonography was indicated underwent 2D USG and 3D USG by the same investigator. The Voluson 530 D Color System was used with vaginal 5?8?MHz 3D probe for 3D imaging. 2D real-time imaging was performed with Aloka SSD 121 device using 5?MHz sector probe. The time needed to perform the examination was determined. Non-parametric Kruskal?Wallis rank sum test was used in statistical analysis. Results A total of 30 newborn infants of different gestational ages (ranging from 25 to 40?weeks) underwent USG after delivery at different postnatal ages (ranging from 2 to 60?days). The median time required to perform the 2D USG was 14?min (10?21). The median time required to perform the investigation by 3D USG was 5?min (ranging from 3 to 10). The difference was statistically significant (H?=?24.88; P?=?0.0031). The median time of data interpretation for 2D USG was 25?min (15?35), and for 3D USG it was 45?min (30?63). The difference was not statistically significant (H?=?13.22; P?=?0.1531). Conclusion The time necessary to obtain 3D USG compared to 2D USG images was shorter, which made it less stressful for the newborns. 3D USG provides more reliable information than 2D USG performed in the same patient at the same age. The time needed to interpret the data is longer for 3D USG but it can be performed after the imaging was terminated.

AB  - From animal studies it is known that fetus during hypoxia redistributes it's blood flow preferentially to the brain, heart and adrenal glands. In animal studies, a three-fold increase in adrenal blood flow has been demonstrated during hypoxia. The adrenals are relatively large organs in the fetus. Compared to fetal body weight, they are 20 times bigger than in the adult. The fetal adrenals respond to stress, such as hypoxemia by increased production of dihydroandrostendion (DHA), DHA sulfate and their metabolites. The adrenal gland is supplied by three arteries: the superior, coming from the inferior phrenic artery; the middle, from the abdominal aorta and inferior, arising from the renal artery. In the recent studies the Doppler signals were obtained from fetal middle adrenal artery. The normal adrenal PI shows decreasing values with the gestational age, which might suggest lower vascular resistance and high blood flow to the adrenals. From our observations the adrenal Doppler velocimetry is easier to record in fetuses from high-risk pregnancies than in normals, probably due to the adrenal sparing effect. Recent results suggest that the adrenal artery velocimetry might be useful in fetal assessment and predicting outcome. The ?adrenal-sparing? effect might be maintained at the same time the brain-sparing signs disappear.
