AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - Objective: To establish normal parameters of thromboelastography (TEG) in healthy adult cats. Background: Thromboelastography (TEG) is an in vitro test of coagulation that has been shown to be useful in humans, dogs and select species to identify and quantify alterations of hemostasis (e.g., hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states). It has also been demonstrated to be useful in monitoring effects of anticoagulant therapies. This test has not been evaluated in cats. Methods: Blood was collected from 25 clinically normal cats by venipuncture using a 21 gauge?3 1/2 inch butterfly catheter and syringe for medial saphenous or jugular venipuncture. A single 1.8?mL sample in 3.8% Sodium Citrate (9:1) was collected from each cat. Recalcified whole blood was analyzed 30?minutes following collection with the TEG? 5000 analyzer (Haemoscope, Niles, IL). Analysis temperature was 37.6°C. TEG parameters recorded included: R-value (represents initial fibrin formation), K (time from R to standard fixed measure of clot firmness which represents contributions of platelets and fibrinogen), maximum amplitude (MA; represents absolute clot strength), and alpha angle (α; the slope of TEG tracing which represents rate of clot formation). The coagulation index (CI) was derived from the formula generated for humans to provide an overall assessment of whether the sample was hyper- or hypocoagulable. Results: Values for the 25 normal cat samples are reported as mean ±2 standard deviations. R=2.97; 1.23?4.72; K=1.54, 0.38?2.71; α=70.70, 57.76?83.65; MA=58.50, 45.26?71.74 and CI=2.27, 0.07?4.46. Compared to historical information obtained on normal dogs, cats have significantly shorter R and K and larger α, MA and CI. Conclusions: TEG does have reproducible performance when used to evaluate coagulation status in normal cats. Compared to dogs, normal cats favor a hypercoagulable state. Species-specific normal values are necessary for interpretation of TEG results. This test bears potential value for use in future experimental and clinical work to investigate hemostasis in cats receiving anticoagulant therapies or in cats suffering from diseases such as cardiomyopathy which are thought to be associated with altered coagulation status.

AB  - Pulse contour analysis is a relatively new method of continuously monitoring cardiac output. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the human algorithm for calculation of continuous cardiac output from the pulse waveform, for use in anaesthetised horses. Cardiac output was measured in 27 anaesthetised clinical cases comparing lithium dilution (LiDCO) with a preceding, calibrated cardiac output measured from the pulse waveform (PulseCO) using a commercial system (LiDCOplus, LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge, UK). These comparisons were repeated every 20?30?min. Positive inotropes or vasopressors were administered when clinically indicated. Cardiac output values obtained ranged from 15.2?52.2?L/min, with cardiac indices from 30.7?114.9?ml/kg/min. Eighty-nine comparisons were obtained. The mean bias was 0.24?ml/kg/min +/?6.48?ml/kg/min. The limits of agreement were ?12.72?13.2?ml/kg/min. The 95% confidence interval for the upper limit of agreement was 12.07?14.33?ml/kg/min and for the lower limit of agreement was ?11.59?13.85?ml/kg/min. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.89 and produced an equation of PulseCO (mls kg?1 minute?1)=0.9226LiDCO (mls kg?1minute?1) +5.354. This method of pulse contour analysis is a relatively non-invasive and reliable way of monitoring continuous cardiac output in the horse under anaesthesia. The ability to easily continuously monitor cardiac output may improve morbidity and mortality in the anaesthetised horse.

AB  - A 15-point neurological score for foals was developed, and tested on foals (<8 days old) presenting to the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center (n=75) and the Royal Veterinary College (n=11). The score consists of 2 scales, which are added together to provide the total score. The points and descriptors for the first scale are as follows: Bright, alert, nursing, follows mare (0); Depressed, nursing, follows mare (1); Depressed, nursing, wanders away from mare (2); Depressed, standing, not nursing, will not follow mare (3); Recumbent, able to maintain sternal recumbency part of the time, strong suckle reflex (4); Recumbent, unable to maintain sternal recumbency, suckle reflex (5); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, responds to finger in ear (6); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, legs extended most of the time and muscles tense (7); Comatose, muscles relaxed, no response to finger in ear (8). Foals with a physical cause of recumbency (e.g., flexural deformity) are scored on this scale as if they were standing. The second scale is as follows: No seizure activity (0); Single seizure of less than 10 seconds (3); Single seizure of more than 10 seconds or two seizures of less then 10 seconds (4); Multiple seizures (5); Status epilepticus (7). All scores were assigned at admission by a single investigator. The median admission neurological scores for hospital survivors and non-survivors, and for blood culture positive and negative foals were compared with the Mann Whitney U-test. The correlation of admission neurological scores and arterial lactate concentrations (measured on a NOVA Stat profile M or CCX analyzer) and mean arterial pressure (measured indirectly with a tail cuff) was tested with Spearman's rho coefficient. Analysis of these data was performed using SPSS version 12. Results for all tests were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. The median neurological score on admission of all 86 foals was 4, and the range was from 0 to 12. The median score of survivors (2) was less than that of non-survivors (5) (p<0.001; n=86). There was no significant difference in median score between blood culture positive (4) and negative (3) foals (p=0.109; n=84). The neurological score was moderately correlated with admission lactate concentration (correlation coefficient 0.528, p<0.001, n=68), but only weakly correlated with mean arterial pressure (correlation coefficient ?0.285, p=0.011, n=78). This neurological score is statistically associated with clinically important parameters (hospital survival, blood lactate concentration), and warrants further study, including investigation of inter-observer variation in scoring.

AB  - A new closure technique developed for lateral thoracotomy approaches in emergency surgeries was used to close 20 thoracotomies in 5 cats and 15 dogs, and the results were compared retrospectively to a previously recommended and published technique. The continuous shoe-lace technique involved the use of monofilament 2?0 (cats) to 2 sized (large dogs) polypropylene on a swaged on taper needle. The closure pattern began at the dorsal aspect of the intercostal opening just caudal to the caudal rib and then moved to just cranial to the cranial rib. The pattern continued in a continuous fashion, placing a suture bite every 1?2?cm (cats) to every 3?4?cm (large dogs). At the ventral aspect of the incision, the closure continued back dorsally with a continuous lacing-like pattern. At the conclusion of the pattern dorsally the sutures on each side of the incision were pulled tight. The opening between the ribs was brought together with this tightening. The single knot was then tied. Results revealed a more rapid closure than the conventional closure (averaging 10?minutes versus 20?minutes, respectively). No dehiscence was observed with either technique. The single knot was able to be tied without any difficulty. No other complications were observed. This study proved that the new closure technique was very effective. It is recommended over the routine previously accepted and published method because of increased speed and less suture material buried. This is especially helpful in emergency surgery where surgery time needs to be as short as possible.

AB  - Because of the cost and complexity of treating immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) cases, it is important to find accurate prognostic factors. Most information to date has come from retrospective university studies with varying treatment protocols. To better identify prognostic indicators in cases diagnosed with IMHA, a prospective study with a standardized treatment protocol was undertaken. Diagnosis of IMHA was based on standard published criteria and effective rule out of other diseases. For each IMHA case admitted, historical, treatment and clinical data were documented during hospitalization. All discharged cases were followed for at least 3 months. Of 31 cases originally enrolled in the study, 26 cases were available for analysis in determining chance for discharge and 21 cases were available in determining longer term prognosis. All cases were autoagglutinating. Eighteen cases were discharged (69%), 1 case died, and 7 cases were euthanized in the hospital due to a grave prognosis. Cases that died or were euthanized in the hospital had a significantly higher maximum total bilirubin (Tbili) level than those that were discharged (33.5 versus 4.8, p=0.0004). Between cases that were discharged and those that died or were euthanized, there was no difference in age, packed cell volume, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count or Tbili on admission, or the presence of hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia. The number of transfusions received and hospitalization time were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Only 3 animals had been vaccinated within 2 months; of those, 1 was euthanized and 2 were discharged. Three-month follow-up information was available for 13 of the 18 cases discharged. Of the 13, 7 cases were still alive at 3 months (7/21, 33%). There was no difference in age, PCV, WBC, platelet count, total bilirubin at admission, number of transfusions received, or hospitalization time between survivors and non-survivors. None of the animals that lived over 3 months had hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria during their hospitalization. Maximum Tbili was significantly higher in non-survivors versus survivors (23.7 versus 1.9, p=0.0005). A total bilirubin of greater than 5.16 during hospitalization was associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

AB  - Acepromazine (ACE) is a phenothiazine derivative used for its sedative properties. The primary mechanism of action of ACE is through inhibition of dopaminergic-2 receptors in the brain. It is a common belief that ACE lowers the seizure threshold. The purpose of this clinical study is to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of seizures in dogs presenting with a history of seizures that were treated with ACE during hospitalization. A retrospective review of records from dogs that had a chronic or acute seizure history and received ACE was done. Factors evaluated included the presenting complaint, historical seizure information, ACE dosage and route of administration, reason for giving and length of hospitalization following ACE, occurrence of seizure activity post-ACE administration, time interval between ACE and seizure activity, and use of other medications. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study, 20 males and 11 females. Age range was 3 months - 14.9 years. Presenting complaint was seizure in 28 patients, bite wound in 1 patient, ruptured cranial cruciate ligament in 1 patient, and hind limb paresis in 1 patient. Twenty-seven dogs did not seize after ACE administration within an average of 16.4 hours of observation (range: 0.25?66 hours). There was a known history of seizures in 22/31 prior to the day of presentation, and 15/22 were currently on maintenance anti-epileptic medication. Of the 16 not on anti-seizure medication at the time of presentation, 13 were started on phenobarbital. One was also started on potassium bromide, and 3 received no anti-seizure medication during hospitalization. All received at least one dose of ACE while in the hospital (range 1?5). Mean ACE dose was 0.029?mg/kg IV (range: 0.008?0.057?mg/kg; n=46), 0.036?mg/kg IM (range: 0.017?0.059?mg/kg; n=14), 0.53?mg/kg PO (n=2). Twenty-three received some form of anti-seizure medication in the hospital prior to being given ACE. Eight seizure episodes occurred 0.3?10 hours after ACE administration in 4. All 4 presented for seizures. The time interval between ACE administration and seizure activity was greater than that expected for measurable effects to be seen in one dog (10 hours). In conclusion, there is no clinical evidence that ACE administration at the listed dosages is associated with increased seizure activity in dogs with seizure disorders. A larger study group is needed to more thoroughly evaluate the safety of short-term ACE use in dogs with a seizure history.

AB  - Introduction: Gastric acid suppression is a recommended therapy for gastric ulceration. Human studies suggest that optimal healing of duodenal ulcers occurs at gastric pH >3 for 75% of the day. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4 gastric acid suppressants at recommended veterinary doses. Drug effect was based on the 24-hour median pH and the percentage of time that the intragastric pH ≥3 in a 24 hour period. Methods: The study was conducted in 12 healthy Beagle dogs and was a double-blind, randomized, multiple cross-over comparison of a placebo (saline IV q12?h), ranitidine 2?mg/kg IV q12?h, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q12?h, pantoprazole 1?mg/kg IV q24?h, and omeprazole (unblinded) ?1?mg/kg PO q24?h. Continuous 24-hour intragastric pH measurements were obtained via PEG tube. Prior to drug testing, 24-hour pH measurements were recorded in fasted and fed dogs. Thereafter, dogs were fed standardized meals throughout the remainder of the study period. Drugs were administered for 1 week with a one-week washout period between tests. Data were obtained on Day 0 (baseline), Day 2 and Day 6 of treatment. Following the randomized study, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q8?h and omeprazole ?1?mg/kg + bicarbonate q12?h via PEG tube were evaluated in 6 dogs, respectively. Appropriate statistical analyses were applied to calculate the 24-hour median pH and percentage of time that the test drug maintained intragastric pH≥3 over 24 hours. Results: The 24-hour median pH of fasted dogs was 4.44 vs. fed dogs 1.30 (p<0.0001). The % time pH≥3: fasted dogs 66.0% vs. fed dogs 13.3% (p<0.0001). The 24-hour median pH was (bold denotes significance when compared to saline) - saline pH 1.81, ranitidine Day 2?pH 2.53, Day 6?pH 2.05, famotidine Day 2?pH 2.83, Day 6?pH 3.68, pantoprazole Day 2?pH 3.11, Day 6?pH 3.49, omeprazole Day 2?pH 3.86, Day 6?pH 4.09. The % time pH≥3: saline 32.9%; ranitidine day 2 ? 44.6%, Day 6 ? 37.2%; famotidine: Day 2 ? 48.9%, Day 6 ? 60.1%; pantoprazole: Day 2 ? 54.2%, Day 6 ? 59.1%; omeprazole: Day 2 ? 66.9%, Day 6 ? 70.2%. The 24-hour median pH of omeprazole + bicarbonate q12?h was 4.7 on Day 2 and 4.9 on Day 6; the % time pH ≥3 was 90.9% on Day 2 and 78.4% on Day 6, respectively. No significant difference was noted in any parameter comparing famotidine q8?h and q12?h. Conclusions: Fasted dogs had a significantly higher pH than fed dogs. Omeprazole was the only drug tested that approached the potential therapeutic efficacy for healing of duodenal ulcers when assessed by criteria for human patients. Variation existed amongst dogs in all drugs tested.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Clostridium tetani infection is uncommon in dogs and cats. Up to this point in time just single case reports have been published in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of 13 dogs and one cat affected with Clostridium tetani. The medical records of the last ten year were reviewed. Dogs and cats that were identified as being infected with Clostridium tetani on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and/or bacterial culture from infected wounds were eligible for study inclusion. Thirteen dogs and one cat met the criteria for study inclusion. Six different breeds and mix-breed dogs were affected, German Shepherd dogs (n=4, 29%) and Labrador retriever (n=3, 21%) were the most frequently affected breeds. Observed clinical complications were ventricular aspiration pneumonia (n=7), laryngeal spasm (n=6), hypersalivation (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=3), and third degree AV block (n=1). Median days from onset of clinical signs until first signs of improvement were 10 days (range: 9?12 days). Median hospitalisation time was 18 days (range: 14?22 days). Six animals showed full recovery and 8 animals died or were euthanized. Death was associated with acute onset of ventricular tachycardia in 2 dogs, 1 dog died with non-responsive third degree AV-block, 3 dogs died after developing aspiration pneumonia, and 1 dog died of unknown causes.

AB  - The Rescue Glide Sked provides a practical means of moving a recumbent, non-ambulatory or injured horse from the site of an accident. Horses with serious injuries, displaying severe malnutrition or neurological symptoms, can be easily moved out of a stall or even down a trail to a horse ambulance for transport to a veterinary facility. It is a specialty cut piece of 8?? 4? recycled polypropylene with tie-down straps and steel attachment points for winch loading into an equine ambulance. A horse must be fully sedated during transport on the rescue glide to prevent further injury to itself or rescuers. Moving a recumbent horse is very difficult due to the weight of the animal, often causing damage to the head and eyes, and with many safety concerns for the rescuers (struggling, kicking). It may take 8 to 10 people to move a horse just a few feet, especially uphill or on high friction surfaces. Benefits of the Rescue Glide include that the plastic reduces the friction of the weight of the animal on the ground surface, so fewer people are needed to move the animal. The tough resilient plastic is flexible so it goes easily over obstacles such as logs, roots, or through ditches. It folds up around the animal's body to get through a standard stall door or tight spaces as might be encountered on a trail. The Glide may be attached to a winch, ropes pulled by human rescuers, or even vehicle (ATV, car, etc.) The practical use of the Rescue Glide has been demonstrated in numerous situations including severe limb injuries, neurological compromise, geriatric, recumbent/unable to rise, severe neglect/malnutrition, and recovery/removal of dead large animals. The equipment has been used at race tracks and riding competition events for transport of animals into ambulances, as well as by veterinary rescue response teams in trail riding accidents, pasture accidents, and severe trailer injuries. The Rescue Glide, in conjunction with an equine ambulance trailer, provides a safe and suitable means of transport of large animals to veterinary facilities and should be a part of the equine practitioner's emergency equipment.

AB  - The primary classes of drugs used for pain control in horses include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), the alpha-2 agonists, and the opiates, but each of these drug classes has significant adverse effects. Ketamine hydrochloride is a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the spinal cord and has been used in both dogs and humans to provide analgesia. The purpose of this study was to identify a safe administration rate for a continuous infusion of ketamine to awake horses and describe the clinical effects of this infusion. Six horses were administered a continuous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a low dose (0.4?mg/kg/hr) and high dose (0.8?mg/kg/hr). Each infusion took place over 6 hours and the horses were monitored during infusion as well as for the 6 hours post-infusion. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, activity level, and analgesic thresholds. Both the low dose and high dose rates were tolerated well by all horses with no signs of excitation or discomfort. Post-infusion heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased as compared to pre-infusion values (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) A significant increase in analgesic threshold was not identified. Subanesthetic infusions of ketamine to awake horses appear to be well tolerated and cause only mild changes in clinical parameters. Further research is needed to evaluate the analgesic potential of these infusions.

AB  - The ischemia-reperfusion seen in dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) could cause oxidative stress, decrease antioxidant capacity, and predispose patients to higher morbidity and mortality. Elevated lactate levels in dogs with GDV have been previously found to be a negative prognostic indicator. The purpose of this study was to serially evaluate oxidant and antioxidant concentrations in dogs with GDV and to determine if there is a correlation between the degree of antioxidant depletion and lactate levels. Dogs presenting to the Tufts Emergency Service that had not been treated with corticosteroids or fluids prior to admission and were not receiving antioxidant supplementation were eligible for the study. Blood samples were collected at the time of initial catheter placement pre-operatively (Time 0), and then 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The samples were analyzed for concentrations of oxidants [malondialdehyde (MDA), oxygen radical trapping capacity (ORAC) and F2 isoprostanes] and antioxidants (α-tocopherol, ? -tocopherol, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase). ANOVA with repeated measures was used to evaluate differences in the variables over the 48-hour period and Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between 2 continuous variables. To date, 8 dogs have been enrolled in the study (1 female and 7 males, with a mean age of 8.0±2.2 years). All dogs have survived to discharge. The chart below indicates differences in parameters measured during hospitalization. Variable Time 0?median (range) 24 hours?median (range) 48 hours?median (range) P?Value MDA (nmol/L) 0.725 (0.532?1.250) 0.500 (0.423?0.870) 0.512 (0.388?0.890) 0.008 α-tocopherol (ug/ml) 16.350 (3.800?29.400) 11.300 (6.760?30.800) 12.950 (7.850?40.400) 0.000 ?-tocopherol (ug/ml) 0.402 (0.138?0.776) 0.293 (0.000?0.500) 0.300 (0.000?0.503) 0.501 Mean plasma lactate upon admission was 4.3?mmol/L (range 2.1?7.2?mmol/L). There was a positive correlation between ?-tocopherol and lactate (r=0.784, P=0.012) but there were no correlations between lactate and MDA or α-tocopherol. Additional dogs are currently being enrolled in the study and analyses of the other variables (ORAC, F2 isoprostanes, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase) are pending. These preliminary results support the hypothesis of alterations in oxidant and antioxidant parameters in dogs with GDV.

AB  - Objective: To determine if 1) administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) would result in alteration of heart rate and fractional shortening parameters and 2) if administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) prior to administration of a dissociative sedative combination (ketamine-diazepam) would blunt increases in heart rate and fractional shortening parameters previously reported with the use of dissociative-based sedation. Design: Single blinded, randomized, crossover design. Animals: Eleven privately owned healthy cats with normal echocardiograms. Procedure: All cats received each of the following injections with at least one week separating each treatment: Treatment A (TA) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) and hydromorphone (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment B (TB) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by ketamine (6?mg/kg IM) and diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment C (TC) ? diazepam and hydromorphone combined in the same syringe followed in 15?minutes by ketamine and diazepam combined in the same syringe. Echocardiograms were performed using the right parasternal position 15?minutes after the second injection. Heart rate (HR) and parameters to determine fractional shortening (FS) in the short axis view were recorded in triplicate for each treatment group. An analysis of variance for repeated measures with a Fisher's LSD protected t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Fractional shortening was significantly increased in each treatment group compared to baseline (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in FS between TA and TB (p<0.05), TA and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p=0.9). Heart rate was not significantly increased between baseline and TA. There was a significant increase in HR between baseline and both TB and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p<0.05) Conclusion: The increase in fractional shortening induced by dissociative-based chemical restraint in normal cats is not blunted by the prior administration of a neuroleptanalgesia combination. The increase in fractional shortening following administration of the neuroleptanalgesia combination may have been due to an indirect increase in sympathetic tone (stress response).

AB  - Improved options for the successful transport of horses trapped in inaccessible areas (floodwater, steep ravines, etc.) during a disaster or emergency are available to practitioners using helicopter assets and the Anderson Sling?. Horses present a particularly difficult problem to remove from the rescue environment of a wide flooded area, or difficult steep terrain far from access by vehicles or heavy equipment. Due to their fractious and fearful nature, they may fight any effort to walk, climb or swim them to safety, and those attempts are inherently very dangerous for the rescuer(s). Unfortunately, many disaster or emergency scenarios may occur in areas not conducive to the use of other options (barge, rescue glide, simple vertical lift sling). Veterinary practitioners on scene should have familiarity with helicopter sling-load operations. The use of cargo nets, inappropriate home-made slings, and inadequate equipment has contributed to disastrous efforts by well-intentioned rescuers. There have even been desperate attempts at sling loading of cattle by roping the horns or one leg and transporting them into a waiting truck for removal from public lands. The Anderson Sling? has been successfully used for helicopter operations in multiple emergencies and training demonstration flights, and is the only Equine Sling recommended for this purpose. Although it was originally intended for clinical use in long-term recovery cases, it has become the industry standard for helicopter operations with equines because of its demonstrated safety margin, design and strength. In clinical use, leg straps further distribute the animal's weight to the legs, but are not necessary in rescue lifts. In some states, there are Large Animal Rescue Teams associated with the Veterinary School, the State Emergency Management Association, or local private Equine Ambulance Services that may have equipment and personnel trained in helicopter sling-loading. This is a specialty interest that requires prior coordination, significant planning, and training of all personnel involved.

AB  - An 8-year-old Pêga breed donkey that presented with a history of persistent enlargement of the right leg was diagnosed with a rhabdomyosarcoma by surgical exploration and biopsy. The tumoral mass involved the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh. At presentation, the donkey was extremely painful and reluctant to walk. Initial physical examination showed a heart rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and a rectal temperature of 100.2°F. Venous blood was collected for a CBC and biochemistry. Postoperative care included antibiotic (potassium penicillin and gentamicin) and anti-inflammatory (phenylbutazone and dexamethasone). The donkey was very painful in the immediate postoperative period and developed dehiscence of the incision. It was unable to bear weight on the affected limb, very reluctant to walk, and lying down in sternal recumbency most of the time. Heart and respiratory rates ranged from 60 to 90 and 20 to 32, respectively. Because of the poor prognosis, euthanasia was indicated but the owner decided to keep the donkey alive to try semen collection. In order to improve life quality and making the semen collection possible, the anti-inflammatory therapy was stopped and an analgesic therapy with epidural opioids was selected. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was inserted in the first intercoccygeal space through an epidural Huber point needle. With the purpose of reaching the lumbosacral area, 20?cm of the catheter was advanced cranially from the needle tip. During 3 days, a combination of morphine (0.1?mg/kg) and tramadol (0.5?mg/kg) was administered daily with a total volume of 20?ml. During the first 24 hours after the first administration, heart rate ranged from 62 to 64 and respiratory rate from 20 to 24. It was not observed to have any adverse effect. The donkey improved during treatment standing most of the time and eating better. It was easier to hand walk, although it was not completely able to bear weight in the affected limb. Even during treatment, the donkey reacted intensely when the surgical area in the caudal aspect of the thigh was manipulated. On the forth day, it tried to copulate and semen was successfully collected by manipulation of the penis. As the semen was not classified as good enough to be frozen, the donkey was euthanatized. On post-mortem examination, the position of the catheter in the epidural canal was observed and 20?ml of methylene blue solution injected through the catheter before euthanasia. It was enough to totally stain the segment of epidural canal from the first intercoccygeal space to the lumbosacral joint. The opioid epidural analgesic therapy reported here was considered to be efficient to treat the painful condition of the donkey, but it was not able to completely abolish the pain.

AB  - Objectives Two large multicenter randomised trials were performed in France to assess whether systematic screening with an artery uteroplacental Doppler (AUD) in low-risk pregnant women followed by the prescription of low-dose aspirin in cases with abnormal results reduced the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and of preeclampsia. Study design and population The first trial ?Seine Saint-Denis? (SSD) trial included 3317 low-risk pregnant women (multi and primigravidae) in 17 French maternity Hospitals and the second ?Erasme? trial included 1869 primigravidae in 12 centres. In the Doppler group, the AUD was performed between 20 and 24?weeks, and women with abnormal results received 100?mg of aspirin daily until the 35th week. Results In the Doppler group, 232 patients (15.7%) had an abnormal result in the SSD trial and 20% in the ERASME trial. The predictive value of the AUD was comparable to that reported in the studies of low-risk populations, but with a low sensitivity. Finally, IUGR, whether defined by the third or tenth percentile, and preeclampsia did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in both trials. Conclusions There is no proof justifying the recommendation of a systematic AUD in a low-risk population, even if abnormal results are followed by aspirin treatment and increase in prenatal surveillance. Future studies must assess predictive tests that can be performed early in pregnancy and can identify populations at very high risk of preeclampsia and IUGR. Only when all of these conditions are fulfilled can aspirin prove its efficacy.

AB  - The Ehlers?Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Over the past two decades, the Villefranche Nosology, which delineated six subtypes, has been widely used as the standard for clinical diagnosis of EDS. For most of these subtypes, mutations had been identified in collagen-encoding genes, or in genes encoding collagen-modifying enzymes. Since its publication in 1998, a whole spectrum of novel EDS subtypes has been described, and mutations have been identified in an array of novel genes. The International EDS Consortium proposes a revised EDS classification, which recognizes 13 subtypes. For each of the subtypes, we propose a set of clinical criteria that are suggestive for the diagnosis. However, in view of the vast genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability of the EDS subtypes, and the clinical overlap between EDS subtypes, but also with other HCTDs, the definite diagnosis of all EDS subtypes, except for the hypermobile type, relies on molecular confirmation with identification of (a) causative genetic variant(s). We also revised the clinical criteria for hypermobile EDS in order to allow for a better distinction from other joint hypermobility disorders. To satisfy research needs, we also propose a pathogenetic scheme, that regroups EDS subtypes for which the causative proteins function within the same pathway. We hope that the revised International EDS Classification will serve as a new standard for the diagnosis of EDS and will provide a framework for future research purposes. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
