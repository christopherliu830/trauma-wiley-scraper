AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the nutrition support in critically ill patients. The negative acute phase proteins are albumin and transferrin. Their serum concentrations fall immediately after the injury, in proportion to its severity. They are used to monitor the nutritional status of acutely ill patients. Areas of intense clinical investigation in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may eventually be shown to be of great value are cancer patients in general, sepsis and trauma, and general perioperative support to prevent or correct malnutrition. Although protein restriction was historically used to reduce risk from hepatic encephalopathy, such a strategy may worsen nutrition status, decrease lean muscle mass, and ironically lead to less ammonia removal. Many interacting biologic and clinical factors are responsible for the development of malnutrition in critically ill and injured hospitalized patients and also the hypercatabolic states associated with trauma, sepsis, cancer, and surgical interventions.

AB  - Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) represent a widely used cell source with multi-lineage differentiation capacity in approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Despite the multitude of literature on their differentiation capacity, little is reported about the physiological properties contributing to and controlling the process of lineage differentiation. Direct intercellular communication between adjacent cells via gap junctions has been shown to modulate differentiation processes in other cell types, with connexin 43 (Cx43) being the most abundant isoform of the gap junction-forming connexins. Thus, in the present study we focused on the expression of Cx43 and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in human ASCs, and its significance for adipogenic differentiation of these cells. Cx43 expression in ASCs was demonstrated histologically and on the gene and protein expression level, and was shown to be greatly positively influenced by cell seeding density. Functionality of gap junctions was proven by dye transfer analysis in growth medium. Adipogenic differentiation of ASCs was shown to be also distinctly elevated at higher cell seeding densities. Inhibition of GJIC by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA) significantly compromised adipogenic differentiation, as demonstrated by histology, triglyceride quantification, and adipogenic marker gene expression. Flow cytometry analysis showed a lower proportion of cells undergoing adipogenesis when GJIC was inhibited, further indicating the importance of GJIC in the differentiation process. Altogether, this study demonstrates the impact of direct cell?cell communication via gap junctions on the adipogenic differentiation process of ASCs, and may contribute to further integrate direct intercellular crosstalk in rationales for tissue engineering approaches.

AB  - Summary Intranasal meningoencephaloceles are characterised by protrusion of brain and meninges through a skull-base defect. Nasal intubation or instrumentation may lead to complications such as meningoencephalitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea or fistula formation. A 62 year old lady developed rhinorrhea following failed videolaryngoscopic and nasal fibreoptic intubation, which ultimately necessitated emergency surgical tracheostomy for a ?can't intubation can't ventilate? scenario. This case highlights the diagnosis and management of an unusual complication resulting from difficult airway management.

AB  - Objective To investigate possible pathophysiological mechanisms (reduced plasma calcitriol concentrations and/or presence of concurrent or masked chronic kidney disease) for hypocalcaemiain hyperthyroid cats. Methods Prospective cohort study. Routine plasma biochemical parameters, plasma parathyroid hormone and calcitriol concentrations, ionized calcium concentrations, and venous pH, were measured at diagnosis and following treatment of hyperthyroidism. Linear regression analysis was used to determine predictors of ionized calcium concentration. Results Hyperthyroid cats (n=45) had lower ionized calcium concentrations than healthy geriatric cats (n=52), however, ionized calcium concentrations were higher in hyperthyroid cats with concurrent or masked chronic kidney disease than non-azotaemic hyperthyroid cats. Plasma calcitriol concentrations were higher in hyperthyroid cats than control cats. Plasma total thyroxine concentration and venous pH were independent predictors of ionized calcium concentration. Plasma total thyroxine concentration was also a predictor of ionized calcium concentration after adjustment for plasma parathyroid hormone and calcitriol concentrations. Clinical Significance Hypocalcaemia in hyperthyroid cats is not associated with the presence of concurrent or masked chronic kidney disease or reduced plasma calcitriol concentrations. Increased thyroid hormone concentrations might influence ionized calcium concentrations through a mechanism, yet to be determined, that is independent of control by parathyroid hormone and calcitriol.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report an interim clinical evaluation of combined external beam irradiation (EBRT) and interstitial or regional hyperthermia in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 1997 to 2001, 26 patients with T3-4/NX/0M0 prostate carcinoma were treated with a combination of conformal EBRT and hyperthermia. Fourteen patients received five weekly regional hyperthermia treatments within an optimization (phase II) study, using the coaxial transverse electrical magnetic system. Twelve patients received one interstitial hyperthermia treatment within a feasibility study (phase I), using the multi-electrode current source system. Irradiation was delivered using a conformal three-field technique, administering 70?Gy in 2-Gy fractions in 7?weeks. RESULTS The mean initial prostate-specific antigen level was 26?ng/mL. Three patients had a T4 and 23 a T3 tumour; the tumours were classified as well (four), moderately (16) and poorly (six) differentiated. The mean follow-up was 36?months. In the combined treatments there was no toxicity of more than grade 2. In regional hyperthermia the mean index temperature (T90 and T50, i.e. exceeded by 90% and 50% of the measurements) was 40.2?°C and 40.8?°C, and for interstitial hyperthermia 39.4?°C and 41.8?°C, respectively. All patients survived; seven patients had a biochemical relapse (27%), three in the regional and four in the interstitial group. The actuarial probability of freedom from biochemical relapse was 70% at 36?months for all patients together, 79% for regional and 57% for interstitial. No factors were found that could be used to predict relapse. CONCLUSIONS The clinical outcome in these patients with advanced localized prostate cancer seems to compare favourably with most series using irradiation alone, and the treatment caused no severe complications.

AB  - Abstract Craniocerebral trauma is a serious disease accompanied with mechanical damage, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3), an abundant circRNA, exerts the function in promoting cell growth. Therefore, we aimed to explore the biological roles and mechanism of circHIPK3 on cell damage in craniocerebral trauma. PC-12 cells were cotransfected with PLCDH-cirHIPK3 and microRNA-455 (miR-455) inhibitor and then were treated with H2O2 for 24?hours. Cell viability, apoptosis and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were tested through trypan blue staining, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species assay, respectively. Expression of circHIPK3 and miR-455 were tested through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression of pro-PARP, cleaved-PARP, pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9, ?-actin, beclin-1, p62, light chain 3-I (LC3-I), LC3-II, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), t-extracellular-regulated kinase (t-ERK) and p-ERK were tested via Western blot experiments. The 100??M H2O2-induced cell damage presented as reducing cell viability, increasing apoptosis, autophagy, and MFI. Besides, H2O2 could downregulate circHIPK3. However, overexpression of circHIPK3 attenuated cell damage caused by H2O2 that it increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis, autophagy and MFI through upregulating miR-455. Additionally, circHIPK3 overexpression promoted the activation of Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulating miR-455. Our study demonstrated that circHIPK3 attenuated H2O2-induced cell damage and activated Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulation of miR-455.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess outcome of phacoemulsification in cats. Methods Records of 71 cats (82 eyes) from five referral centers were reviewed. Groups were divided by cause of cataract (congenital/juvenile [n = 32], traumatic [n = 33], and secondary to uveitis [n = 6]), and group comparisons were performed for the most common complications: postoperative ocular hypertension (POH), uveitis, corneal ulceration, synechia/dyscoria, and posterior capsular opacity (PCO) in three different time periods: immediately postoperatively, at 1-90 days, and at >90 days. Results Median follow-up was 198 days (interquartile range 64-518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12-month follow-up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%). At 1-90 days, uveitis in 41/81 eyes (50.6%) remained the most common complication, followed by synechia/dyscoria in 21/81 eyes (25.9%), corneal ulceration in 16/81 eyes (19.7%), and PCO in 15/81 eyes (18.5%). At >90 days, PCO in 17/47 eyes (36.1%), followed by synechia/dyscoria in 16/47 eyes (34%), was the most common complications. The number of eyes with synechia/dyscoria in the trauma group was higher (13/33 [39.3%]) than in the congenital/juvenile group (5/31 [16.1%]) at 1-90 days (P = .039). No statistical difference was found for the other group comparisons. Three eyes in total were enucleated owing to endophthalmitis, post-traumatic ocular sarcoma, and secondary glaucoma. Conclusion Uveitis in the short-term and PCO and synechia/dyscoria in the long-term were the most common complications following phacoemulsification in cats.

AB  - Abstract Objective Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is recommended as the initial form of acute circulatory support for many disease processes. The epidemiology of its use in the ED is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess indications, use patterns and short-term effects of FBT in a paediatric ED. Methods Retrospective observational study in the ED of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (annual census >90?000) using hospital electronic medical record data for all patients who received an i.v. fluid bolus in the ED over the calendar year 2018 were included in the study. We extracted demographics, indications, volume, content of FBT as well as subsequent vital sign and biochemical changes. Results One thousand five hundred and thirty-nine fluid boluses were administered to 1343/90?000 children (1.5%), 1185 received 1, 123 received 2, 32 received 3, and 3 received 4 boluses. Fluid bolus volume of 10 mL/kg was used in 45.3%, 20?mL/kg in 35.7%, 500?mL in 6.4% and 1000?mL in 7.1%. The fluid content was 0.9% saline in 99.9% of cases. The most common indications for FBT were: vomiting/diarrhoea (23%), acute febrile illness (11%) and pneumonia or sepsis (10% each). FBT was associated with a reduction in median heart rate by 6 beats per minute (P?<?0.01), reduction in mean blood pressure by 3?mmHg (P?<?0.01), and reduction in venous lactate by 0.2?mmol/L (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Fluid bolus therapy is a commonly used intervention in the paediatric ED, most often for dehydration. Variability in indications, dose and effects of FBT warrant further exploration.

AB  - Abstract The concept that the mammalian glycoprotein vitronectin acts as a biological ?glue? and key controller of mammalian tissue repair and remodelling activity is emerging from nearly 50 years of experimental in vitro and in vivo data. Unexpectedly, the vitronectin-knockout (VN-KO) mouse was found to be viable and to have largely normal phenotype. However, diligent observation revealed that the VN-KO animal exhibits delayed coagulation and poor wound healing. This is interpreted to indicate that VN occupies a role in the earliest events of thrombogenesis and tissue repair. VN is the foundation upon which the thrombus grows in an organised structure. In addition to sealing the wound, the thrombus also serves to protect the underlying tissue from oxidation, is a reservoir of mitogens and tissue repair mediators, and provides a provisional scaffold for the repairing tissue. In the absence of VN (e.g., VN-KO animal), this cascade is disrupted before it begins. A wide variety of biologically active species associate with VN. Although initial studies were focused on mitogens, other classes of bioactives (e.g., glycosaminoglycans and metalloproteinases) are now also known to specifically interact with VN. Although some interactions are transient, others are long-lived and often result in multi-protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes provide several advantages: prolonging molecular interactions, sustaining local concentrations, facilitating co-stimulation of cell surface receptors and thereby enhancing cellular/biological responses. We contend that these, or equivalent, multi-protein complexes facilitate VN polyfunctionality in vivo. It is also likely that many of the species demonstrated to associate with VN in vitro, also associate with VN in vivo in similar multi-protein complexes. Thus, the predominant biological function of VN is that of a master controller of the extracellular environment; informing, and possibly instructing cells ?where? to behave, ?when? to behave and ?how? to behave (i.e., appropriately for the current circumstance). ? 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(10):807-818, 2013

AB  - Abstract:? First described in the 1500s, scurvy is infrequently seen in industrialized countries today, although vulnerable patient groups remain. A 15-yr-old girl underwent liver transplantation at age 26?months for a primary diagnosis of biliary hypoplasia, and subsequently developed late allograft failure and progressive renal insufficiency culminating in listing for combined liver retransplantation and kidney transplantation at age 13?yr. She required regular hemodialysis treatment for 12?months prior to deceased donor organ availability, with a complicated clinical course including recurrent septic episodes and severe cachexia. Ten months after initiation of hemodialysis, she presented with severe bone pain, purpura, ecchymoses, gingival hyperplasia, mucosal bleeding, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Serial serum ascorbic acid levels were found to be extremely low (<10??mol/L) despite routine supplementation both in her dialysate and via regular oral supplementation. Histopathology from skin biopsy revealed purpura, hyper- and parakeratosis, and follicular plugging. She had ECG and 2D echocardiogram disturbances, as well as osteopenia and sclerosis of the extremities on radiological evaluations. Therapy with high-dose ascorbic acid (1?g/day orally) led to complete resolution of skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of awareness and recognition of this historic diagnosis, and particularly in children with end-stage organ disease with severely compromised nutrition.

AB  - Summary This chapter overviews the advances in digital biosensors operating in the binary (YES/NO) mode, mostly emphasizing biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. The attractive performance of the new enzyme logic biosensors holds considerable promise for diverse practical and important future applications, including novel forensic and security applications. The chapter describes how the biomedical analysis can benefit from the use of biomolecular information processing (biocomputing) systems. Forensic analysis of biofluids can benefit from novel bioanalytical/biosensing methods, including those based on the biocomputing approach. The chapter also overviews the application of binary biosensing methods based on the enzyme logic gates to various types of injury biomarkers, particularly concentrating on battlefield injuries. It shows that the simplest logic processing based mostly on logic AND/OR gates, applied to biochemical input signals.

AB  - Summary Conifers have evolved complex oleoresin terpene defenses against herbivores and pathogens. In co-evolved bark beetles, conifer terpenes also serve chemo-ecological functions as pheromone precursors, chemical barcodes for host identification, or nutrients for insect-associated microbiomes. We highlight the genomic, molecular and biochemical underpinnings of the large chemical space of conifer oleoresin terpenes and volatiles. Conifer terpenes are predominantly the products of the conifer terpene synthase (TPS) gene family. Terpene diversity is increased by cytochromes P450 of the CYP720B class. Many conifer TPS are multiproduct enzymes. Multisubstrate CYP720B enzymes catalyse multistep oxidations. We summarise known terpenoid gene functions in various different conifer species with reference to the annotated terpenoid gene space in a spruce genome. Overall, biosynthesis of terpene diversity in conifers is achieved through a system of biochemical radiation and metabolic grids. Expression of TPS and CYP720B genes can be specific to individual cell types of constitutive or traumatic resin duct systems. Induced terpenoid transcriptomes in resin duct cells lead to dynamic changes of terpene composition and quantity to fend off herbivores and pathogens. While terpenoid defenses have contributed much to the evolutionary success of conifers, under new conditions of climate change, these defences may become inconsequential against range-expanding forest pests.

AB  - Summary The brain and other parts of the nervous system undergo complex changes with age. Loss of brain weight and volume, changes in neurons and synapses, and oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical changes have all been described in the aging brain. Moreover, the aging brain and nervous system show an increased vulnerability to a variety of distinct pathologies, particularly degenerative and vascular. This chapter provides an overview of the neuropathology of the aging brain, including ?normal? aging, the pathology of cognitive impairment and dementia, movements disorders, brain tumors, vascular disease, motor impairments, and other common geriatric brain conditions, such as toxic metabolic conditions, neoplasms, infections, and traumatic injury that may affect the elderly. The section on cognitive impairment and dementia explains the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mixed dementias, vascular dementia (also known as vascular cognitive impairment), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
