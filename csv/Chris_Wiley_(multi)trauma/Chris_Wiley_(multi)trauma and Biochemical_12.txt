AB  - This review attempts to describe the major immunocytochemical strategies that are in current use for transmission electron microscopy. Emphasis is placed on suggesting the most appropriate application of each technique that is described. The review is not intended to identify the microscopist's ?cure all? technique for immunocytochemistry but rather to describe what techniques are available and what are their relative merits. Expensive equipment and technically complicated methods are not always necessary to collect robust data. I hope to present a review that will enable its readers to select the most profitable technique (or compromise) available, to reflect both their resources and their ability to address their biological questions with vigour.

AB  - Abstract Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease in Malaysia. The symptoms of leptospirosis vary from mild nonspecific flu-like illness to a severe condition which is usually associated with serious complication and fatality. To study the protein expression profile of mild and severe leptospirosis, 15 paired sera were collected from the patients who were mildly infected and following that progressed to severe stage. The proteome profiles of mild and severe cases were studied using 2DE analysis in combination with LC-MS/MS. The expression of proteins that were significantly different and had a fold difference of at least 2 had been identified and then validated using Western blot. Our study demonstrated apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I), serum amyloid A (SAA), transferrin (TF), haptoglobin (HP) and transthyretin (TTR) have significantly different expression between mild and severe leptospirosis. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software suggested the expression of these five proteins were modulated by acute phase response signaling pathway. Besides that, a functional network of lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry that interconnects these five proteins with interactomes also had been predicted by this software. In conclusion, this finding supports the potential of these five proteins to be the biomarkers for mild and severe human leptospirosis.

AB  - The energy-sensing AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (AMPK) confers cell survival in part by stimulation of cellular energy production and limitation of cellular energy utilization. AMPK-sensitive functions further include activities of epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and voltage-gated K+ channel KCNE1/KCNQ1. AMPK is activated by an increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The present study explored whether AMPK regulates the Ca2+-sensitive large conductance and voltage-gated potassium (BK) channel. cRNA encoding BK channel was injected into Xenopus oocytes with and without additional injection of wild-type AMPK (AMPKα1+AMPK?1+AMPK?1), constitutively active AMPK?R70Q, or inactive AMPKαK45R. BK-channel activity was determined utilizing the 2-electrode voltage-clamp. Moreover, BK-channel protein abundance in the cell membrane was determined by confocal immunomicroscopy. As BK channels are expressed in outer hair cells (OHC) of the inner ear and lack of BK channels increases noise vulnerability, OHC BK-channel expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and hearing function analyzed by auditory brain stem response measurements in AMPKα1-deficient mice (ampk?/?) and in wild-type mice (ampk+/+). As a result, coexpression of AMPK or AMPK?R70Q but not of AMPKαK45R significantly enhanced BK-channel-mediated currents and BK-channel protein abundance in the oocyte cell membrane. BK-channel expression in the inner ear was lower in ampk?/? mice than in ampk+/+ mice. The hearing thresholds prior to and immediately after an acoustic overexposure were similar in ampk?/? and ampk+/+ mice. However, the recovery from the acoustic trauma was significantly impaired in ampk?/?mice compared to ampk+/+ mice. In summary, AMPK is a potent regulator of BK channels. It may thus participate in the signaling cascades that protect the inner ear from damage following acoustic overstimulation.?Föller, M., Jaumann, M., Dettling, J., Saxena, A., Pakladok, T., Munoz, C., Ruth, P., Sopjani, M., Seebohm, G., Rüttiger, L., Knipper, M., Lang, F.

AB  - ABSTRACT Immobilization as a result of long-term bed rest can lead to gradual bone loss. Due to their distribution throughout the bone matrix and remarkable interconnectivity, osteocytes represent the major mechanosensors in bone and translate mechanical into biochemical signals controlling bone remodeling. To test whether immobilization affects the characteristics of the osteocyte network in human cortical bone, femoral diaphyseal bone specimens were analyzed in immobilized female individuals and compared to age-matched postmenopausal individuals with primary osteoporosis. Premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy individuals served as control groups. Cortical porosity, osteocyte number and lacunar area, the frequency of hypermineralized lacunae as well as cortical bone calcium content (CaMean) were assessed using bone histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). Bone matrix properties were further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the immobilization group, cortical porosity was significantly higher, and qBEI revealed a trend towards higher matrix mineralization compared to osteoporotic individuals. Osteocyte density and canalicular density showed a declining rate from premenopausal towards healthy postmenopausal and osteoporotic individuals with peculiar reductions in the immobilization group, while the number of hypermineralized lacunae accumulated inversely. In conclusion, reduced osteocyte density and impaired connectivity during immobilization are associated with a specific bone loss pattern, reflecting a phenotype clearly distinguishable from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Immobilization periods may lead to a loss of survival signals for osteocytes, provoking bone loss that is even higher than in osteoporosis states, while osteocytic osteolysis remains absent.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an elevated risk of post-operative complications. The impact it has on patients living with DM following hip fracture surgery (HFS) is not completely understood and may represent a predictor of increased mortality. This study investigates the impact of DM, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and fracture location, on the outcome of HFS in Ireland. The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) database records all fragility hip fractures within Galway University Hospital. Retrospective data collection was performed over a 3-year period. Data collected included patient age, gender, date of HFS, anatomical fracture location, type of operation, ASA grade, DM status, and mortality. A database of 650 individuals was created including 461 females and 189 males, with an average group age of 80.2?±?9.3 years. Results showed a significantly higher incidence of hip fractures in males with DM (19.57%) than females with DM (12.36%) (?2 test, p?=?0.020). Cox regression survival analysis indicated that DM status and ASA grade were the two main independent predictors of patient survival following HFS. Nevertheless, when examining the combined impact of gender and DM status on survival after HFS, results showed that survival post HFS differed significantly with gender and presence of DM (log-rank test, p?<?0.001), with males with DM performing worse than females with DM (p?=?0.021) or males without DM (p?=?0.001). This gender and disease-associated outcome should prompt an early multi-disciplinary team approach to the management of hip fractures in patients with DM. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - The anatomical response of Norway spruce bark polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) to inoculation with the phytopathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica and attack by its bark-beetle vector Ips typographus was examined. Fungal inoculation on the periderm surface had no effect, while inoculation just below the periderm or halfway into the phloem (mid-phloem) generated detectable responses within 3 wk. The responses included increase in PP cell size and in periodic acid-Schiff's staining of PP cell phenolics, wound periderm initiation from PP cells, and cambial zone traumatic resin duct formation. Fungi were not seen in samples 3 wk after subperiderm or mid-phloem inoculation, but were found in some samples 6 and 9 wk after mid-phloem inoculation. In contrast, inoculations into the cambium resulted in partial (3 wk) or complete (6 and 9 wk) fungal colonization and death of tissue in the infected area. This indicates that PP cells have defenses capable of inhibiting fungal growth. Samples taken near bark-beetle galleries had similar anatomical responses as inoculated samples, validating the inoculation approach to studying defense responses in spruce. These results show that PP cells represent not only a constitutive defense system, but are also involved in local and remote inducible defenses against fungal and beetle attack.

AB  - Objective To determine the response of Australian cats with lymphosarcoma to chemotherapy and/or surgery in relation to patient and tumour characteristics, haematological and serum biochemical values and retroviral status. Design Prospective study of 61 client-owned cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma subjected to multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. Procedure An accepted chemotherapy protocol utilising l-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate and prednisolone was modified and used to treat 60 cats with lymphosarcoma. Clinical findings were recorded before and during therapy. As far as practical, cases were followed to death, euthanasia or apparent cure. Owner satisfaction with the results of chemotherapy was determined using a questionnaire sent after the completion of chemotherapy. Results One cat, with lymphosarcoma limited to a single mandibular lymph node, was treated using surgery alone and was cured. The other 60 cats were treated using multi-agent chemotherapy, although seven cats with localised intestinal, ocular and subcutaneous lesions had these lesions partially (2 intestinal lesions) or completely (2 eyes, 2 intestinal lesions and a cluster of regional lymph nodes) resected prior to starting chemotherapy. The median survival time for these 60 cats was 116 days. Of the 60 cats, 48 rapidly went into complete remission following the administration of l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone (complete remission rate 80%) and these cats had a median survival of 187 days. Three cats were censored from further analysis as their long-term survival data were uninterpretable because they died of causes unrelated to lymphosarcoma or were prematurely lost to follow-up. Twenty cats were classed as ?long-term survivors? based on survival time in excess of one year and at least 14 were ?cured? based on the absence of physical evidence of lymphosarcoma 2-years after initiating treatment. In other words, of the 48 cats that reached complete remission, in excess of 29% were ?cured?. Despite detailed analysis, few meaningful prognostic indicators based on patient or tumour characteristics were identified, although long-term survivors were more likely to be less than 4-years (P = 0.04) and to have tumours of the T-cell phenotype (P = 0.06). Excluding the one FeLV ELISA-positive cat with mediastinal LSA, 7 of 9 cats less than 4 years-of-age were long-term survivors (median survival time >1271 days). There was a strong association between achieving complete remission and long-term survival (P = 0.003). On the basis of 27 replies to a questionnaire, owners were generally very satisfied with the response to chemotherapy, irrespective of the survival time of the individual patient. Eighty five percent of owners expressed complete satisfaction with their decision to pursue chemotherapy and 70% believed their cat's health status improved during the first 2-weeks of treatment. Importantly, 78% of owners considered that chemotherapy required a very substantial time commitment on their part. Conclusions It was possible to cure approximately one quarter of cats with lymphosarcoma using sequential multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. FeLV-negative cats younger than 4 years (typically with mediastinal lymphosarcoma) had a particularly favourable prognosis. The decision to embark on chemotherapy should be based on the results of induction chemotherapy with l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone, as the response to this was a good predictor of long-term survival. Cats surviving the first 16 weeks of chemotherapy generally enjoyed robust remissions (in excess of 1 year) or were cured of their malignancy.

AB  - Abstract Cell death occurs by one of two mechanisms: apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis due to cellular injury or trauma. Each method has distinct morphological and biochemical characteristics. Distinguishing between apoptosis and necrosis depends selection of appropriate assays and proper timing. This unit provides an extensive series of assays that measure membrane integrity, cell size and DNA content, state of chromatin, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. The results of these assays allow one to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.

The length and location PSMs are important, with significant differences between open and robotic RP. The impact of PSMs on BCR remains secondary to other clinico-pathologic variables: Gleason Score, pathologic stage, and baseline PSA. However, lower PSM rates are associated with reduced use of secondary interventions and patient anxiety of cancer recurrence. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;113:310?315. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Cell-based tissue engineering is a promising approach for treating cartilage lesions, but available strategies still provide a distinct composition of the extracellular matrix and an inferior mechanical property compared to native cartilage. To achieve fully functional tissue replacement more rationally designed biomaterials may be needed, introducing bioactive molecules which modulate cell behavior and guide tissue regeneration. This study aimed at exploring the impact of cell-instructive, adhesion-binding (GCWGGRGDSP called RGD) and collagen-binding (CKLER/CWYRGRL) peptides, incorporated in a tunable, matrixmetalloprotease (MMP)-responsive multi-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG)/heparin hydrogel on cartilage regeneration parameters in vitro and in vivo. MMP-responsive-starPEG-conjugates with cysteine termini and heparin-maleimide, optionally pre-functionalized with RGD, CKLER, CWYRGRL or control peptides, were cross-linked by Michael type addition to embed and grow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or chondrocytes. While starPEG/heparin-hydrogel strongly supported chondrogenesis of MSC according to COL2A1, BGN and ACAN induction, MMP-degradability enhanced cell viability and proliferation. RGD-modification of the gels promoted cell spreading with intense cell network formation without negative effects on chondrogenesis. However, CKLER and CWYRGRL were unable to enhance the collagen content of constructs. RGD-modification allowed more even collagen type II distribution by chondrocytes throughout the MMP-responsive constructs, especially in vivo. Collectively, peptide-instruction via heparin-enriched MMP-degradable starPEG allowed adjustment of self-renewal, cell morphology and cartilage matrix distribution in order to guide MSC and chondrocyte-based cartilage regeneration towards an improved outcome.

AB  - Abstract Background Adenosine kinase deficiency is a recently described defect affecting methionine metabolism with a severe clinical phenotype comprising mainly neurological and hepatic impairment and dysmorphism. Methods Clinical data of 11 additional patients from eight families with adenosine kinase deficiency were gathered through a retrospective questionnaire. Two liver biopsies of one patient were systematically evaluated. Results The main clinical symptoms are mild to severe liver dysfunction with neonatal onset, muscular hypotonia, global developmental retardation and dysmorphism (especially frontal bossing). Hepatic involvement is not a constant finding. Most patients have epilepsy and recurrent hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Major biochemical findings are intermittent hypermethioninemia, increased S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in plasma and increased adenosine in urine. S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine are the most reliable biochemical markers. The major histological finding was pronounced microvesicular hepatic steatosis. Therapeutic trials with a methionine restricted diet indicate a potential beneficial effect on biochemical and clinical parameters in four patients and hyperinsulinism was responsive to diazoxide in two patients. Conclusion Adenosine kinase deficiency is a severe inborn error at the cross-road of methionine and adenosine metabolism that mainly causes dysmorphism, brain and liver symptoms, but also recurrent hypoglycemia. The clinical phenotype varies from an exclusively neurological to a multi-organ manifestation. Methionine-restricted diet should be considered as a therapeutic option.

AB  - Summary.? The Middle and Late Iron Age samples of disarticulated human remains from the settlement site of Gussage All Saints and the hillfort of Maiden Castle (Dorset, England) were investigated for evidence of funerary rites. The samples were examined using osteological, forensic and archaeological methodologies for evidence of excarnation and secondary burial. The study found evidence for dry-fractures, animal gnawing and peri-mortem trauma, indicating that many individuals had received blunt-force cranial fractures and/or weapon injuries at the time of death. The taphonomic indicators showed that bodies were excarnated, received secondary burial treatment and then selected skull and long bones were incorporated into structured deposits. Osteological analysis also showed that the majority of individuals were adult males, which corresponded to patterns of trauma in the inhumated sample from Dorset. Two bones also provided unique evidence within Dorset for the cultural modification of human remains.

AB  - summary? This study investigated the shear bond strengths of sectioned human mandibular incisor edge fragments reattached using luting cements, bonding agents or restored with composite resins. Seventy teeth were randomly distributed among six experimental groups and a control group. Leaving half of the anatomic crowns exposed, the teeth were embedded in self-cure acrylic resins with the exposed part then sectioned. The fragments in groups 1?4 were bonded to their respective teeth using Clearfil Liner Bond 2V, Scotch Bond Multi Purpose Plus, Panavia-F and 3M Opal Luting cement. The 5th and 6th groups were restored with composite resins (Silux 3M and Clearfil AP-X) using their bonding agents (Single Bond and Clearfil SE Bond). The results indicated that reattachment of fractured incisal fragments by using new generation bonding agents was effective against shear stresses, comparable with the intact teeth. Instead of restoration with composite resins therefore reattachment of a fractured fragment might be more preferable in cases of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Summary Myxedema coma is a decompensated state of hypothyroidism resulting from severe and prolonged depletion of thyroid hormones, leading to altered mental status and other clinical features related to widespread multi-organ dysfunction. While this is a rare condition on the spectrum of thyroid disorders, myxedema coma is considered an endocrine emergency due to the danger of increased mortality with recent rates of 20?25% reported. Therefore, it is important to promptly recognize and treat myxedema coma in an attempt to improve outcomes.

AB  - Objective To report the complications and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gall bladder disease. Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Client-owned dogs (n=20). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. Results Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed successfully for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in dogs after careful case selection. The surgeon considering laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be familiar with a variety of methods for cystic duct dissection and ligation to avoid difficulties during the procedure.
