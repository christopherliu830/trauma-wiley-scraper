AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the association between different subjective and objective assessments of ankle function in a population of athletes with or without functional ankle instability (FAI). 29 athletes with a history of ankle spraining were divided into two groups according to their ankle status: 16 with FAI (initial ankle sprain with residual functional instability) (age 24.6?±?3.1 years), and 13 COPERS (initial ankle sprain without residual instability) (age 25.3?±?4.4 years). The assessment of each individual's ankle function was based on three approaches: The ?functional-ankle-ability-measure? (FAAM) assessing subjective ankle functionality, measures of sensorimotor control as objective functional measurements and MRI-based T2-mapping as a quantitative marker of compositional joint status. Pearson's product-moment-correlation coefficient, student's t-test and analysis-of-variance were used for statistical analysis. Significant group differences existed for subjective ankle function (FAAM, p?=?0.04) and MRI-data mainly in the medial compartment of the ankle joint (p?≤?0.05). We found unique associations between T2-mapping results and sensorimotor scores in the COPER (r?=??0.756?0.849), and ?FAI?-group (r?=?0.630?0.657). The location and magnitude differed between groups. No correlations existed between these measures and the FAAM. This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential interrelations between various diagnostic measures of ankle function and structure in individuals with and without FAI. We found associations between MRI-results and selected measures of sensorimotor control, indicating a potential link between loss of ankle function and early joint degeneration. Despite these interrelations, each of the different assessment options appears to contain unique information on ankle functionality important in a clinical assessment. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Application of 100 mmol/L methyl jasmonate (MJ) to the intact bark of 30-yr-old Norway spruce induced anatomical reactions related to defense. Within 30 d, a single MJ treatment induced swelling of existing polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) and an increase in their phenolic contents and formation of additional PP cells and of traumatic resin ducts (TDs) at the cambial zone. These changes occurred up to 7 cm away from the application zone. Treatment enhanced resin flow and increased resistance to the blue-stain fungus, Ceratocystis polonica. Methyl jasmonate application to the oldest internode of 2-yr-old saplings also induced TD formation, and, more surprisingly, TDs were formed in the untreated internode. Traumatic ducts were not formed in branches, ruling out an effect of volatile MJ on the upper internode. Methyl jasmonate application never gave rise to a hypersensitive response, cell death, tissue necrosis, or wound periderm, indicating the amount of MJ transported across the periderm was very low relative to the application concentration. This is the first report of a single compound giving rise to major cellular features related to acquired resistance and previously shown to be induced by wounding, fungal infection, and bark beetles in Norway spruce.

AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reproductive function of women with bipolar disorder (BD) compared to healthy controls. Methods Women diagnosed with BD and healthy controls with no psychiatric history, aged 18?45 years, were recruited from a university clinic and surrounding community. Participants completed a baseline reproductive health questionnaire, serum hormone assessment, and ovulation tracking for three consecutive cycles using urine luteinizing hormone (LH)-detecting strips with a confirmatory luteal-phase serum progesterone. Results Women with BD (n = 103) did not differ from controls (n = 36) in demographics, rates of menstrual abnormalities (MAs), or number of ovulation-positive cycles. Of the women with BD, 17% reported a current MA and 39% reported a past MA. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were higher in controls (p = 0.052 and 0.004, respectively), but there were no other differences in biochemical levels. Medication type, dose, or duration was not associated with MA or biochemical markers, although those currently taking an atypical antipsychotic agent indicated a greater rate of current or past MA (80% versus 55%, p = 0.013). In women with BD, 22% reported a period of amenorrhea associated with exercising or stress, versus 8% of controls (p = 0.064). Self-reported rates of bulimia and anorexia nervosa were 10% and 5%, respectively. Conclusions Rates of MA and biochemical levels did not significantly differ between women with BD and controls. Current atypical antipsychotic agent use was associated with a higher rate of current or past MA and should be further investigated. The incidence of stress-induced amenorrhea should be further investigated in this population, as should the comorbid incidence of eating disorders.

AB  - ABSTRACT Skin loss can be caused by accident, burn, trauma, chronic wounds, and diseases, which is severely aggravated by multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Soft hybrids based on biopolymers combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have potential applications as wound dressing supports and skin tissue repair. Thus, our study focused on the design, green synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC?AgNP) nanocomposites for producing hydrogel membranes, with tunable physicochemical properties, cytocompatibility, and biocidal activity for potential application as wound dressing and skin repair. These nanocomposites were prepared using CMC with two degrees of carboxymethylation, distinct concentrations of citric acid (CA) crosslinker, and AgNPs by in situ chemical reduction, forming hybrid membranes by the solvent casting method. The results demonstrated that superabsorbent hydrogels were produced with swelling and degradation behaviors dependent on the concentration of CA crosslinker, degree of carboxymethylation of CMC, and content of AgNP in the matrices. Moreover, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis evidenced that the CMC functional groups (e.g., ?COOH and ?OH) were directly involved in the chemical reactions for the formation of AgNPs and hydrogel crosslinking pathway. These nanocomposites were cytocompatible using in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability assay with of human embryonic kidney cells. Conclusively, the CMC?AgNP nanohybrids demonstrated to be simultaneously non-toxic combined with highly effective antibacterial activity against gram-positive multi-resistant wound/skin pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus) and moderate effect towards gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract This study tested the hypothesis that activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) contributes towards the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in the mouse. The effects of LPS on plasma glucose, biochemical markers of hepatic, renal and pancreatic exocrine function and lung content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were examined in homozygous PAR-2 knockout mice (PAR-2 -/-) and genetically equivalent, homozygous PAR-2 +/+ mice. The effect of LPS was also examined in normal mice receiving dexamethasone (10 mg kg?1, i.p.) or saline as a positive control. At six hours after intraperitoneal injection, LPS (40 mg kg?1) produced an increase in rectal temperature, hypoglycaemia and elevations in serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and lipase, as well as an increase in lung MPO content. Dexamethasone treatment reduced LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and elevation of serum ALT concentrations but did not modify elevations in serum creatinine and lipase concentrations or the increase in lung MPO content. The changes in serum concentrations of glucose, ALT, creatinine and lipase produced by LPS in PAR-2 -/- mice were not different from those seen in wild-type or PAR-2 +/+ mice. These data suggest that activation of PAR-2 may not play a pivotal role in LPS-induced multi-organ dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract Study of cell-biomaterial interaction is a crucial aspect of bone tissue engineering to find a state-of-the-art functional substitute. In present study, the Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) behavior on three-dimensional biomimetic nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan/gelatin (nHA/CS/Gel) scaffolds was investigated. The outcome was assessed by histological, biochemical and morphological tests. Results indicated that hWJ-MSCs attached onto the scaffold surface through membrane filopodia, uniformly spread throughout the contacting surface. It only took 3 days for the seeded cells to appear deep inside the scaffold, reflecting proper hWJ-MSCs adhesion and migration, evidenced by both scanning electron microscope and hematoxilin and eosin assessments. Additionally, the present fabricated nHA/CS/Gel scaffold proved to be non-toxic as it supported cell proliferation measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, 3-week culture of hWJ-MSCs on scaffolds, immersed in osteogenic medium, rendered the microenvironment in favor of hWJ-MSCs differentiation into osteoblast cells and extracellular matrix secretion. Finally, osteoblasts were immunologically positive for various osteogenic markers including osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and alkaline phosphatase. Present findings indicate that nHA/CS/Gel scaffold appropriately harbored hWJ-MSCs, stimulating their growth, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. hWJ-MSCs-loaded nHA/CS/gel substitute may therefore be considered as a suitable platform for the rising demand in in vivo bone repair studies. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this study, polybutyrolactam (PBA) was synthesized, and the PBA/chitosan (CS) blended films were fabricated for wound dressings. The results showed that the surface roughness of the blended films decreased with the increasing ratios of CS. In addition, the tensile strength of the film with 50 wt % CS (NC50) was about 33.6 MPa and the highest compared with other films. The hydrophilicity of the blended films gradually decreased while the water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) increased with the increase of CS content. Moreover, the blended films could be biodegradable in phosphate buffer saline. Both PBA and blended films were non-toxic and good for L929 cells growth, showing good cytocompatibility. Furthermore, the NC50 was found to promote the cell proliferation better than other groups. It can be suggested that the NC50 combined the advantages of both PBA and CS well. Therefore, the NC50 with good cytocompatibility, mechanical properties, and WVTRs might be suitable for wound dressing applications. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB  - Objective Evaluate the effect of a perioperative intravenous continuous rate infusion (CRI) of metoclopramide on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization. Study Design Prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial. Animals 61 client-owned dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis and normal preoperative thoracic radiographs. Methods All dogs underwent unilateral arytenoid lateralization with a uniform anesthetic, analgesic, and management protocol. Dogs in the treatment group received an intravenous CRI of metoclopramide for 24 hours perioperative. All dogs were assessed for clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia based on the results of physical examination and owner interview up to the point of suture removal (10?14 days postoperative). Any dog with suspected aspiration pneumonia had thoracic radiographs performed. Results Six dogs developed aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period (2/28 control dogs and 4/33 treated dogs), accounting for an overall frequency of 10% with no significant difference between control and treated dogs. No variables measured in the study were significantly different between control and treated dogs. Conclusions Perioperative metoclopramide, at the doses used in this study, did not affect the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization.

AB  - Objective? To identify preoperative diagnostic results that predict postoperative complications and survival in feline renal-transplant recipients. Study Design? Retrospective clinical study. Animals? Sixty-one feline renal allograft recipients. Methods? Medical records for 61 consecutive cats that underwent renal allograft transplantation between January 1, 1996, and December 1, 1999, were reviewed. Age, diagnosis, body weight, body condition score, preoperative medical treatment, systolic blood pressure, packed cell volume, biochemical parameters at admission and at the time of surgery, postoperative complications, and postoperative survival were recorded. Associations of preoperative data with the occurrence of postoperative complications were determined using logistic regression. Postoperative survival was graphed using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative-survival plot. Associations of covariates with postoperative survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results? Two parameters were significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative central nervous system (CNS) disorders: blood urea nitrogen concentration (odds ratio = 1.083; 95% CI = 1.018 to 1.148) and serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.413 to 2.187) at the time of surgery. Postoperative survival 6 months after transplantation was 59%, though 3-year survival remained at 42%. Of all covariates investigated, only recipient age (relative hazard = 1.183; 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.334) was significantly associated with survival. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance? Standard measures of preoperative renal dysfunction do not predict postoperative survival in cats after renal transplantation, although an increase in the degree of preoperative azotemia is associated with an increased risk of CNS disorders after surgery. Increased recipient age is associated with decreased survival after renal transplantation.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

AB  - Summary Portosystemic shunts (PSS) are vascular anomalies connecting the portal and systemic venous systems that result in varying degrees of biochemical and clinical abnormalities. Unfortunately, due to diminished portal perfusion, only a minority of intrahepatic PSS (IHPSS) can be completely occluded acutely without resulting in life-threatening portal hypertension. More recently, endovascular management of portosystemic shunts has been described. These techniques can be used to provide partial or complete endovascular attenuation of IHPSS or extrahepatic PSS (EHPSS), achieve similar clinical results, and result in fewer perioperative complications and mortalities compared to those reported following traditional surgery. Portal hypertension occur uncommonly following percutaneous transvenous embolization (PTE), likely due to the post-sinusoidal location of the shunt attenuation favoring the development of intrahepatic venous collaterals over portal hypertension. Digital subtraction angiography is highly recommended when performing the PTE procedure.

AB  - Abstract The development and organisation of the human brain start in the embryonic stage and is a highly complex orchestrated process. It depends on series of cellular mechanisms that are precisely regulated by multiple proteins, signalling pathways and non-protein-coding genes. A crucial process during cerebral cortex development is the migration of nascent neuronal cells to their appropriate positions and their associated differentiation into layer-specific neurons. Neuronal migration defects (NMD) comprise a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders including monogenetic disorders and residual syndromes due to damaging factors during prenatal development like infections, maternal diabetes mellitus or phenylketonuria, trauma, and drug use. Multifactorial causes are also possible. Classification into lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and neuronal heterotopia is based on the visible morphologic cortex anomalies. Characteristic clinical features of NMDs are severe psychomotor developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, and dysmorphisms. Neurometabolic disorders only form a small subgroup within the large group of NMDs. The prototypes are peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, peroxisomal ß-oxidation defects and congenital disorders of O-glycosylation. The rapid evolution of biotechnology has resulted in an ongoing identification of metabolic and non-metabolic disease genes for NMDs. Nevertheless, we are far away from understanding the specific role of cortical genes and metabolites on spatial and temporal regulation of human cortex development and associated malformations. This limited understanding of the pathogenesis hinders the attempt for therapeutic approaches. In this article, we provide an overview of the most important cortical malformations and potential underlying neurometabolic disorders.

AB  - A concept for a new generation of an integrated multi-functional biosensor/actuator system is developed, which is based on biomolecular logic principles. Such a system is expected to be able to detect multiple biochemical input signals simultaneously and in real-time and convert them into electrical output signals with logical operations such as OR, AND, etc. The system can be designed as a closed-loop drug release device triggered by an enzyme logic gate, while the release of the drug induced by the actuator at the required dosage and timing will be controlled by an additional drug sensor. Thus, the system could help to make an accurate and specific diagnosis. The presented concept is exemplarily demonstrated by using an enzyme logic gate based on a glucose/glucose oxidase system, a temperature-responsive hydrogel mimicking the actuator function and an insulin (drug) sensor. In this work, the results of functional testing of individual amperometric glucose and insulin sensors as well as an impedimetric sensor for the detection of the hydrogel swelling/shrinking are presented.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive survey is provided on the application of a random positioning machine (RPM) for studies on gravitational effects on mammalian cells. The RPM is suitable to simulate microgravity conditions and allows performing a high number of on-ground experiments wherein mammalian cells are exposed to reduced gravity. Most of these experiments have been performed either to prove or extend observations made during spaceflights or to develop and prepare new spaceflight experiments. They did not only bring a tremendous number of observations, but they helped to elucidate three dominant cellular pathways that are affected by weightlessness. The apoptotic, the immune-activating and the bone differentiation pathways are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Clinical cellular therapeutics (CCTs) have shown preliminary efficacy in reducing inflammation after trauma, preserving cardiac function after myocardial infarction, and improving functional recovery after stroke. However, most clinically available cell lines express tissue factor (TF) which stimulates coagulation. We sought to define the degree of procoagulant activity of CCTs as related to TF expression. CCT samples from bone marrow, adipose, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, multi-potent adult progenitor cell donors, and bone marrow mononuclear cells were tested. TF expression and phenotype were quantified using flow cytometry. Procoagulant activity of the CCTs was measured in vitro with thromboelastography and calibrated thrombogram. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separated samples into high- and low-TF expressing populations to isolate the contribution of TF to coagulation. A TF neutralizing antibody was incubated with samples to demonstrate loss of procoagulant function. All CCTs tested expressed procoagulant activity that correlated with expression of tissue factor. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreased with increasing TF expression. High-TF expressing cells decreased clotting time more than low-TF expressing cells when isolated from a single donor using FACS. A TF neutralizing antibody restored clotting time to control values in some, but not all, CCT samples. CCTs demonstrate wide variability in procoagulant activity related to TF expression. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreases as TF load increases and this procoagulant effect is neutralized by a TF blocking antibody. Clinical trials using CCTs are in progress and TF expression may emerge as a safety release criterion. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:731?739

AB  - Summary Background Irisin is a new adipo-myokine, encoded by the FNDC5 gene. Currently, there is a discussion regarding the relation between thyroid function and irisin concentration. This prospective study assesses the influence of thyrometabolic changes on serum irisin concentration in association with altered muscle metabolism. This is performed on a large cohort of patients affected by severe hypo- or hyperthyroidism, as well as by the expression of the FNDC5 gene in thyroid tissue affected by different pathologies. Methods The study group comprised 119 patients with newly diagnosed severe hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, and a control group of 45 healthy subjects. Body composition, serum irisin concentrations, and thyroid-related hormones, creatine kinase, dystrophin and titin concentrations were evaluated. FNDC5 expression was also analysed in tissue samples from 80 patients with nontoxic multinodular goitre, toxic goitre, Graves? disease and papillary thyroid cancer. Results Irisin concentration was lower in patients with prolonged hypothyroidism. There was a tendency towards lower dystrophin and titin concentrations in patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Restoration of euthyroidism in patients with hypothyroidism resulted in a decreased muscle mass with an increase in irisin concentrations, while the hyperthyroid group showed an increase in fat mass. Statistically significant overexpression of FNDC5 gene was found in patients with toxic goitre as compared to Graves? disease, papillary thyroid cancer and controls. Conclusions The presented data support the theory that irisin concentration changes are associated with prolonged hypothyroidism and might primarily constitute the result of prolonged myopathy. These changes are most likely not related to the expression of the FNDC5 gene in the thyroid gland.
