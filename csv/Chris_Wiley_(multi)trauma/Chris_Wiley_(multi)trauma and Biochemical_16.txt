AB  - Abstract Extended human longevity has resulted in increasing numbers of elderly persons in the general population. However, old age is also associated with a variety of serious physical disorders. Frailty among sedentary elderly patients is related to the impaired structure and function of contractile fibers. Biochemical research into cellular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia promises to acquire the scientific basis of evidence to aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The recent application of MS-based proteomic methodology has identified a large cohort of disease-specific markers of sarcopenia. This review critically examines the biomedical implications of the results obtained from the proteomic screening of both aged human muscle and established animal models of sarcopenia. Substantial alterations in proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, regulatory and contractile elements of the actomyosin apparatus, myofibrillar remodeling and the cellular stress response are discussed. A multi-factorial etiology appears to be the basis for a slower-twitching aged fiber population, which exhibits a shift to more aerobic-oxidative metabolism. It is hoped that the detailed biomedical characterization of the newly identified biomarkers of sarcopenia will translate into better treatment options for reversing age-dependent muscle degeneration, which could improve the standard of living for a large portion of society.

AB  - A critical review of some of our current views on how chemicals induce cancer is presented. Emphasis is placed on pathologic processes, rather than on agents and on the many steps that lie between initial exposure to a carcinogen and the appearance of malignant neoplasia. The nature of some of the early steps in carcinogenesis is outlined including the early appearance during initiation of cells resistant to some of the inhibitory effect of carcinogens. This property is considered to be important in the development of cancer in at least one model of carcinogenesis. The essential characteristic of promotion, differential stimulation of proliferation of initiated cells, is discussed along with at least three possible mechanisms for such differential effects of promoting environments. The multistep hypothesis for cancer development is supported by observations of identifiable biochemical and biological properties of different cell populations at some steps. The implications of this for cancer diagnosis, prevention and control are briefly discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Myeloproliferative disorders involving the megakaryocytic line are uncommon but in recent years several reports have come from North America and the United Kingdom describing megakaryoblastic leukaemia (MbL) and a particular form called essential thrombocythaemia (ET). This article reports a myeloproliferative disorder in a dog that was ultimately designated as MbL on the basis of the presence of circulating blast cells and thrombocythaemia, and of multi-organ infiltration and myelofibrosis. It comments on the difficulties of diagnosing such a condition and reviews previously published articles on MbL and ET in dogs and cats.

AB  - Summary The evidence base to support the prevention of haemophilic arthropathy remains incomplete. In particular there is a lack of evidence regarding the potential influence of non-haematological factors. Additionally the ankle joint, the most affected joint in the primary prophylaxis era, has biochemical and structural features that should offer some protection from degeneration. Therefore, this study aimed to ascertain expert opinions on the potential contributory factors in order to inform a research agenda. The Delphi method, a group forum technique to achieve consensus of expert opinion was selected. It allows anonymous participation of a geographically disparate panel. A modified three-round design was used with a multi-professional international panel from 11 countries, 280 suggestions with the potential to influence arthropathy development were submitted in Round 1. These were analysed for theme, giving 47 factors in four categories: musculoskeletal intrinsic, extrinsic affecting physical health, compliance, education and non-haematological management, and haemophilia related. Subsequently, consensus was ascertained on their importance for study. At survey completion, 31 panellists (86%) completed. 41 factors reached the pre-selected level for consensus and 6 were rejected. The breadth of the factors put forward suggests that the panel believe pathogenesis of HA is multifactorial. Panel composition indicates results with high face and content validity capable of guiding future research. Developing an understanding of the relative influence of factors in each patient has the potential of not only individualizing replacement therapy with regard to frequency and trough levels but also individualizing other interventions that promote musculoskeletal health.

PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract The controversy regarding the role of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in the treatment of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning has been re-ignited following the publication of a further randomized controlled trial by Weaver et al., the results of which appear to conflict with our findings. Comparative analysis suggests that the apparent outcome differences may be secondary to the design, analysis and interpretation of the results of the two studies. Following careful analysis of these two papers and further results from a study by Raphael et al on 385 CO-poisoned patients, we can still find no convincing evidence favouring HBO therapy. Pending further research to determine optimal oxygen therapy for CO-poisoning, current therapy should involve stratifying patients for risk of a poor outcome. This stratification may be aided by the evolving availability of biochemical markers of brain injury and the finding that patients with transient loss of consciousness and poor performance on neuropsychological tests of the supervisory attention system are at higher risk of neuropsychological sequelae. We propose that those patients most at risk be admitted and receive more prolonged normobaric oxygen therapy whilst those with more minor CO-poisoning should be provided with normobaric oxygen of no less than 6 h duration and certainly until sign and symptom free.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Summary A 17-year-old Irish Sport Horse gelding was referred to the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital for low-grade colic that had been nonresponsive to medical treatment. Diagnostic investigation revealed a marked septic peritonitis. The inciting cause was detected by gastroscopy to be a perforating foreign body in the pylorus of the stomach from a briar of a blackthorn plant (Prunus spinosa spp.). Successful removal of the foreign body was achieved surgically via gastrotomy. The horse subsequently developed a multi-drug resistant abdominal incision site infection, which was successfully managed over a 2-month period. Abdominal incisional herniation occurred thereafter. Six months post-operatively, the horse was back in light work and no further adverse sequelae had been noted.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to assess the frequency of localised primary canine hypoplasia (LHPC) in a sample of 24 subadults from a Neolithic cemetery assemblage located at Man Bac, northern Vietnam (~4000?3500?years BP), and explore the range of factors potentially contributing to the development of this condition. It is found that 41.7% of individuals (20.9% of primary canines) have LHPC, which is similar to the frequency reported in a suite of ancient cemetery series from Neolithic through to Metal Age Thailand. A range of competing aetiological factors considered included trauma to the deciduous canine, ostensibly by way of early childhood exploratory behaviours (e.g. ?mouthing? objects), nutritional and dietary deficiencies (especially vitamin A and D), the impact of the mother's health on the developing foetus as well as the effects of premature birth on the developing child. It is concluded that while the aetiology LHPC is multi-factorial, the reasonably high prevalence of this condition at Man Bac suggests depressed maternal and neonatal health, consistent with a community experiencing high rates of fertility and transitioning to an agricultural subsistence economy.

AB  - Summary Portal vascular anomalies (PVAs) in dogs and cats include congenital or acquired macrovascular portosystemic shunts (PSS), portal venous hypoplasia (microvascular dysplasia), hepatic arteriovenous malformation, and noncirrhotic portal hypertension with portal vein atresia. Congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) are the most common PVA managed surgically. Cats with CPSS are generally considered to have a higher complication rate and poorer outcome than dogs. Hypothermia is reported as an early predictor of postoperative death in toy breeds. Systemic hypotension is a common problem during anesthesia and surgery for CPSS and is often multifactorial. Hypoglycemia occurs commonly in dogs with CPSS, particularly small breeds. Intraoperative bleeding is most commonly considered a complication of surgery for IHPSS, although the specific incidence of intraoperative hemorrhage in CPSS surgery is rarely reported. Hypoalbuminemia is a common biochemical abnormality in dogs with CPSS but is rarely reported in cats with CPSS. Status epilepticus is a devastating complication of surgery for CPSS.

AB  - Objectives To characterise the presentation, clinicopathologic data and outcome of 29 dogs with presumed primary renal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of medical records of dogs with suspected primary renal lymphoma from 11 institutions. Results All dogs were substage b, and lethargy and gastrointestinal signs were common presenting complaints, as were azotaemia (n=25; 86%) and erythrocytosis (n=15; 51%) on biochemical testing. Ultrasonography typically revealed bilateral renal lesions (n=23; 79%), renomegaly (n=22; 76%) and abdominal lymphadenopathy (n=14; 48%). Chemotherapy was the only treatment in 23 dogs, of which 11 responded, all considered partial responses. For all dogs the median progression-free survival and median overall survival times were 10 days (range: 1 to 126) and 12?days (range: 1 to 212), respectively, and for dogs that responded to chemotherapy 41?days (range: 10 to 126) and 47?days (range: 10 to 212), respectively. Clinical Significance Primary renal lymphoma in dogs appears to be associated with a poor prognosis and short-lived response to chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the perioperative findings and outcome of dogs undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the management of pyothorax. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?14). Methods Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. Results Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n?=?2), migrating plant material (n?=?2), and idiopathic (n?=?10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved. One patient had recurrence of a pyothorax requiring revision surgery 17 months postoperatively. Conclusion VATS allows minimally invasive treatment of uncomplicated canine pyothorax. Preoperative thoracic CT may help identify candidates for VATS among dogs with pyothorax.

AB  - ABSTRACT The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to evaluate the longitudinal change in cartilage T1? and T2 6- and 12-months after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) in both reconstructed and intact contralateral knees with the aim of validating the role of the contralateral knee as an internal control in longitudinal studies; (2) to explore relationships between bone shape at the time of injury and the progression of T1? and T2 over 12-months after ACLR. T1? and T2 cartilage relaxation times and 3D MRI-based statistical shape modeling (SSM) of tibia and femur were computed for both knees of forty ACL-injured patients and 15 healthy controls. ACL subjects were scanned 8.4?±?6.4 weeks after injury (2.4?±?3.7 weeks prior to ACLR), 6- and 12-months after ACLR. Longitudinal changes in T1? and T2 values were assessed using linear mixed model, and partial correlation coefficients were calculated between bone shape and longitudinal changes in T1? and T2 values. Significant longitudinal increases in T1? and T2 values were observed in reconstructed and contralateral knees 6-months after ACLR. Tibial bone shape features, associated with the medial plateau height and width, were observed to be correlated with cartilage T1? and T2 progression in reconstructed knees. Our results suggest that caution should be used in considering contralateral knee as internal controls in longitudinal ACL studies and 3D MRI-based-SSM might serve as an imaging biomarker for the early stratification of patients at risk for developing post-traumatic accelerated cartilage degeneration and potentially osteoarthritis after ACL tear. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Abstract Advances in high-throughput screening, together with rapid progress in genomic and proteomic sciences, have considerably stimulated the development of a variety of biomarker discovery tools and have contributed to the improvement of clinical diagnosis. Major challenges include the obtaining of high-quality data sets based on assays that are rapid, reliable, and inexpensive, but still highly sensitive and easy to perform. The microsphere-based flow cytometric technology is a platform that is currently entering the diagnostic market. This article reviews the development and the applications of microsphere-based flow cytometric platforms in basic and applied proteomic research, and discusses bead-based assays used in clinical applications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable. Sources of funding:?Massey University McGeorge fund; New Zealand Equine Research Foundation. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Objective To report clinical findings, perioperative complications and long-term outcome in dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy surgery for treatment of neoplasia. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?84) and cats (16). Methods Medical records (January 2000 to December 2009) of dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy at participating institutions were reviewed. Postoperative progress and current status of the patient at the time of the study was determined by either medical record review, or via telephone contact with the referring veterinarian or owner. Results Complications were infrequent and usually minor. Hemorrhage was the main intraoperative complication; 2 dogs required blood transfusion. One dog developed an incisional hernia. In dogs, hemangiosarcoma had the worst prognosis with a median survival time (MST) of 179 days. MST for chondrosarcoma (1232 days), osteosarcoma (533 days), and soft tissue sarcoma (373 days) were not statistically different. Median disease-free interval (DFI) for local recurrence of all tumor types was 257 days. Cats had 75% survival at 1 year, which was significantly longer than dogs. Conclusions Survival times for most tumor types can be good, but surgical margins should be carefully evaluated to ensure complete tumor removal. Adjuvant therapies may be advisable particularly for dogs to reduce rates of local recurrence or distant metastasis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the outcome and prognostic variables associated with long-term survival and complications in dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Sixty-one client-owned dogs with central division masses. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2015 were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, preoperative staging, preoperative cytology or biopsy results, date of procedure, location of mass, surgical technique, whether cholecystectomy or cholecystopexy was performed, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and margin evaluation, date of local recurrence or detection of metastatic disease, and survival. Results Hilar resection was associated with increased intraoperative and postoperative complications. Intraoperative complications occurred in 29 dogs, with 20 dogs experiencing intraoperative hemorrhage. Nineteen dogs required transfusions. Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 20 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 11%, and 2-week mortality rate was 14.7%. The median survival time for dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not reached. The 1- and 3-year censored survival rates for dogs with HCC was 82.1% and 82.1%, respectively. Margin status did not impact survival time. Conclusion Hepatic lobectomy of the central division was associated with hemorrhage in approximately 33% of dogs, but there was a relatively low perioperative mortality rate. Hepatic lobectomy for HCC resulted in long-term survival, regardless of margin status. Clinical significance Surgeons should anticipate the requirement for blood products in dogs that may require hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Long-term survival can be expected after surgical treatment of HCC, regardless of margin status.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the clinical characteristics, perioperative complications, and outcomes in dogs surgically treated for gastric carcinoma. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Forty client-owned dogs with histologically confirmed gastric carcinoma. Methods Medical records were reviewed for preoperative diagnostics, surgery, histopathology, postoperative complications, adjuvant chemotherapy, disease progression, and survival. Variables were assessed for associations with outcome by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results Surgical treatment included partial gastrectomy (28 dogs), Billroth I (9 dogs), subtotal gastrectomy (2 dogs), and submucosal resection (1 dog). Major postoperative complications occurred in 8 of 40 dogs, including septic peritonitis secondary to dehiscence in 4 dogs. The median progression free interval was 54?days, and the median survival time (MST) was 178?days (range, 1?1902). According to multivariable analysis results, experiencing an intraoperative complication was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.1?9.8, P = .005), and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy correlated with an improved survival (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2?0.9, P = .03). Conclusion In this population of dogs, MST exceeded historically reported data, major postoperative complication rates were comparable to established literature, and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival. Clinical significance Results from this study may be used to counsel owners more accurately regarding prognosis for dogs undergoing surgical excision for gastric carcinoma.

AB  - Background Multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) is reported as a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. Recently, continuous blood purification (CBP) has been mostly applied for MODS treatment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CBP on plasma phospholipid level in patients with MODS. Methods A total of 126 patients with MODS and 120 healthy people were collected. The serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes were detected, and the correlation among phospholipid compounds with serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes was analyzed. Results Before CBP, levels of body temperature, RR, HR, CVP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 were obviously higher, and pH, HCO3-, PaO2, SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 were lower in the MODS group than those in the control group. During CBP, the MODS group had gradually declined RR, CVP, levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 and increased HCO3-, PaO2 and SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747. Besides, levels of PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 had an obvious negative correlation with levels of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, BUN, SCr, and PaCO2, and a significant positive correlation with levels of HCO3-, PaO2, and SaO2. Conclusion CBP could effectively ameliorate clinical signs of patients with MODS and correct the plasma phospholipid levels.

AB  - Objective To examine perioperative mortality, long-term survival, causes of death, and prognostic factors for dogs and cats undergoing surgical excision of thymic epithelial tumors (TETs). Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Eighty dogs and 32 cats. Methods Follow-up information was obtained for dogs and cats that underwent surgical excision of a TET between 2001 and 2012. Results Perioperative mortality was 20% in dogs and 22% in cats. No independent risk factors for perioperative mortality were identified. The estimated median survival time for all dogs was 1.69 years (95% CI 0.56?4.32) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 55% (95% CI 44?67) and 44% (95% CI 32?56). The estimated median survival time for all cats was 3.71 years (95% CI 0.56-unestimatable) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 70% (95% CI 53?87) and 47% (95% CI 0?100). Of animals that survived to discharge, 42% of dogs and 20% of cats eventually died of TET-related causes. The presence of paraneoplastic syndromes (hazard ratio [HR] 5.78, 95% CI 1.64?20.45, P?=?.007) or incomplete histologic margins (HR 6.09, 95% CI 1.50?24.72, P?=?.01) were independently associated with decreased survival in dogs. No significant predictors of survival were identified in cats. Conclusions regarding the effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy could not be made. Conclusions While there is substantial risk of perioperative death in dogs and cats undergoing surgery for TETs, many animals that survive to discharge have prolonged survival. Survival is significantly decreased in dogs with paraneoplastic syndromes or incomplete histologic margins.
