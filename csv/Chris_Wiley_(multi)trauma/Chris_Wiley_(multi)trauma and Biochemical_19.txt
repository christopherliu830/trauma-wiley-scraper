AB  - Abstract Pulpal healing patterns were studied in a clinical material of 637 luxated and 95 root-fractured permanent incisors followed routinely for up to 11 years. It was found that pulpal healing patterns could generally be divided into 3 groups according to the degree of injury sustained by the pulp: little, moderate or severe. Thus after luxation injuries, pulp survival could be without radiographic change (PS), with pulp canal obliteration (PCO) or nonhealing (pulp necrosis (PN)). After root fracture, similar healing patterns could be observed: healing by hard tissue union of fragments (HT), by connective tissue union of fragments (CT) or by nonunion due to interposition of granulation tissue between fragments (GT) resulting from PN of the coronal fragment. In both trauma situations, healing or nonhealing could be determined by type of luxation injury, stage of root development and type of fixation used (forceful application of orthodontic bands vs. passively applied acid-etch fixation). Pulpal healing complications (PN or GT) were based on clinical findings (coronal discoloration, loss of pulpal sensibility) and radiographic findings (resorption processes of the lamina dura at the root apex or at the level of the root fracture). However, in both injury groups the same changes could also be seen to be intermediate steps in the pulpal healing process. Based on findings from these studies, hypotheses for the mechanics of pulpal healing are proposed as well as guidelines for acute and later treatment of dental luxations, root fractures and the diagnosis of healing complications.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC), the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppressive agents, plays a crucial role in new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT). Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the ? cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC-induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/AKT and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (eg, PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (odds ratio = 2.692, P = .023, n = 135). Integrating grafts? CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs 0.79, P = .048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces ?hematogenous diabetes? via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To evaluate the activity and tolerability of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma that were ineligible for surgical resection or with owners who declined surgical resection, and underwent 3D-CRT were retrospectively reviewed. 6 to 10 Gy per fraction was prescribed at isocentre of planning target volume to a total dose of 18 to 42 Gy with 1 to 2 fractions per week for a total of 3 to 7 fractions. Follow-up examinations included physical examination, contrast-enhanced CT scan and blood analysis (complete blood count, electrolytes and serum biochemical panel). RESULTS The median follow-up time after 3D-CRT was 534 (range, 281 to 1057) days. An objective response was observed in five of six cases. Radiation-induced liver disease developed in one dog but was asymptomatic and reversible. Toxicity was not noted in any other dog. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE 3D-CRT appears to be a viable treatment option for dogs with inoperable massive hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Abstract In cartilage regeneration, the biomimetic functionalization of hydrogels with growth factors is a promising approach to improve the in vivo performance and furthermore the clinical potential of these materials. In order to achieve this without compromising network properties, multifunctional linear poly(glycidol) acrylate (PG-Acr) is synthesized and utilized as crosslinker for hydrogel formation with thiol-functionalized hyaluronic acid via Michael-type addition. As proof-of-principle for a bioactivation, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-?1) is covalently bound to PG-Acr via Traut's reagent which does not compromise the hydrogel gelation and swelling behavior. Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) embedded within these bioactive hydrogels show a distinct dose-dependent chondrogenesis. Covalent incorporation of TGF-?1 significantly enhances the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs compared to hydrogels with supplemented noncovalently bound TGF-?1. The observed chondrogenic response is similar to standard cell culture with TGF-?1 addition with each medium change. In general, multifunctional PG-Acr offers the opportunity to introduce a range of biomimetic modifications (peptides, growth factors) into hydrogels and, thus, appears as an attractive potential material for various applications in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract The human blood coagulation system comprises a series of linked glycoproteins that upon activation induce the generation of downstream enzymes ultimately forming fibrin. This process is primarily important to arrest bleeding (hemostasis). Hemostasis is a typical example of a molecular machine, where the assembly of substrates, enzymes, protein cofactors and calcium ions on a phospholipid surface markedly accelerates the rate of coagulation. Excess, pathological, coagulation activity occurs in ?thrombosis?, the formation of an intravascular clot, which in the most dramatic form precipitates in the microvasculature as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Thrombosis occurs according to a biochemical machine model in the case of atherothrombosis on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, but may develop at a slower rate in venous thrombosis, illustrating that the coagulation machinery can act at different velocities. The separate coagulation enzymes are also important in other biological processes, including inflammation for which the rapid conversion of one coagulation factor by the other is not a prerequisite. The latter role of coagulation enzymes may be related to the old and probably maintained function of the coagulation machine in innate immunity.

AB  - Abstract In vitro models of traumatic injury are useful adjuncts to animal models for studying mechanisms of post-traumatic cell death. Here we describe a new in vitro model in which reproducible levels of injury are delivered by a punch device that produces 28 parallel cuts in individual wells of 96-well microplates. Cell loss is measured by LDH assay or quantitative fluorometric assay for ethidium homodimer staining. Glial cultures show cell death restricted to the initial injury site, whereas neuronal/glial cultures demonstrate substantial spread of cell loss over time. We used this model to examine the role of pH and NMDA receptors in delayed post-traumatic injury. NMDA receptor blockade by dizocilpine (MK-801) or treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against NMDAR1 was neuroprotective. Decreased cell death was observed under acidic conditions whereas increased extracellular pH was associated with increased, MK-801 sensitive cell loss. Advantages of our model include: reproducible trauma induction; rapid measurements of cell injury; and use of 96-well microplates which reduce time and cost. This model appears to be well-suited for the study of selected mechanisms of post-traumatic neuronal injury as well as for screening potential neuroprotective agents. J. Neurosci.

AB  - The Ehlers?Danlos syndromes (EDSs) comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases, characterized by fragility of the soft connective tissues and widespread manifestations in skin, ligaments, joints, blood vessels and internal organs. The clinical spectrum varies from mild skin and joint hyperlaxity to severe physical disability and life-threatening vascular complications. The current Villefranche classification recognizes six subtypes, most of which are linked to mutations in genes encoding fibrillar collagens or enzymes involved in post-translational modification of these proteins. Mutations in type V and type III collagen cause classic or vascular EDS respectively, while mutations involving the processing of type I collagen are involved in the kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasis and dermatosparaxis type of EDS. Establishing the correct EDS subtype has important implications for genetic counseling and management and is supported by specific biochemical and molecular investigations. Over the last years, several new EDS variants have been characterized which call for a refinement of the Villefranche classification. Moreover, the study of these diseases has brought new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EDS by implicating genetic defects in the biosynthesis of other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, such as proteoglycans and tenascin-X, or genetic defects in molecules involved in intracellular trafficking, secretion and assembly of ECM proteins.

AB  - Abstract Objective To define and compare clinical characteristics of canine primary appendicular hemangiosarcoma (HSA) and telangiectatic osteosarcoma (tOSA), including signalment, presentation, response to treatment, and prognosis. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Seventy dogs with primary appendicular HSA or tOSA. Methods Patient data were obtained from institutions' medical records. Immunohistochemistry was applied to archived tissues to establish tumor type. Patient characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes were described and compared by tumor type. Results Forty-one HSA and 29 tOSA were identified. Dogs with HSA were more likely than dogs with tOSA to be male and have hind limb tumors; 78% of HSA occurred in hind limbs, particularly the tibia. Dogs with tOSA weighed a median of 9.9?kg (95% CI 4.6-15.3) more than dogs with HSA. Most dogs received antineoplastic treatment, predominantly amputation with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall survival with local treatment and chemotherapy was 299 days (95% CI 123-750) for HSA and 213 days (95% CI 77-310) for tOSA. Younger age and more aggressive treatment were associated with longer survival in dogs with HSA but not tOSA. One-year survival rates did not differ between dogs with HSA (28%) and those with tOSA (7%). Conclusion Distinct clinical features were identified between HSA and tOSA in this population. Both tumors were aggressive, with a high incidence of pulmonary metastases. However, local treatment combined with chemotherapy led to an average survival 7 months for tOSA and 10 months for HSA. Clinical significance HSA should be considered as a differential in dogs with aggressive lytic bone lesions, particularly medium-sized dogs with tibial lesions. HSA has a unique clinical presentation but similar therapeutic response and outcome to OSA. Amputation and chemotherapy appear to prolong survival in some dogs with HSA and tOSA.

AB  - Abstract This chapter presents a systematic summary overview of coordinated efforts taking place at the environmental bioinformatics and Computational Toxicology Center (ebCTC.org) towards developing a mechanistic modeling framework that integrates multiple scales of coupled toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic processes. This framework employs highly modular ?whole body? computational descriptions of the human and of selected model organisms that incorporate a hierarchy of alternative formulations representing biological events in ?virtual? tissues and organs. This approach allows the mechanistic consideration of multiple scales of interlinked phenomena that include molecular interactions; dynamics of intracellular biomolecular networks; spatial and stochastic aspects of cell biochemistry; integrative coupling of cellular-level processes related to common endpoints; extracellular signaling and cell-cell communication and interaction; aspects of functional heterogeneity in multicellular structures; dynamics of histomorphological and histopathological processes at the tissue level; and integrative coupling of processes across scales, resulting in different physiosystem phenotypes for health and disease states. The ebCTC framework offers a range of combined approaches for coupling processes and ?transferring and integrating? information across multiple strata of biological organization, ranging from formal methods of multiscale analysis, including statistical descriptions of multicellular kinetics and dynamics, to simplified ?top-down? approaches, incorporating both mechanistic and phenomenological formulations that rely on point and distributional parameterizations of the finer scales. The computational implementation of the framework employs a combination of agent-, network-, and field-based modeling methods. Example applications of various components of this framework are presented, spanning the range from molecular interactions to bionetwork and cellular dynamics to multiscale problems at the tissue and organ levels.

AB  - Abstract:? Tragically as many as 50% of pheochromocytomas are discovered at autopsy, mainly because the diagnosis of this neuroendocrine tumor was not considered. Missing the diagnosis almost invariably results in devastating cardiovascular complications or death. Clinicians must always think of pheochromocytoma whenever evaluating a patient with sustained or paroxysmal hypertension or any manifestations suggesting hypercatecholaminemia. Very rarely, familial pheochromocytomas may cause no hypertension, symptoms, or signs. But biochemical testing can always establish the presence or absence of a pheochromocytoma, and localization with magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or 131I or 123I-MIBG is almost always possible.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - Summary A 24-hour-old male Shetland pony was presented for evaluation of unilateral hindlimb lameness of unknown duration. Physical and radiographic findings confirmed a diagnosis of medial luxation of the patella. A traumatic or congenital aetiology was suspected but could not be confirmed. Surgical correction of the luxation, using a modified recession trochleoplasty technique, was carried out. At 6 months follow-up, no discernbile lameness could be observed. In the literature, descriptions of medially luxated patellae in equids are rare. Published reports describing the use of peri- and intra-articular surgical techiques for the correction of luxated patellae in equids are widely available. The modified recession trochleoplasty employed in this case may offer advantages over previously published techniques.

AB  - Summary Disorders of branched-chain amino/keto acid metabolism encompass diverse entities, including maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), the ?classical? organic acidurias isovaleric acidemia (IVA), propionic acidemia (PA), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and, among others, rarely described disorders such as 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MBDD) or isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBDD). Our focus in this review is to highlight the biochemical basis underlying recent advances and ongoing challenges of long-term conservative therapy including precursor/protein restriction, replenishment of deficient substrates, and the use of antioxidants and anaplerotic agents which refill the Krebs cycle. Ongoing clinical assessments of affected individuals in conjunction with monitoring of disease-specific biochemical parameters remain essential. It is likely that mass spectrometry-based ?metabolomics? may be a helpful tool in the future for studying complete biochemical profiles and diverse metabolic phenotypes. Prospective studies are needed to test the effectiveness of adjunct therapies such as antioxidants, ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) or creatine in addition to specialized diets and to optimize current therapeutic strategies in affected individuals. With the individual life-time risk and degree of severity being unknown in asymptomatic individuals with MBDD or IBDD, instructions regarding risks for metabolic stress and fasting avoidance along with clinical monitoring are reasonable interventions at the current time. Overall, it is apparent that carefully designed prospective clinical investigations and multicenter cohort-controlled trials are needed in order to leverage that knowledge into significant breakthroughs in treatment strategies and appropriate approaches.

On his way back to his home in Kamakura, he stopped in Kyoto. He came under severe criticism for ?sightseeing? at such a time. This comment was his response.) The introduction explains why we should take him seriously as a commentator on art. The body of the article examines why our looking at art might be more, not less, important after the post-War situation, the kinds of art Kawabata might have meant, why some possibilities are more likely than others, and how they differ in what they offer us and the value of art under conditions of trauma and mass trauma.

AB  - Abstract Mospd1 codes for a small protein with unknown physiological function, which is part of a family of genes, including Mospd2 and Mospd3, defined by the presence of the major sperm protein domain and two transmembrane domains. This work characterizes the Mospd1 gene, the intracellular location of the protein and its expression in different mouse tissues and mesenchymal cell lines during differentiation. The role of Mospd1 in mesenchymal cellular differentiation was studied by siRNA knockdown experiments in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Transfection experiments of the targeted cDNA show MOSPD1 located in the endoplasmatic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus. Removal of the last exon of the gene resulted in localization of the protein in the nucleus, which was attributed to a nuclear export sequence in the N-terminal part. In mouse tissues the gene was generally strongly expressed while mesenchymal tissues showed the highest expression. In mesenchymal cell lines Mospd1 mRNA was higher expressed in cells with advanced differentiation status. In osteoblastic, myoblastic, and adipocytic cell lines Mospd1 was up-regulated during differentiation. Genome-wide gene expression analysis after knockdown of Mospd1 by siRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells revealed a shift in the gene expression pattern from mesenchymal to epithelial genes featuring up-regulation of the epithelial cadherin Cdh1 and down-regulation of its inhibitors Snail1 and 2 and the mesenchymal cadherin Cdh11, suggesting a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. From these data we conclude that Mospd1 plays a pivotal role in the developmental regulation at the switch between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. J. Cell.

AB  - An 18-month-old European shorthair cat was presented with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory tetraparesis, moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions. Bilateral facial and nasal hypalgesia, absent menace response and anisocoria were found, and segmental spinal reflexes were normal. Neurological signs progressed to non-ambulatory tetraparesis, tremor and spinal hyperalgesia. Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neurons and axons were preserved. Lesions were multi-focal and varied in severity. A predominantly sensory polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed. This lesion has not been reported previously in cats. Rabies, herpesviruses, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline leukaemia virus were excluded as possible aetiologies. Infections by other viruses or an autoimmune disease are discussed.

AB  - Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to certain common brain pathologies (e.g., ischemia, stroke, and trauma) believed to facilitate its development and progression. One of the logical approaches to this problem is to study the effects of ischemia and hypoxia on the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein, which plays one of the key roles in the pathogenesis of AD. This involves an analysis of (1) proteases, which participate in proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein either by the nonamyloidogenic route (α-secretase) or the amyloidogenic pathway and lead to formation of toxic ?-amyloid peptides (?- and ?-secretases) and (2) several metallopeptidases that might play a role in degradation of ?-amyloid peptide (A?). The study of the effects of prenatal hypoxia and acute hypoxia in adult animals allowed us to conclude that oxygen deprivation results not only in an increase of amyloid precursor protein expression in the brain but also in a decrease in the activity of α-secretase. In some brain structures involved in AD pathology (the cortex and striatum), we also observed a decrease in the expression of two of the A? degrading enzymes, neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme, after hypoxia. A decrease in expression of these metalloproteases was also observed in the model of four-vessel occlusion ischemia in rats with their restoration to the control levels after reperfusion. Preconditioning to mild hypoxia both in the prenatal period and in adults appeared to have a neuroprotective effect restoring, in particular, the levels of amyloid precursor protein, activity of a-secretase, and expression of neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme to their control values.

AB  - Abstract Background This study compares diamond burs and curettes by clinical, microbiological, biochemical and scanning electron microscopic parameters and treatment time data in the non-surgical periodontal treatment of patients with chronic periodontitis. Methods Two quadrants of each of the 12 patients received root planing with diamond burs, whereas the other two quadrants were treated with curettes. Clinical periodontal measurements were recorded at baseline and then 1, 3 and 6 months after completion of non-surgical periodontal treatment. Subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained at baseline and 1-month control. Twenty-one hopeless teeth received root planing with diamond burs or curettes or no treatment and then extracted for microscopic evaluations. Results Clinical periodontal parameters improved similarly with both treatment modalities. Microbiological analyses revealed similar findings for the bacterial load (16S gene copy numbers) and ratio of each bacterium to the total bacterial count at baseline and 1-month control. Cytokine levels in the gingival crevicular fluid samples exhibited differences between the two treatments. Scanning electron microscopic analyses indicated that diamond burs were better in terms of calculus removal and loss of tooth substance indices but roughness index values were better for curettes. Conclusions Diamond burs provide findings comparable with curettes in root planing.
