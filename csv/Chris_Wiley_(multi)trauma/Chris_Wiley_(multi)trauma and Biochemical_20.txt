AB  - Abstract Accumulated evidences indicate intestinal lesions play an important role in the pathogenesis of heatstroke. However, the underlying mechanisms by which heat stress causes intestinal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) in heat stress-induced intestinal hyper-permeability and bacterial translocation. Intestinal permeability in heat stressed mouse was evaluated by determining plasma endotoxin concentration and urinal lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio with gastric administration of L/M solution. Venous blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tissues were collected for bacterial load test. Real time PCR was used to determine ileum PAR1 mRNA expression. In vitro study, permeability was assessed by determining trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human intestinal Caco-2 cell line. RWJ-58259, a selective antagonist of PAR1, was used both in vivo and in vitro studies. The results showed that heat stress could increase ileum PAR1 mRNA level, urinal L/M ratio, plasma endotoxin concentration and bacterial load in the blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Blocking PAR1 with RWJ-58259 (10?mg/kg) pretreatment could significantly reduce heat stress-induced above changes, but have no role to PAR1 mRNA level. In Caco-2 cells, heat stress-induced high permeability could also be reduced by RWJ-58259 (5?20?µmol/L). In summary, our results demonstrated that PAR1 signaling pathway may play an important role in the heat stress-induced elevation of intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation and the occurrence of endotoxemia.

AB  - Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to certain common brain pathologies (e.g., ischemia, stroke, and trauma) believed to facilitate its development and progression. One of the logical approaches to this problem is to study the effects of ischemia and hypoxia on the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein, which plays one of the key roles in the pathogenesis of AD. This involves an analysis of (1) proteases, which participate in proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein either by the nonamyloidogenic route (α-secretase) or the amyloidogenic pathway and lead to formation of toxic ?-amyloid peptides (?- and ?-secretases) and (2) several metallopeptidases that might play a role in degradation of ?-amyloid peptide (A?). The study of the effects of prenatal hypoxia and acute hypoxia in adult animals allowed us to conclude that oxygen deprivation results not only in an increase of amyloid precursor protein expression in the brain but also in a decrease in the activity of α-secretase. In some brain structures involved in AD pathology (the cortex and striatum), we also observed a decrease in the expression of two of the A? degrading enzymes, neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme, after hypoxia. A decrease in expression of these metalloproteases was also observed in the model of four-vessel occlusion ischemia in rats with their restoration to the control levels after reperfusion. Preconditioning to mild hypoxia both in the prenatal period and in adults appeared to have a neuroprotective effect restoring, in particular, the levels of amyloid precursor protein, activity of a-secretase, and expression of neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme to their control values.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and strength due to excessive loss of bone protein and mineral content. The imbalance between osteogenesis by osteoblasts and osteoclastogenesis by osteoclasts contributes to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Estrogen withdrawal leads to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Overactivated osteoclasts by inflammation play a vital role in the imbalance. Matrine is an alkaloid found in plants from the Sophora genus with various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory activity. Here we demonstrate that matrine significantly prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vivo with decreased serum levels of TRAcp5b, TNF-α, and IL-6. In vitro matrine significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator for NF-?B ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF in bone marrow monocytes and RAW264.7 cells as demonstrated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and actin-ring formation as well as bone resorption through pit formation assays. For molecular mechanisms, matrine abrogated RANKL-induced activation of NF-?B, AKT, and MAPK pathways and suppressed osteoclastogenesis-related marker expression, including matrix metalloproteinase 9, NFATc1, TRAP, C-Src, and cathepsin K. Our study demonstrates that matrine inhibits osteoclastogenesis through modulation of multiple pathways and that matrine is a promising agent in the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases such as osteoporosis.?Chen, X., Zhi, X., Pan, P., Cui, J., Cao, L., Weng, W., Zhou, Q., Wang, L., Zhai, X.

AB  - Significant progress has been made in the development of in vitro-engineered skin substitutes that mimic human skin, either to be used for the replacement of lost skin or for the establishment of in vitro skin research models. However, at the present time, there are no models of bioengineered skin that completely replicate the nature of uninjured skin. Obviously, there is still much room for improvement of the components of bioengineered skin and their interplay. This review summarises the important new discoveries in key elements of engineering of tissue-engineered skin including cell sources, biomaterials and growth factors, etc. Furthermore, basic and clinical applications for engineered skin substitutes in cell therapy, tissue engineering, and biomedical research continue to drive design improvements premised on these structure and function-based engineering paradigms.

We begin the chapter with a discussion of the epidemiology of PXE, and then present clinical aspects. Next, we consider the initial diagnosis of PXE, as well as prenatal diagnosis and diagnostic tests. Since PXE is a genetically predetermined disorder, we present extensive discussion of genetic factors. Later, we discuss the three biochemical abnormalities recognized in PXE. The chapter concludes with a section on the management of the PXE followed by a discussion of recent developments.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents veterinary management strategies and diagnostic findings in the reintroduction of the endangered whooping crane (Grus americana). Between 2005 and 2010, 63 (27 male, 36 female) hatchling whooping cranes were assigned to a reintroduction project involving autumn release of costume-reared chicks in Wisconsin. Veterinary care included preventive measures and comprehensive pre-release evaluations to improve fitness and reduce translocation of potential disease agents to native habitats. A total of 44 clinically normal birds were released (70% of assigned individuals). Cases of morbidity were classified according to primary body system affected. Musculoskeletal disorders were described in 57 birds (90%); five birds were removed from the project prior to release (8%), all for abnormalities that prevented normal function. Fourteen birds died or were euthanized prior to release (22%); pre-release mortality was attributed to developmental abnormality, predation, trauma or infectious disease. Chronic respiratory aspergillosis, diagnosed in seven birds (11%), was the most common infectious disease of concern. Predation and trauma were primary causes of post-release mortality; no evidence of infectious disease of captive origin was detected in the study population by the end of 2010. The assessment of data accumulated by this project helped to outline successful health management strategies, as well as identify and mitigate ongoing risks to captive whooping cranes that impede reintroduction efforts and achieving management goals for species recovery.

AB  - Haemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved, prioritizing the early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while haemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy. Haemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells (RBCs) in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Transfusion of RBCs, plasma and platelets in a similar proportion as in whole blood prevents both hypovolaemia and coagulopathy. Although an early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Results from recent before-and-after studies in massively bleeding patients indicate that trauma exsanguination protocols involving the early administration of plasma and platelets are associated with improved survival. Furthermore, viscoelastic whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG)/rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe haemorrhage, as opposed to conventional coagulation assays. In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of its cause, should be treated with goal-directed haemostatic control resuscitation involving the early administration of plasma and platelets and based on the results of the TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal haemostatic competence until surgical haemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 5.3 million people in the United States, and there are 12,500 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) every year. There is yet a significant need for in vitro models of TBI and SCI in order to understand the biological mechanisms underlying central nervous system (CNS) injury and to identify and test therapeutics to aid in recovery from neuronal injuries. While TBI or SCI studies have been aided with traditional in vivo and in vitro models, the innate limitations in specificity of injury, isolation of neuronal regions, and reproducibility of these models can decrease their usefulness in examining the neurobiology of injury. Microfluidic devices provide several advantages over traditional methods by allowing researchers to (1) examine the effect of injury on specific neural components, (2) fluidically isolate neuronal regions to examine specific effects on subcellular components, and (3) reproducibly create a variety of injuries to model TBI and SCI. These microfluidic devices are adaptable for modeling a wide range of injuries, and in this review, we will examine different methodologies and models recently utilized to examine neuronal injury. Specifically, we will examine vacuum-assisted axotomy, physical injury, chemical injury, and laser-based axotomy. Finally, we will discuss the benefits and downsides to each type of injury model and discuss how researchers can use these parameters to pick a particular microfluidic device to model CNS injury.

AB  - The integrity of human skin is central to the prevention of infection. Acute and chronic wounds can develop when the integrity of skin as a barrier to infection is disrupted. As a multi-functional organ, skin possesses important biochemical and physical properties that influence its microbiology. These properties include a slightly acidic pH, a low moisture content, a high lipid content (which results in increased hydrophobicity) and the presence of antimicrobial peptides. Such factors have a role to play in preventing exogenous microbial colonisation and subsequent infection. In addition, the properties of skin both select for and enhance colonisation and biofilm formation by certain ?beneficial? micro-organisms. These beneficial micro-organisms can provide further protection against colonisation by potential pathogens, a process known as colonisation resistance. The aim of this paper is to summarise the microflora of skin and wounds, highlighting the role of certain micro-organisms and biofilms in associated infections.

AB  - Summary Splenectomy is performed for primary or, less frequently, metastatic malignant tumors, spleen torsion, splenomegaly associated to infiltrative disease, traumatic rupture, and immune-mediated diseases. Splenectomy may be performed as 'open surgery' or laparoscopically. The most common early complication of splenectomy is hemorrhage, associated or not with hemostatic abnormalities. Early complications also include damage to the left pancreatic lobe and gastric wall because of devascularization and acute infection. Arrhythmias are abnormal rhythms of the heart, causing a less effective cardiac output. Arrhythmias, usually in form of rapid ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular arrhythmia, are reported in dogs undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors, torsion, and benign splenomegaly. Continuous monitoring is acceptable when neither significant pulse deficit nor clinical signs are evident. Only symptomatic dogs with no perceptible femoral pulse, multifocal ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia, and hypoperfusion or preexisting cardiac disease should receive medical therapy.

AB  - Abstract Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a widely used clinical anesthetic with proven anti-inflammatory effects. Both high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and pyroptosis play an important role in the inflammatory response to infection and trauma. Thus far, there have been no studies published addressing the effect of DEX on HMGB1 and pyroptosis. In order to fill this gap in the literature, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were exposed to HMGB1 (4?µg/mL) with or without DEX (50??M) pretreatment. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1? (IL-1?), and IL-18], phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and P38, and the activation of caspase-1 were measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, confocal microscope, and flow cytometry, respectively. We found that DEX protected against HMGB1-induced cell death of BMDMs. In addition, DEX suppressed the generation of TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-18 as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. Moreover, DEX inhibited caspase-1 activation and decreased pyroptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the protective effect of DEX in mediating HMGB1-induced cellular injury, thus indicating that DEX may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of infection and trauma-derived inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the effect of acepromazine (ACP) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by stimulated equine neutrophils. Study design? Ex vivo biochemical experiments. Animals? Isolated neutrophils from healthy untreated horses. Methods? Neutrophils were incubated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m and then stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) before measurement of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). In a second experiment neutrophils were incubated in the presence of α-keto-? methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) and treated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m. Subsequent PMA stimulation lead to neutrophilic ROS production and decomposition of KMB to ethylene, which is measured by gas chromatography. Electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping (EPR) analysis was performed with PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the presence of ACP (10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m) directly added to the cell suspension. In the second experiment, the same concentrations of ACP were pre-incubated with neutrophils, then centrifuged to eliminate the excess of ACP and re-suspended in phosphate buffer before stimulation with PMA. In all experiments, the results of ACP-treated and ACP-untreated stimulated neutrophils were compared. Results? Overall, results obtained with lucigenin-enhanced CL and KMB oxidation were in agreement with those seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Acepromazine induced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on neutrophilic ROS production. Electron paramagnetic resonance also showed, at high ACP concentration, the appearance of a cation radical derived from ACP. In contrast, electron paramagnetic resonance study performed with pre-incubated neutrophils showed an important dose-dependent inhibitory effect of ACP. Conclusion? The results indicate that ACP can neutralize O??2 or its by-products during the stimulation of neutrophils. Clinical relevance? These findings may have a therapeutic relevance when phenothiazines are used in horses suffering from inflammatory diseases in which neutrophil activation and ROS production are implicated.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed with a single port access system (SPAS) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective study. Animals Fifteen client-owned dogs with nonobstructive gallbladder disease. Methods Medical records were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, and outcome until suture removal. Results The SPAS was placed 1?cm caudal to the umbilicus. The procedure was completed with the SPAS alone in two cases. An additional cannula was added in 12 cases. In the last 10 cases, the additional cannula was placed at the beginning of the procedure. Dissection began at the cystic duct in 11 dogs (73%). In three cases (20%), the SPAS procedure was converted to a laparotomy; two of these conversions were elective, and one was emergent. The risk of conversion was affected by the experience of the surgeon (odds ratio = 0.53; P = .0105), and the rate of conversion was reduced when a cannula was added at the beginning of the procedure (P = .022). Fourteen dogs were discharged from the hospital. One dog died after being discharged due to severe cholangiohepatitis, and another dog died due to leakage of a gastrostomy tube. Conclusions The use of SPAS for cholecystectomy in dogs has an acceptable outcome. The experience gained by the surgeon and the addition of a cannula reduced the risk of conversion. Clinical Relevance/Impact Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed with a SPAS. The placement of an additional cannula at the beginning of the procedure is highly recommended.

AB  - A four-year-old, entire male domestic cat was referred for assessment of a large abdominal mass of three-weeks duration. Diagnostic imaging suggested the presence of either splenic neoplasia, an abdominal abscess or haematoma. A coeliotomy was performed and an enlarged, irregular mass, including the left kidney and adrenal gland, was identified. The mass was removed, requiring a left adrenalo-uretero-nephrectomy. The aorta was accidentally punctured during the procedure, resulting in paraplegia. Given a poor prognosis, the owners decided to have the cat euthanased. Histological examination of the mass was characteristic of a chronic expanding haematoma.

AB  - Objective Disruption to endochondral ossification leads to delayed and irregular bone formation and can result in a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders known as osteochondrodysplasias. These genetic disorders arise through disturbances in the complex processes of skeletal growth causing development of unsightly skeletal deformities. Methods? Each syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of detailed clinical and radiographic assessment. Lower limb deformities were the prime presenting feature. Results Here are presented three patients with diverse genetic syndromes, namely Wolcott?Rallison syndrome (WRS), Kniest dysplasia (KD) and Desbuquois dysplasia (DS). Genetic testing was performed in the patients with WRS and DS. The diagnosis of KD was made purely on a clinical and radiographic basis. Variable orthopaedic interventions to realign these patients' lower limbs were implemented with the aim of improving their balance and gait. Conclusions The aim of this paper is twofold. The first part is to outline the importance of diagnosing the causes of various skeletal abnormalities in patients with osteochondrodysplasias by phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The second part is to demonstrate our techniques for surgical corrections in patients with joint laxity and malalignment and show how far techniques for growth modulation, re-alignment and ligament reconstruction have advanced.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.
