AB  - Abstract Microcirculatory dysfunction is a critical element of the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock. In this Bench-to-Bedside review, we present: 1) the central role of the microcirculation in the pathophysiology of sepsis; 2) new translational research techniques of in vivo video microscopy for assessment of microcirculatory flow in human subjects; 3) clinical investigations that reported associations between microcirculatory dysfunction and outcome in septic patients; 4) the potential role of novel agents to ?rescue? the microcirculation in sepsis; 5) current challenges facing this emerging field of clinical investigation; and 6) a framework for the design of future clinical trials aimed to determine the impact of novel agents on microcirculatory flow and organ failure in patients with sepsis. We specifically focus this review on the central role and vital importance of the nitric oxide (NO) molecule in maintaining microcirculatory homeostasis and patency, especially when the microcirculation sustains an insult (as with sepsis). We also present the scientific rationale for clinical trials of exogenous NO administration to treat microcirculatory dysfunction and augment microcirculatory blood flow in early sepsis therapy.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9.

AB  - Abstract Background Recent studies provide evidence for significant and previously underestimated barrier damaging effects of repeated exposure to 60% n-propanol in healthy skin in vivo. Objectives To investigate further the cumulative effects of a range of n-propanol concentrations relevant at the workplace in healthy and atopic dermatitis (AD) individuals, and study the modulation of the outcomes by co-exposure and host-related factors. Methods Healthy adult and AD volunteers were exposed to n-propanol concentrations from 30% to 75% in occlusion-modified tandem repeated irritation test with measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss, capacitance, and the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels at baseline and after 96?hours. Results n-Propanol exerted significant barrier damaging effects even at the lowest concentration in both groups. Exposure to all n-propanol concentrations significantly reduced the NMF levels. Preceding low-grade trauma by occlusion/water exposure reduced the skin irritation threshold in both groups. The differences in the severity of the barrier function impairment after exposure to the same concentrations under the same conditions between the AD and control groups were significant. Conclusions The negative effects of cumulative exposure to n-propanol in healthy and atopic skin shown in the study suggest the need for critical re-evaluation of its irritant properties in vivo.

AB  - Abstract Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy (CN) is one of the most challenging foot complications in diabetes. Common predisposing and precipitating factors include neuropathy and increased mechanical forces, fracture and bone resorption, trauma and inflammation. In the last 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the early recognition of the acute Charcot foot when the X ray is still negative (stage 0 or incipient Charcot foot). Recent advances in imaging modalities have enabled the detection of initial signs of inflammation and underlying bone damage before overt bone and joint destruction has occurred. Casting therapy remains the mainstay of medical therapy of acute CN. If timely instituted, offloading can arrest disease activity and prevent foot deformity. In cases with severe deformity, modern surgical techniques can correct the unstable deformity for improved functional outcome and limb survival. Emerging new studies into the cellular mechanisms of severe bone destruction have furthered our understanding of the mechanisms of pathological bone and joint destruction in CN. It is hoped that these studies may provide a scientific basis for new interventions with biological agents. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient required for the activity of metalloenzymes. It is an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN), but requirements are low. Mn status is difficult to assess, with the commonest method being measurement of its concentration in whole blood. This method has limitations, including artifactually high concentrations resulting from contamination of specimen tubes. Mn toxicity is a well-recognized complication of PN, the risk of which increases if there is cholestasis or if the patient has received high doses. It usually presents with parkinsonian-like symptoms but may be detected presymptomatically as hypermanganesemia or as increased signal intensity of the basal ganglia upon T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Caution is necessary when providing Mn for patients on long-term PN (>1 month). It is advisable to withhold supplementation if hypermanganesemia or cholestasis develops. Deficiency of Mn is rare in patients treated with PN. PN regimens are contaminated with Mn in amounts likely to meet requirements. Consequently, it is debated whether PN should be routinely supplemented with Mn. The currently recommended dose of Mn in adults treated with PN is 55 ?g/d, but the doses provided by most currently available multi?trace element products exceed this. In response to calls for new products to be developed, 2 new multi?trace element products are currently available in Europe that provide Mn doses of 55 ?g/d. Once these products are in general use, it is likely that the incidence of Mn toxicity will decrease.

AB  - The essential trace element zinc (Zn) has a large number of physiologic roles, in particular being required for growth and functioning of the immune system. Adaptive mechanisms enable the body to maintain normal total body Zn status over a wide range of intakes, but deficiency can occur because of reduced absorption or increased gastrointestinal losses. Deficiency impairs physiologic processes, leading to clinical consequences that include failure to thrive, skin rash, and impaired wound healing. Mild deficiency that is not clinically overt may still cause nonspecific consequences, such as susceptibility to infection and poor growth. The plasma Zn concentration has poor sensitivity and specificity as a test of deficiency. Consequently, diagnosis of deficiency requires a combination of clinical assessment and biochemical tests. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) are susceptible to Zn deficiency and its consequences. Nutrition support teams should have a strategy for assessing Zn status and optimizing this by appropriate supplementation. Nutrition guidelines recommend generous Zn provision from the start of PN. This review covers the physiology of Zn, the consequences of its deficiency, and the assessment of its status, before discussing its role in PN.

AB  - Cartilage engineering facilitates repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage using engineered tissue that restores the functional properties of the impaired joint. The seed cells used most frequently in tissue engineering, are chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. Seed cells activity plays a key role in the regeneration of functional cartilage tissue. However, seed cells undergo undesirable changes after in vitro processing procedures, such as degeneration of cartilage cells and induced hypertrophy of mesenchymal stem cells, which hinder cartilage tissue engineering. Compared to monoculture, which does not mimic the in vivo cellular environment, co-culture technology provides a more realistic microenvironment in terms of various physical, chemical, and biological factors. Co-culture technology is used in cartilage tissue engineering to overcome obstacles related to the degeneration of seed cells, and shows promise for cartilage regeneration and repair. In this review, we focus first on existing co-culture systems for cartilage tissue engineering and related fields, and discuss the conditions and mechanisms thereof. This is followed by methods for optimizing seed cell co-culture conditions to generate functional neo-cartilage tissue, which will lead to a new era in cartilage tissue engineering.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Good results have been obtained with a human amiodarone (AD) i.v. protocol in horses with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and a pharmacokinetic study is required for a specific i.v. amiodarone treatment protocol for horses. Objectives: To study the efficacy of this pharmacokinetic based i.v. AD protocol in horses with chronic AF. Methods: Six horses with chronic AF were treated with an adapted AD infusion protocol. The protocol consisted of 2 phases with a loading dose followed by a maintenance infusion. In the first phase, horses received an infusion of 6.52 mg AD/kg bwt/h for 1 h followed by 1.1 mg/kg bwt/h for 47 h. In the second phase, horses received a second loading dose of 3.74 mg AD/kg bwt/h for 1 h followed by 1.31 mg/kg bwt/h for 47 h. Clinical signs were monitored, a surface ECG and an intra-atrial electrogram were recorded. AD treatment was discontinued when conversion or any side effects were observed. Results: Three of the 6 horses cardioverted successfully without side effects. The other 3 horses did not convert and showed adverse effects, including diarrhoea. In the latter, there were no important circulatory problems, but the diarrhoea continued for 10?14 days. The third horse had to be subjected to euthanasia because a concomitant Salmonella infection worsened the clinical signs. Conclusion: The applied treatment protocol based upon pharmacokinetic data achieved clinically relevant concentrations of AD and desethylamiodarone. Potential relevance: Intravenous AD has the potential to be an alternative pharmacological treatment for AF in horses, although AD may lead to adverse drug effects, particularly with cumulative dosing.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Abstract Tendon injuries are common musculoskeletal system disorders in clinical, but the regeneration ability of tendon is limited. Tendon stem cells (TSCs) have shown promising effect on tissue engineering and been used for the treatment of tendon injury. Exosomes that serve as genetic information carriers have been implicated in many diseases and physiological processes, but effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury repair is unclear. The aim of this study is to make clear that the effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury healing. Exosomes were harvested from conditioned culture media of TSCs by a sequential centrifugation process. Rat Achilles tendon tendinopathy model was established by collagenase-I injection. This was followed by intra-Achilles-tendon injection with TSCs or exosomes. Tendon healing and matrix degradation were evaluated by histology analysis and biomechanical test at the post-injury 5 weeks. In vitro, TSCs treated with interleukin 1 beta were added by conditioned medium including exosomes or not, or by exosomes or not. Tendon matrix related markers and tenogenesis related markers were measured by immunostaining and western blot. We found that TSCs injection and exosomes injection significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 expression, increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) and Col-1a1, and increased biomechanical properties of the ultimate stress and maximum loading. In vitro, conditioned medium with exosomes and exosomes also significantly decreased MMP-3, and increased expression of tenomodulin, Col-1a1 and TIMP-3. Exosomes from TSCs could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing for its balancing tendon extracellular matrix and promoting the tenogenesis of TSCs.

AB  - Abstract Background information Continued advances in stem cell biology and stem cell transplantation rely on non-invasive biomarkers to characterise cells and stem cell aggregates. The non-invasive quality of such biomarkers is essential because exogenous labels, probes or reporters can unintentionally and dramatically alter stem cell state as can disruption of cell?cell and cell?matrix interactions. Here, we investigate the utility of the autofluorescent metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), as a non-invasive, intrinsic biomarker of cell death when detected with multi-photon optical-based approaches. To test this possibility, cell death was induced in murine embryoid bodies (EBs) at an early stage (day 3) of differentiation using staurosporine, an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of electron transport. Several hours after staurosporine treatment, EBs were stained with a single-colour, live/dead probe. A single-cross-sectional plane of each EB was imaged to detect the fluorescence intensity of the live/dead probe (extrinsic fluorescence) as well as the fluorescence intensity of NADH (intrinsic fluorescence). EBs were assessed at subsequent time points (days 6?12) for the formation of beating areas as an indicator of functional differentiation. Results Statistical comparison indicated a strong positive correlation between extrinsic fluorescence intensity of the live/dead stain and intrinsic fluorescence of NADH, suggesting that the intensity of NADH fluorescence could be used to reliably and non-invasively assess death of cells of EBs. Furthermore, EBs that had high levels of cell death soon after aggregate formation had limited ability to give rise to functional cardiomyocytes at later time points. Conclusions We demonstrate the utility of NADH fluorescence intensity as a non-invasive indicator of cell death in stem cell aggregates when measured using multi-photon excitation. In addition, we show that the degree of stem cell death at early stages of differentiation is predictive for the formation of functional cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Abstract Transport And Golgi Organization protein 2 (TANGO2) deficiency has recently been identified as a rare metabolic disorder with a distinct clinical and biochemical phenotype of recurrent metabolic crises, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, arrhythmias, and encephalopathy with cognitive decline. We report nine subjects from seven independent families, and we studied muscle histology, respiratory chain enzyme activities in skeletal muscle and proteomic signature of fibroblasts. All nine subjects carried autosomal recessive TANGO2 mutations. Two carried the reported deletion of exons 3 to 9, one homozygous, one heterozygous with a 22q11.21 microdeletion inherited in trans. The other subjects carried three novel homozygous (c.262C>T/p.Arg88*; c.220A>C/p.Thr74Pro; c.380+1G>A), and two further novel heterozygous (c.6_9del/p.Phe6del); c.11-13delTCT/p.Phe5del mutations. Immunoblot analysis detected a significant decrease of TANGO2 protein. Muscle histology showed mild variation of fiber diameter, no ragged-red/cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers and a defect of multiple respiratory chain enzymes and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in two cases, suggesting a possible secondary defect of oxidative phosphorylation. Proteomic analysis in fibroblasts revealed significant changes in components of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi network and secretory pathways. Clinical presentation of TANGO2 mutations is homogeneous and clinically recognizable. The hemizygous mutations in two patients suggest that some mutations leading to allele loss are difficult to detect. A combined defect of the respiratory chain enzymes and CoQ10 with altered levels of several membrane proteins provides molecular insights into the underlying pathophysiology and may guide rational new therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite the potentially life-saving effects of stem cell transplant (SCT), many transplant patients experience traumatic stress reactions due to mortality threat, interpersonal isolation, financial and occupational loss, and invasive medical procedures. Emerging evidence suggests that trauma-related stress symptoms (TSS) predict significant health complications following SCT. The aim of the current prospective study was to examine TSS in the acute aftermath of SCT as a predictor of neutrophil recovery following SCT, a crucial component of immune defense against infection. Methods Fifty-one autologous SCT recipients were assessed for TSS 7 days after SCT. Patients' absolute neutrophil counts were collected from medical charts for the first 30 days following SCT. Hierarchical linear growth modeling was used to test the hypothesis that TSS at day 7 would be associated with delayed recovery of neutrophil counts from days 9 to 30 post SCT, that is, when neutrophil counts began to recover. Results As hypothesized, TSS measured 7 days after SCT was significantly associated with slower neutrophil recovery even after pre-existing TSS, depression, distress related to physical symptoms, and potential medical confounds were statistically controlled. Exploratory analyses showed that of the TSS symptom clusters, re-experiencing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms predicted neutrophil recovery, whereas avoidance symptoms did not. Conclusion Though traumatic stress symptoms may be a normative response to SCT, our findings suggest that TSS following SCT may interfere with neutrophil recovery and overall health. These results provide further insight as to potential mechanisms by which traumatic stress translates to poor medical outcomes for SCT patients. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Objective To describe a case of diabetes mellitus in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Design A case report with controls. Procedures We describe clinical and laboratory findings in a 6-year-old, free-living, female koala presented with traumatic injury and subsequently found to have polydipsia, hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. Over a 5 week period, serum biochemical analyses, haematological examinations, urinal-yses, measurement of serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations, necropsy, histopathological examination of a range of tissues and immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas for insulin-containing cells were done. For reference purposes, serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations were determined in four and two healthy koalas, respectively, and three healthy koalas pancreases were examined histo-logically and immunohistochemically. Results The koala had persistent hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia and glucosuria. Serum insulin concentration of the diabetic koala was only marginally smaller than that of healthy koalas, but all concentrations were smaller than reference concentrations in dogs and people. Fructosamine concentration did not allow the diabetic koala to be distinguished from healthy koalas and concentrations of all koala analytes were greater than expected for healthy dogs and people. Histopathological examination revealed extensive degeneration of pancreatic islet cells and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed decreased or absent insulin in the b cells of the affected koala. Conclusion Clinical signs, clinicopathological results and histopathological changes were consistent with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the condition could not be determined but may have been related to the administration of a parenteral corticosteroid preparation, the stress of capture or tissue damage and inflammation.

AB  - Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single-center pediatric LT cohort (2000-2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height-for-age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride?rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non-CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow-up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.
