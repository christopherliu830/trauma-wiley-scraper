AB  - Abstract Aim:? The assessment of body composition is an important aspect of the determination of nutritional health. This cross-sectional measurement study aimed to assess the relative validity of a range of field techniques for the measurement of body composition in a sample of older orthopaedic inpatients participating in rehabilitation. Methods:? Assessment of percent fat-free mass of 31 adults, aged 65?years and over, was conducted under fasting conditions by two types of bioelectrical impedance analysis (multi-frequency and single frequency?using manufacturer's pre-programmed prediction equation) and compared with percent fat-free mass estimated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a reference technique. Data from multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis were also used to calculate percent fat-free mass from the prediction equation of Dey et?al. for comparison. Skeletal muscle mass was derived from assessment of corrected arm muscle area and compared with skeletal muscle mass from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to determine the level of agreement between each field technique and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results:? Mean bias and limits of agreement between single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were ?5.7% (?24.0, 12.6), between multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (manufacturer's pre-programmed prediction equation) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were 1.4% (?13.4, 16.1), between multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (Dey et?al. prediction equation) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were ?5.0% (?16.6, 6.6) and between skeletal muscle mass as derived from assessment of corrected arm muscle area and skeletal muscle mass from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis ?0.97?kg (?8.37, 6.43). Conclusion:? None of the methods assessed are clinically acceptable for assessment of body composition in older orthopaedic rehabilitation patients; however, estimation of skeletal muscle mass, as derived from corrected arm muscle area, is likely to be of more use in the clinical setting as there is no requirement for patients to be fasted.

AB  - Summary Reactive oxygen species generated during various metabolic and biochemical reactions have multifarious effects that include oxidative damage to DNA leading to various human degenerative and autoimmune diseases. The highly reactive hydroxy radical (·OH) can interact with chromatin and result in a wide range of sugar and base-derived products, DNA?protein cross-links and strand breaks. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that after modification the DNA becomes highly immunogenic and the induced antibodies exhibit variable antigen-binding characteristics. Systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototype autoimmune disease, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to multiple nuclear antigens. The detection of 8-hydroxyguanosine in the immune complex derived DNA of systemic lupus erythematosus patients reinforces the evidence that reactive oxygen species may be involved in its pathogenesis. Increased apoptosis and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells as observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might well be a contributory factor in systemic autoimmunity. Clinically, titres of autoantibodies are closely related to the degree of renal inflammation. Anti-DNA antibodies may combine with circulating antigen and contribute to the deposition of immune complexes in renal glomeruli.

AB  - Objective To report the diagnosis, treatment, and short-term outcome in dogs with suspected persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) undergoing thoracoscopy with concurrent esophagoscopy. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with suspected PRAA (n=9). Methods Medical records were reviewed from 2012 to 2016. Dogs undergoing thoracoscopy for PRAA at 3 referral hospitals were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, anesthesia protocol (including the use of one-lung ventilation), surgical approach, complications, and short-term outcome were recorded. Dogs underwent a left-sided intercostal thoracoscopic approach with concurrent intraoperative esophagoscopy. The ligamentum arteriosum (LA) and constricting fibers were divided using a vessel-sealing device using a 3 or 4 port thoracoscopy technique. Visualization and dissection of the LA was aided by transesophageal illumination by esophagoscopy. Results Thoracoscopy confirmed PRAA in 9 dogs, with an aberrant left subclavian artery (LS) identified in 5 dogs. Major complications occurred in 2 dogs: postoperative hemorrhage from the LS and esophageal perforation, which resulted in euthanasia. Median follow-up was 250 days (range, 56?1,595). Regurgitation resolved in 4 of 8 surviving dogs. One dog had recurrence of regurgitation 1,450 days postoperatively, esophageal compression by the LS was identified, and regurgitation resolved following LS transection. Conclusion Esophagoscopy aided identification and dissection of the LA in all cases. Due to the potential for the LS to cause clinical esophageal constriction postoperatively, a recommendation for LS transection may be warranted. Vascular clips can also be considered as an alternative for vessel ligation to avoid complications associated with vessel-sealing device use.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Pleural effusion (PE) is reported to occur most commonly secondary to bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses, with neoplastic effusions contributing the minority of cases. The majority of these reports originate from America and Australia, where long distance transport of horses, a recognised risk factor, appears to occur more frequently. Anecdotally, neoplastic PE is more commonly diagnosed in the UK. Objectives To describe the causes of PE in horses resident in the UK, and to identify potential markers that can help differentiate between infectious and neoplastic causes of PE. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods Medical records from 4 referral hospitals in southern England were searched for horses diagnosed with PE. Information gathered from medical records included signalment, diagnosis (infectious vs. neoplastic), admission physical examination and biochemical findings, and characteristics of the effusion (volume, cell count, total protein [TP] concentration). Statistical comparisons were made between the neoplastic and infectious group using appropriate testing. Results Seventy horses were identified, of which 28 (40%) were neoplastic and 42 were infectious. Horses with infectious effusions were significantly younger (median 7 vs. 13 years; P?=?0.002) and had significantly smaller volumes of pleural fluid drained at admission (9.8 vs. 32.3?l; P<0.001). Horses with infectious PE had a significantly higher rectal temperature (38.6 vs. 38.2°C; P?=?0.03), fibrinogen concentration (7.8 vs. 5.7?g/l; P?=?0.02) and serum amyloid A concentration (223 vs. 104?mg/l; P?=?0.02). Pleural fluid characteristics identified a significantly greater cell count and TP concentration in horses with infectious PE (47?x?109/l vs. 3.4?x?109/l; P<0.001; 54 vs. 31?g/l; P?=?0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that in the UK neoplastic effusions account for a greater proportion of PE than previously reported. A large volume of PE in an older horse with a low cell count and TP concentration should increase the index of suspicion of neoplasia. Ethical animal research:?This was a retrospective study of clinical cases. Explicit owner informed consent for inclusion of animals in this study was not stated. Source of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Summary Koebner?s phenomenon (KP) has been observed in a number of skin diseases, including vitiligo. Its clinical significance in vitiligo with respect to disease activity and course is still debatable, while its relevance for surgical techniques has been demonstrated in some reports. We present a literature review on the currently known facts about KP in vitiligo, including details of clinical, experimental, and histopathological changes. The consensus view is that there are still no methods to define and assess KP in vitiligo. A new classification is proposed to allow an evaluation of KP in daily practice or in experimental studies. However, many unanswered questions still remain after redefining KP in patients with vitiligo. Active research focusing on KP in vitiligo may not only provide unexpected clues in the pathogenesis of vitiligo but also help to tailor novel therapies against this chronic and often psychologically devastating skin disease.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Damage to the central nervous system triggers rapid activation and specific migration of glial cells towards the lesion site. There, glial cells contribute heavily to secondary neuronal changes that take place after lesion. In an attempt to identify the molecular cues of glial activation following brain trauma we performed differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screenings from lesioned and control hippocampus. Here we report on the identification of the macrophage/microglia activation factor (MAF), a new membrane protein with seven putative transmembrane domains. Expression analysis revealed that MAF is predominantly expressed in microglial cells in the brain, and is upregulated following brain lesion. Overexpression of MAF in non-glial cells shows an intracellular codistribution with the lysosomal marker endosome/lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (lamp-1). Furthermore, MAF-transfected cells show that MAF is primarily associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and that this association can be disrupted by activation of protein kinase C-dependent pathways. In conclusion, these results imply that MAF is involved in the dynamics of lysosomal membranes associated with microglial activation following brain lesion.

AB  - Objectives: The efficacy of maropitant (Cerenia?; Pfizer Inc.) as an anti-emetic for use in dogs with ongoing emesis was evaluated in a two-phase multi-centric study conducted at veterinary clinics in France, Italy, Slovakia and the UK. Methods: In phase I, dogs with ongoing emesis were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either maropitant (32 dogs) or metoclopramide (34 dogs). In phase II, dogs were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to maropitant (77 dogs) or metoclopramide (40 dogs). Maropitant was administered subcutaneously at 1 mg/kg/day for up to five days. Metoclopramide was administered as recommended on the product labels as licensed at 0·5 to 1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously or orally with the daily dose divided over two to three administrations per day for up to three to five days. Results: In phase I, 97 per cent of dogs treated with maropitant and 71 per cent of dogs treated with metoclopramide did not vomit after treatment (P<0·01). The mean number of emetic events after maropitant treatment was significantly reduced compared with that after metoclopramide treatment (P=0·01). In phase II, the occurrence of emesis was lower for maropitant during the first 24 hours (P<0·0001) and for each day thereafter. Clinical Significance: A single daily dose of maropitant was more effective than metoclopramide administered two or three times daily in the treatment of emesis caused by various aetiologies in dogs.

AB  - The late endosomal adaptor protein LAMTOR2/p14 is essential for tissue homeostasis by controlling MAPK and mTOR signaling, which in turn regulate cell growth and proliferation, migration and spreading. Moreover, LAMTOR2 critically controls architecture and function of the endocytic system, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in lysosomes, positioning of late endosomes and defense against intracellular pathogens. Here we describe the multifaceted ultrastructural phenotype of the endo/lysosomal system of LAMTOR2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Quantitative (immuno-)electron microscopy of cryo-fixed samples revealed significantly reduced numbers of recycling tubules emanating from maturing multivesicular bodies (MVB). Instead, a distinct halo of vesicles surrounded MVB, tentatively interpreted as detached, jammed recycling tubules. These morphological changes in LAMTOR2-deficient cells correlated with the presence of growth factors (e.g. EGF), but were similarly induced in control cells by inactivating mTOR. Furthermore, proper transferrin receptor trafficking and recycling were apparently dependent on an intact LAMTOR complex. Finally, a severe imbalance in the relative proportions of endo/lysosomes was found in LAMTOR2-deficient cells, resulting from increased amounts of mature MVB and (autophago)lysosomes. These observations suggest that the LAMTOR/Ragulator complex is required not only for maintaining the homeostasis of endo/lysosomal subpopulations but also contributes to the proper formation of MVB-recycling tubules, and regulation of membrane/cargo recycling from MVB.

AB  - Cells reside in a complex microenvironment (niche) in which the biochemical and biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix profoundly affect cell behavior. Extracellular stiffness, one important bio-mechanical characteristic of the cell niche, is important in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and lineage specification. However, the mechanism by which mechanical signals guide osteogenic and adipogenic commitment of stem cells remains difficult to dissect. To explore this question, we generated a range of polydimethylsiloxane-based matrices with differing degrees of stiffness that mimicked the stiffness seen in natural tissues and examined adipose stem cell morphology, spreading, vinculin expression, and differentiation along the osteogenic and adipogenic pathways. Rigid matrices allowed broader cell spreading, faster growth rate and stronger expression of vinculin in adipose-derived stem cells. In the presence of inductive culture media, stiffness-dependent osteogenesis and adipogenesis of the adipose stem cells indicated that there was a combinatorial effect of biophysical and biochemical cues; no such lineage specification was observed in normal media. Osteogenic differentiation behavior showed a correlation with matrix rigidity, as well as with elevated expression of RhoA, ROCK-1/-2, and related proteins in the Wnt/?-catenin pathway. The result provides a comprehensive understanding of how stem cells respond to the surrounding microenvironment and points to the fact that matrix stiffness is a critical element in biomaterial design and this will be an important advance in stem cell-based tissue engineering.

AB  - ABSTRACT Canine distemper virus causes a multi systemic disease in dogs often with severe neurological signs. These signs are the result of viral replication in neurons and glial cells leading to grey matter lesions and demyelination. Inflammation leads to further destruction of the tissue. As extraneural signs are often lacking and only one localisation may be found on neurological examination, distemper may be difficult to diagnose. Myoclonus is almost pathognomonic for this disease but occurs in less than half of the cases. The inflammation of the central nervous system that occurs during the chronic stage of the disease can be detected on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, in particular by determination of the IgG index. Viral antigen can be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid cells by fluorescent antibody techniques. The prognosis of nervous distemper is generally poor although dogs can recover from this disease. Treatment is largely supportive and symptomatic. The importance of regular vaccination is stressed.

AB  - Aims Type 1 diabetes can be complicated with neuropathy that involves immune-mediated and inflammatory pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, have shown anti-inflammatory properties, and thus we hypothesized that long-term treatment with liraglutide induced diminished inflammation and thus improved neuronal function. Methods The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Titration was 6 weeks to 1.2?1.8 mg/d, continuing for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in latency of early brain evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints were changes in proinflammatory cytokines, cortical evoked potential, autonomic function and peripheral neurophysiological testing. Results Thirty-nine patients completed the study, of whom 19 received liraglutide. In comparison to placebo, liraglutide reduced interleukin-6 (?22.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?38.1, ?3.2; P = .025) with concomitant numerical reductions in other proinflammatory cytokines. However neuronal function was unaltered at the central, autonomic or peripheral level. Treatment was associated with ?3.38 kg (95% CI: ?5.29, ?1.48; P < .001] weight loss and a decrease in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (?40.2%; 95% CI: ?60.6, ?9.5; P = .02). Conclusion Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine physiologic responses to apnea-induced severe hypoxemia in anesthetized horses. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six university-owned horses with a median (range) body weight of 500 (220?510) kg and aged 13.5 (0.8?24.0) years scheduled for euthanasia. Methods Xylazine?midazolam?ketamine-anesthetized horses breathing room air spontaneously were instrumented with a facial artery catheter for pressure measurement and blood sampling, and were made apneic with atlanto-occipital intrathecal lidocaine (4 mg kg?1). Cardiopulmonary, biochemical and hematologic variables were recorded before (baseline) and every minute for 10 minutes after lidocaine injection. Results PaO2 values were: baseline, 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa); 1 minute, 28 mmHg (3.8 kPa); 2 minutes, 18 mmHg (2.4 kPa); 3 minutes, 15 mmHg (2.0 kPa), and 4?10 minutes, (8?11 mmHg (1.1?1.5 kPa). PaCO2 values were: baseline, 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa); 1 minute, 61 mmHg (8.1 kPa), and 2?10 minutes, 64?66 mmHg (8.5?8.8 kPa). Base excess values at baseline, 1 minute and 2?10 minutes were 5.3 mmol L?1, 6.5 mmol L?1 and 7.0?8.1 mmol L?1, respectively. Pulse rates at baseline, 1 minute and 2?7 minutes were 36, 53 and 54?85 beats minute?1, respectively. Asystole occurred at 8 minutes. Pulse pressures were 50 mmHg at baseline and 1 minute, and 39 mmHg, 31 mmHg, 22 mmHg, 17 mmHg and 1?9 mmHg at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6?10 minutes, respectively. Lactate was 0.9 mmol L?1 at baseline, progressively increasing to 1.7?2.4 mmol L?1 at 7?10 minutes. Packed cell volume increased after 7 minutes of apnea. There were no other major changes. Conclusions and clinical relevance Apnea immediately exacerbated hypoxemia and hypercapnia and rapidly caused hemodynamic instability. Apnea in hypoxemic anesthetized horses is associated with a serious risk for progress to cardiovascular collapse.

AB  - Summary Two or three different solutions may be used to preserve thoracic and abdominal organs during a single procurement. The aim of this prospective, multi-center, noncomparative study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Celsior? (study solution, solution S) as a flushing and cold storage solution for both thoracic and abdominal organs. Between August 1999 and July 2000, 72 consecutive multiple-organ procurements were performed using solution S as the sole solution for flushing out and cold-storing thoracic and abdominal grafts. Two hundred and sixty-four grafts were implanted into 245 recipients (131 kidneys, 9 kidney?pancreases, 69 livers, 34 hearts and 6 heart?lungs). The mean cold ischemia time was 21?h for kidneys (26%>24?h); 11?h 26?min for pancreases, 9?h 16?min for livers (23%>12?h), and 2?h 58?min for hearts and lungs. No cardiac failure or arrhythmia occurred on graft reperfusion. Fourteen percent of kidney recipients had delayed graft function. The mean serum creatinin level at 3 months was 123?±?41??mol/l. All pancreas recipients were insulin-free at 3?months. Primary graft nonfunction occurred in one liver recipient. Complete hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in six liver recipients during the first month; four of these patients had a risk factor for thrombosis. All but three of the heart recipients were in sinus rhythm on day 1, and 65% were extubated on day 1. Inotropic drugs were necessary during the first 72?h in 25% of heart recipients. Twelve-month patient and graft survival rates were, respectively, 100% and 96% (kidney), 100% and 89% (pancreas), 88% and 83% (liver), 77.5% (heart) and 67% (heart?lung). These results suggest that Celsior?, a ready-to-use solution, is safe and effective for multiple organ procurement and preservation.

AB  - Abstract General description It this paper we present a survey of the main reactive oxygen species (ROS). their biological sources and the array of antioxidant enzymes and antiradical molecules which constitutes the cellular detent; against ROS toxicity. We outline also the fundamentals of ROS biochemistry, in relation to the role of ROS in several human pathologies. Finally, we discuss with particular emphasis the involvement of ROS in dermatological diseases, highlighting the possible therapeutic application of antioxidants in skin care. Learning objective The reader will learn what ROS are, the identity of the anti-ROS defensive system in human cells and the many fold roles of ROS in human physiopathology, and thus the potential application of antioxidants in clinical therapy.
