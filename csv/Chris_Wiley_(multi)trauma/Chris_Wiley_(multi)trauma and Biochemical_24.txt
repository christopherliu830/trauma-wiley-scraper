AB  - ABSTRACT This study investigates the correlation between the composition of human meniscus and its absorption spectrum in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) spectral range. Meniscus samples (n?=?24) were obtained from nonarthritic knees of human cadavers with no history of joint diseases. Specimens (n?=?72) were obtained from three distinct sections of the meniscus, namely; anterior, center, posterior. Absorption spectra were acquired from each specimen in the VIS and NIR spectral range (400?1,100?nm). Following spectroscopic probing, the specimens were subjected to biochemical analyses to determine the matrix composition, that is water, hydroxyproline, and uronic acid contents. Multivariate analytical techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression, were then used to investigate the correlation between the matrix composition and it spectral response. Our results indicate that the optical absorption of meniscus matrix is related to its composition, and this relationship is optimal in the NIR spectral range (750?1,100?nm). High correlations (R2uronic?=?86.9%, R2water?=?83.8%, R2hydroxyproline?=?81.7%, p?<?0.0001) were obtained between the spectral predicted and measured meniscus composition, thus suggesting that spectral data in the NIR range can be utilized for estimating the matrix composition of human meniscus. In conclusion, optical spectroscopy, particularly in the NIR spectral range, is a potential method for evaluating the composition of human meniscus. This presents a promising technique for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of meniscus integrity in real-time during arthroscopic surgery. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses the nature of disability, how it can best be ameliorated, which training techniques and medical treatments are most effective, particularly after single incident brain injury, and the organisational structures required for their optimal delivery. A holistic biopsychosocial individualised multi-dimensional rehabilitation programme includes: reiterative multi-disciplinary assessment, problem definition and measurement, goal-setting and treatment planning, treatment delivery, evaluation of effectiveness, and reassessment with a view to further treatment. Non-invasive therapy interventions and task-related training in the context of neural damage are an integral part of the rehabilitation process after a neurological event, and aim to optimise a person's functional ability. Cardio-respiratory training and exercise classes may reverse the detraining effects of immobility and reduced activity seen in many chronic conditions. Symptoms related to neurological impairments caused by either single incident or chronic progressive conditions can cause distress and impact on function.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted to heart transplant recipients by donor organs. Mid-term results were reported using HCV-positive donors in patients at risk of imminent death (group I, n?=?10), or in patients who otherwise would not have been offered heart transplantation (group II, n?=?10) because of age (9/10) or associated medical risk (1/10). Medical records pertaining to patients receiving HCV-positive allografts between July 1994 and December 1999 were reviewed. The recipients consisted of 19 males and one female, with a median age of 54?years for group I and 66 for group II. The HCV RNA level, seroconversion of anti-HCV antibody, biochemical liver dysfunction, and causes of death were examined. Older recipients received reduced immunosuppression. Two patients in group II were HCV positive and were also retransplants. The hospital mortality rate was 10% in group I and 20% in group II; both hepatitis C-positive recipients died postoperatively prior to discharge. All predischarge deaths were related to multi-system organ failure (MSOF). All 17 survivors were HCV negative prior to transplant. Of these, 4/17 seroconverted. HCV RNA was detected in two of them. At a median follow-up of 26.4?months, 2/11 current survivors continue to test anti-HCV positive and are RNA negative. Three-year actual survival was 40% for group I and 70% in group II. Transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD) accounted for one postoperative death in group I. Current data show that four out of 11 survivors had developed TCAD at 3-year follow-up, yielding an actual freedom from TCAD rate of 12/17 (70%) at 3-year follow-up. Hepatitis C transmission using a donor heart as the reservoir is moderate (25%). Limited use of such donors is justified in selected patients. The risk for hepatic disease may be reduced by tailoring immunosuppression specifically for such recipients, particularly if they are at low risk of rejection. Further studies are necessary to define a possible association between HCV and TCAD.

AB  - Abstract Plant natural products derived from phenylalanine and the phenylpropanoid pathway are impressive in their chemical diversity and are the result of plant evolution, which has selected for the acquisition of large repertoires of pigments, structural and defensive compounds, all derived from a phenylpropanoid backbone via the plant-specific phenylpropanoid pathway. These compounds are important in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses and thus can have large impacts on agricultural productivity. While plant-based medicines containing phenylpropanoid-derived active components have long been used by humans, the benefits of specific flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid-derived compounds to human health and their potential for long-term health benefits have been only recognized more recently. In this part of the review, we discuss the diversity and biosynthetic origins of phenylpropanoids and particularly of the flavonoid and stilbenoid natural products. We then review data pertaining to the modes of action and biological properties of these compounds, referring on their effects on human health and physiology and their roles as plant defense and antimicrobial compounds. This review continues in Part II discussing the use of biotechnological tools targeting the rational reconstruction of multienzyme pathways in order to modify the production of such compounds in plants and model microbial systems for the benefit of agriculture and forestry.

AB  - Summary Our study group recently evaluated an ED95 local anaesthetic volume of 0.11?ml.mm?2 cross-sectional nerve area for the ulnar nerve. This prospective, randomised, double-blind crossover study investigated whether this volume is sufficient for brachial plexus blocks at the axillary level. Ten volunteers received an ultrasonographic guided axillary brachial plexus block either with 0.11 (?low? volume) or 0.4?(?high? volume)?ml.mm?2 cross-sectional nerve area with mepivacaine 1%. The mean (SD) volume was in the low volume group 4.0 (1.0) and 14.8?(3.8)?ml in the high volume group. The success rate for the individual nerve blocks was 27 out of 30 in the low volume group (90%) and 30 out of 30 in the high volume group (100%), resulting in 8 out of 10 (80%) vs 10 out of 10 (100%) complete blocks in the low vs the high volume groups, respectively (NS). The mean (SD) sensory onset time was 25.0?(14.8)?min in the low volume group and 15.8?(6.8)?min in the high volume group (p?<?0.01). The mean (SD) duration of sensory block was 125?(38)?min in the low volume group and 152?(70)?min in the high volume group (NS). This study confirms our previous published ED95 volume for mepivacaine 1% to block peripheral nerves. The volume of local anaesthetic has some influence on the sensory onset time.

AB  - Objectives To assess the value of first trimester scanning for the diagnosis of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Population/methods An unselected group of 7447 pregnant women who had a first trimester scan in our unit. In all the cases an anatomical survey was performed and the nuchal translucency was measured. Four thousand and 84 women also had second trimester biochemical screening. We assessed the performance of first trimester scanning in the detection of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Results The incidence of anomalous fetuses was 1.4%, including 43 chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate for structural abnormalities was 59% (37/63). Seventy-eight percent of chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed at 11?14?weeks either because of a nuchal translucency measurement above the 99th centile or due to the presence of structural abnormalities. Second trimester biochemical screening detected half of the fetuses with trisomy 21 which were missed by first trimester screening, increasing the sensitivity to 90.5% (19/21; 95%C.I. 69.6% to 98.8%). However, the positive predictive value of the biochemical test was very low (0.5%). Conclusion First trimester NT measurement is an effective screening test for the prenatal detection of fetuses with structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the measurement of biochemical markers in the second trimester can detect additional affected fetuses this may be out-weighted by the delay in diagnosis, the extra visits and cost so that the right time for biochemical screening still needs to be determined. Second trimester anomaly scanning should continue to be an essential part of a prenatal screening programme.

AB  - Objectives To examine the clinical signs, laboratory findings, possible predisposing factors, antimicrobial sensitivity and outcomes of dogs and cats diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by Corynebacterium urealyticum. Materials and Methods Retrospective, observational study of dogs and cats that were diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum. Results This report concerns a total of 11 dogs and 10 cats. All cats had a history of urethral catheterisation, and six cats had undergone urological surgery before diagnosis of this specific infection. Dogs had history of neurogenic urinary incontinence (n=5), urethral catheterisation (n=4), urological surgery (n=4), lower urinary tract disease (n=2) or prostatic disease (n=1). In seven animals, previous urine culture was negative. Median urine pH was 8.6 (interquartile range 7.5 to 9), and 19 animals had pyuria and struvite crystalluria. Encrusted cystitis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in nine animals. All but one isolate were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes. Thirteen isolates were sensitive to tetracyclines. There was bacterial and clinical resolution of the infection in nine dogs and seven cats. Two animals died from sepsis and two cats were euthanased because of clinical deterioration. Clinical Significance Urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum should be suspected in animals with pre-existing urinary disorders, especially if urine is alkaline and there is struvite crystalluria, negative routine urine culture and encrusted cystitis.

The physiological benefits of utilizing photobiomodulation therapy as part of the treatment plan in the management of these lesions are a relief of pain, a modulation of the inflammatory response, an increase in circulation, and a subsequent acceleration of the healing process. This chapter provides an overview of the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved, the optimum application techniques, dosages, the frequency of treatment, and the integral role of photobiomodulation therapy in the care of these patients.

AB  - Objective? To compare the effects of postoperative pain after ovariohysterectomy by harmonic scalpel-assisted laparoscopy (HALO) and traditional ovariohysterectomy (OVH) in dogs. Study Design? A randomized, blinded, prospective study. Sample Population? Sixteen, purpose-bred, intact female, Beagle dogs. Methods? Dogs were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (8 dogs), which had OVH by HALO, and Group 2 (8 dogs), which had traditional OVH. Physiologic data, abdominal nociceptive threshold scores, and University of Melbourne pain scores (UMPS) were recorded at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Blood samples for measurement of plasma cortisol, glucose, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations were collected at the time of the incision, and 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Results? No significant surgical complications occurred. The HALO mean surgical time was significantly longer (55.7 minutes) than traditional OVH (31.7 minutes). No significant differences were observed between groups for the pain measures of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, CPK, and glucose concentrations. The OVH group had significantly higher mean plasma cortisol levels at hour 2 after surgery than the HALO group (P=.0001). The mean UMPS were significantly higher in OVH than the HALO group at all postoperative times (P=.0001). The mean nociceptive threshold measurements revealed significantly higher tolerated palpation pressures in HALO than OVH at all postoperative times, except hour 72 (P=.0002). Conclusions? Dogs appeared to be in less pain with HALO than OVH. The harmonic scalpel coagulated ovarian and uterine vessels completely with minimal collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Clinical Relevance? HALO is a safe alternative to OVH and offers a minimally invasive and less painful method of surgery.

AB  - Abstract Electroanalysis involves the measurement or determination of a chemical or biochemical species, using a wide range of electrochemical methods. The species being measured can either bring about a direct electrochemical response that can be detected and measured, or can be induced to bring about such a response, resulting in a process that can be detected electrochemically. In both cases an interface is required between the chemical or biochemical species being measured, and the electrochemical system performing the measurement. This interface is referred to as an ?electrode?. It is the transfer of electrons or ions between the electrode and the environment being sampled which is of concern in electroanalysis. The application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis is concerned with the measurement of chemical and biochemical species present in biological fluids (primarily blood but also urine and other body fluids and tissues). It is applied in several areas of critical care where its rapidity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy at biologically relevant concentrations make it an ideal choice over other, typically slower, biochemical techniques. Indeed, it is the speed of electrochemical analysis that principally differentiates it from other methods. It is not universally applicable to clinical chemistry, however, and has only been applied in situations where such analyses are relevant. This has principally been in the analysis of blood gases and pH and blood electrolytes. Electrochemical methods are, however, gradually being extended to the analysis of small biochemical components such as sugars, amino acids and other metabolites, with the advent of enzyme-based ?biosensors?. There is also little doubt that the application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis will be further exploited by the use of such biosensor devices based on other forms of biorecognition, such as antibodies, cell ligands, membranes, tissues and whole cells. These biosensor devices are also amenable to other forms of detection such as acoustic wave and optical measurements. Together, these techniques offer a wide range of advantages over traditional analytical methodologies, and will undoubtedly have a rapidly increasing impact on many types of clinical analysis. This article focuses on the use of electrochemical techniques and electrochemical biosensors and their application in clinical chemistry.

AB  - Objectives: To report the clinicopathological findings and outcome in cats with pancreatitis-associated extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction (EHBO) treated by choledochal tube stenting. Methods: Medical records of cats with EHBO secondary to pancreatitis that underwent choledochal stenting were reviewed. Information on outcome was obtained by re-examination of the cat or by telephone interview with the owners. Results: All cats had pancreatitis confirmed by histopathological examination of biopsy samples (n=6) or suspected based on gross examination at surgery (n=1). In six cats, a section of 3·5 to five French gauge red rubber catheter and in one cat a section of 22?G intravenous catheter were used as a choledochal stent. Two cats developed re-obstruction of the biliary tract within a week of the original surgery. One cat had confirmed episodes of ascending cholangitis postoperatively. Two cats had chronic intermittent vomiting in the postoperative period. Two cats died during the perioperative period. Five cats survived to discharge, three of which died seven to 24 months postoperatively and two of which remain alive to date. Clinical Significance: Choledochal stenting is an alternative to biliary diversion for management of feline pancreatitis-associated EHBO in select cases. However, there may be greater morbidity with this technique in cats compared with dogs.

AB  - Abstract We analyze key proteomic issues and cutting-edge technologies that will spearhead inroads into functional interpretations of human diseases and their therapeutic rectification, following the availability of the predicted human proteome. We contrast the distinctions between high quality data that are low throughput, (e.g., 3-D proteomic reconstructions in embryogenic and nervous system contexts, and multigenerational transgenic studies), versus automated data harvesting that is more distant from human disease phenotypes and currently fulfills a diagnostic role, (e.g., molecular portraits of human diseases via transcriptomic analyses). We examine the extent to which these approaches impinge upon a realistic understanding of human diseases, namely how close they come to revealing the causal events involved in the initiation of disease. While tissue sources from human embryogenesis, foetal development and the brain remain the absolute priority, the pragmatic approaches utilize judicious data integration from selected proteomic studies of model organisms. The role of genome-wide disease-related screens, ?humanized? transgenic analyses, multigenerational gene interference methods, and analyses of post-translational modifications in epigenetic contexts from Drosophila will be crucial, since these avenues are far too slow and transgenically cumbersome in mammals. Finally, the implementation of multi compartment electrolyzers (MCE) and multi photon detection (MPD) systems will be pivotal for the proteomic profiling of human tissue samples.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background? Biomedical markers may provide additive objective information in screening and confirmation of acute or recent consumption, intoxication, relapse, heavy drinking, hazardous/harmful use/abuse and dependence and alcohol use related organ dysfunction (alcohol use-related disorders: AUDs). Aims? To review the use of biomarkers in clinical practice to detect AUDs. Findings? About one-fifth of the patients seen in clinical practice have AUDs, which offer a variety of treatment options if diagnosed. The diagnosis of AUDs relies on clinical and alcohol-related history, physical examination, questionnaires and laboratory values. No clinical available laboratory test [e.g. for acute abuse: alcohol in blood or breath; for chronic alcohol abuse: ?-glutamyl transferase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT)] is reliable enough on its own to support a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, harmful use or abuse. Sensitivities, specificities and the predictive values may vary considerably according to patient and control group characteristics (e.g. gender, age or related comorbidity). In patient groups with limited cooperation markers may be helpful when considering treatment options. Conclusions? More research is needed to determine the value of markers (single or combined, with questionnaires) in the context of clinical decision-making algorithms in defined settings and with defined dichotomous outcome variables.

AB  - Total disc replacement using tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (TE-IVDs) may offer a biological alternative to treat radiculopathy caused by disc degeneration. A composite TE-IVD was previously developed and evaluated in rat tail and beagle cervical spine models in vivo. Although cell viability and tissue integration into host tissue were promising, significant implant displacement occurred at multiple spinal levels. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of a resorbable plating system on the stiffness of motion segments and stability of tissue-engineered implants subjected to axial compression. Canine motion segments from levels C2/C3 to C5/C6 were assessed as intact (CTRL), after discectomy (Dx), with an implanted TE-IVD only (PLATE?), and with a TE-IVD combined with an attached resorbable plate (PLATE+). Segments under PLATE+ conditions fully restored separation between endplates and showed significantly higher compressive stiffness than segments under PLATE? conditions. Plated segments partially restored more than 25% of the CTRL motion segment stiffness. Plate attachment also prevented implant extrusion from the disc space at 50% compressive strain, and this effect was more significant in segments from levels C3/C4 when compared to segments from level C5/C6. These results suggest that stabilization of motion segments via resorbable plating assists TE-IVD retention in the disc space while allowing the opportunity for implants to fully integrate into the host tissue and achieve optimal restoration of spine biomechanics.
