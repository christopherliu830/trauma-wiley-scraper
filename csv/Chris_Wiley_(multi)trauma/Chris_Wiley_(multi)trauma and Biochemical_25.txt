AB  - Total disc replacement using tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (TE-IVDs) may offer a biological alternative to treat radiculopathy caused by disc degeneration. A composite TE-IVD was previously developed and evaluated in rat tail and beagle cervical spine models in vivo. Although cell viability and tissue integration into host tissue were promising, significant implant displacement occurred at multiple spinal levels. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of a resorbable plating system on the stiffness of motion segments and stability of tissue-engineered implants subjected to axial compression. Canine motion segments from levels C2/C3 to C5/C6 were assessed as intact (CTRL), after discectomy (Dx), with an implanted TE-IVD only (PLATE?), and with a TE-IVD combined with an attached resorbable plate (PLATE+). Segments under PLATE+ conditions fully restored separation between endplates and showed significantly higher compressive stiffness than segments under PLATE? conditions. Plated segments partially restored more than 25% of the CTRL motion segment stiffness. Plate attachment also prevented implant extrusion from the disc space at 50% compressive strain, and this effect was more significant in segments from levels C3/C4 when compared to segments from level C5/C6. These results suggest that stabilization of motion segments via resorbable plating assists TE-IVD retention in the disc space while allowing the opportunity for implants to fully integrate into the host tissue and achieve optimal restoration of spine biomechanics.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the feasibility and the safety of applying chitosan membrane (ChiMe) on the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (NS-RARP). The secondary aim of the study was to report preliminary data and in particular potency recovery data. Patients and Methods This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated. Results In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. Conclusion In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the ?standard? procedure. No patients had signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. A comparative cohort would have added value to the study. The present paper was performed before Conformité Européene (CE)-mark achievement.

AB  - Variation in water-holding capacity (WHC), which presents a major economic burden to the swine industry, is considered to be underpinned by variation at a molecular and biochemical level. High-resolution 2D DIGE followed by MS analysis and Western blot were used to unravel the proteome of muscle exudate, collected following centrifugation, in the pH 4?7 range. A first 2DE-based protein map of this substrate was produced where 89 spots were successfully characterised. Two phenotypes divergent for WHC plus one intermediate were compared with a view to deciphering the biochemical processes impacting on variation in WHC. Twenty spots were observed to be altered across the phenotypes. Of these, 14 represented sixteen proteins including metabolic enzymes, stress response proteins and structural proteins. Triosephosphate isomerase and transferrin showed a major difference between the two extreme phenotypes, and may have potential as biological markers for WHC prediction. Several members of the HSPs family were highlighted. This proteomic study makes an important contribution towards a more detailed molecular view of the processes behind WHC and will provide a valuable resource for future investigations.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Abstract Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by most cellular types that carry important biochemical compounds throughout the body with different purposes, playing a preponderant role in cellular communication. Because of their structure, physicochemical properties and stability, recent studies are focusing in their use as nanocarriers for different therapeutic compounds for the treatment of different diseases ranging from cancer to Parkinson's disease. However, current bioseparation protocols and methodologies are selected based on the final exosome application or intended use and present both advantages and disadvantages when compared among them. In this context, this review aims to present the most important technologies available for exosome isolation while discussing their advantages and disadvantages and the possibilities of being combined with other strategies. This is critical since the development of novel exosome-based therapeutic strategies will be constrained to the effectiveness and yield of the selected downstream purification methodologies for which a thorough understanding of the available technological resources is needed.

Methods An ameloblastoma, located in the rostral aspect of the mandible, was removed by complete en-bloc resection of the tumor, removing most of the mandibular symphysis. Results The day after surgery, the remaining mandibular symphysis (<5?mm) fractured causing marked instability of the hemi-mandibles. Partial wound dehiscence occurred 5 days after surgery; however, the mare was able to eat well and the incision healed within 2 weeks. At 18 months, there was bony fusion of the hemi-mandibles and mild protrusion of the tongue. Conclusion Extensive rostral mandibulectomy (up to the caudal edge of the mandibular symphysis) can apparently be performed in a horse without internal or external stabilization, and yield a cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - Abstract A biogeographic estimate of a certain population can not only discern population substructure in the whole genome association study, but also provide informative clues for forensic investigations when obtained DNA genotypes do not find a match in the available forensic DNA database. In this study, 100 ancestry informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (AISNPs) were first presented to differentiate three continental ancestries (African, East Asian and European). Ultimately, forty-two AISNPs were chosen from the 100 AISNPs. Distinguishing power of the 100 and 42 AISNPs for differentiating continental populations was further evaluated with population cluster analyses. Results indicated both of AISNP sets could efficiently differentiate 11 training populations from the three continents. Further validation of 42 AISNPs in testing population set indicated these 42 AISNPs performed well for ancestry inferences of these testing individuals. Ancestry components of Uyghur group were assessed by comparing with different continental populations based on these 42 AISNPs. Results revealed that East Asian populations contributed more ancestry components to the studied Uyghur group than European populations. In conclusion, our study is expected to provide more AISNP markers and enrich extant reference database.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease that commonly affects the elderly. Current drug therapies for treating OA may cause adverse side effects, and so there remains a need to develop alternative treatments. Bergapten (BG) is a coumarin phytohormone that is widely found in fruits and has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we tested the hypothesis that BG may restrict the progression of OA by examining its effect on OA chondrocytes. We observed that BG significantly ameliorated interleukin (IL)-1?-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including interleukin 1 (Il-1), interleukin 6 (Il-6), tumor necrosis factor α (Tnf-α), cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp-13), maintained chondrocyte phenotype, and promoted the secretion of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix. We provide evidence that BG exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by activating the ANP32A/ATM signaling pathway, which was recently verified to be associated with OA. In conclusion, these findings indicate that BG may be a potential candidate for treatment of OA.

Study Design Prospective cohort study. Animals Dogs with normal (n?=?15) and abnormal (n?=?14) elbows. Methods Infrared imaging was performed on all dogs and data analyzed via descriptive statistics and image pattern analysis software. Animals with elbow dysplasia had arthroscopic procedures to confirm the presence of elbow disease. Results Computer recognition pattern analysis was up to 100% correct in identifying abnormal elbows and normal elbows, with the medial images most consistent. The caudal, lateral, and cranial images correctly identified 83?100% abnormal elbows. The caudal and lateral images correctly identified 83% normal elbows. A significant difference in temperature was found between normal and abnormal elbows for the cranial full region of interest, lateral images, and each quadrant. Conclusion Medical infrared imaging was able to correctly identify known abnormal and known normal elbows in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Organic acidurias (synonym, organic acid disorders, OADs) are a heterogenous group of inherited metabolic diseases delineated with the implementation of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in metabolic laboratories starting in the 1960s and 1970s. Biochemically, OADs are characterized by accumulation of mono-, di- and/or tricarboxylic acids (?organic acids?) and corresponding coenzyme A, carnitine and/or glycine esters, some of which are considered toxic at high concentrations. Clinically, disease onset is variable, however #Affected individuals may already present during the newborn period with life-threatening acute metabolic crises and acute multi-organ failure. Tandem mass spectrometry-based newborn screening programmes, in particular for isovaleric aciduria and glutaric aciduria type 1, have significantly reduced diagnostic delay. Dietary treatment with low protein intake or reduced intake of the precursor amino acid(s), carnitine supplementation, cofactor treatment (in responsive patients) and nonadsorbable antibiotics is commonly used for maintenance treatment. Emergency treatment options with high carbohydrate/glucose intake, pharmacological and extracorporeal detoxification of accumulating toxic metabolites for intensified therapy during threatening episodes exist. Diagnostic and therapeutic measures have improved survival and overall outcome in individuals with OADs. However, it has become increasingly evident that the manifestation of late disease complications cannot be reliably predicted and prevented. Conventional metabolic treatment often fails to prevent irreversible organ dysfunction with increasing age, even if patients are considered to be ?metabolically stable?. This has challenged our understanding of OADs and has elicited the discussion on optimized therapy, including (early) organ transplantation, and long-term care.

AB  - ABSTRACT Methodological differences between in vitro and in vivo studies on cartilage overloading complicate the comparison of outcomes. The rationale of the current review was to (i) identify consistencies and inconsistencies between in vitro and in vivo studies on mechanically-induced structural damage in articular cartilage, such that variables worth interesting to further explore using either one of these approaches can be identified; and (ii) suggest how the methodologies of both approaches may be adjusted to facilitate easier comparison and therewith stimulate translation of results between in vivo and in vitro studies. This study is anticipated to enhance our understanding of the development of osteoarthritis, and to reduce the number of in vivo studies. Generally, results of in vitro and in vivo studies are not contradicting. Both show subchondral bone damage and intact cartilage above a threshold value of impact energy. At lower loading rates, excessive loads may cause cartilage fissuring, decreased cell viability, collagen network de-structuring, decreased GAG content, an overall damage increase over time, and low ability to recover. This encourages further improvement of in vitro systems, to replace, reduce, and/or refine in vivo studies. However, differences in experimental set up and analyses complicate comparison of results. Ways to bridge the gap include (i) bringing in vitro set-ups closer to in vivo, for example, by aligning loading protocols and overlapping experimental timeframes; (ii) synchronizing analytical methods; and (iii) using computational models to translate conclusions from in vitro results to the in vivo environment and vice versa. ? 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Hepatocytes can be generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using inducers such as chemical compounds and cytokines, but issues related to low differentiation efficiencies remain to be resolved. Recent work has shown that overexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors can directly cause cells phenotypic changes, including differentiation, trans-differentiation, and de-differentiation. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated constitutive expression of forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a) could promote inducing mouse ESCs to hepatocyte-likes cells. First, ESC lines that stably expressed Foxa2, Hnf4a, or Foxa2/Hnf4a were constructed via lentiviral expression vectors. Second, observations of cell morphology changes were made during the cell culture process, followed by experiments examining teratoma formation. Then, the effects of constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a on hepatic differentiation and maturation were determined by measuring the marker gene expression levels of Albumin, α-fetoprotein, Cytokeratin18, and α1-antitrypsin. The results indicate that constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a does not affect ESCs culture, teratoma formation, or the expression levels of the specific hepatocyte genes under autonomous differentiation. However, with some assistance from inducing factors, Foxa2 significantly increased the hepatic differentiation of ESCs, whereas the expression of Hnf4a alone or Foxa2/Hnf4a could not. Differentiated CCE-Foxa2 cells were more superior in expressing several liver-specific markers and protein, storing glycogen than differentiated CCE cells. Therefore, our method employing the transduction of Foxa2 would be a valuable tool for the efficient generation of functional hepatocytes derived from ESCs. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? This article is aimed to review the novel actions of progesterone, which otherwise is considered as a female reproductive hormone. The article focuses on its important physiological actions in males too and gives an overview of its novel perspectives in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system. Key findings? Progesterone may have a potential benefit in treatment of traumatic brain injury, various neurological disorders and male related diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer and osteoporosis. Norethisterone (NETA), a progesterone derivative, decreases bone mineral loss in male castrated mice suggesting its role in osteoporosis. In the future, progesterone may find use as a male contraceptive too, but still needs confirmatory trials for safety, tolerability and acceptability. Megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative is preferred in prostatic cancer. Further, it may find utility in nicotine addiction, traumatic brain injury (recently entered Phase III trial) and Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathy and crush injuries. Studies also suggest role of progesterone in stroke, for which further clinical trials are needed. The non genomic actions of progesterone may be in part responsible for these novel actions. Summary? Although progesterone has shown promising role in various non-hormonal benefits, further clinical studies are needed to prove its usefulness in conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuropathy and crush injury. In male related illnesses like BPH and prostatic Ca, it may prove a boon in near future. New era of hormonal male contraception may be initiated by use of progesterone along with testosterone.

AB  - Abstract Mental disorders are neuropsychiatric conditions that are marked by unusual or irregular thinking, feelings, or behavior, and lead to distress and/or impaired functions. Major psychiatric conditions are depression, anxiety, and psychoses of various types. Their etiopathogeneses, of a primary or secondary origin, are associated with genetic and environmental factors. They are commonly treated with psychoactive drugs (also known as psychotropics), which target serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, and nuclear receptors (NRs), including retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) and other receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). Herein we present a diverse array of isoxazole derivatives, among which are some prominent marketed drugs. Some of the derivatives and forms, including N-oxides, are under either (pre)clinical evaluation or patent protection as new generation of psychotropics, and a few have effective blood?brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Various drug-like isoxazol(in)es and their structural features and efficiency, modified through scaffold hopping, are described and discussed in the context of treating neuropsychiatric conditions.
