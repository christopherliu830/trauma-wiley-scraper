AB  - An 11-month-old Border collie presented collapsed and continued to deteriorate rapidly despite supportive treatment. The dog had a history of failure to thrive and recurring respiratory infection. Laboratory abnormalities included neutrophilic leucocytosis, Heinz body anaemia, hyperammonaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, proteinuria and hypocobalaminaemia. Post-mortem examination revealed multi-focal necrosis within the heart, kidneys, pancreas, liver, meninges and cerebral cortex. Fungal hyphae in lesions were identified as Scedosporium prolificans following culture. Subsequent genotyping confirmed that the dog carried the CUBN:c.8392delC mutation in a homozygous state, verifying hereditary cobalamin deficiency (a.k.a. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Cobalamin deficiency may have been a predisposing factor for the development of systemic fungal infection in this dog.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Detailed oral and dental examination is best performed under general anaesthesia. This allows tests such as pocket depth assessment and intra-oral radiography to be optimally performed. A dental chart is used as a tool to allow efficient recording of information for diagnostic, monitoring and medico-legal purposes. Quantitative measurements and indices are used to score pathology where possible. This information is used in parallel with additional tests, both systemic and local, e.g. blood biochemistry and histopathology respectively, in order to reach a diagnosis and prognosis for the individual's oral status and specific dentition where appropriate. It is vital to thoroughly examine both extra-oral and intra-oral areas and soft and hard tissues alike.

AB  - Abstract Articular chondrocytes reside in lacunae distributed in cartilage responsible for the remodelling of the tissue with limited ability of damage repairing. The in vitro expanded chondrocytes enhanced by factors/agents to obtain large numbers of cells with strengthened phenotype are essential for successful repair of cartilage lesions by clinical cell implantation therapies. Because the salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a major hydrophilic therapeutic agent isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been widely used to treat diseases and able to stimulate activity of cells, this study examines the effects of Sal B on passaged chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were treated with various concentrations of Sal B in monolayer culture, their morphological properties and changes, and mitochondrial membrane potential were analysed using microscopic analyses, including cellular biochemical staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The proteins were quantified by BCA and Western blotting, and the transcription of genes was detected by qRT-PCR. The passaged chondrocytes treated with Sal B showed strengthened cellular synthesis and stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential with upregulated expression of the marker genes for chondrocyte phenotype, Col2-α1, Acan and Sox9, the key Wnt signalling molecule ?-catenin and paracrine cytokine Cytl-1. The treatments using CYTL-1 protein significantly increased expression of Col2-α1 and Acan with no effect on Sox9, indicating the paracrine cytokine acts on chondrocytes independent of SOX9. Sal B has ultimately promoted cell growth and enhanced chondrocyte phenotype. The chondrocytes treated with pharmaceutical agent and cytokine in the formulated medium for generating large number of differentiated chondrocytes would facilitate the cell-based therapies for cartilage repair.

AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To collate and describe emergency admissions to a large animal tertiary university referral hospital during a 12-month period. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Large animal tertiary university referral hospital. Animals: Large animal emergency patient admissions. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Information obtained from the medical record included the presenting complaint, clinical problem, admission time, duration of clinical signs before presentation, diagnostic procedures performed, therapies administered, and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission, and survival to discharge. The most common category listed for the presenting complaint and clinical problem categories was gastrointestinal. Most emergency cases were admitted during the evening and in late spring, summer, and early fall. Most cases had a duration of clinical signs before presentation of >2 hours and ≤8 hours (27%) or >8 hours and ≤24 hours (29%). The most common diagnostic procedures performed during the first 24 hours were palpation per rectum, ultrasonographic examination, radiographs, and abdominocentesis. Antimicrobials, fluids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common therapies administered. Approximately 25% of cases required surgery. An exploratory celiotomy was performed in approximately 15% of cases. Enterotomy, intestinal resection and anastomosis, cesarean section, or joint or sheath lavage was each performed in <5% of cases. Overall survival to discharge was 74%. Conclusions: Large animal emergency clinicians are required to have knowledge on a wide range of diseases and should be proficient at performing numerous procedures on an emergency basis. Gastrointestinal disease is the most common type of emergency and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission are a reflection of this type of case. Only 25% of cases required surgery. Additional research in the form of a multicenter study and surveying both private and university practitioners needs to be performed to further define the necessary skills for an ?ideal? large animal emergency clinician.

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of human suffering and disability for which disease-modifying treatments are lacking. OA occurs through complex and dynamic interplays between diverse factors over long periods of time. The traditional research and clinical focus on OA, the end stage disease, obscured understanding pathogenesis prior to reaching a common pathway defined by pain and functional deficits, joint deformity, and radiographic changes. To emphasize disease modification and prevention, we describe a multi-disciplinary systems-based approach encompassing biology, mechanics, and structure to define pre-osteoarthritic disease processes. Central to application of this model is the concept of ?pre-osteoarthritis,? conditions where clinical OA has not yet developed. Rather, joint homeostasis has been compromised and there are potentially reversible markers for heightened OA risk. Key messages from this perspective are (i) to focus research onto defining pre-OA through identifying and validating biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of OA risk, (ii) to emphasize multi-disciplinary approaches, and (iii) to propose that developing personalized interventions to address reversible markers of OA risk in healthy joints may be the key to prevention. Ultimately, a systems-based analysis of OA pathogenesis shows potential to transform clinical practice by facilitating development and testing of new strategies to prevent or delay the onset of osteoarthritis. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background and purpose:? White matter lesions (WMLs) caused by small vessel disease are common in elderly people and contribute to cognitive impairment. There are no established biochemical markers for WMLs. We aimed to study the relation between degree of WMLs rated on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of structural biomarkers associated with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and subcortical vascular dementia. Methods:? Fifty-three non-demented elderly individuals with WMLs were subjected to lumbar puncture. Degree of WMLs was rated using the Fazekas scale. Volumetric assessment of WMLs was performed. CSF samples were analyzed for the 40 and 42 amino acid fragments of amyloid ?, α- and ?-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein, total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau181), neurofilament light protein (NFL), sulfatide and CSF/Serum-albumin ratio. Results:? Fifteen subjects had mild, 23 had moderate and 15 had severe degree of WMLs. CSF-NFL levels differed between the groups (P?<?0.001) and correlated with the volume of WMLs (r?=?0.477, P?<?0.001). CSF sulfatide concentration displayed similar changes but less strongly. T-tau, P-tau181 and the different amyloid markers as well as CSF/S-albumin ratio did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions:? The association of increased CSF-NFL levels with increasing severity of WMLs in non-demented subjects suggests that NFL is a marker for axonal damage in response to small vessel disease in the brain. This manifestation may be distinct from or earlier than the neurodegenerative process seen in AD, as reflected by the lack of association between WMLs and AD biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract Following subarachnoid haemorrhage the most significant complication is sustained cerebral vascular contraction (vasospasm), which may result in terminal brain damage from cerebral infarction. Despite this, the biochemical cause of vasospasm remains poorly understood. In this study, the global high-concentration metabolite composition of CSF has been correlated with patient outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage using multivariate statistics and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In total, 16 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) were compared with 16 control patients who required a procedure where CSF was obtained but did not have aSAH. Multivariate statistics readily distinguished the aSAH group from the heterogeneous control group, even when only those controls with blood contamination in the CSF were used. Using principal components analysis and orthogonal signal correction, vasospasm was correlated to the concentrations of lactate, glucose and glutamine. These pattern recognition models of the NMR data also predicted Glasgow Coma Score (54% within ±?1 of the actual score on a scale of 1?15 for the whole patient group), Hunt and Hess SAH severity score (88% within ±?1 of the actual score on a scale of 1?5 for the aSAH group) and cognitive outcome scores (78% within ±?3 of the actual score on a 100% scale for the whole patient group). Thus, the approach allowed the prediction of outcome as well as confirming the presence of aSAH. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Background Autoantibodies to apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-ApoA-1 IgG) were shown to predict major adverse cardiovascular events and promote atherogenesis. However, their potential relationship with clinical disability and ischaemic lesion volume after acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) remains unexplored. Materials and methods We included n = 76 patients admitted for AIS and we investigated whether baseline serum anti-ApoA-1 IgG levels could predict (i) AIS-induced clinical disability [assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)], and (ii) AIS-related ischaemic lesion volume [assessed by Computed Tomography (CT)]. We also evaluated the possible pro-apoptotic and pro-necrotic effects of anti-ApoA-1 IgG on human astrocytoma cell line (U251) using flow cytometry. Results High levels of anti-ApoA-1 IgG were retrieved in 15·8% (12/76) of patients. Increased baseline levels of anti-ApoA-1 IgG were independently correlated with worse mRS [? = 0·364; P = 0·002; adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1·05 (95% CI 1·01?1·09); P = 0·017] and CT-assessed ischaemic lesion volume [? = 0·333; P < 0·001; adjusted OR: 1·06 (95% CI 1·01?1·12); P = 0·048] at 3 months. No difference in baseline clinical, biochemical and radiological characteristics was observed between patients with high vs. low levels of anti-ApoA-1 IgG. Incubating human astrocytoma cells with anti-ApoA-1 IgG dose dependently induced necrosis and apoptosis of U251 cells in vitro. Conclusion Anti-ApoA-1 IgG serum levels at AIS onset are associated with poorer clinical recovery and worse brain lesion volume 3 months after AIS. These observations could be partly explained by the deleterious effect of anti-ApoA-1 IgG on human brain cell survival in vitro and may have clinical implication in the prediction of poor outcome in AIS.

AB  - Abstract The last decade has seen the rapid development of untethered mobile micro- and nanorobots able to navigate liquids by means of external power sources or by harvesting chemicals from their surrounding media. These tiny devices hold great promise for applications in the biomedical field including targeted drug delivery, localized diagnostics, microsurgery, and cell stimulation. However, to translate small-scale robots from the laboratory to the clinic, many challenges remain. A major obstacle is the lack of imaging technologies that will allow for precise tracking of the devices in vivo. Here, the current progress, challenges, and future possibilities in the monitoring and tracking of biomedical micro- and nanomachines using established as well as less conventional imaging technologies are reviewed.

AB  - Summary Bariatric surgery can facilitate weight loss and improvement in medical comorbidities. It has a profound impact on nutrition, and patients need access to follow-up and aftercare. NICE CG189 Obesity emphasized the importance of a minimum of 2 years follow-up in the bariatric surgical service and recommended that following discharge from the surgical service, there should be annual monitoring as part of a shared care model of chronic disease management. NHS England Obesity Clinical Reference Group commissioned a multi-professional subgroup, which included patient representatives, to develop bariatric surgery follow-up guidelines. Terms of reference and scope were agreed upon. The group members took responsibility for different sections of the guidelines depending on their areas of expertise and experience. The quality of the evidence was rated and strength graded. Four different shared care models were proposed, taking into account the variation in access to bariatric surgical services and specialist teams across the country. The common features include annual review, ability for a GP to refer back to specialist centre, submission of follow-up data to the national data base to NBSR. Clinical commissioning groups need to ensure that a shared care model is implemented as patient safety and long-term follow-up are important.

AB  - The amount of myelin in the outer band of Baillarger in the human visual cortex stained by Luxol Fast Blue MBS, has been measured in normal individuals of wide age range, in a group of blind and severely visually impaired but otherwise normal individuals and in a series of demented patients of the Alzheimer and multi-infarct type who were apparently visually normal. The amount of myelin is found to be significantly reduced in the blind and demented groups. Examination of the lateral geniculate body in the blind cases demonstrated slight reduction in neuron numbers and marked reduction in mean neuron diameter. Neuronal cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid, nucleolar volume and numbers of tetraploid glial nuclei in the blind or visually impaired cases were significantly reduced when compared with controls, indicating reduced function in these neurons. Similar results were obtained on examining this nucleus in Alzheimer and multi-infarct cases, suggesting that the visual pathways may be involved in these conditions. It is concluded that loss of myelin from the outer band of Baillarger occurs in association with reduced function of neurons in the lateral geniculate body.
