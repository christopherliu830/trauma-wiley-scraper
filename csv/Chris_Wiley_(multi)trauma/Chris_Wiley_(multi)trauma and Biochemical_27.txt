AB  - The amount of myelin in the outer band of Baillarger in the human visual cortex stained by Luxol Fast Blue MBS, has been measured in normal individuals of wide age range, in a group of blind and severely visually impaired but otherwise normal individuals and in a series of demented patients of the Alzheimer and multi-infarct type who were apparently visually normal. The amount of myelin is found to be significantly reduced in the blind and demented groups. Examination of the lateral geniculate body in the blind cases demonstrated slight reduction in neuron numbers and marked reduction in mean neuron diameter. Neuronal cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid, nucleolar volume and numbers of tetraploid glial nuclei in the blind or visually impaired cases were significantly reduced when compared with controls, indicating reduced function in these neurons. Similar results were obtained on examining this nucleus in Alzheimer and multi-infarct cases, suggesting that the visual pathways may be involved in these conditions. It is concluded that loss of myelin from the outer band of Baillarger occurs in association with reduced function of neurons in the lateral geniculate body.

AB  - Abstract In this article, both sodium magnetic resonance (MR) and T1? relaxation mapping aimed at measuring molecular changes in cartilage for the diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis are reviewed. First, an introduction to structure of cartilage, its degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA) and an outline of diagnostic imaging methods in quantifying molecular changes and early diagnostic aspects of cartilage degeneration are described. The sodium MRI section begins with a brief overview of the theory of sodium NMR of biological tissues and is followed by a section on multiple quantum filters that can be used to quantify both bi-exponential relaxation and residual quadrupolar interaction. Specifically, (i) the rationale behind the use of sodium MRI in quantifying proteoglycan (PG) changes, (ii) validation studies using biochemical assays, (iii) studies on human OA specimens, (iv) results on animal models and (v) clinical imaging protocols are reviewed. Results demonstrating the feasibility of quantifying PG in OA patients and comparison with that in healthy subjects are also presented. The section concludes with the discussion of advantages and potential issues with sodium MRI and the impact of new technological advancements (e.g. ultra-high field scanners and parallel imaging methods). In the theory section on T1?, a brief description of (i) principles of measuring T1? relaxation, (ii) pulse sequences for computing T1? relaxation maps, (iii) issues regarding radio frequency power deposition, (iv) mechanisms that contribute to T1? in biological tissues and (v) effects of exchange and dipolar interaction on T1? dispersion are discussed. Correlation of T1? relaxation rate with macromolecular content and biomechanical properties in cartilage specimens subjected to trypsin and cytokine-induced glycosaminoglycan depletion and validation against biochemical assay and histopathology are presented. Experimental T1? data from osteoarthritic specimens, animal models, healthy human subjects and as well from osteoarthritic patients are provided. The current status of T1? relaxation mapping of cartilage and future directions is also discussed. Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The European Study Group on Diabetes and the Lower Extremity is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary network of 14 centres from ten countries. In 2003?2004, all patients treated in the participating centres because of a new diabetic foot ulcer (n?=?1232) were included in a prospective observational study. Subjects attended follow-up visits on a monthly basis until final outcome: healing of the foot, lower-leg amputation, death or non-healing after 1?year. During all visits, data were recorded on standardized case record forms by investigators who were trained during several plenary meetings and on-site visits. Unique aspects of the study were its size, the pan-European scope and the integrated/holistic approach for a multi-organ disease. In this review, the main findings of the study and its implications for diabetic foot care are discussed. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common medical emergency and may represent up to 14% of all diabetic admissions with an annual incidence of about 4.6 cases per 1,000 diabetics per year. A spectrum of disease is encountered and mortality rates vary in different series from 1.9% to 15%. The pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on interpretation of biochemistry results and on fluid and electrolyte resuscitation. A flexible approach to fluid resuscitation, careful interpretation of biochemistry results, and close monitoring should be combined with other standard aspects of management such as titratable insulin infusions and early treatment of identifiable precipitants in order to minimise morbidity and mortality.

AB  - ABSTRACT Linear-dendron (LD) hybrids are macromolecules comprising a linear polymer or oligomer conjugated at one or both termini with branched macromolecules called dendrons. Since their introduction approximately 2 decades ago, tremendous progress has been made in their synthesis, the study of their self-assembly, and toward their application in a variety of fields. This highlight is focused on aqueous assemblies of LD hybrids where function is imparted by the dendron, linear component, or both. These functions include the encapsulation and release of drug molecules, enhancement of cell uptake and targeting of specific tissues, and the stabilization of enzymes for catalysis. In addition, many stimuli-responsive LD hybrids that undergo changes in response to light, enzymes, pH, temperature, redox potential, or even multiple stimuli have been developed. LD hybrids can also be used to form networks via cross-linking reactions. Described here are the structure?property relationships underlying the functions of these materials, along with their potential applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

AB  - ABSTRACT The spatiotemporal analysis of the proteomic profile during human wound healing is a critical investigative step that can establish the complex interplay of molecular events that comprise the local response to burn injury. Partial-thickness wound samples with adjacent ?normal? skin were collected from twenty-one patients with burn wounds and examined across a time spectrum ranging from the acute injury period at 3, 6, 11 days to the later hypertrophic scar period at 7 and 15 months. The techniques used for histology-directed tissue analyses highlighted inflammatory protein markers at the early time points after injury with diminished expression as burn wounds progressed into the proliferative phase. The datasets show the usefulness of MALDI MS and imaging mass spectrometry as discovery approaches to identify and map the cutaneous molecular sequence that is activated in response to the unique systemic inflammatory response following burn trauma. This information has the potential to define the unique factors that predispose human burn victims to disfiguring hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.

AB  - Widespread expression of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), which maintains redox homeostasis, has recently been identified in the hair follicle (HF). Small molecule activators of NRF2 may therefore be useful in the management of HF pathologies associated with redox imbalance, ranging from HF greying and HF ageing via androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata to chemotherapy-induced hair loss. Indeed, NRF2 activation has been shown to prevent peroxide-induced hair growth inhibition. Multiple parameters can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species in the HF, for example melanogenesis, depilation-induced trauma, neurogenic and autoimmune inflammation, toxic drugs, environmental stressors such as UV irradiation, genetic defects and aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, the potential mechanisms whereby NRF2 activation could prove beneficial in treatment of redox-associated HF disorders are therefore discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Hindfoot arthritis is an important contributor to foot pain and physical disability. While the subtalar joint (STJ) is most frequently affected, anatomical variants such as facet configuration were suggested to further STJ cartilage deterioration. T2* mapping enables detection of ultra-structural cartilage change, particularly in thin cartilage layers, but its feasibility in the STJ has not yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmentation consistency and inter-scan short-term precision error of T2* mapping of talocalcaneal cartilage and to investigate the relationship between facet configuration and STJ T2* values. Using 3Tesla morphological magnetic resonance imaging, STJ configuration was categorized according to the degree of fusion between anterior, medial, or posterior facets. Subsequently, two repeats of multi-echo gradient recalled echo sequences were performed to obtain T2* maps with repositioning. Segmentation consistency of T2* values attained an ICC of 0.90 (95%CI 0.69?0.99). Precision errors comprised a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging 0.01?0.05, corresponding to a root mean square CV of 0.03?0.04. A 2-joint configuration type (i.e., fused anterior-medial facets) was significantly associated with a decrease in posterior facet T2* values (??=??0.6, p?=?0.046). STJ T2* mapping is a reliable method requiring at least a 4% difference within people to enable detection of significant change. Anatomical variants in STJ configuration were associated with T2* values with the more stable 3-joint types exhibiting more favorable cartilage outcomes. Longer-term larger-scaled studies focusing on arthritis pathology are needed to further support the use of T2* mapping in hindfoot disease monitoring. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Diabetic hyperglycemia can lead to stress-related cellular apoptosis of cardiac tissue. However, the mechanism by which hyperglycemia inflicts this damage on the structure and function of the heart is unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between proteome alterations, mitochondrial function, and major biochemical and electrophysiological changes affecting cardiac performance during simulated short-term hyperglycemia. Two-dimensional comparative proteomics analysis of rat hearts perfused with glucose at high (30?mM) or control (5.5?mM) levels revealed that glucose loading alters cardiomyocyte proteomes. It increased expression levels of initial enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and of enzymes of fatty acid ?-oxidation, with consequent up-regulation of enzymes of mitochondrial electron transport. It also markedly decreased expression of enzymes of glycolysis and the final steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glucose loading increased the rate of Bax-independent apoptosis. High glucose increased the duration of the action potential and elevated level of intracellular cytoplasmic calcium. Surprisingly, glucose loading did not influence levels of nitric oxide or mitochondrial superoxide in isolated cardiomyocytes. In summary, short-term simulated hyperglycemia attenuated expression of many anti-apoptotic proteins. This effect was apparently mediated via alterations in multiple biochemical pathways that collectively increased apoptotic susceptibility.

AB  - Abstract Denaturing CE (DCE) is a powerful tool for analysis of DNA variation. The development of commercial multi-CE instruments allows large-scale studies of DNA variation (many samples and many fragments). However, the cost of consumables like capillary arrays and sieving matrix might limit the use of DCE in such studies. Thus, we have tested 72?different in-house formulated sieving matrices' ability to suppress EOF and separate PCR-amplified alleles with the DCE variant, cycling temperature CE (CTCE). The data herein demonstrate that alleles can be baseline-separated by use of PVP and poly(N,N-dimethyl acrylamide) polymers at various percentages and pH. Allele separation by CTCE is matrix-independent and consequently applicable to any capillary instrument used for DNA separation. Formulation of sieving matrix for CTCE was done by dissolving appropriate amount of polymer powder into the running buffers. Allele separation was observed at different pH (7.5?8.5), concentrations and molecular size of the polymer, without compromising the separation and reproducibility. Finally, the cost reduction of homemade matrices is more than 1000-fold as compared to commercial sieving matrices.

AB  - Summary Background The wireless motility capsule concurrently measures temperature, pH and pressure as it traverses the gastrointestinal tract. Aims To describe normative values for motility/contractility parameters across age, gender and testing centres. Methods Healthy participants underwent a standardised wireless motility capsule assessment following an overnight fast and consumption of a meal of known nutritional content. Traces were divided into regions of interest and analysed using 2 software packages (MotiliGI and GIMS Data Viewer). Inter-observer agreement was independently assessed by 2 investigators. Results Normative data for motility/contractility parameters (maximum amplitude, mean peak amplitude, contraction frequency and motility index) are presented for 107 individuals (62 male, median age 40¬†years, range 18-78). MotiliGI-Gastric, small bowel and colonic maximal contraction amplitude correlated with age (r¬†=¬†.24, P¬†=¬†.01; r¬†=¬†.22, P¬†=¬†.02; and r¬†=¬†.2, P¬†=¬†.04 respectively). Small bowel motility index was higher in females than males (150.4¬†¬±¬†12 vs 122¬†¬±¬†7.6, P¬†=¬†.04). Inter-observer agreement was excellent for transit times, pH and contractility/motility parameters. GIMS Data viewer-Gastric, small bowel and colonic loge motility index correlated with the respective area under the contraction curve, total contractions, sum of amplitudes and contraction frequency (all r>.35, P¬†<¬†.0003) but not with transit times. Conclusions Our analysis provides normative data for motility/contractility parameters. Log motility index summarises a number of measures. In future, the measurement of contractile activity with the wireless motility capsule may potentially aid in the diagnosis of disease states such as visceral myopathic disorders.

AB  - Abstract Many diseases caused by inflammatory processes can progress to a chronic state causing deterioration in the quality of life and a poor prognosis for long-term survival. To address inflammatory diseases effectively, early detection and novel therapeutics are required. However, this can be challenging, in part because of the lack of early predictive biomarkers and the limited availability of adequate technologies capable of the identification/characterization of key predictive biomarkers present in biological materials, especially those found at picomolar concentrations and below. This review highlights the need for state-of-the art methodologies, with high-sensitivity and high-throughput capabilities, for determination of multiple biomarkers. Although many new biomarkers have been discovered recently, existing technology has failed to successfully bring this advancement to the patient's bedside. We present an overview of the various advances available today to extend the discovery of predictive biomarkers of inflammatory diseases; in particular, we review the technology of immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE), which combines the use of antibodies as highly selective capture agents with the high resolving power of capillary electrophoresis. This two-dimensional hybrid technology permits the quantification and characterization of several protein biomarkers simultaneously, including subtle structural changes such as variants, isoforms, peptide fragments, and post-translational modifications. Furthermore, the results are rapid, sensitive, can be performed at a relatively low cost, without the introduction of false positive or false negative data. The IACE instrumentation can have relevance to medical, pharmaceutical, environmental, military, cultural heritage (authenticity of art work), forensic science, industrial and research fields, and in particular as a point-of-care biomarker analyzer in translational medicine.

Therapeutic hypothermia, lowering of the core body temperature to 32 ¬∞C to 34 ¬∞C, may reduce injury to the brain in the period after the circulation has been restored. This therapy has been effective in neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and adults after witnessed ventricular fibrillation cardiopulmonary arrest. The effect of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiopulmonary arrest in paediatric patients is unknown. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia after paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11); Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to December 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to December 2011); Ovid CINAHL (1982 to December 2011); Ovid BIOSIS (1923 to December 2011); and Web of Science (1945 to December 2011). We searched the trials registry databases for ongoing trials. We also contacted international experts in therapeutic hypothermia and paediatric critical care to locate further published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing therapeutic hypothermia with normothermia or standard care in children, aged 24 hours to 18 years, after paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. Main results We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found four on-going randomized controlled trials which may be available for analysis in the future. We excluded 18 non-randomized studies. Of these 18 non-randomized studies, three compared therapeutic hypothermia with standard therapy and demonstrated no difference in mortality or the proportion of children with a good neurological outcome; a narrative report was presented.¬†¬† Authors' conclusions Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are needed and the results of on-going trials will be assessed when available. Plain Language Summary Therapeutic hypothermia as a neuroprotective therapy after cardiopulmonary arrest in children Cardiopulmonary arrest in children is uncommon however the numbers of children who survive are very low. Resulting brain injury in the survivors can be devastating for the child and family. Cooling the patient to a temperature of 32 ¬∞C to 34 ¬∞C, which is 3 ¬∞C to 4 ¬∞C below normal (therapeutic hypothermia), has previously been found to improve survival and reduce brain injury in newborn infants who were deprived of oxygen during birth, and also in adults following cardiopulmonary arrest. The causes of cardiopulmonary arrest are different in children than in adults, and asphyxia at birth is also different, so the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the proportion of children who survive or who have brain injury is unclear. We therefore conducted a Cochrane systematic review of the literature, searching medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) until December 2011 and contacting international experts for high quality published and unpublished evidence. Our searches failed to find any randomized controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria. However, we found four on-going trials which, when completed, may contribute to our review. At present there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute the use of therapeutic hypothermia within a few hours after return of spontaneous blood flow following cardiopulmonary arrest in children. International resuscitation guidelines currently recommend that doctors consider using the therapy in infants and children although more research is needed to be sure this is the correct recommendation with the lack of treatment options other than supportive care in an intensive care unit that are available.

AB  - Summary Liver disease in children differs greatly from that in adults. An infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (CHB) or a suspected inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) requires a referral to a specialist liver centre. Patients with liver disease require regular nutritional assessment. The frequency of assessment is determined by the stage and severity of liver disease. The causes of acute liver failure (ALF) include: infective (hepatitis A, B or C, cytomegalo-virus); IMD including haemochromatosis, galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia; toxins/drugs, (parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy or paracetamol overdose); and irradiation (radiotherapy). There are many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). The chance of requiring liver transplantation increases with advancing age and liver disease progression. Pancreatitis is the result of inflammation within the parenchyma of the pancreas; causes for pancreatitis in children differ from those of adults. Nutrition support is particularly important in acute pancreatitis caused by trauma.
