AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Abstract T1? describes the spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame and has been proposed for detecting damage to the cartilage collagen-proteoglycan matrix in osteoarthritis. In this study, a multi-slice T1? imaging method for knee cartilage was developed using spin-lock techniques and a spiral imaging sequence. The adverse effect of T1 regrowth during the multi-slice acquisition was eliminated by RF cycling. Agarose phantoms with different concentrations, 10 healthy volunteers, and 9 osteoarthritis patients were scanned at 3T. T1? values decreased as agarose concentration increased. T1? values obtained with imaging methods were compared with those obtained with spectroscopic methods. T1? values obtained during multi-slice acquisition were validated with those obtained in a single slice acquisition. Reproducibility was assessed using the average coefficient of variation of median T1?, which was 0.68% in phantoms and 4.8% in healthy volunteers. There was a significant difference (P = 0.002) in the average T1? within patellar and femoral cartilage between controls (45.04 ± 2.59 ms) and osteoarthritis patients (53.06 ± 4.60 ms). A significant correlation was found between T1? and T2; however, the difference of T2 was not significant between controls and osteoarthritis patients. The results suggest that T1? relaxation times may be a promising clinical tool for osteoarthritis detection and treatment monitoring. Magn Reson Med, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A female with clinical features of familial articular hypermobility syndrome (FAHS) and her family were studied. The subject showed generalized hypermobility, except for a painful shoulder which presented functional limitation with a diagnosis of painful shoulder syndrome. Biochemical studies demonstrated that collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) contents from skin biopsies of the subject and her family were almost normal. Nevertheless, the densitometric analysis of electrophoretic patterns showed differences in the relative proportions of their collagenous components. They were characterized by changes in type I and III collagens and the presence of type V collagen, in the subject, her father and brother. Also, they presented changes in the types of GAGs, when compared with those of normal skin. Morphological studies revealed a general disorganization of dermal components, a loose collagen network characterized by thick bundles. Also, besides cellular elements, the presence of an abundant darkly staining material was observed. Biochemical and morphological findings permit us to suggest a connective tissue defect, initially described in the FAHS, otherwise known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type XI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity of platelets of an age- and sex-matched group of controls was compared with several groups of inpatients having non-familial dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), Parkinson's disease (PD), multi-infarct dementia (MID), mixed types of these 3 diseases and a group of other central nervous system (CNS) organic disorders. All patients were subjected to several psychometric tests, including the Sandoz Clinical Assessment - Geriatric Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Mini-Mental State Examination and the Organic Mental Disorder Scale (OMDS). A statistically significant enhancement of MAO-B activity could be observed in DAT patients and in PD patients, whereas the MID group showed a mean activity similar to that of the control group and the group with other organic CNS disorders. In DAT patients the degree of dementia in the OMDS test and the enhancement of MAO activity were positively correlated, but PD did not show such a correlation. It is concluded that the increase of MAO activity in PD and in DAT might be due to a disease-related enhanced affinity to oxygen and to such oxygen-derived radicals as superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. However, a possible drug-induced enhancement of MAO activity in PD cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the MAO-B activity values in platelets of individual patients or controls are not indicative of diagnosis or prognosis of any of these diseases and are of no disease-related specificity.

AB  - A six-year-old, neutered, female golden retriever was presented with generalised, dark purple to black cutaneous nodules and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Histopathologically, all cutaneous nodules were diagnosed as benign cavernous haemangiomas. Endoscopic analysis revealed similar nodules in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. At laparotomy, similar nodules were seen on the visceral peritoneal lining of abdominal organs. Metastatic haemangiosarcoma was ruled out based on histological features and lack of primary tumour in spleen, liver or heart ultrasonographically. Blood loss associated with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was managed with blood transfusion. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first canine case of multi-system progressive angiomatosis resembling blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome in humans.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for almost a decade for hemophilic patients with inhibitors. Its off-label use as a hemostatic agent in massive bleeding caused by a wide array of clinical scenarios is rapidly expanding. While evidence-based guidelines exist for rFVIIa treatment in hemophilia, none are available for its off-label use. Objectives:?The aim of this study is to develop expert recommendations for the use of rFVIIa in patients suffering from uncontrolled bleeding (with special emphasis on trauma) until randomized, controlled trials allow for the introduction of more established evidence-based guidelines. Methods:?A multidisciplinary task force comprising representatives of the relevant National Medical Associations, experts from the Medical Corps of the Army, Ministry of Health and the Israel National Trauma Advisory Board was established in Israel. Recommendations were construed based on the analysis of the first 36 multi-trauma patients accumulated in the prospective national registry of the use of rFVIIa in trauma, and an extensive literature search consisting of published and prepublished controlled animal trials, case reports and series. The final consensus guidelines, together with the data of the first 36 trauma patients treated in Israel, are presented in this article. Results:?Results of the first 36 trauma patients: The prolonged clotting assays [prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)] shortened significantly within minutes following administration of rFVIIa. Cessation of bleeding was achieved in 26 of 36 (72%) patients. Acidosis diminished the hemostatic effect of the drug, while hypothermia did not affect it. The survival rate of 61% (22/36) seems to be favorable compared with published series of similar, or less severe, trauma patients (range 30%?57%). Conclusions:?As a result of the lack of controlled trials, our guidelines should be considered as suggestive rather than conclusive. However, they provide a valuable tool for physicians using rFVIIa for the expanding off-label clinical uses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delusions and misidentifications have been reported in dementia ranging from 10% to 73% in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and up to 40% in multi-infarct dementia (MID) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in 61 AD and 31 MID patients both the frequency and the content of delusions during the course of illness and to evaluate the relationship between these and both functional and mental decline. The results indicated that delusion experiences had occurred in 45% of AD patients and in 38% of MID patients, occurring most frequently during the first year of illness. Patients who experienced psychiatric symptoms showed higher mini mental state examination scores and were less impaired in functional disability measures. With regard to the content, no significant differences were observed between AD and MID patients; 53% of psychotic symptoms were found to be paranoid delusions while 47% were misidentification delusions.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI), which are mostly due to road traffic crash (RTC), are a major public health concern. This article describes the incidence, severity and outcome of TBI caused by RTC in New Caledonia over a five-year period. Methods: Data of all individuals admitted in intensive care unit with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤8 at admission) caused by RTC in New Caledonia from 2008 to 2012 were analysed. Causes and severity of trauma, demographic data, and short-term as well as last available long-term outcome of patients were analysed. Five types of road users were compared (car drivers, car passengers, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians). Outcome was defined according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale classification. Results: A total of 109 patients were included in the study. The median age of patients was 24 [IQR18?33] years with a sex ratio of 2.8 (80 men/29 women). The rate of 44 among Melanesian males was two times higher that among 16 European males (22/100,000 people vs 11/100,000 people). The total survival at the Intensive Care Unit discharge (short-term outcome) was 84%, being the highest among passengers (88%) and the lowest among motorcyclists (69%). Of the patients tested for psychoactive substances, half tested positive. Lost to follow-up rate was 67%. Conclusion: Poor outcome occurs in patients with RTC-related TBI, with young Melanesian men being the most affected. Public health action should focus on this group using culturally appropriate messages.

AB  - Abstract We consider a new concept of biometric-based cybersecurity systems for active authentication by continuous tracking, which utilizes biochemical processing of metabolites present in skin secretions. Skin secretions contain a large number of metabolites and small molecules that can be targeted for analysis. Here we argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual. Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable active authentication at the level of an individual.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) trauma often occurs in combination with injury to the articular cartilage of the knee, this can result in earlier radiographic evidence of post traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee compared to the contralateral, ACL intact knee; however, the biomechanical and biological mechanisms associated with the onset and progression of this disease are not understood. We sought to gain insight into the mechanisms by determining the relationship between articular cartilage injury associated with ACL trauma and the expression of synovial fluid biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism, and to evaluate the relationship between these biomarkers and the patient's perspective of the outcomes. Synovial fluid samples were acquired from 39 ACL injured subjects at an average of 10 weeks after injury, and 32 control subjects with normal knees (documented with clinical exam and MRI assessment). Subjects in the ACL-injured group were classified as low-risk for future OA if they displayed an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Grade 2 articular cartilage lesion or less and high-risk for future OA if they had an ICRS Grade 3A articular cartilage lesion. The patient's perspective of the injury was evaluated with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS). There were no significant differences in mean concentrations of the markers of type II collagen metabolism (CPII, C2C, and C1,2C) or the aggrecan breakdown Alanine?Arginine?Glycine?Serine (ARGS) -fragment between control subjects and the subjects in the low- and high-risk groups (p-value range: 0.80?0.43). Associations between ARGS-aggrecan concentration and KOOS subscales of symptoms and pain were significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.03 and p?=?0.01, respectively). Likewise, there was strong evidence in support of an association between the markers of type II collagen metabolism (C1,2C and CPII concentrations) and the KOOS subscale of pain between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.051 and 0.077, correspondingly). In ACL injured subjects with concomitant Grade 3A articular cartilage injuries, concentrations of synovial fluid ARGS-aggrecan were directly associated with improvements in KOOS symptoms and pain. These findings suggest the possible involvement of ARGS-aggrecan in a localized tissue repair response involving an increase in aggrecan turnover following severe knee trauma. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Induction of terpene synthase (TPS) gene expression and enzyme activity is known to occur in response to various chemical and biological stimuli in several species of spruce (genus Picea). However, high sequence identity between TPS family members has made it difficult to determine the induction patterns of individual TPS at the protein and transcript levels and whether specific TPS enzymes respond differentially to treatment. In the present study we used a multi-level approach to measure the induction and activity of TPS enzymes in protein extracts of Norway spruce (Picea abies) bark tissue following treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Measurements were made on the transcript, protein, enzyme activity and metabolite levels. Using a relatively new proteomics application, selective reaction monitoring (SRM), it was possible to differentiate and quantitatively measure the abundance of several known TPS proteins and three 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) isoforms in Norway spruce. Protein levels of individual TPS and DXS enzymes were differentially induced upon MeJA treatment and good correlation was generally observed between induction of transcripts, proteins, and enzyme activities. Most of the mono- and diterpenoid metabolites accumulated with similar temporal patterns of induction as part of the coordinated multi-compound chemical defense response. Protein and enzyme activity levels of the monoTPS (+)-3-carene synthase and the corresponding accumulation of (+)-3-carene was induced to a higher fold change than any other TPS or metabolite measured, indicating an important role in the induced terpenoid defense response in Norway spruce.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases.

AB  - Abstract Osteoporosis frequently coexists with other chronic diseases and syndromes of aging, and therefore multimorbidity interactions can potentially complicate its evaluation and treatment. This article reviews osteoporosis comorbidity interactions with select common diseases of aging including cardiovascular, neurologic, and geriatric syndromes, and select commonly used medications by older adults. Using depression as a case example, we describe the complex relationship between osteoporosis, mood, and antidepressant medications, and the implications of these interactions for patients and clinicians.

AB  - Abstract Van Buchem disease (VBD) is a rare bone sclerosing dysplasia caused by the lack of a regulatory element of the SOST gene, which encodes for sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived negative regulator of bone formation. We studied the demographic, clinical, biochemical, and densitometric features of 15 patients with VBD (12 adults and 3 children) and 28 related carriers of the gene mutation. The most common clinical findings in patients were facial palsy (100%) and various degrees of hearing impairment (93%); raised intracranial pressure had been documented in 20%. The clinical course of the disease appeared to stabilize in adulthood, with the majority of patients reporting no progression of symptoms or development of complications with time. Carriers of the disease had none of the clinical features or complications of the disease. Sclerostin could be detected in the serum in all but 1 VBD patients (mean 8.0?pg/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9?11.0?pg/mL), and were lower than those of carriers (mean 28.7?pg/mL; 95% CI, 24.5?32.9?pg/mL; p?<?0.001) and healthy controls (mean 40.0?pg/mL; 95% CI, 34.5?41.0?pg/mL; p?<?0.). Serum procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) levels were also significantly higher in adult patients (mean 96.0; 95% CI, 54.6?137.4?ng/mL versus mean 47.8; 95% CI, 39.4?56.2?ng/mL, p?=?0.003 in carriers and mean 37.8; 95% CI, 34.5?41.0?ng/mL, p?=?0.028 in healthy controls) and declined with age. Bone mineral density (BMD) was markedly increased in all patients (mean Z-score 8.7?±?2.1 and 9.5?±?1.9 at the femoral neck and spine, respectively); BMD of carriers was significantly lower than that of patients but varied widely (mean Z-scores 0.9?±?1.0 and 1.3?±?1.5 at the femoral neck and spine, respectively). Serum sclerostin levels were inversely correlated with serum P1NP levels (r?=??0.39, p?=?0.018) and BMD values (femoral neck r?=??0.69, p?<?0.001; lumbar spine r?=??0.78, p?<?0.001). Our results show that there is a gene-dose effect of the VBD deletion on circulating sclerostin and provide further in vivo evidence of the role of sclerostin in bone formation in humans. The small amounts of sclerostin produced by patients with VBD may explain their milder phenotype compared to that of patients with sclerosteosis, in whom serum sclerostin is undetectable. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the long-term outcome of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and pericardectomy for treatment of chylothorax in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Thirty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods Dogs were included if they had undergone a VATS TDL and pericardectomy and had at least 1-year follow-up or had died within 1 postoperative year. Medical records were evaluated, and recorded data included clinicopathological and diagnostic imaging results, surgical findings, complications, conversion rates, and long-term resolution and recurrence rates. Results Thirty-nine dogs met the inclusion criteria. Two dogs died intraoperatively; 1 was euthanized after severe restrictive pleuritis was diagnosed intraoperatively, and 1 underwent ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest during pericardectomy and could not be resuscitated. Conversion to an open approach was required in 1 of 39 (3%) dogs for TDL and 4 of 36 (11%) dogs for pericardectomy. Overall follow-up time was median 38 months (range, 3-115). Resolution of pleural effusion occurred in 35 of 37 (95%) dogs that survived the perioperative period. Late recurrence of pleural effusion was seen at 12, 12, and 19 months postoperatively in 3 of 35 (9%) dogs that survived the perioperative period and in which chylothorax had initially resolved. Conclusion Successful long-term resolution of chylothorax was seen in a high proportion of dogs that underwent VATS TDL and pericardectomy, although late recurrence was sometimes seen. Clinical significance Video-assisted thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation and pericardectomy are highly successful in dogs with chylothorax. Future studies should evaluate whether pericardectomy is required in dogs without evidence of pericardial disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective ED chest pain assessments can be challenging, lengthy and contribute to overcrowding. Rapid accurate risk stratification strategies should improve ED length of stay (EDLOS). Emergency, Biochemistry and Cardiology implemented new guidelines using paired (<3?h) multiple cardiac markers to stratify patients. The intervention would reduce chest pain EDLOS. We observed for safety and disposition effects. Methods This is a single-site, prospective observational, before and after intervention study. In December 2009, paired multiple cardiac markers, the second at least 4?h from pain, replaced late troponins. The 4 h rule (ED flow improvement) started in April 2009 (unplanned confounder). Demographics, clinical features, risk assessment and disposition; preferably prospective. Administrative datasets provided disposition outcomes, 4 months pre-/post-intervention. Follow up with partially blinded adjudications assessed for 45?day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Before intervention, consecutive patients were enrolled with mixed prospective/retrospective data. After, sampling occurred whenever prospective data were collected. Results Adjudicated patients were n?=?1029 (14.2% MI, 14.9% MACE), 426 before, 603 after. EDLOS reduced 87?min (416?329; P?<?0.001), similar to triage 2 patients without chest pain. Possibly, avoidable MACE occurred in five of 598 discharges (0.8%, CI 0.3?1.8%) with non-significant decreases (0.5%, CI 0.1?1.8%) post-intervention. Disposition changes included greater observation ward use (3.8?12.3%; P?<?0.001), more discharges (47.4?52.9%, P?=?0.002), less transfers (9.3?6.9%, P?=?0.014) and less late inpatient discharge decisions (15.2?8.7%, P?=?0.001). Conclusion Paired cardiac markers performed adequately for avoidable MACE, and disposition improved significantly. A confounding system change meant the reduced EDLOS (primary outcome) was unable to be associated with the intervention.
