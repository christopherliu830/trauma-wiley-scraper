AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The current 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines recommend transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVIs) as the therapy of choice for inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Most of the TAVIs worldwide are performed under general anaesthesia (GA). Although conscious sedation (CS) concepts are increasingly applied in Europe, it is still a matter of debate which concept is associated with highest amount of safety for this high-risk patient population. The aim of this single center, before-and-after study was to investigate feasibility and safety of CS compared with GA with respect to peri-procedural complications and 30-day mortality in patients scheduled for transfemoral TAVI (TF-TAVI). Methods From March 2012 until September 2014, patients scheduled for the TF-TAVI procedure were included in a prospective, observational manner. From the 200 patients finally included, 107 procedures were performed under GA, using either an endotracheal tube or a laryngeal mask, and balanced anaesthesia. CS was performed in 93 patients using low-dose propofol and remifentanil. Results Conversion to GA was needed 4 times due to procedural-related complications (4.3%), in one patient due to ongoing agitation (1.1%). The CS-group showed significantly shorter key time courses: anaesthesia time (105 [95-120] minutes vs 115 [105-140] minutes, P-value = 0.009, Mann-Whitney-U-test) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (1.6 [1.0-1.5] d vs 2.1 [1.0-2.0] d, P-value = 0.002, Mann-Whitney-U-test). The lowest mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the CS-group compared with the GA-group (74.3 mmHg vs 55.2 mmHg, P-value <0.0001, t-test). CS was associated with less requirements of norepinephrine (0.1 ?g/kg vs 2.3 ?g/kg, P-value <0.0001, Mann-Whitney-U-test). Conclusions Our single-center data demonstrate that CS is a feasible and safe alternative, especially with respect to a higher degree of intra-procedural haemodynamic stability, and a reduced length of stay in the intensive care unit.

AB  - ABSTRACT Biological psychiatry has four principal modes of investigation but each has been flawed by errors in procedure and inference such that the bulk of existing findings must be called into question. Pedigree studies are ruined by selective adoption, the use of ?throw-away kids? to demonstrate so-called genetic effects, lack of case history data, and lapses in ?blind? diagnosis. In particular, the Danish adoption studies are challenged, despite the field's insistence that this research has settled the nature-nurture controversy in schizophrenia. Pharmacological-response studies are the next line of methodology and these are marred by a spurious assumption that drugs which work must be correcting a biochemical imbalance that causes the condition. Thirdly, neuropsychological-neurophysiological studies are ?heuristic? fishing-expeditions to find a presumed abnormality to account for psychopathology, without doing the prospective longitudinal research necessary to validate such theory. Lastly, biochemical correlates of emotion are treated as if each emotion must have a distinct neuronal substrate rather than possibly representing a general visceral arousal where cognition defines the feeling. All told, biological psychiatry is often more reductionist than acknowledged, does not come up to current scientific standards, and uncritically cites work which is, or should be, discredited. At the heart of the problem is an implicit ideology within biological psychiatry, with insufficient awareness of its social ramifications: ?blaming the victim's body? protects the status quo by holding protoplasm at fault for maladjustment rather than the person, family, or community.

AB  - Objective To investigate the in vitro efficacy of commercially available topical otic preparations (?ear cleaners?) against Pseudomonas spp. isolated from canine ear infections. Methods Between January and May 2011, 50 isolates that were morphologically and phenotypically confirmed as Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 48 dogs that had been identified with clinical signs of otitis externa and media at a referral dermatology clinic in the north west of the UK. The in vitro efficacy of eight different topical preparations against these isolates was investigated using an in-agar inhibition test. Results Of the eight preparations tested, three showed consistently good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas spp., while a further three were consistently ineffective. For the remaining two -preparations, in vitro efficacy was variable and inconsistent. Clinical Significance Topical treatment with ear cleaners is considered to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of canine otitis that involves multi-antimicrobial-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. Where treatment with antimicrobials is not an option, the use of these preparations, as a sole form of therapy, may be effective in some cases. As a comparison with other similar studies looking at the activity of ear cleaners against bacterial isolates from otitis, this study uses isolates from 50 ears from 48 dogs providing a significant number of isolates for analysis.

AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.

AB  - Abstract Root resorption is a pathological process initiated by specific clastic cells which remove the organic and mineral components of dental hard tissues. Clastic cell activity in teeth is associated with a number of factors which include biomechanical forces, mechanical, surgical and chemical trauma, endodontic microorganisms and their toxins, developmental defects, neoplasia, and hormonal disturbances. The therapeutic measures which can regulate clastic activity include endodontic treatment, the use of specific anticlastic agents such as Ledermix paste, non-specific necrobiotic agents such as calcium hydroxide and trichloracetic acid, surgery or root surface conditioners. Accurate diagnosis is essential to the correct application of therapy. While some resorptions are self-limiting, others such as inflammatory root resorption require active and prompt endodontic preparation and medication to allow the control of clastic activity. One treatment regimen of invasive cervical and related conditions involves careful and accurate application of a chemical cauterising agent, trichloracetic acid, followed by curettage and restoration.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Abstract Functional chronic visceral pain (FCVP) is one of the most common causes of morbidity in the general population. Pain perceived within the abdomen may occur due to a range of different mechanisms according to the organ and their afferent pathways. Advances in our understanding of the complexities of FCVP could lead to the exploitation of contemporary research in order to develop and utilize our understanding of neurobiological and psychobiological visceral mechanisms in a clinical setting. This progression, together with increasing amounts of epidemiological and gender based information concerning specific abdominal pain syndromes can allow us to develop assessment tools that go beyond disease only analysis and move toward a more comprehensive assessment model so that patients may have access to expert or multidisciplinary management sooner, rather than later. Based on current evidence, one must consider the main contributors to pain, whether it is nociceptive, neuropathic or psychosocial or as is common with FCVP, a combination of all three. Aim.? This comprehensive assessment model should encompass not only systematic evaluation for reliable communication, but should also progress toward idiographic diagnosis relating to the uniqueness of the patient. This model should be practical in a multidisciplinary setting, taking into account the multi-faceted nature of this presentation.

AB  - Abstract The advent of antibiotics revolutionized the medical care resulting in significantly reduced mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. However, excessive use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistance and indeed, the incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens is considered as a major disadvantage in the medication strategy, which led the scholar?s attention toward innovative antibiotic sources in recent years. Medicinal plants contained a variety of secondary metabolites with a wide range of therapeutic potential against the resistant microbes. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the antibacterial potential of traditional herbal medicine against bacterial infections. About more than 200 Published research articles reporting the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against drug resistant microbial infections were searched using different databases such as Google scholar, Science Direct, PubMed and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) etc. with various keywords like Medicinal plants having antibacterial activities, antimicrobial potentials, phytotherapy of bacterial infection etc., and articles were selected related to the efficacious herbs easily available to local population addressing common pathogens. Various plants such as Artocarpus communis, Rheum emodi, Gentiana lutea L., Cassia fistula L., Rosemarinus officinalis, Argemone maxicana L, Hydrastis canadensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Cymbopogon citrates, Carica papaya, Euphorbia hirta etc. were found to have significant antibacterial activities. Although, herbal preparations have promising potential in the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial infection, but still, more research is required to isolate phytoconstituents, their mechanism of action as well as to find their impacts on human body.

AB  - Background? For families of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) getting a diagnosis is a traumatic experience on which future care and education plans for the child depend. In this paper parental experiences of diagnosis and forward planning for children with ASD are reported. Method? This paper is part of a large cross-sectional study conducted in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that assessed the needs and experiences of parents of children diagnosed with ASD. Questionnaires were designed and completed by 95 parents, reporting on 100 children, as well as 67 multi-disciplinary professionals. Results? Findings confirm that diagnostic and planning processes are extremely stressful for parents, that statutory diagnosis takes a long time, that care and education plans do not include full parental participation, and that reviews of plans do not consistently include intervention data. Conclusion? Policy and practice implications of these findings are important for future revisions of diagnostic tools and manuals.

AB  - Abstract Major haemorrhage is a leading cause of death in critically ill or injured patients requiring medical retrieval and presents significant clinical and logistic challenges irrespective of patient location, primary pathophysiology or mode of transport. It is essential that all care providers involved in the retrieval patient pathway, including referring hospitals, ambulance services, retrieval teams and tertiary receiving centres, adopt a common approach to the management of this complex patient group through the use of retrieval-specific, integrated protocols. These should incorporate the latest clinical evidence base, recognise the differences between primary and inter-facility missions and clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the retrieval clinical coordinator. By unifying the response across services, the aim is to facilitate seamless transition of care with ongoing damage control resuscitation from point of referral, during transfer and on arrival at the receiving centre.

Further systematic investigations of several HLA-A*0201?peptide complexes confirmed the importance of anchor residues and water molecules in peptide binding, and quantitatively showed that: (i) the primary and second anchor residues provide a larger binding energy contribution (>3?kcal/mol) than the non-anchor residues (<2?kcal/mol), (ii) native hydrophobic anchor residues replaced by polar amino acids will lead to a significant destabilization for bound complexes (>4?kcal/mol), and (iii) water molecules contribute significantly to stabilization of the complexes (>8?kcal/mol). We believe that this work is helpful for elucidating the roles of anchor residues and water molecules in peptides recognized and bound by HLA-A*0201.

AB  - Summary This report describes a case of a multiple-drug resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii associated with bronchopneumonia in a horse. A 6-month-old Thoroughbred colt was examined for a chronic lower respiratory tract disease. Prior to presentation to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UVTH), the colt had been treated intensively in a private equine hospital for presumed antimicrobial-induced enterocolitis following treatment with azithromycin and rifampin, and had been discharged on treatment of doxycycline for continued lower airway abnormalities. At the UVTH, investigation of the lower airway disease included a culture of a percutaneous transtracheal wash, which identified a multiple-drug resistant strain of A. baumannii as the causative agent with sensitivity only to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim sulphonamides. Following treatment with marbofloxacin there was full resolution of the bronchopneumonia. A. baumannii is a major nosocomial pathogen associated with infections in both animals and man and reports of multiple-drug resistant strains have been documented worldwide. Outbreaks of A. baumannii infections have been reported to occur in very ill human patients housed in healthcare settings such as intensive care units, and are characterised by the rapid development of resistance to the majority of antimicrobials. The difficulties in the treatment of such cases as well as the potential risk of transmission within a veterinary clinical setting are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of a novel controlled-release formulation of carbimazole in feline hyperthyroidism. Methods: A multicentre, self-controlled study in 44 client-owned cats with history and clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, and total thyroxine concentration greater than or equal to 50 nmol/l. Treatment was started at 15 mg once daily, response assessed after 10 days, and 3, 5, 8, 26 and 53 weeks and dose adjusted as required. Results: The median dose of carbimazole was 10 mg (range 10 to 15 mg) and 15 mg (5 to 25 mg) once daily after 3 and 53 weeks, respectively. Median total thyroxine concentration dropped significantly from 118 nmol/l (50 to 320 nmol/l) at presentation to 33 nmol/l (n=40) after 10 days, 31 nmol/l (n=34) at 3 weeks and 21 nmol/l (n=18) at 53 weeks. Clinical signs improved or resolved in almost all cats within three weeks after starting treatment. Twenty-one adverse reactions possibly (20) or probably (1) related to treatment were reported. During treatment, increased blood urea nitrogen concentration was observed in 25 per cent of the cats, eosinophilia in 20 per cent and lymphopenia in 16 per cent, while liver enzymes tended to improve. Clinical Significance: Once daily administration of controlled-release carbimazole tablets was effective and had expected tolerance in hyperthyroid cats during short- and long-term treatment.
