AB  - Even organs from an ideal donor will occasionally develop primary graft dysfunction (PGD) causing a significant morbidity and mortality after transplantation. It is likely that this situation represents subtle undetectable levels of ongoing donor organ dysfunction. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of PGD between lung, kidney and heart recipients from the one donor. From 202 multiorgan donors, contributed 231 consecutive lung transplants at the Alfred Hospital, 378 kidney and 114 heart transplants were subsequently performed at multiple centers across Australia and New Zealand. Eight hundred seventy-five organs were used for 723 transplants. The incidence of PGD after lung, kidney and heart transplants was 20% (47/231), 24% (92/378) and 20% (23/114), respectively. In paired single organ recipients, PGD in one of the pair was a significant risk factor for the development of PGD in the other [lung: odds ratio = 5.63 (1.72?18.43), p = 0.004; kidney: odds ratio = 3.19 (1.90?5.35), p < 0.0001]. In multivariate analysis, same donor heart PGD [3.37 (1.19?9.50), p = 0.02] was an independent risk factor for lung PGD and same donor lung PGD was significant risk factor for kidney PGD [1.94 (1.01?3.73), p = 0.04], if the PGD status of the paired kidney was not known. There was a significant association for the development of PGD across different organs transplanted from the same donor.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mutations in genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis and structural diversity of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) cause a variety of disorders affecting bone and connective tissues, including Desbuquois dysplasia (DD). In an infant with prenatal-onset disproportionate short stature, joint laxity, and radiographic findings typical for DD compound-heterozygosity for a large intragenic deletion, and a p.Pro384Arg missense mutation in CSGALNACT1 was found. CSGALNACT1 encodes chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (CSGalNAcT-1, ChGn-1), which initiates chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain biosynthesis on the so-called GAG-protein linker region tetrasaccharide. Biochemical studies revealed a reduced GalNAc-transferase activity of the Arg-384 mutant protein, whereas no differences in proteoglycan synthesis in fibroblasts and the GAG content in the urine were found between patient and controls. This is the first description of bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in CSGALNACT1 that produce a skeletal dysplasia reminiscent of the skeletal dysplasia of Csgalnact1?/? mice, and adds to the genetic heterogeneity of DD.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

Vertical integration has been achieved by consideration of the five stages of medical education, with the undergraduate emergency medicine contributions coming in the junior clinical student and senior clinical student stages. Horizontal integration has been achieved by defining the complete emergency medicine undergraduate curriculum and identifying those parts not adequately covered elsewhere. This paper describes how this process was achieved at the Christchurch School of Medicine.

AB  - Summary Various aetiopathological mechanisms have been postulated to be at the root of Menière's disease (MD), and some data suggest that there may be also an underlying autoimmune factor. In fact, Menière patients manifest certain characteristics that are typical of autoimmune involvement association of particular human leucocyte antigen haplotypes, the presence of antibodies against internal ear antigens. In this study, we evaluated the association between thyroid autoimmunity and MD in a non-selected group of patients. We recruited 50 consecutive MD patients and two groups as controls: group A, 82 healthy volunteers; and group B, 50 subjects suffering from acute unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy. All subjects were submitted to instrumental assessment of cochlear?vestibular function and analysis of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, anti-TSH receptor antibody (TR-Ab), anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (Tg-Ab) in the blood. The prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis in group B [6/50 (12%); 66·7% TPO-Ab and 33·3% Tg-Ab] was superimposable with the healthy controls [6/82 (7%); 66·7% TPO-Ab and 33·3% Tg-Ab]. In contrast, 38% of the MD patients (P?= 0·0001 versus group A and group B) had significant autoantibody levels (68·4% TPO-Ab; 15·8% TPO-Ab?+?TR-Ab; 10·5% Tg-Ab; 5·2% TPO-Ab?+?Tg-Ab). Furthermore, 14% of the MD patients were hyperthyroid under l-thyroxine therapy, while no dysfunction was seen in the control groups. Overall, our data demonstrate a significant association between MD and thyroid autoimmunity, which suggests that an autoimmune factor is involved in the aetiopathogenesis of this disease. These findings suggest that it should be useful to submit MD patients to multi-disciplinary clinical investigation.

AB  - Abstract Objective Prognostic models are commonly used in the clinical setting. The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of the Rapid Emergency Medical Score (REMS) or alternate models. Methods A retrospective cohort study of critical care patients who underwent retrieval service transfer to an ICU in a single state-wide service in Victoria, Australia. All patients aged 18 years and over transferred to an ICU between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2013. Retrieval and ICU datasets were probabilistically linked. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the capacity of physiological markers and patient characteristics to predict in-hospital mortality in the ICU population. The prediction performance was evaluated using measures of discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration (Hosmer?Lemeshow [H-L statistic]?). Results There were 1776 ICU patients who were transferred and 1749 (98.5%) had complete data. Of the 1749 patients with complete data, 257 (14.7%) died in-hospital. The REMS calculated at the time of retrieval referral demonstrated borderline predictive capability (C-statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.62?0.76). Following logistic regression analysis of the REMS components, final variables included in the Retrieval REMS model were age, mean arterial pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale score. This model demonstrated acceptable predictive capability (C-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.64?0.79). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) Retrieval REMS for survivors and non-survivors, respectively, were 7 (5, 10) and 9 (7, 11), P < 0.01. Conclusions The availability of a validated tool such as Retrieval REMS assists recognition of high-risk patients and consideration of this risk in retrieval mission planning and response.

AB  - The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to generate clinically acceptable prostate permanent seed implant plans using two seed types which are identical except for their activity. The IPSA inverse planning algorithms were modified to include multiple dose matrices for the calculation of dose from different sources, and a selection algorithm was implemented to allow for the swapping of source type at any given source position. Five previously treated patients with a range of prostate volumes from were re-optimized under two hybrid scenarios: (1) using 0.32 and , and (2) using 0.64 and . Isodose lines were generated and dosimetric indices, , , , , , , and were calculated. The algorithm allows for the generation of single-isotope, multi-activity hybrid brachytherapy plans. By dealing with only one radionuclide, but of different activity, the biology is unchanged from a standard plan. All were within 2.3 percentage points for every plan and always above the clinically desirable 95%. All were identically zero, and is always below the clinically acceptable value of . Clinical optimization times for the hybrid plans are still under one minute, for most cases. It is possible to generate clinically advantageous brachytherapy plans (i.e. obtain the same quality dose distribution as a standard single-activity plan) while incorporating leftover seeds from a previous patient treatment. This method will allow a clinic to continue to provide excellent patient care, but at a reduced cost. Multi-activity hybrid plans were equal in quality (as measured by the standard dosimetric indices) to plans with seeds of a single activity. Despite the expanded search space, optimization times for these studies were still under two minutes on a modern day laptop and can be reduced to below one minute in a clinical setting. With the typical cost of a set of PPI seeds on the order of thousands of dollars, it is possible to reduce the cost of brachytherapy treatments by allowing for easier use of seeds left over from a previous patient or unused due to a cancelled treatment.

Methods: In this study, the data of 42 dogs with the diagnosis of leptospirosis were evaluated retrospectively. Dogs were presented to the Small Animal Medicine Teaching Hospital (Medizinische Kleintierklinik) of the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany, between 1990 to 2003. Results: Reactivity to the serogroup grippotyphosa (13/42) was most frequently present, followed by reactivity to the serogroup saxkoebing (10/42). There was no difference in the clinical picture and the laboratory changes between dogs whose sera were reactive to different serogroups. Clinical Significance: Most of the dogs with leptospirosis in southern Germany had sera reacting to serogroups other than icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola, which are contained in the vaccine. Thus, currently available vaccines in Europe do not protect against the most common Leptospira organisms associated with clinical disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives:? Coronary artery disease (CAD), as the leading cause of death, poses a huge economic burden on health-care systems. We used a multi-marker approach to explore discriminative abilities of several lipid, inflammatory, and oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers as CAD predictors. We assessed their cost-effectiveness compared with the Framingham risk score (FRS). Methods:? Using a decision model, we evaluated the costs, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of each model. The FRS was used as the baseline model. Other models were formed with the consecutive addition of selected markers: apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein B (apoB), apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)] isoform, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase (SOD), sulfhydryl, and superoxide anion (O2-). A best-case model was formed from a combination of diagnostic markers to yield the best patient stratification algorithm. All models were assessed by their predictive probabilities using receiver operating characteristic curves. To accomplish our goals, we recruited 188 CAD patients (verified by coronary angiography) and 197 asymptomatic CAD-free subjects for comparison. The analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective. Results:? Only two strategies had outstanding discriminative abilities: the best-case model (FRS, SOD, and O2-) and FRS plus SOD with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.924 and 0.906, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratio varied between ?593 per AUC for the baseline model to ?2425 per AUC for FRS plus apo(a) isoform. Strategies involving oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers were more cost-effective than strategies involving lipid or inflammatory markers. All results were robust. Conclusion:? Our results support the feasibility of a multimarker approach for CAD screening. The introduction of oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers in the clinical laboratory would be convenient and cost-effective.

AB  - Summary Background Even if horses strictly depend on the gut microbiota for energy homeostasis, only a few molecular studies have focused on its characterisation and none on the perinatal gut microbial colonisation process. Objectives To explore the perinatal colonisation process of the foal gut microbial ecosystem and the temporal dynamics of the ecosystem assembly during the first days of life. Study design Longitudinal study. Methods Thirteen Standardbred mare-foal pairs were included in the study. For each pair, at delivery we collected the mare amniotic fluid, faeces and colostrum, and the foal meconium. Milk samples and faeces of both mare and foal were also taken longitudinally, until day 10 post-partum. Samples were analysed by means of next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on Illumina MiSeq. Results Our findings suggest that microbial components derived from the mare symbiont communities establishes in the foal gut since fetal life. After birth, an external transmission route of mare microorganisms takes place. This involves a rapid and dynamic process of assembling the mature foal gut microbiome, in which the founder microbial species are derived from both the milk and the gut microbial ecosystems of the mare. Main limitations The inability to discriminate between live and dead cells, the possible presence of contaminating bacteria in low biomass samples (e.g. meconium and amniotic fluid), the limits of the phylogenetic assignment down to species level, and the presence of unassigned operational taxonomic units. Conclusions Our data highlight the importance of mare microbiomes as a key factor for the establishment of the gut microbial ecosystem of the foal.

AB  - In accordance with recent terminology, it is proposed that malignant mesenchymoma should be renamed ?composite sarcoma? and defined as ?a sarcoma composed of two or more cellular types each of which is sufficiently differentiated to permit clear recognition of its histogenetic type microscopically, immunohistochemically or ultrastructurally; excluding fibrosarcomatous and high-grade pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomatous component, dedifferentiated sarcoma and the combination of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma which is regarded as a single histogenetic type?. Four cases of primary osseous composite sarcoma (POCS) were identified among 928 primary bone sarcomas. Their age ranged from 10 to 87 years, peak incidence in the second decade with equal sex distribution. Most presented with pain, commonest in the knee, affecting the metaphysis, appearing radiologically as expansile infiltrative osteolytic lesions with cortical erosion, periosteal reaction, variable extent of osteoblastic areas and soft tissue extension. All contained variable amounts of conventional high-grade osteosarcoma with or without chondrosarcoma component; the other constituents were liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. In all cases, Ki67 proliferative index was over 35%, there was no CDK4 and MDM2 amplification. The absence of low-grade component supported the de novo origin of POCS rather than derivation from divergent dedifferentiation. The two older patients with hitherto undescribed osteoleiomyosarcoma died 2 and 10 months after operation, whereas the two younger with osteorhabdomyosarcoma and osteoliposarcoma enjoyed disease-free survival at 16 and 6 years after chemotherapy despite the latter showing lung metastasis at presentation. Identification of the different lines of differentiation together with their approximate amounts and histological grades is therefore mandatory for POCS as multi-agent chemotherapy catered for each sarcoma component might offer hope for long-term disease-free survival.

AB  - Abstract A novel living hyaline cartilage graft (LhCG) with controllable dimensions and free of non-cartilaginous constituents for articular regeneration is developed. As a living graft for regenerative medicine, LhCG is purely living tissue based and truly scaffold-free. The process of neotissue formation in LhCG is mediated by an interim biomaterial-based novel scaffolding system. This design highlights a philosophy of using biomaterials in engineered regenerative medicine as a transient guiding facility rather than a permanent part of substitute. The fabrication is designed and practiced in a continuous and integrated process, which attributes to its simplicity in operation. Because of the intrinsic non-cell-adhesive property of hydrogel scaffolds, articular chondrocytes? phenotype is always preserved throughout the whole procedure, which has been tested and approved both in vitro and in vivo. In situ grafting trials in a rabbit model showcase high success rates in both cartilage repair and graft-host integration. Beyond cartilage repair, this LhCG model may provide a living-tissue-based open platform or niche for multi-tissue regenerations.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study is to establish a new experimental model of hematogenous implant-related infection (IRI) by a community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strain. Cylindrical porous tantalum intramedullary implants were inserted in the proximal right tibia of 30 male white rabbits after administration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Four weeks later and without antibiotic prophylaxis, 20 animals received 1 ml of inoculum of two different concentrations (study groups A and B) of CA-MRSA strain through an ipsilatelar femoral artery catheter. The remaining 10 received normal saline instead (control group C). Surviving animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later. Sterile bone, bone marrow biopsies, and implants were harvested for culture and histological evaluation. Ten animals receiving 5???108cfu/ml (group A) died within 48?72 h due to septic shock. Blood cultures were positive; histology demonstrated acute infection. Ten animals received bacterial load of 3???108cfu/ml (group B) and all survived; two had negative Gram-stain and cultures but PCR and RT-PCR results demonstrated the viability of the microorganisms, while periprosthetic osteolysis and histological evaluation indicated subacute osteomyelitis; eight animals established periprosthetic infection, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis documented by positive Gram-stain, cultures, subperiosteal reaction, and chronic infection on histology. Control group specimens demonstrated no signs of infection. Histopathological semiquantitative scoring was used to compare the three groups. Comparison of groups A and B with control group and between group A and B showed statistically significant difference (p?<?0.05) in all parameters except for periosteal reaction between groups B and C (p?=?0.354). This novel, reproducible experimental model will facilitate the study of hematogenous CA-MRSA IRIs. ? 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adult skeletal muscle can regenerate effectively after mild physical or chemical insult. Muscle trauma or disease can overwhelm this innate capacity for regeneration and result in heightened inflammation and fibrotic tissue deposition resulting in loss of structure and function. Recent studies have focused on biomaterial and stem cell-based therapies to promote skeletal muscle regeneration following injury and disease. Many stem cell populations besides satellite cells are implicated in muscle regeneration. These stem cells include but are not limited to mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, pericytes, fibroadipogenic progenitors, side population cells, and CD133+ stem cells. However, several challenges associated with their isolation, availability, delivery, survival, engraftment, and differentiation have been reported in recent studies. While acellular scaffolds offer a relatively safe and potentially off-the-shelf solution to cell-based therapies, they are often unable to stimulate host cell migration and activity to a level that would result in clinically meaningful regeneration of traumatized muscle. Combining stem cells and biomaterials may offer a viable therapeutic strategy that may overcome the limitations associated with these therapies when they are used in isolation. In this article, we review the stem cell populations that can stimulate muscle regeneration in vitro and in vivo. We also discuss the regenerative potential of combination therapies that utilize both stem cell and biomaterials for the treatment of skeletal muscle injury and disease. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Frequency response analysis is applied to analyze NIR-TRS spectra in a tissue model with a simulated thrombus. The value changes in parameters obtained from frequency response analysis are correlated with heterogeneity position in three dimensions. The goal of this research is to noninvasively localize deep vein thrombosis in the human leg through the use of this novel combination.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether elevated canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (CPLI) concentrations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Methods: Serum CPLI assays were performed on serum stored from cases diagnosed with IBD. Thirty-two dogs with CPLI results within the reference range were designated as the control group and 15 dogs had CPLI above the reference range. Clinical signs, age, serum lipase and amylase activities, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, abdominal ultrasound examination, histopathology on small intestinal biopsies, management of IBD and outcome were compared between the two groups. Results: No significant differences were found in clinical activity score (P=0·54), number of antibiotic-responsive disease cases (P=0·480), number of steroid-responsive disease cases (P=0·491), serum amylase activity (P=0·058), serum cobalamin concentration (P=0·61), serum albumin concentration (P=0·052), abdominal ultrasound score (P=0·23) and histopathology scores for IBD (P=0·74) between the two groups. Dogs with increased CPLI concentration were significantly older and had a higher serum lipase activity than dogs with a CPLI concentration within the normal reference range (P=0·001, P=0·001, respectively). Moreover, dogs with increased CPLI concentration responded poorly to steroid treatment (P=0·01) and were significantly more likely to be euthanased at follow-up (P=0·02). Clinical Significance: CPLI should be measured in cases of canine IBD as elevated CPLI was associated with a worse outcome.

AB  - Summary Epilepsy can be a devastating disorder. In addition to debilitating seizures, epilepsy can cause cognitive and emotional problems with reduced quality of life. Therefore, the major aim is to prevent the disorder in the first place: identify, detect, and reverse the processes responsible for its onset, and monitor and treat its progression. Epilepsy often occurs following a latent period of months to years (epileptogenesis) as a consequence of a brain insult, such as head trauma, stroke, or status epilepticus. Although this latent period clearly represents a therapeutic window, we are not able to stratify patients at risk for long-term epilepsy, which is prerequisite for preventative clinical trials. Moreover, because of the length of the latent period, an early biomarker for treatment response would be of high value. Finally, mechanistic biomarkers of epileptogenesis may provide more profound insight in the process of disease development.
