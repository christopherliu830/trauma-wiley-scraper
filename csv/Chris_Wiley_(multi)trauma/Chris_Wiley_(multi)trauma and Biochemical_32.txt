AB  - Abstract The paper provides a brief overview of the use of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in the areas of bone regenerative medicine. Reconstruction of bone defects caused by trauma, non-union, and bone tumor excision, still faces many challenges despite the intense investigations and advancement in bone-tissue engineering and bone regeneration over the past decades. IONPs have promising prospects in this field due to their controlled responsive characteristics in specific external magnetic fields and have been of great interest during the last few years. This Minireview aims to summarize the relevant progress and describes the following five aspects: (i) The general introduction of IONPs, with a focus on the magnetic properties as the base of application; (ii) using IONPs as tools to study and control stem cells for better treatment efficacy in stem-cell-based bone defect repair; (iii) the use of IONPs and their complexes in the delivery of therapeutic agents, including chemical drug molecules, growth factors, and genetic materials, to promote osteogenesis-related cell function and differentiation, healthy bone tissue growth, and functional reconstruction; (iv) magneto-mechanical actuation in the regulation of cells distribution, mechano-transduction membrane receptors activation, and mechanosensitive signaling pathways regulation, and (v) fabrication, characteristics, and in?vitro and in?vivo osteogenic effects of magnetic composite bone scaffolds. Ongoing prospects are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multi-functional growth factors belonging to the transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) superfamily. BMPs are expressed in a large variety of tissues and organs, where they exhibit pleiotropic functions during development as well as in the adult organism. Thus maintenance of the BMP signaling pathways requires strict control and regulation by antagonists, co-receptors and inhibitors. BMPs exert their signals by binding to hetero-oligomeric signaling complexes composed of type I and type II receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity. They play a decisive role in the development of several diseases but are also involved in self-renewal of stem cells and tissue regeneration. These insights may lead to the design of future therapeutic treatments. This review focuses on the differential BMP signaling pathways initiated at distinct oligomerized signaling complexes as well as on the pathological aspects of BMP signaling in diseases and their potential for tissue regeneration.

AB  - Summary Epilepsy can be a devastating disorder. In addition to debilitating seizures, epilepsy can cause cognitive and emotional problems with reduced quality of life. Therefore, the major aim is to prevent the disorder in the first place: identify, detect, and reverse the processes responsible for its onset, and monitor and treat its progression. Epilepsy often occurs following a latent period of months to years (epileptogenesis) as a consequence of a brain insult, such as head trauma, stroke, or status epilepticus. Although this latent period clearly represents a therapeutic window, we are not able to stratify patients at risk for long-term epilepsy, which is prerequisite for preventative clinical trials. Moreover, because of the length of the latent period, an early biomarker for treatment response would be of high value. Finally, mechanistic biomarkers of epileptogenesis may provide more profound insight in the process of disease development.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Summary This chapter is an overview of basic patient evaluation with an eye to anesthetic planning. Important things to evaluate are the patient's overall health status with a thorough physical examination, temperament, body condition score, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Basic blood work can include just a Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and Total Protein (TP) in healthy patients who are young with no systemic disease. Other tests will be indicated in patients who are geriatric or who have significant disease. The full gamut of possible tests that can be run are outside of the scope of this chapter.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR; synonymous with NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) is a universal physical technique best known for non-invasive detection and anatomical mapping of water protons (H). MR-spectroscopy (MRS) records protons from tissue chemicals other than water, intrinsic phosphorus containing metabolites, sodium, potassium, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. MRS is therefore an imaging technique with the potential to record human and animal biochemistry in vivo. As a result of wide availability of MRI equipment in research laboratories and hospitals, MRS is a serious competitor with PET to define normal body composition and its perturbation by pharmacological and pathological events. This article describes practical aspects of in vivo MRS with particular emphasis on the brain, where novel metabolites have been described. A survey of these new aspects of neurochemistry emphasize their practical utility as neuronal and axonal markers, measures of energy status, membrane constituents, and osmolytes, as well as some xenobiotics, such as alcohol. The concept of multinuclear in vivo MRS is illustrated by diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of several human brain disorders. Although these methods are currently most frequently encountered in human studies, as well as with transgenic and knockout mouse models, MRS adds a new dimension to anatomic and histopathologic descriptions.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, expected outcomes, equipment, fluoroscopic procedure, special considerations, alternative uses, and the complication examples for pleural space disease. Pneumothorax and pleural effusions are common causes of respiratory distress in companion animals. A surgical approach is used for placement of the port associated with permanent pleural drainage and a basic surgical pack and sterile drapes are needed. Temporary drainage of the thoracic cavity can be easily achieved through the placement of an intra-thoracic catheter. Port placement is always performed with the patient under general anesthesia and controlled ventilation. Thoracic drainage catheters can also be used for infusion. Alternatively, cases of pyothorax, in which medical management is being pursued, may require thoracic lavage and drainage. The temporary thoracic drainage catheters can be used for this purpose; however, ports should not be used as they may become occluded or infected after suction.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Objective To review the intellectual history of concussion from the mid-19th century to the opening decade of the 21st century. Background Head injuries (HI) and their acute and long-term effects have been investigated for centuries, with major reviews of the topic appearing by 1870. Thus, while it has long been acknowledged that chronic traumatic encephalopathy was first described by Harrison Martland in 1928, an examination of the history of concussion research up to Martland's seminal report places his studies in a deeper historical context. This history makes clear that Martland's findings were one among many such studies showcasing the lasting dangers of blows to the head. In the years after Martland published his study, his paper was frequently cited in other papers that made clear that blows to the head, of all ranges of severity, were dangerous injuries with potentially life-changing consequences. Methods The author has engaged in an historical analysis of the development and elaboration of concussion research in clinical medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, and those scientific disciplines related to clinical medicine. The author has found numerous primary sources from the history of medicine and science that describe the acute and chronic effects of single and repeated sub-concussive and concussive blows to the head. Results This study makes clear that evidence-based methodologies inevitably short-change the knowledge of past clinicians and scientists by holding these figures to normative standards of recent invention. What criticism of this kind fails to recognize is that past investigators, many of them pioneers in their fields, published their work in ways that matched the highest normative standards of their day for the presentation of evidence. Conclusions It has been recognized for a long time that concussions are dangerous injuries with potentially life-changing consequences, ranging from permanent symptoms to degenerative neurological states. The intellectual history of medicine and science from 1870 to the recent past shows both a continuity of clinical observations about HI and a steady, incremental accumulation of knowledge refining our understanding of those observations from a remarkably wide sphere of scientific disciplines.
