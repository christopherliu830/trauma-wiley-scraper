AB  - Summary Purpose Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, and early posttraumatic seizures (EPTS) are a contributing factor to ongoing acute damage. Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) was utilized to assess the burden of clinical and electrographic EPTS. Methods Eighty-seven consecutive, unselected (mild ? severe), acute TBI patients requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission at two academic centers were monitored prospectively with cEEG per established clinical TBI protocols. Clinical and subclinical seizures and status epilepticus (SE, clinical and subclinical) were assessed for their relation to clinical risk factors and short-term outcome measures. Key Findings Of all patients, 42.5% (37/87) had seizures. Younger age (p = 0.002) and injury mechanism (abusive head trauma ? AHT, p < 0.001) were significant risk factors. Subclinical seizures occurred in 16.1% (14/87), while 6.9% (6/87) had only subclinical seizures. Risk factors for subclinical seizures included younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p < 0.001). SE occurred in 18.4% (16/87) with risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.002). Subclinical SE was detected in 13.8% (12/87) with significant risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p = 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.004). Subclinical seizures were associated with lower discharge King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) score (p = 0.002). SE and subclinical SE were associated with increased hospital length of stay (p = 0.017 and p = 0.041, respectively) and lower hospital discharge KOSCHI (p = 0.007 and p = 0.040, respectively). Significance cEEG monitoring significantly improves detection of seizures/SE and is the only way to detect subclinical seizures/SE. cEEG may be indicated after pediatric TBI, particularly in younger children, AHT cases, and those with intraaxial blood on computerized tomography (CT).

AB  - Summary Burns and dog-bite wounds can be superficial or extensive, involving muscle, bone, and vital organs. Bullet wounds may penetrate deeper tissues causing injury far from the point of entry. Burns that cover a large surface area result in substantial losses of fluids and electrolytes. Medications applied topically to burns should be easy to apply and should not interfere with healing. Horses that have incurred a bullet wound may require antimicrobial therapy, due to the penetration of a viscus, or a synovial structure. The bullet injures tissues directly in its path, and concussive forces injure tissue adjacent to the bullet's path. Dog-bite wounds are heavily contaminated and characterized by the presence of crushed, necrotic tissue. Damage to tissue caused by a bullet, a bite, or a burn progresses after injury, necessitating continuous re-evaluation of the wound.

AB  - In contrast to traditional static cold preservation of donor livers, normothermic machine perfusion may reduce preservation injury, improve graft viability and potentially allows ex vivo assessment of graft viability before transplantation. We have studied the feasibility of normothermic machine perfusion in four discarded human donor livers. Normothermic machine perfusion consisted of pressure and temperature controlled pulsatile perfusion of the hepatic artery and continuous portal perfusion for 6 h. Two hollow fiber membrane oxygenators provided oxygenation of the perfusion fluid. Biochemical markers in the perfusion fluid reflected minimal hepatic injury and improving function. Lactate levels decreased to normal values, reflecting active metabolism by the liver (mean lactate 10.0 ± 2.3 mmol/L at 30 min to 2.3 ± 1.2 mmol/L at 6 h). Bile production was observed throughout the 6 h perfusion period (mean rate 8.16 ± 0.65 g/h after the first hour). Histological examination before and after 6 h of perfusion showed well-preserved liver morphology without signs of additional hepatocellular ischemia, biliary injury or sinusoidal damage. In conclusion, this study shows that normothermic machine perfusion of human donor livers is technically feasible. It allows assessment of graft viability before transplantation, which opens new avenues for organ selection, therapeutic interventions and preconditioning.

AB  - Abstract The paper overviews various methods that are used for the analysis of output signals generated by enzyme-based logic systems. The considered methods include optical techniques (optical absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance), electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, potentiometry, impedance spectroscopy, conductivity measurements, use of field effect transistor devices, pH measurements), and various mechanoelectronic methods (using atomic force microscope, quartz crystal microbalance). Although each of the methods is well known for various bioanalytical applications, their use in combination with the biomolecular logic systems is rather new and sometimes not trivial. Many of the discussed methods have been combined with the use of signal-responsive materials to transduce and amplify biomolecular signals generated by the logic operations. Interfacing of biocomputing logic systems with electronics and ?smart? signal-responsive materials allows logic operations be extended to actuation functions; for example, stimulating molecular release and switchable features of bioelectronic devices, such as biofuel cells. The purpose of this review article is to emphasize the broad variability of the bioanalytical systems applied for signal transduction in biocomputing processes. All bioanalytical systems discussed in the article are exemplified with specific logic gates and multi-gate networks realized with enzyme-based biocatalytic cascades.

AB  - Objective To-determine the feasibility of a single paracostal abdominal approach for thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and cisterna chyli ablation (CCA) in dogs with chylothorax. Study Design Observational study and prospective case series. Animals Normal dogs (n = 5) and dogs with chylothorax (n = 8). Methods A single paracostal approach with transdiaphragmatic extension for TDL and CCA was developed experimentally (n = 5) and used in 8 clinical cases with subtotal pericardectomy (SPE) performed in 4 dogs. Surgery time, complications, hospitalization time, outcome, and follow-up of clinical cases were recorded. Results Exposure of relevant anatomy was excellent; vital lymphatic staining facilitated identification of lymphatic structures. In clinical cases, mean surgery time for TDL + CCA was 136 minutes. Mean hospitalization time was 3.1 days. Seven of 8 cases survived, with 1 dog dying of heart failure shortly after discharge. One dog required a second (left) paracostal approach to ligate 2 more lymphatic vessels. On follow-up (median, 7 months; range, 2?20 months), there was complete resolution of chylothorax in 6 dogs. Conclusions A single paracostal approach provides excellent exposure of cisterna chyli, caudal thoracic duct, and intestinal lymphatics. This approach eliminates the need for repositioning during combined TDL + CCA procedures and avoids an intercostal thoracotomy.

AB  - Summary Background Nutraceuticals are often used in the management of equine osteoarthritis, but scientific evidence of their efficacy is lacking. Objectives To study the preventive effects of two new nutraceuticals after the experimental induction of synovitis in comparison with positive and negative control treatments. Study design Blinded, controlled, randomised experiment. Methods Twenty-four healthy Standardbred horses were randomly allocated to supplement AT (multi-ingredient, 28 days), supplement HP (collagen hydrolysate, 60 days), meloxicam (4 days) or placebo (60 days). Synovitis was induced in the right intercarpal joint by intra-articular injection of 0.5 ng lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli while treatments were continued. Blood and synovial fluid were sampled before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Synovial fluid samples were analysed for total nucleated cell count (TNCC), total protein (TP) and selected biomarkers (prostaglandin E2 [PGE2], interleukin-6 [IL-6], glycosaminoglycans [GAGs], type II collagen synthesis [CPII], matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]). Lameness was scored by visual examination and pressure plate analysis immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Clinical examinations were performed before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, at 2, 4 and 6 h post-injection, and then twice per day during the test period. Results Before treatment and intra-articular challenge, there were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups for any of the parameters. After intra-articular challenge, the placebo group showed significantly higher synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE2 compared with the meloxicam group, although the model did not induce a relevant amount of lameness. Both nutraceuticals resulted in significantly lower synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE2 compared with placebo. No statistical differences in IL-6, GAGs, CPII or MMPs were observed among treatment groups. No adverse effects were observed. Main limitations Despite evidence of synovitis, lameness was too mild to detect. Conclusions The preventive administration of these nutraceuticals showed anti-inflammatory effects in this validated synovitis model. Therefore, further studies of their clinical applicability are warranted.

High-affinity glutamate uptake was studied in platelets from 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 multi-infarct dementia patients, and 35 age-matched normal controls; it was decreased by 40% in platelets from Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls and with multi-infarct dementia patients. Platelet glutamate uptake could be used as peripheral marker of glutamatergic involvement and as adjunctive diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. Ann Neurol 2000;47:641?643

AB  - Summary Malignant insulinomas are very rare endocrine tumours with a variable clinical course. We describe a 51-year-old man who had two large insulinomas resected from the body of the pancreas and 19 years later, having again become symptomatic, was found to have hepatic metastases. Medical treatment with diazoxide and octreotide failed to control his symptoms, but repeated hepatic embolization effected both symptomatic and biochemical improvements for a further 5 years. When symptoms recurred but further embolization failed to control his symptoms the hepatic metastases were treated by outpatient percutaneous radio-frequency ablation. He remains symptom-free 18 months later and levels of insulin and pro-insulin have nearly normalized. The survival, with liver metastases, for 27 years in a man with a malignant insulinoma has not been described previously. Malignant insulinoma may follow a rather indolent course and symptoms respond well to locally destructive therapies. Hepatic embolization is less traumatic than hepatic lobe resection and radio-frequency ablation offers an alternative if vascular access to the tumour is no longer possible.

AB  - Abstract The hematopoietic system consists of: (1) a network of stem and progenitor cells of varying degrees of maturity interacting with other cells that possess supportive and regulatory capacities and (2) vascular stem cell niches with supporting stem cells in their self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and mobilization to the circulation. Recent data suggest that selective expression of organ-specific chemokines promotes the mobilization of bone-marrow-derived pluripotent cells, a process that is essential for tissue vascularization and organ regeneration. Despite intensive investigation, the pathways by which mechanical signals are converted to biochemical responses are not completely understood. Recent studies have suggested that chromatin shifts and cell cycle effects stem cell gene expression, and thus results in changes of its surface receptor expression at different points of the cell cycle machinery, therefore changing cell cycle transit. This review will attempt to discuss new approaches to determine the regulation of stem cell growth and differentiation by underlying the significance of the chaotic dynamics of transcriptional networks within a cell, with a combination of chemokines and cytokines in the environment, and mechanical forces, such as; stretch, strain and laminar flow, all involving both cooperation and competition.

AB  - Introduction Lameness is the most common health problem of racehorses and may affect both welfare and performance. The aim of this study was to investigate if locomotion asymmetry in a group of young horses was related to delayed qualification for races. Methods Locomotion asymmetry was measured every 1?3 months with a wireless inertial sensor based lameness evaluation system in 16 horses fourteen times between September of the year they were 1-year olds and May of the year they were 3-year olds. As 3-year-olds they passed their qualification race and after this, two subgroups were created for the study based on whether they passed their qualification race before June 21st (early group, n?=?6) or after September 19th (late group, n?=?6). The groups were compared with respect to the differences in vertical head (forelimbs) and pelvis (hindlimbs) movement (as measured by the Lameness Locator, Equinosis) during each stride cycle at trot. The vector sums (VS) of maximum and minimum difference from each sensor were calculated and used for statistical analyses. ANOVA (Proc mixed model including individual {random}, date and group) was used to analyse differences between groups. Results The late group had higher VS for forelimbs (16.0?±?1.0) than the early group (12.6?±?1.0) (P?=?0.04) in total over the whole period. The VS for hind limbs did not differ between groups. Conclusions Front limb locomotion asymmetry in young horses in training is associated with delayed qualification for races. However, further studies are warranted to investigate causality.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell based therapies for the repair and regeneration of various tissues are of great interest for a high number of diseases. Adult stem cells, instead, are more available, abundant and harvested with minimally invasive procedures. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent progenitors, able to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and adipose tissues. Human adult adipose tissue seems to be the most abundant source of MSCs and, due to its easy accessibility; it is able to give a considerable amount of stem cells. In this study, we selected MSCs co-expressing CD34 and CD90 from adipose tissue. This stem cell population displayed higher proliferative capacity than CD34?CD90? cells and was able to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes (PPAR?+ and adiponectin+) and endothelial cells (CD31+VEGF+Flk1+). In addition, in methylcellulose without VEGF, it formed a vascular network. The aim of this study was to investigate differentiation potential of human adipose CD34+/CD90+ stem cells loaded onto commercial collagen sponges already used in clinical practice (Gingistat) both in vitro and in vivo. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that human adult adipose and loose connective tissues can be obtained in vivo, highlighting that CD34+/CD90 ASCs are extremely useful for regenerative medicine.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Alcohol abuse causes impairment of cognitive function ranging from mild forms to end-stage dementia. Alcohol-related dementia accounts for nearly 20% of all admissions to state mental hospitals and may result from head trauma, thiamine deficiency, Alzheimer's, and other brain diseases that can be diagnosed conclusively only at autopsy. However, we postulate that after all these conditions have been excluded, an ?alcohol encephalopathy? remains. This is characterized by impaired synaptic function, which underlies the continuum of impaired intellectual function. We found in 79 histologically normal brains of a nondemented general hospital population a 40% decrease in the density of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the frontal cortex of alcoholics when compared with matched controls of the same age. Only alcohol abuse and not aging, postmortem changes, medications, clinical (including liver) diseases, or differences in causes of death could account for this loss.

AB  - The essential trace element copper (Cu) is required for a range of physiologic processes, including wound healing and functioning of the immune system. The correct amount of Cu must be provided in parenteral nutrition (PN) if deficiency and toxicity are to be avoided. While provision in line with the standard recommendations should suffice for most patients, Cu requirements may be higher in patients with increased gastrointestinal losses and severe burns and lower in those with cholestasis. The tests of Cu status that are currently available for clinical use are unreliable. Serum Cu concentration is the most commonly ordered test but is insensitive to Cu deficiency and toxicity and is misleadingly increased during the acute phase response. These limitations make it difficult for prescribers to assess Cu status and to decide how much Cu to provide. There is a need for better tests of Cu status to be developed to decrease uncertainty and improve individualization of Cu dosing. More information is needed on Cu requirements in disease and Cu contamination of PN components and other intravenous fluids. New multi?trace element products should be developed that provide Cu doses in line with the 2012 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommendations. This article discusses the evaluation and treatment of Cu deficiency and toxicity in patients treated with PN.

AB  - Abstract There has been a recent call for longitudinal imaging studies to better characterize the time course of physiological recovery following sport-related concussion (SRC) and its relationship with clinical recovery. To address this, we evaluated changes to resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of the whole-brain network following SRC and explored associations between rs-FC and measures of clinical outcome. High school and collegiate football athletes were enrolled during preseason. Athletes that suffered SRC (N =?62) were assessed across the acute (within 48?hr) and sub-acute (days 8, 15, and 45) phases. Matched football athletes without concussion served as controls (N =?60) and participated in similar visits. Multi-band resting-state fMRI was used to assess whole-brain rs-FC at each visit using network-based statistic and average nodal strength from regions of interest defined using a common whole-brain parcellation. Concussed athletes had elevated symptoms, psychological distress, and oculomotor, balance, and memory deficits at 48?hr postconcussion relative to controls, with diminished yet significant elevations in symptoms and psychological distress at 8?days. Both rs-FC analyses showed that concussed athletes had a global increase in connectivity at 8?days postconcussion relative to controls, with no differences at the 48-hr, 15-day, or 45-day visits. Further analysis revealed the group effect at the 8-day visit was driven by the large minority of concussed athletes still symptomatic at their visit; asymptomatic concussed athletes did not differ from controls. Findings from this large-scale, prospective study suggest whole-brain rs-FC alterations following SRC are delayed in onset but associated with the presence of self-reported symptoms.
