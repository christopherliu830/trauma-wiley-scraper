AB  - Objective To provide (1) a comprehensive description of hemipelvectomy; and (2) report clinical application and outcome of hemipelvectomy in dogs and cats. Study Design Descriptive report and retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?4) and 5 cats. Methods Cadaveric dissection was performed for imaging purposes using 4 mixed breed dogs euthanatized for reasons unrelated to this study. Medical records (2005?2012) were reviewed for dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy. Data collected included signalment, body weight, body condition score, clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging findings, location and extent of tumor, definitive diagnosis, use of adjuvant therapy, ability to ambulate postoperatively, complications, and survival. Results The most common indication for hemipelvectomy in cats was injection site sarcoma (ISS) and in dogs, osteosarcoma or peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST). Complete tumor excision was achieved in 6 (67%) cases. Incomplete excision occurred in 2 dogs with lumbosacral PNST and 1 cat having a 2nd surgery for ISS. Complications included intraoperative hemorrhage (n?=?2), postoperative soft tissue infection (2), and discharge from the incision site (1). All but 1 animal were ambulatory at the time of discharge. Hospitalization ranged from 1?10 days (median, 4 days). Survival after surgery was individually assessed. Conclusion With in-depth anatomic familiarity, hemipelvectomy can be successful for excision of neoplastic lesions of the proximal aspect of the pelvic limb, with only minor complications.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies, using reflective skin markers, are commonly used to investigate equine neck motion in equitation science and for rehabilitation purposes. In order to interpret the registrations accurately, the degree of skin displacement has been described for the limbs and back, but not for the neck. The aim of the present study was to investigate the degree of skin displacement in the equine neck. Methods Radiopaque skin markers were applied to the skin over the first six cervical vertebrae of six healthy horses. Radiographs were taken in three standardized neck positions in the sagittal plane: control (horizontal neck), ?on the bit? and ?nose to carpus?. The scales of the images were normalized and calculation of skin displacement was performed by use of a coordinate system, dividing the displacement into measurements on an x-axis parallel to the vertebra's longitudinal axis and a y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis. The non-parametric paired Wilcoxon rank test was employed to study the differences in distances in x- and y-directions, and statistical significance was set to P<0.05. Results Between control and ?nose to carpus? positions, there were significant differences in the marker locations, related to the underlying vertebra, in x-line for C1?6, and in y-line for C3?6. The differences in marker locations were between 3?±?9 and 44?±?14?mm, depending on the marker. Conclusions The outcome of this study indicates that skin displacement is an important factor to consider when investigating equine neck motion with skin marker methodology. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by a local Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments (Uppsala, Sweden), with written consent from the horse owners. Sources of funding:?none. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Abstract Polycomb group protein EZH2 and Bmi1 are reportedly involved in the progression of malignant tumours. We examined the participation of EZH2 in multi-step cholangiocarcinogenesis in hepatolithiasis with respect to tumour suppressor gene p16INK4a. We examined 20 hepatolithiatic livers with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and 10 histologically normal livers. Neoplastic biliary lesions were classified into biliary intraepithelial neoplasm (BilIN-1, 2 and 3) and invasive carcinoma. We selected 15 foci of invasive carcinoma, 8 BilIN-3 (carcinoma in situ), 12 BilIN-2 (high-grade dysplasia), 32 BilIN-1 (low-grade dysplasia) and 37 non-neoplastic biliary epithelia from these livers. Expression of p16INK4a, EZH2 and Bmi1 were surveyed in these foci. P16INK4a promoter methylation was examined in microdissected tissues. Taking advantage of two cell lines of CC (HuCTT-1 and TFK-1) and small interfering RNA (siRNA), the effects of the knockdown of EZH2 on p16INK4a methylation of CC cells were examined. Expression of p16INK4a, which was frequent in BilIN1, was decreased in BilIN-2/3 and invasive carcinoma, while EZH2 expression showed step-wise increase from BilIN-1, -2 and -3 to invasive carcinoma (p < 0.01). P16INK4a promoter hypermethylation was related to aberrant expression of EZH2. The knockdown of EZH2 in cultured CC cells decreased p16INK4a methylation and decreased binding of EZH2 to the p16INK4a gene promoter. The latter suggested that direct binding of EZH2 is involved in the regulation of the p16INK4a gene. Our data suggest that over-expression of EZH2 may induce hypermethylation of p16INK4a promoter followed by decreased expression of p16INK4a in the multi-step cholangiocarcinogenesis through intraepithelial neoplasm in hepatolithiasis.

The tet(L) and erm(B) genes, associated with tetracycline and erythromycin resistance, respectively, were found in all vanA isolates. The intestinal tract of Lusitano horses can be a potential reservoir for vanA-containing enterococci.

AB  - Summary: Using univariate and multivariate regression analysis, we studied seizure duration, seizure type, age, etiologies, other clinical features, and mortality among 253 adults with status epilepticus (SE) admitted to the Medical College of Virginia. Cerebral vascular disease and discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were the most prominent causes of SE, each accounting for ?22% of all patients in the series. The other principle etiologies were alcohol withdrawal, idiopathic, anoxia, metabolic disorders, hemorrhage, infection, tumor, drug overdose, and trauma. When the patients were divided into two groups, the group with SE lasting < 1 h had a lower mortality as compared with seizure duration ≥ 1 h. Low mortality rates were noted in alcohol and AED discontinuation etiologies. Anoxia and increasing age were significantly correlated with higher mortality. The mortality rates of partial and generalized SE were not significantly different. Race and sex did not affect mortality significantly. Our findings represent the first multivariate analysis of predictive indicators of mortality in SE and demonstrate that specific factors influence mortality rate in SE.

AB  - Summary A 4-week-old Thoroughbred filly foal with a history of sepsis was evaluated for right hindlimb lameness. Bilateral femoropatellar and femorotibial joint effusions were detected. Ultrasonography and radiography of the right stifle revealed signs of joint collapse and periarticular swelling. Computed tomography revealed abnormalities in the bone density of the medial femoral condyle of the right hindlimb and lateral femoral condyle of the left hindlimb. Euthanasia was recommended based on the severity of the lesions. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed extensive separation of the articular-epiphyseal cartilage complex from the subchondral bone of the femoral condyles. The histological features suggest an ischaemic aetiology; comparisons are made with lesions of osteochondrosis and avascular necrosis of bone.

AB  - Abstract Background Glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I) is a cerebral organic aciduria caused by inherited deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and is characterized biochemically by an accumulation of putatively neurotoxic dicarboxylic metabolites. The majority of untreated patients develops a complex movement disorder with predominant dystonia during age 3?36 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated striatal and extrastriatal abnormalities. Aims/methods The major aim of this study was to elucidate the complex neuroradiological pattern of patients with GA-I and to associate the MRI findings with the severity of predominant neurological symptoms. In 180 patients, detailed information about the neurological presentation and brain region-specific MRI abnormalities were obtained via a standardized questionnaire. Results Patients with a movement disorder had more often MRI abnormalities in putamen, caudate, cortex, ventricles and external CSF spaces than patients without or with minor neurological symptoms. Putaminal MRI changes and strongly dilated ventricles were identified as the most reliable predictors of a movement disorder. In contrast, abnormalities in globus pallidus were not clearly associated with a movement disorder. Caudate and putamen as well as cortex, ventricles and external CSF spaces clearly collocalized on a two-dimensional map demonstrating statistical similarity and suggesting the same underlying pathomechanism. Conclusions This study demonstrates that complex statistical methods are useful to decipher the age-dependent and region-specific MRI patterns of rare neurometabolic diseases and that these methods are helpful to elucidate the clinical relevance of specific MRI findings.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Acrolein, a major lipid peroxidation product, has been associated with both CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Because of its long half-life, acrolein is a potent endogenous toxin capable of killing healthy cells during the secondary injury process. Traditionally, attempts to intervene in the process of progressive cell death after the primary injury have included scavenging reactive oxygen species (so-called free radicals). The animal data supporting such an approach have generally been positive, but all human clinical trials attempting a similar outcome in human CNS injury have failed. New drugs that might reduce toxicity by scavenging the products of lipid peroxidation present a promising, and little investigated, therapeutic approach. Hydralazine, a well-known treatment for hypertension, has been reported to react with acrolein, forming hydrazone in cell-free systems. In the companion paper, we have established an acrolein-mediated cell injury model using PC12 cells in vitro. Here we test the hypothesis that the formation of hydrazone adducts with acrolein is able to reduce acrolein toxicity and spare a significant percentage of the population of PC12 cells from death. Concentrations of approximately 1 mM of this aldehyde scavenger can rescue over 80% of the population of PC12 cells. This study provides a basis for a new pharmacological treatment to reduce the effects of secondary injury in the damaged and/or diseased nervous system. In particular, we describe the need for new drugs that possess aldehyde scavenging properties but do not interfere with the regulation of blood pressure. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare but important liver disease that leads to cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation in a high proportion of cases. The disease occurs in approximately 1 per 100,000 population per year, usually presents in adulthood, and affects men more often than women. Typical serum biochemical results, autoantibodies and liver biopsy are suggestive but not diagnostic of PSC, the diagnosis requiring cholangiographic demonstration of stricturing and dilatation of the intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts. The natural history of PSC is variable, the average survival being 12 to 17 years. The cause of PSC is still unknown. Although considered an autoimmune disease, PSC has several atypical features and a strong genetic component. The therapy of PSC is unsatisfactory. Standard doses of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) lead to improvements in biochemical abnormalities but not in histology, cholangiographic appearance or survival. Several innovative therapies have been tried in PSC, but with scant evidence of benefit. For patients with high grade strictures, endoscopic dilatation is beneficial. Liver transplantation is successful for end-stage liver disease due to PSC and improves survival. PSC may recur after transplantation but is rarely progressive. The most dreaded complication of PSC is cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnosis of this highly malignant tumor is difficult, and there are no biomarkers for its early detection. Liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma has an exceedingly poor outcome, although transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoirradiation holds promise in selected patients. Thus, significant opportunities remain for basic and clinical research into the cause, natural history, and therapy of PSC. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:746?764.)
