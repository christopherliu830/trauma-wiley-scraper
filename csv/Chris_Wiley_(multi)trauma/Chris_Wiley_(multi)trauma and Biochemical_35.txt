AB  - Summary Background: Studies elsewhere have shown a high incidence of malnutrition in brain-injured people and in in-patient populations. Objectives: To investigate the incidence of malnutrition in long-term rehabilitation at the National Centre for Brain Injury Rehabilitation and to evaluate the usefulness of a range of measures of nutritional status. Methods: All (n=33) patients were invited to participate. Anthropometric, dietary, haematological and biochemical measurements were made. Result: The incidence of malnutrition was nil. The incidence of obesity was comparable to the ?normal? population. Subjects consumed a nutritionally adequate diet, except for NSP (fibre). Conclusion: The result was not only better than that of other therapeutic communities, it was better than the ?normal? population. Useful tools for assessment of nutritional status were found to be BMI, arm anthropometry, biochemistry, haematology and food diaries. Further study of the nutritional status of all admissions will identify the changes which can occur during long-term rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare but important liver disease that leads to cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation in a high proportion of cases. The disease occurs in approximately 1 per 100,000 population per year, usually presents in adulthood, and affects men more often than women. Typical serum biochemical results, autoantibodies and liver biopsy are suggestive but not diagnostic of PSC, the diagnosis requiring cholangiographic demonstration of stricturing and dilatation of the intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts. The natural history of PSC is variable, the average survival being 12 to 17 years. The cause of PSC is still unknown. Although considered an autoimmune disease, PSC has several atypical features and a strong genetic component. The therapy of PSC is unsatisfactory. Standard doses of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) lead to improvements in biochemical abnormalities but not in histology, cholangiographic appearance or survival. Several innovative therapies have been tried in PSC, but with scant evidence of benefit. For patients with high grade strictures, endoscopic dilatation is beneficial. Liver transplantation is successful for end-stage liver disease due to PSC and improves survival. PSC may recur after transplantation but is rarely progressive. The most dreaded complication of PSC is cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnosis of this highly malignant tumor is difficult, and there are no biomarkers for its early detection. Liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma has an exceedingly poor outcome, although transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoirradiation holds promise in selected patients. Thus, significant opportunities remain for basic and clinical research into the cause, natural history, and therapy of PSC. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:746?764.)

AB  - Summary Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernails and/or toenails caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte moulds. The epidemiology of onychomycosis in Serbia is yet to be fully established. This epidemiological study was aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of onychomycosis in a sample of the Serbian patients at risk of onychomycosis, to determine the fungal aetiological agents and to identify the possible risk factors. The study population included 374 patients from six centres in Serbia with suspected onychomycosis. Demographic data, data about comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical aspects of onychomycosis, trauma, excessive perspiration and personal and family history of previous onychomycosis were studied. Laboratory confirmation of diagnosis was done by direct microscopy, fungal culture and PCR. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed in 50.8% of patients, who tested positive to at least one laboratory test (direct microscopy, fungal culture or PCR). Trichophyton rubrum was predominant both on toenails (85.98%) and on fingernails (38.46%). Independent risk factors for onychomycosis were: old age (OR = 2.285; P < 0.001), family history of previous onychomycosis and/or tinea pedis (OR = 2.452; P = 0.005), excessive perspiration (OR = 2.165; P = 0.002) and higher degree of hyperkeratosis (OR = 1.755; P = 0.020). This is a first epidemiological study of onychomycosis from Serbia.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Abstract The objectives of this study were to evaluate temporal changes in lubricin, hyaluronan (HA), and HA molecular weight (MW) distributions in three distinct models of equine joint injury affecting the carpal (wrist), tarsal (ankle), and femoropatellar (knee) joints. To establish ranges for lubricin, HA, and HA MW distributions across multiple joints, we first evaluated clinically healthy, high-motion equine joints. Synovial fluid was collected from high-motion joints in horses without clinical signs of joint disease (n?=?11 horses, 102 joints) and from research horses undergoing carpal osteochondral fragmentation (n?=?8), talar cartilage impact injury (n?=?7), and femoral trochlear ridge full-thickness cartilage injury (n?=?22) prior to and following arthroscopically induced joint injury. Lubricin and HA concentrations were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and gel electrophoresis was performed to evaluate HA MW distributions. Synovial fluid parameters were analyzed via linear regression models, revealing that lubricin and HA concentrations were conserved across healthy, high-motion joints. Lubricin concentrations increased post-injury in all osteoarthritis models (carpal fragmentation P?=?.001; talar impact P?<?.001; femoral trochlear ridge cartilage defect P?=?.03). Sustained loss of HA was noted post-arthroscopy following carpal osteochondral fragmentation (P?<?.0001) and talar impact injury (P?<?.001). Lubricin may be elevated to compensate for the loss of HA and to protect cartilage post-injury. Further investigation into the mechanisms regulating lubricin and HA following joint injury and their effects on joint homeostasis is warranted, including whether lubricin has value as a biomarker for post-traumatic osteoarthritis.

AB  - Background: How tissue patterns form in development and regeneration is a fundamental issue remaining to be fully understood. The integument often forms repetitive units in space (periodic patterning) and time (cyclic renewal), such as feathers and hairs. Integument patterns are visible and experimentally manipulatable, helping us reveal pattern formative processes. Variability is seen in regional phenotypic specificities and temporal cycling at different physiological stages. Results: Here we show some cellular/molecular bases revealed by analyzing integument patterns. (1) Localized cellular activity (proliferation, rearrangement, apoptosis, differentiation) transforms prototypic organ primordia into specific shapes. Combinatorial positioning of different localized activity zones generates diverse and complex organ forms. (2) Competitive equilibrium between activators and inhibitors regulates stem cells through cyclic quiescence and activation. Conclusions: Dynamic interactions between stem cells and their adjacent niche regulate regenerative behavior, modulated by multi-layers of macro-environmental factors (dermis, body hormone status, and external environment). Genomics studies may reveal how positional information of localized cellular activity is stored. In vivo skin imaging and lineage tracing unveils new insights into stem cell plasticity. Principles of self-assembly obtained from the integumentary organ model can be applied to help restore damaged patterns during regenerative wound healing and for tissue engineering to rebuild tissues.

AB  - Abstract Acrolein, a major lipid peroxidation product, has been associated with both CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Because of its long half-life, acrolein is a potent endogenous toxin capable of killing healthy cells during the secondary injury process. Traditionally, attempts to intervene in the process of progressive cell death after the primary injury have included scavenging reactive oxygen species (so-called free radicals). The animal data supporting such an approach have generally been positive, but all human clinical trials attempting a similar outcome in human CNS injury have failed. New drugs that might reduce toxicity by scavenging the products of lipid peroxidation present a promising, and little investigated, therapeutic approach. Hydralazine, a well-known treatment for hypertension, has been reported to react with acrolein, forming hydrazone in cell-free systems. In the companion paper, we have established an acrolein-mediated cell injury model using PC12 cells in vitro. Here we test the hypothesis that the formation of hydrazone adducts with acrolein is able to reduce acrolein toxicity and spare a significant percentage of the population of PC12 cells from death. Concentrations of approximately 1 mM of this aldehyde scavenger can rescue over 80% of the population of PC12 cells. This study provides a basis for a new pharmacological treatment to reduce the effects of secondary injury in the damaged and/or diseased nervous system. In particular, we describe the need for new drugs that possess aldehyde scavenging properties but do not interfere with the regulation of blood pressure. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary A 15-year-old Boerperd stallion presented for thyroid enlargement associated with inappetance. Ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid gland revealed an enlarged left lobe, which, on cytological examination, contained numerous anaplastic cells. A mixed C cell microfollicular thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed following histopathological examination of the excisional biopsy specimen. In order to determine metastasis, pulmonary radiographs revealed a poorly-marginated soft tissue opacity caudo-dorsal to the cardiac silhouette. Thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy was performed comparing 99mTc-sestamibi with 99mTc-pertechnetate and no metastasis was detectable. Following hemithyroidectomy, the stallion made a full recovery without the need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Six months later, repeated thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy using 99mTc-sestamibi was normal.

AB  - Abstract An adhesive yet easily removable burn wound dressing represents a breakthrough in second-degree burn wound care. Current second-degree burn wound dressings absorb wound exudate, reduce bacterial infections, and maintain a moist environment for healing, but are surgically or mechanically debrided from the wound, causing additional trauma to the newly formed tissues. We have developed an on-demand dissolvable dendritic thioester hydrogel burn dressing for second-degree burn care. The hydrogel is composed of a lysine-based dendron and a PEG-based crosslinker, which are synthesized in high yields. The hydrogel burn dressing covers the wound and acts as a barrier to bacterial infection in an in vivo second-degree burn wound model. A unique feature of the hydrogel is its capability to be dissolved on-demand, via a thiol?thioester exchange reaction, allowing for a facile burn dressing removal.

AB  - Abstract The neonatal mortality during hospital stay of live-born babies in a large government hospital is assessed in the light of various maternal factors and neonatal problems. The complete records of every neonatal death along with record of all deliveries over a period of 18 months were maintained prospectively and analysed. Out of total 9,374 deliveries, 8,931 were live births, of which 438 were neonatal deaths. Thus the neonatal mortality was 49.04 per 1,000 live births, of which 89.5% were early neonatal deaths. The main contributors to neonatal mortality were prematurity (22.8%), hyaline membrane disease (20.8%), birth asphyxia (15.7%), sepsis (14.4%), malformations (11.4%), other respiratory problems (8.9%) and birth trauma (3.4%). The main causes of late neonatal deaths were sepsis, respiratory problems and malformations. Of the total live births 13.95% were having birth weight of less than 2 kg and these contributed to 79.6% of neonatal deaths. Of all neonatal deaths, 52.5% were preterm babies. The various high risk factors and measures to reduce neonatal mortality are discussed.

AB  - Abstract For several decades, there has been considerable interest in marine-derived long chain n-3 fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) due to their outstanding health benefits. n-3 LCPUFAs can be found in nature either in triglycerides (TAGs) or in phospholipid (PL) form. From brain health point of view, PL n-3 is more bioavailable and potent compared to n-3 in TAG form, as only PL n-3 is able to cross the blood?brain barrier and can be involved in brain biochemical reactions. However, PL n-3 has been ignored in the fish oil industry and frequently removed as an impurity during degumming processes. As a result, PL products derived from marine sources are very limited compared to TAG products. Commercially, PLs are being used in pharmaceutical industries as drug carriers, in food manufacturing as emulsifiers and in cosmetic industries as skin care agents, but most of the PLs used in these applications are produced from vegetable sources that contain less (without EPA, DPA, and DHA) or sometimes no n-3 LCPUFAs. This review provides a comprehensive account of the properties, structures, and major sources of marine PLs, and provides focussed discussion of their relationship to brain health. Epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical studies on n-3 LCPUFAs enriched PLs using different model systems in relation to brain and mental health that have been published over the past few years are discussed in detail.

AB  - A nine-year-old female Rottweiler presented with a 6-week history of progressive impairment of hindlimb adduction. Clinical examination showed abduction of both hind legs when walking on a smooth surface, pain at the medial surface of the left thigh, and an intrarectal palpable mass at the pelvic floor. Electromyography demonstrated fibrillation potentials in the adductor muscles on both sides. Pelvic radiographs showed severe osteolysis of the ischium. Gross post-mortem examination following euthanasia disclosed a large retroperitoneal mass, invading the obturator foramina and compressing both obturator nerves. Histopathological examination revealed a high-grade anaplastic sarcoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells labelled positively for vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin, hence the tumour was considered a ?myofibroblastic fibrosarcoma?. This unique case report describes a novel cause of obturator neuropathy in veterinary medicine. To date, clinical descriptions of obturator nerve lesions have been limited to pelvic fractures in small animals and following difficult labour in large animals.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of dementia is expected to double in the next 20 years and will contribute to heavy social and economic burden. Dementia is caused by neuronal loss that leads to brain atrophy years before symptoms manifest. Currently, no cure exists and extensive efforts are being made to mitigate cognitive impairment in late life in order to reduce the burden on patients, caregivers, and society. The most common type of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) often co-exists in the brain and shares common, modifiable risk factors, which are targeted in numerous secondary prevention trials. There is a growing need for non-pharmacological interventions and infrastructural support from governments to encourage psychosocial and behavioral interventions. Secondary prevention trials need to be redesigned based on the risk profile of individual subjects, which require the use of validated and standardized clinical, biological, and neuroimaging biomarkers. Multi-domain approaches have been proposed in high-risk populations that target optimal treatment; clinical trials need to recruit individuals at the highest risk of dementia before symptoms develop, thereby identifying an enriched disease group to test preventative and disease modifying strategies. The underlying aim should be to reduce microscopic brain tissue loss by modifying vascular and lifestyle risk factors over a relatively short period of time, thus optimizing the opportunity for preventing dementia in the future. Collaboration between international research groups is of key importance to the optimal use and allocation of existing resources, and the development of new techniques in preventing dementia. This article is part of the Special Issue ?Vascular Dementia?.
