AB  - Abstract Results are presented from an in vivo study of human skin in which a zig-zag surface coil together with a three-pulse Fourier Series Window (FSW) protocol have been used to obtain minimally contaminated 31P skin spectra of the posterior calf. Phantom experiments indicate that while the fall-off in the B1 field profile of the zig-zag surface coil is superior to conventional surface coil designs, it is still not sufficient on its own to reduce muscle signal contamination to acceptable levels in human studies. The additional spatial localization required is provided by the FSW, which reduces signal contamination to less than 30% of the total signal collected. In a study of 18 normal controls the measured pH was found to be relatively high (7.39±0.08), while the ratios of skin PCr/?-ATP (1.04±0.35) and PCr/Pi (1.67±0.4) were found to be low compared with that of skeletal muscle. In addition, substantial signal from phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters were also observed.

AB  - Abstract An adhesive yet easily removable burn wound dressing represents a breakthrough in second-degree burn wound care. Current second-degree burn wound dressings absorb wound exudate, reduce bacterial infections, and maintain a moist environment for healing, but are surgically or mechanically debrided from the wound, causing additional trauma to the newly formed tissues. We have developed an on-demand dissolvable dendritic thioester hydrogel burn dressing for second-degree burn care. The hydrogel is composed of a lysine-based dendron and a PEG-based crosslinker, which are synthesized in high yields. The hydrogel burn dressing covers the wound and acts as a barrier to bacterial infection in an in vivo second-degree burn wound model. A unique feature of the hydrogel is its capability to be dissolved on-demand, via a thiol?thioester exchange reaction, allowing for a facile burn dressing removal.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.

AB  - Abstract We describe a typology of regulatory deficits associated with anger in combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive, arousal, and behavioral domain deficits in anger regulation were observed clinically in PTSD patients with high levels of anger who were participating in a multi-year trial of a structured anger treatment. We also describe a category of patients whose anger type we have termed ?ball of rage.? These patients exhibit regulatory deficits in all three domains of anger regulation. We offer a conceptual framework to advance the understanding of anger associated with PTSD and to guide its effective treatment.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a robust, non-invasive means of defining aspects of human neurochemistry. After more than two decades, it is clear that in addition to its scientific interest, MRS has diagnostic value in tumor diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic outcome, dementia diagnosis and prognosis, multiple sclerosis, infections, trauma, development, stroke, perinatal ischemia, xenobiotics and inborn errors (as determined from a meta-analysis included in this paper). However, in many healthcare systems, a new radiological technique requires evidence-based medicine (EBM) before it is recommended for reimbursement. Much of the reason why MRS is thought to be non-reimbursable in the USA is due to recent announcements that this 15-year-old technique is still considered ?investigational? by these EBM assessments. An analysis is presented of the technology assessments that brought about this situation. Based on the conclusions of the EBM assessments, strategies are suggested that involve all entities responsible for spectroscopy including the scientists' role in ensuring the future for clinical spectroscopy.

AB  - Abstract Multifunctional nanomaterials for cancer therapy has attracted researchers? attention for decades. In this study, a unique oxidative method using KMnO4 or K2MnO4 as oxidizing agents to oxidize dopamine (DA) to polydopamine (PDA) was reported. The oxidizing agent was reduced to MnOx to form MnOx/PDA composite NPs. Afterwards, the MnOx/PDA composite NPs were surface-modified with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form a multifunctional theranostic agent, named MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs, with improved colloidal stability and biocompatibility. Such a material would become a photothermal nanoagent, since the PDA renders the composite NPs an admirable photothermal transforming ability with the photothermal conversion efficiency of 27.06%. Meanwhile, as a commonly used T1 contrast agent, manganese (Mn2+) endowed the MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs with MRI ability, rendering the as-synthesized MnOx/PDA composite NPs a capability of imaging guided multi-modal tumor therapy. Moreover, the formed MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs were used for drug loading, which was found to own the tunable drug loading and controlled drug releasing capacity. The as-prepared composite NPs were successfully used for the combined tumor chemotherapy and photothermal therapy in?vitro and in?vivo. This research provides insights into the development of conjugated polymer-based nanomaterial for various biomedical applications, especially in imaging guided cancer therapy.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Background: Retinal artery occlusive events are unusual in the paediatric population. The average age of their occurence is 60 years and the aetiology most often related to cardiovascular disease. Case Report: A healthy 11-year-old white girl developed permanent unilateral visual field loss as a result of a branch retinal artery occlusion. An extensive work-up included transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiograms, routine haematological and biochemical testing including serum lipids, screening for thrombophilia and thrombolysis, as well as autoantibodies, all of which proved to be within normal limits. Conclusions: Recognition of the underlying aetiology is not always possible, but should be sought as prognosis for vision or survival may rest upon these findings.

The definitive diagnosis of such cystic lesions may be difficult and needle aspiration or biopsy or even operation may be necessary. Clinical and biochemical features may be helpful and in five of the six patients presented, the liver function tests were abnormal. In two patients, diagnostic imaging could not distinguish the tumour from a benign cyst. The differential diagnosis of such cystic liver tumours includes simple cyst, polycystic liver disease, hydatid, liver abscess, haematoma and biloma.

AB  - Abstract The present series of experiments demonstrate that a polypeptide activity present in rat serum induces a proliferative response in cultured rat Schwann cells. Schwann cells in multi-well tissue culture plates were incubated in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and serial dilutions of normal rat serum, and control preparations were incubated in the same culture medium without rat serum. Rates of cell proliferation were assayed by measuring DNA incorporation of tritiated thymidine using liquid scintillation counting. A prominent dose-dependent proliferative response was observed among Schwann cells incubated with rat serum and rat plasma dilutions as compared to controls; this activity is abolished by heat inactivation and by proteolytic digestion, and was not affected by dialysis against a cellulose ester membrane that excludes molecules larger than 10,000 daltons. In contrast, no increase in DNA uptake of tritiated thymidine was observed when astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cultures were incubated with serial dilutions of rat serum. No proliferative effect was observed when rat Schwann cells were incubated with a dilution of standard adult bovine serum. These results suggest there is an intravascular plasma polypeptide with a molecular weight greater than 10,000 daltons that specifically stimulates Schwann cell proliferation, and it is proposed that this factor may be the mitogen responsible for the Schwann cell proliferative response known to occur after nerve injury. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background The Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) study is an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of early goal-directed therapy compared with standard care for patients presenting to the ED with severe sepsis. Objective In keeping with current practice, and taking into considerations aspects of trial design and reporting specific to non-pharmacologic interventions, this document outlines the principles and methods for analysing and reporting the trial results. The document is prepared prior to completion of recruitment into the ARISE study, without knowledge of the results of the interim analysis conducted by the data safety and monitoring committee and prior to completion of the two related international studies. Methods The statistical analysis plan was designed by the ARISE chief investigators, and reviewed and approved by the ARISE steering committee. The data collected by the research team as specified in the study protocol, and detailed in the study case report form were reviewed. Information related to baseline characteristics, characteristics of delivery of the trial interventions, details of resuscitation and other related therapies, and other relevant data are described with appropriate comparisons between groups. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes for the study are defined, with description of the planned statistical analyses. Results A statistical analysis plan was developed, along with a trial profile, mock-up tables and figures. A plan for presenting baseline characteristics, microbiological and antibiotic therapy, details of the interventions, processes of care and concomitant therapies, along with adverse events are described. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes are described along with identification of subgroups to be analysed. Conclusion A statistical analysis plan for the ARISE study has been developed, and is available in the public domain, prior to the completion of recruitment into the study. This will minimise analytic bias and conforms to current best practice in conducting clinical trials.

AB  - Mammalian skeletal muscle is notable for both its highly ordered biophysical structure and its regenerative capacity following trauma. Critical to both of these features is the specialized muscle extracellular matrix, comprising both the multiple concentric sheaths of connective tissue surrounding structural units from single myofibers to whole muscles and the dense interstitial matrix that occupies the space between them. Extracellular matrix-dependent interactions affect all activities of the resident muscle stem cell population (the satellite cells), from maintenance of quiescence and stem cell potential to the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on the role of the extracellular matrix in muscle regeneration, with a particular emphasis on regulation of satellite-cell activity.

AB  - ABSTRACT Systems orientated research offers the possibility of identifying novel therapeutic targets and relevant diagnostic markers for complex diseases such as osteoarthritis. This review demonstrates that the osteoarthritis research community has been slow to incorporate systems orientated approaches into research studies, although a number of key studies reveal novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms that contribute both to joint tissue homeostasis and its dysfunction. The review introduces both top-down and bottom-up approaches employed in the study of osteoarthritis. A holistic and multiscale approach, where clinical measurements may predict dysregulation and progression of joint degeneration, should be a key objective in future research. The review concludes with suggestions for further research and emerging trends not least of which is the coupled development of diagnostic tests and therapeutics as part of a concerted effort by the osteoarthritis research community to meet clinical needs. ? 2017 The Authors.
