AB  - Abstract Suicide risk assessment may well be the most complex clinical task that mental health professionals face. Tests have shown to be of little use. To confront this complexity, assessment and prediction are best seen as interwoven with understanding suicide, a multi-dimensional malaise. With the essential concepts of lethality and perturbation, a clinical theory of suicide is presented. Intrapsychic aspects (i.e., unbearable psychological pain, cognitive constriction, indirect expressions, inability to adjust, and ego) as well as interpersonal aspects (i.e., interpersonal relations, rejection-aggression, identification-egression), are outlined to aid in assessment. Transference and countertransference issues in assessment are noted. A case illustration to aid in clinical insight is provided. It is concluded that all assessment and prediction of suicide risk ultimately depends on the skill of the clinician.

AB  - Abstract N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in mediating excitatory synaptic transmissions in the brain and have been implicated in numerous neurologic disorders. The proximal amino-terminal domains (ATDs) of NMDA receptors constitute many modulatory binding sites that may serve as potential drug targets. There are few biochemical and structural data on the ATDs of NMDA receptors, as it is difficult to produce the functional proteins. Here an optimized method was established to reconstitute the insoluble recombinant ATD of NMDA receptor NR2B subunit (ATD2B) through productive refolding of 6xHis-ATD2B protein from inclusion bodies. Circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering characterizations revealed that the solubilized and refolded 6xHis-ATD2B adopted well-defined secondary structures and monodispersity. More significantly, the soluble 6xHis-ATD2B specifically bound ifenprodil to saturation. Ifenprodil bound to 6xHis-ATD2B with a dissociation constant (KD) of 127.5±45 nM, which was within the range of the IC50 determined electrophysiologically. This is the first report on a functional recombinant ATD2B with a characterized KD.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Abstract Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health problem, with approximately 2 million incidents occurring annually in the United States, no therapeutic agents to treat TBI have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration despite several clinical trials. It is estimated that 3.5 million Americans now have a lifelong condition that might be termed ?chronic traumatic brain injury disease.? Some health care providers categorize TBI as an ?event? for which patients require brief periods of rehabilitation with no further treatment. On the contrary, TBI should be seen as a chronic disease process that fits the World Health Organization definition as being a non-reversible pathologic condition requiring special rehabilitation training. Among the major obstacles that contribute to this type of misconception is the absence of brain injury?specific diagnostic biomarker(s) that can indicate and monitor the long-term health status of patients with TBI after use of conventional therapeutics and a rehabilitation process. It is of interest that recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology have enabled us to use these high throughput?based approaches in developing biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the area of TBI. One aim of this article is to provide an overview that evaluates the current status of TBI biomarker discovery using neuroproteomics/systems biology techniques, along with their clinical utilization. In addition, we discuss the need for strengthening the role of biomarker-based neuroproteomics/systems biology and its potential utility in the field of rehabilitation, which would lead to the establishment of rehabilomics studies, where biomarkers would indicate and predict the long-term efficacy and health status of patients with chronic TBI conditions.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate response and outcome of dogs with multicentric lymphoma treated with single-agent vinblastine as a second rescue. METHODS Medical records from 39 client-owned dogs receiving vinblastine rescue treatment (having relapsed on or following completion of UW-Madison and CCNU/L-asparaginase protocols), between 2005 and 2014, were reviewed for information regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, drug dosage, number of treatments, side effects, response and outcome. RESULTS The median starting dose of vinblastine was 2·6 mg/m2 (1·7 to 2·8 mg/m2), administered weekly until disease progression. Of the 39 dogs treated, 3 dogs (7·7%) achieved a complete remission, 7 dogs (17·9%) achieved a partial response, 18 dogs (46·2%) maintained stable disease and 11 (28·2%) had progressive disease. Ten dogs (25·6%) developed a grade III or IV neutropenia, and 4 dogs (10·3%) developed grade III or IV thrombocytopenia (one dog in both categories). After starting vinblastine, the median progression-free survival was 29·5 days (0 to 77 days) and overall median survival time was 46 days (4 to 250 days). Duration of first remission was identified as a positive predictor of outcome. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Single-agent vinblastine is well tolerated in dogs with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Responses were incomplete and short-lasting.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - Summary Sketches provides, in more technical language, outlines of the various imaging modalities, and illustrates their roles in medical care with many clinical examples. After examining film-radiography and conventional fluoroscopy, in which images arise from differential attenuation of an X-ray beam by various tissues, it moves on to their twenty-first century computer-based descendants: computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), culminating in three-dimensional mapping of tissues with spiral, multi-slice CT. It then addresses nuclear medicine (NM), including single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), where contrast comes from the differential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by tissues. With diagnostic ultrasound (US), echoes are created at tissue interfaces where differences in tissue elasticity and density occur. The chapter concludes with an appendix on the selection of optimal imaging modalities for representative clinical problems.

AB  - Background and Objectives? G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells have long replaced marrow as the major source for allogeneic transplants. Conclusive evidence questioning the long-term safety of G-CSF for donors has not been provided, but the cumulative number of followed donors remains insufficient to rule out rare adverse events. A long-term active follow-up study of G-CSF-mobilized healthy volunteer donors was therefore performed. Patients and Methods? Two hundred and three successive donors were evaluated pre-apheresis, subjected to G-CSF-mobilization/apheresis, and actively followed for 5?years by the same physicians and laboratories. Follow-up laboratory work included standard biochemical/haematological tests and T-cell phenotyping. Results? Donor epidemiology was typical for reported stem cell donor cohorts. Acute adverse effects of G-CSF and apheresis were mild and transient, consistent with the previous reports. Mean circulating CD34+ cells after nine doses of G-CSF were 124 per ?l. Other biochemical/haematological parameters were also altered, consistent with G-CSF treatment. Spleen enlargement was modest. At first follow-up, all clinical and laboratory parameters had normalized. Leucocyte/lymphocyte counts and CD4/CD8 ratios were the same as during premobilization work-up and remained unchanged throughout. A single severe but likely unrelated adverse event, a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma, was reported. Conclusion? The studies add an observation time of almost 500 donor years to the growing body of evidence of the long-term safety of G-CSF for allogeneic donor stem cell mobilization.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to assess the effect of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs) on articular chondrocyte expansion and maintenance of differentiation status and redifferentiation capacity. Passage 0 (P0) pig articular chondrocytes were expanded for six passages on plastic flasks (Plastic), SDSC-derived ECM (ECM), or substrate switching from either Plastic to ECM (PtoE) or ECM to Plastic (EtoP). Cell morphology, gene expression profiles, and immunophenotypes at each passage were used to characterize differentiation status of expanded cells. Chondrocytes at P0, P2, and P6 were assessed for redifferentiation capacity in a pellet culture system treated with either TGF-?1- or serum-containing medium for 14 days, using histology, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, Western blot, and real-time PCR. We found that ECM not only greatly enhanced chondrocyte expansion but also delayed dedifferentiation of expanded chondrocytes. Intriguingly, compared to a dramatic decrease in CD90+/CD105+ cells and CD90+ cells, CD105+ cells dramatically increased when chondrocytes were plated on Plastic; on the contrary, ECM expansion dramatically increased CD90+ cells and delayed the decrease of CD90+/CD105+ cells. Interestingly, expanded chondrocytes on ECM also acquired a strong redifferentiation capacity, particularly in the pellets treated with TGF-?1. In conclusion, the ratio of CD90 to CD105 may serve as a marker indicative of proliferation and redifferentiation capacity of dedifferentiated chondrocytes. ECM deposited by SDSCs provides a tissue-specific three-dimensional microenvironment for ex vivo expansion of articular chondrocytes while retaining redifferentiation capacity, suggesting that ECM may provide a novel approach for autologous chondrocyte-based cartilage repair.

AB  - Abstract Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have become an indispensable tool in the management of end-stage cardiac failure, both as a means of bridging to cardiac transplantation and as destination therapy for long-term quality of life improvement. Although the technology continues to advance and these devices continue to be refined, they are still associated with significant complications. This article reviews the basics of VAD function and physiology, as well as the myriad to complications that follow their implantation. This review aims to provide a systematic approach to the troubleshooting, diagnosis and management of both VAD-associated complications and the resuscitation of the decompensated VAD patient presenting to the ED.

AB  - Abstract Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are diagnosed in at least 10?40% of the patients seen for long-term monitoring of epilepsy, and it is no surprise that patients with PNES are often treated for epilepsy. Given the substantial economic costs and mental health burden of misdiagnosis, it is imperative to establish early identification, correct diagnosis, and effective treatment of PNES in order to provide the greatest opportunity for remission of events, improved psychological functioning, and social-vocational outcome. This article outlines an informed, practical approach to diagnosing this common condition and provides a summary of factors, based on medical history and semiology, that may suggest PNES. We discuss also the issues of communicating the diagnosis to the patient and making treatment recommendations which should ideally be coordinated using a multi-disciplinary team approach, involving the disciplines of neurology, psychiatry, psychology, social work, and nursing.

AB  - Summary: Purpose: In epilepsy, patient-based assessments are increasingly used as outcome measures in clinical trials of novel therapies alongside the traditional clinical measures of efficacy. The objective of this study was to validate psychometrically a quality of life (QOL) measure developed for use with recently diagnosed epilepsy patients. Methods: The NEWQOL (Quality of Life in Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Instrument) is a 93-item self-administered battery designed to assess QOL in patients with new-onset epilepsy. NEWQOL consists of eight multi-item scales (13 subscales) measuring several health parameters: Anxiety, Depression, Social Activities, Symptoms, Locus of Control/Mastery, Neuropsychological Problems (includes the following subscales: Fatigue, Memory, Concentration, Motor Skills, and Reading), Social Stigma, Worry, Work Limitations, and several single-item measures (General Health, Number of Seizures, Social Limitations, Social Support, Self Concept, Ambition Limitations, Health Transition, and General Limitations). The NEWQOL was collected at baseline and 1 week post-baseline from 108 patients in the U.K. and U.S. Results: All of the multi-item scales had high item discriminant validity, good test-retest reliability, and acceptable levels of internal consistency reliability; all but the Reading and Stigma subscales had negligible floor and ceiling effects. General linear models were used to examine the known groups validity of NEWQOL. Significant differences were observed in the Worry, Symptoms, Summary Neuropsychological Scales, and all Neuropsychological subscales (Memory, Fatigue, Concentration, Motor Skills, and Reading), indicating poorer functioning in the more frequent or severe seizure groups. Conclusions: Results from this study offer supportive evidence that NEWQOL has good validity and reliability and can discriminate between patient groups, particularly in relation to symptoms and psychological problems. We conclude that NEWQOL represents a useful measure for future studies in this patient population.
