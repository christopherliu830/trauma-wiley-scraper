AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare the pharmacodynamics of once daily and twice daily administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration in horses. Study Design Randomized cross over study. Animals Adult mixed breed healthy mares (n?=?6). Methods LMWH (dalteparin) was administered (50?U/kg subcutaneously) either every 12 or 24?hours for 3 consecutive days. Anti-factor Xa activity was measured before and at select time points after LMWH administration. Packed cell volume (PCV), platelet count, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and anti-thrombin (AT) activity were monitored throughout the study. Results No changes in PCV, platelet count, or AT activity were detected with either frequency of daily LMWH administration. Values for PTT increased throughout the study but never exceeded the normal reference interval. Anti-factor Xa activity was maintained within or above the suggested thromboprophylactic range (0.1?0.2?U/mL) when LMWH was administered twice daily, but fell below this range ?16?hours after administration when given once daily. For both once and twice daily LMWH administration, the area under the curve was significantly greater after the last dose of LMWH when compared to the first dose. Conclusions Administration of LMWH once or twice daily for 3 consecutive days appears to be safe in healthy adult horses. Anti-factor Xa activity was maintained within or above the suggested thromboprophylactic range for 24?hours with twice daily LMWH administration but not with once daily administration.

AB  - Biomaterial approaches for engineering orthopedic interfaces such as the tendon-bone junction (TBJ) are limited by a lack of understanding of how insoluble (microstructure, composition) and soluble regulators of stem cell fate work in concert to promote bioactivity and differentiation. One strategy for regenerating the interface is to design biomaterials containing spatially graded structural properties sufficient to induce divergent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into multiple interface-specific phenotypes. This work explores the hypothesis that selective structural modification to a 3D collagen?glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffold combined with biochemical supplementation can drive human bone-marrow-derived MSC differentiation down tenogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Tenogenic differentiation is enhanced in geometrically anisotropic scaffolds versus a standard isotropic control. Notably, blebbistatin treatment abrogates this microstructurally driven effect. Further, enhanced osteogenic differentiation and new mineral synthesis are achieved by incorporation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase within the CG scaffold along with the use of osteogenic induction media. Finally, chondrogenic differentiation is optimally driven by combining chondrogenic induction media with a reduced density scaffold that promotes increased cellular condensation, significantly higher expression of chondrogenic genes, and increased GAG deposition. Together these data provide critical insight regarding design rules for elements of an integrated biomaterial platform for orthopedic interface regeneration.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two categories of joint overloading cause post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA): single acute traumatic loads/impactions and repetitive overloading due to incongruity/instability. We developed and refined three classes of complementary models to define relationships between joint overloading and progressive cartilage loss across the spectrum of acute injuries and chronic joint abnormalities: explant and whole joint models that allow probing of cellular responses to mechanical injury and contact stresses, animal models that enable study of PTOA pathways in living joints and pre-clinical testing of treatments, and patient-specific computational models that define the overloading that causes OA in humans. We coordinated methodologies across models so that results from each informed the others, maximizing the benefit of this complementary approach. We are incorporating results from these investigations into biomathematical models to provide predictions of PTOA risk and guide treatment. Each approach has limitations, but each provides opportunities to elucidate PTOA pathogenesis. Taken together, they help define levels of joint overloading that cause cartilage destruction, show that both forms of overloading can act through the same biologic pathways, and create a framework for initiating clinical interventions that decrease PTOA risk. Considered collectively, studies extending from explants to humans show that thresholds of joint overloading that cause cartilage loss can be defined, that to at least some extent both forms of joint overloading act through the same biologic pathways, and interventions that interrupt these pathways prevent cartilage damage. These observations suggest that treatments that decrease the risk of all forms of OA progression can be discovered. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The pathophysiology and clinical phenomenology of epileptic psychoses are wide and varied, and an internationally accepted classification system has yet to be established. A multi-axial classification should be developed to capture the complexity of clinicai situations and to describe the heterogeneity of individuals presenting with the same diagnosis. We propose a new 5-axial classification system based on a review of the previous literature and evaluate its validity and applicability in Japan by a multi-institutional design. Methods: According to the ICD-10 guidelines, psychosis is defined as the presence of hallucination, delusions, or a limited number of behavioral abnormalities, such as gross excitement and overactivity, marked psychomotor retardation, and catatonic behavior, without disturbance of consciousness. Among the patients with epilepsy and psy- choses treated by the authors at 6 epilepsy clinics, 128 patients were randomly selected to participate as subjects. Those patients who developed epilepsy after the onset of their psychoses were excluded. The average age of the subjects was 39.4 years, average age of onset of epilepsy was 13.3 years, and average age of onset of psychoses was 27.9 years. Results: The first axis codes the type of epilepsy and laterality of epileptic focus. Temporal lobe epilepsy (48%) and other localization-related epilepsies (14%) were prevalent, but all types of epilepsy were seen. Left-sided (29%) and right-sided foci (27%) were in equal proportion, and bilateral foci (9%) also were found. The second axis codes the type of psychoses and clinical course. Paranoid schizophrenia-like disorder (41%) and delusional disorder (19%) were prevalent; whereas acute transient psychotic disorder (9%), catatonic disorder (7%), hallucinosis (6%), and hebephrenic schizophrenia-like disorder (4%) were relatively infrequent. Single episode (24%), recurrent episodes (34%), and chronic course (34%) were found in almost equal proportion. Therc were several cases with chronic course after recurrent episodes (3%). The third axis codes the temporal relationship between seizure occurrence and EEG changes during psychoses. lnterictal onset (69%) was most frequent followed by postictal (15%), para-ictal (6%), and other (5%). EEG changes during psychoses were seen in 38%, and normalization of the EEG was seen in 4%of patients. In 22%, EEG could not be recorded during psychoses (22%). The fourth axis codes the precipitating factors of psychoses. Specific personality trait (20%), changes in drug-regimen (l4%), co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders (12%), and psychosocial factors (10%) were seen. The fifth axis codes the organic background. Abnormal findings by brain imaging techniques (38%). mild intelligence deficiency (30%), and previous history of brain damage (27%) were noted. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate the heterogeneity of epileptic psychoses. We have proposed a 5-axial classification that appears to provide a convenient format for organizing and communicating clinical information to assist clinical practice and facilitate research. Using those guidelines, we may be able to improve our under- standing of the pathogenesis, develop suitable treatment, predict the prognosis, and ultimately establish appropriate intervention strategies.

AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - Objective:? Bone involvement in chronic renal failure is manifested long before the initiation of dialysis and is more prevalent in patients receiving inadequate conservative phase management. This study aimed at identifying the extent of renal bone disease among pre-dialysis and maintenance dialysis patients. Method: Thirty-two patients (gr 1) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for variable period of time were compared to twenty newly detected, irregularly treated, (gr 2) pre-dialysis severe renal failure patients for their clinical, biochemical, and imaging features. Result:?Mean age of gr 1 and gr 2 patients was 45?±?14 vs. 34?±?15 years (p?<?0.05). Comparison of blood biochemistry between group 1 and 2 showed serum creatinine 9.9?±?2.9 vs. 13.4?±?4.4?mg/dl (P?<?0.01), calcium 10?±?1.4 vs. 7.4?±?1?mg/dl (p?<?0.001); phosphate 4.4?±?1 vs. 8?±?2?mg/dl (p?<?0.008); ionized calcium 4.7?±?0.1 vs. 3.9?±?0.7?mg/dl (p?<?0.05); alkaline phosphatase 116?±?31 vs. 86?±?31?IU/l (p?<?0.05); and iPTH 72?±?48 vs. 147?±?92?pg/ml (p?<?0.05). Radiological changes present in the two groups were osteopenia-63% vs. 65%(P?=?NS); trabecular resorption-53% vs. 20%(p?<?0.05); soft tissue calcification-31% vs. 10%(p?<?0.05); bone cyst-16% vs. 25%(P?=?NS) and subperiosteal bone resorption-16% vs. 20%(P?=?NS). Tc 99MDP bone scan combined in both groups of patients (n?=?52) showed increased uptake in wrist joint (29%), tibia-fibula (25%), costochondral junction, vertebral column (15% each), sternum (13%), radius and ulna (10%), and calvaria and mandible (8% each). X-ray finding was positive for bone involvement in 59% cases and Tc 99 scan was positive in 80%(p?<?0.05). Association study showed iPTH had a negative correlation with serum calcium (r?=??0.5, p?<?0.05) and a positive correlation with serum phosphate (r?=?0.7, p?<?0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (r?=?0.9, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:?It is concluded that pre-dialysis newly detected renal failure patients may present with deranged calcium homeostasis and can manifest high prevalence of bone involvement when compared to maintenance hemo-dialysis patients.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.

AB  - SUMMARY Two patients who presented with skin fragility and a bullous eruption were found to have amyloid deposits along the epidermal basement membrane. In both cases a basement membrane similar to that observed in pemphigoid was seen on direct immunofluorescence resulting from the non-specific absorption of immunoglobulins by the amyloid deposits. Evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia was found in both patients, one of whom developed nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Clinico-pathological studies have shown that the clinical diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia (MID) is even more difficult than that of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The study evaluated the significance of course characteristics for the diagnosis of MID and DAT. Course characteristics were rated when 57 demented patients were admitted to our neurogeriatric department. Diagnosis of MID and DAT, respectively, was established after a follow-up study with repeated neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological investigations. In 21 cases diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem neuropathology. MID lacked the typical course of the disease in about two thirds of patients, while most DAT patients presented with the typical course of primary degenerative dementia. Features of the ?typical? clinical course of MID (abrupt onset, stepwise deterioration) helped to exclude DAT, whereas MID could not be excluded on the basis of a history of insidious onset and gradual decline.

AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Summary Careful assessment of the biochemistry panel and familiarity with normal biochemistry values for neonatal foals is imperative in the workup of any critically ill neonate, particularly those with neurological signs. The importance of rapidity of change compared to the absolute value of the biochemical abnormality must be emphasised. Serial biochemical panels ideally assist in assessing rapidity of change. Many foals can have severe biochemical derangements in the absence of seizures. Identifying values that are significantly out of range should spur immediate therapy to correct them and potentially additional diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the abnormalities. A temporal relationship between correction of biochemical abnormalities and resolution of seizures and encephalopathic signs supports causation.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims The gold standard procedure after a severe nerve injury is the nerve autograft, yet this technique has drawbacks. In recent years, progress has been made in the development of artificial nerve guides to replace the autograft, but no device has been able to demonstrate superiority. The present study introduces an adaptable foundation design for peripheral nerve regeneration. Methods Silk fibroin was electrospun, creating a tri-layered material with aligned fiber surfaces and a randomly deposited fiber interior. This material was rolled into a micro-channeled conduit, which was then enveloped by a jacket layer of the same tri-layered material. Results The proposed implant design succeeds in incorporating various desirable aspects of synthetic nerve guides, while facilitating the surgical implantation process for medical application. The aligned fiber surfaces of the conduit support axon guidance, while the tri-layered architecture improves its structural integrity compared with a fully aligned fiber material. Moreover, the jacket layer creates a small niche on each end which facilitates surgical implantation. An in vivo study in rats showed that nerve regeneration using this device was comparable to results after direct suture. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study, therefore, advances the development of tissue engineered nerve grafts by creating an optimized guidance conduit design capable of successful nerve regeneration.

AB  - Identifying and characterizing top predators? use of trophic resources provides important information about animal ecology and their response to changing conditions. Information from sources such as stable isotopes can be used to infer changes in resource use as direct observations in the wild are difficult to obtain, particularly in the marine environment. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values were recovered from the canine teeth of grey seals collected from haul outs in the central North Sea in the 1970/1980s (n = 44) and 2000s (n = 25), spanning a period of marked ecosystem changes in the region. Extracting material deposited during juvenile and adult life-stages, we reconstructed a multi-decadal record of δ15N and δ13C variation. Using established correlations between stable isotope ratios and sea bottom temperature we created a proxy for baseline isotopic variability to account for this source of temporal change. We found 1) a significant long-term decline in juvenile grey seal δ15N values, suggesting trophic position has decreased over time; 2) a decline in adult δ15N values and contraction in stable isotopic niche space after the North Sea regime shift, signifying both a decline in trophic position and change in foraging habits over the 20th century; and 3) evidence for dietary segregation between juvenile and adult animals, showing juvenile individuals feeding at a lower trophic position and in more nearshore areas than adults. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mining archived biological samples to address ecological questions and imply important ontogenetic and long-term shifts in the feeding ecology of a top predator. Long-term changes in grey seal trophic dynamics may be partly in response to well documented ecosystem changes in the North Sea. Such indirect monitoring of marine predators may have utility when set in the context of ecosystem assessments where paucity of long-term monitoring data is prevalent.

AB  - Abstract Aim. To recognize epileptic spasms (ES) as a seizure type after traumatic brain injury (TBI), accidental or non-accidental, in infants and children. In the process, we aim to gain some insight into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in ES. Methods. A retrospective electronic chart review was performed at the Children's Hospital of Michigan from 2002 to 2012. Electronic charts of 321 patients were reviewed for evidence of post-traumatic epilepsy. Various clinical variables were collected including age at TBI, mechanism of trauma, severity of brain injury, electroencephalography/neuroimaging data, and seizure semiology. Results. Six (12.8%) of the 47 patients diagnosed with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) had ES. Epileptic spasms occurred between two months to two years after TBI. All patients with ES had multiple irritative zones, manifesting as multifocal epileptiform discharges, unilateral or bilateral. Cognitive delay and epileptic encephalopathy were seen in all six patients, five of whom were free of spasms after treatment with vigabatrin or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Conclusion. The risk of PTE is 47/321(14.6%) and the specific risk of ES after TBI is 6/321 (1.8%). The risk of ES appears to be high if the age at which severe TBI occurred was during infancy. Non-accidental head trauma is a risk factor of epileptic spasms. While posttraumatic epilepsy (not ES) may start 10 years after the head injury, ES starts within two years, according to our small cohort. The pathophysiology of ES is unknown, however, our data support a combination of previously proposed models in which the primary dysfunction is a focal or diffuse cortical abnormality, coupled with its abnormal interaction with the subcortical structures and brainstem at a critical maturation stage.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU). A population-based cohort study involving 1018 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n?=?865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n?=?147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n?=?110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n?=?37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p?<?0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR?=?7.279, 95% CI: 1.299?40.784, p?<?0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p?<?0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR?=?4.554, 95% CI: 3.14?5.12, p?<?0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C?>?1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.

AB  - ABSTRACT Knee injuries cause structural damage and acute inflammation that initiates the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a member of a family of enzymes that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in normal development of the musculoskeletal system, but may increase ROS production to harmful levels after joint injury. The role of ROS in both normal joint homeostasis and injury is poorly understood, but inhibition of excessive ROS production by Nox4 after joint injury could be protective to the joint, decreasing oxidative stress, and initiation of PTOA. Knee injuries were simulated using inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary human chondrocytes and a non-invasive mouse model of PTOA in C57BL/6N and Nox4 knockout mice. There is an acute decrease in Nox4 activity within 24?h after injury in both systems, followed by a subsequent sustained low-level increase, a novel finding not seen in any other system. Inhibition of Nox4 activity by GKT137831 was protective against early structural changes after non-invasive knee injury in a mouse model. Nox4 knockout mice had significant differences in structural and mechanical properties of bone, providing further evidence for the role of Nox4 in development of joint tissues and biochemical response after joint injury. Nox4 plays a significant role in the acute phase after joint injury, and targeted inhibition of inflammation caused by Nox4 may be protective against early joint changes in the pathogenesis of PTOA. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.
