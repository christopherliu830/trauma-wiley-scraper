AB  - Summary Ureteral obstructions are a major clinical problem in small animal veterinary patients most commonly associated with ureteroliths, ureteral strictures, and trigonal neoplasia of the ureterovesicular junction (UVJ). With the invasiveness and morbidity associated with traditional surgical treatments, interventional options have become the mainstay of treatment in the author's practice. The main treatment options discussed in this chapter are the use of nephrostomy tubes, ureteral stents, and subcutaneous ureteral bypass devices (SUB). Ureteral stenting is most commonly accomplished using endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance in canine patients, and surgically-assisted with fluoroscopy in feline patients. These devices are used for a variety of obstructive disorders in both dogs and cats. The main type of ureteral stent used in veterinary medicine is an indwelling soft double pigtail ureteral stent that can remain in place for numerous months to years if necessary.

AB  - Objective To examine the technical feasibility of percutaneous endoscopic pediculectomy using a lateral approach and to evaluate its use for decompression and examination of the thoracic and lumbar spinal canals in small dogs. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Clinically normal adult dogs (n=10). Methods After optimizing the technique in cadavers, percutaneous endoscopic pediculectomy was performed using a lateral approach to the thoracic (T12) or lumbar (L2) vertebrae in 5 dogs each. Using fluoroscopic guidance, a K-wire, dilator, and (cannula) working sleeve were placed. A window for visualizing the spinal cord and floor of the spinal canal was created using a specialized drill, rongeurs, trephine, and elevator. Gait and neurologic status were monitored postoperatively, and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed. Results All procedures were completed successfully (T12, 45?±?13 minutes; L2, 59?±?14 minutes) with clear observation of the spinal cord and floor of the spinal canal. Normal ambulation was maintained in 9 dogs. One dog in the L2 group had ipsilateral hind limb weakness that resolved within 4 days. One dog in the L2 group suffered a fracture of the accessory process. One dog each in the T12 and L2 groups had hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI images, suspicious of focal edema, which reduced at 4 weeks after initial examination, possibly reflecting gliosis. Conclusion Pediculectomy using a percutaneous endoscopic thoracolumbar lateral approach is feasible, provides a good view of the spinal canal, and may be an alternative for treatment of disk disease in dogs.

AB  - Objectives: To review the literature on intracranial empyema and report two new cases in cats. Methods: Literature review and case reports. Results: Intracranial empyema has been rarely reported in small animals. In two novel cases in cats, the route of infection was postulated to be local extension from a retrobulbar abscess of odontogenic origin in one case and direct inoculation from a penetrating bite wound to the skull, confirmed at post-mortem examination, in the other. On magnetic resonance imaging of the first case, there was a contrast-enhancing large extra-axial fluid collection overlying the right cerebral hemisphere, consistent with subdural empyema. Infection was caused by an Actinomyces spp. This is the first report of successful treatment of intracranial empyema by craniotomy, drainage and antibiotics. Clinical Significance: Intracranial empyema is a neurosurgical emergency. Favourable outcomes may be achieved with surgical decompression, antimicrobial therapy and intensive care.

AB  - A 14-month-old, male German shepherd dog was evaluated for chronic, recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. An initial diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made, which resolved with appropriate antibacterial therapy. The urinary tract infection, however, did not resolve and on further investigation a bladder trigone diverticulum was evident, thought to be congenital in origin. This report describes the apparent ultrasonographic and radiological changes, and surgical repair of the diverticulum, and reviews the literature with regard to both congenital bladder trigone diverticulum and emphysematous cystitis. The former has never been documented in the dog and the latter is an unusual finding in a non-diabetic dog.

AB  - Diffusion MRI is extensively used to study brain microarchitecture and pathologies, and water diffusion appears highly anisotropic in the white matter (WM) of the spinal cord (SC). Despite these facts, the use of diffusion MRI to study the SC, which has increased in recent years, is much less common than that in the brain. In the present review, after a brief outline of early studies of diffusion MRI (DWI) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the SC, we provide a short survey on DTI and on diffusion MRI methods beyond the tensor that have been used to study SC microstructure and pathologies. After introducing the porous view of WM and describing the q-space approach and q-space diffusion MRI (QSI), we describe other methodologies that can be applied to study the SC. Selected applications of the use of DTI, QSI, and other more advanced diffusion MRI methods to study SC microstructure and pathologies are presented, with some emphasis on the use of less conventional diffusion methodologies. Because of length constraints, we concentrate on structural studies and on a few selected pathologies. Examples of the use of diffusion MRI to study dysmyelination, demyelination as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic SC injury are presented. We conclude with a brief summary and a discussion of challenges and future directions for diffusion MRI of the SC. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary We report a case of primary cutaneous cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent host. Several nodules, isolated or sometimes joint to form plaques, affected the right arm. The arm was paralytic and hypoplastic, and a history of numerous abrasions picking firewood up preceded the onset of the eruption. Histology on skin biopsy documented a dermal infiltrate constituted of histiocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and rare giant cells. Numerous rounded periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) bodies were also present. Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans grew upon culture. Complete blood, biochemical and instrumental examinations resulted in findings within normal range. Treatment with itraconazole 200?mg daily for 4?months led to complete recovery. During a 2-year follow-up, the patient did not present any relapse or dissemination to other organs.

AB  - Abstract Cystic fibrosis patients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trauma, burn wound, or patients requiring ventilation are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physiological innate defense mechanisms against this pathogen, and their alterations in lung diseases, are for the most part unknown. We now demonstrate a role for the sphingoid long chain base, sphingosine, in determining susceptibility to lung infection by P. aeruginosa. Tracheal and bronchial sphingosine levels were significantly reduced in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients and from cystic fibrosis mouse models due to reduced activity of acid ceramidase, which generates sphingosine from ceramide. Inhalation of mice with sphingosine, with a sphingosine analog, FTY720, or with acid ceramidase rescued susceptible mice from infection. Our data suggest that luminal sphingosine in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells prevents pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in normal individuals, paving the way for novel therapeutic paradigms based on inhalation of acid ceramidase or of sphingoid long chain bases in lung infection.

AB  - Abdominal wall hernia is a recurrent issue world-wide and requires the implantation of over 1 million meshes per year. Because permanent meshes such as polypropylene and polyester are not free of complications after implantation, many mesh modifications and new functionalities have been investigated over the last decade. Indeed, mesh optimization is the focus of intense development and the biomaterials utilized are now envisioned as being bioactive substrates that trigger various physiological processes in order to prevent complications and to promote tissue integration. In this context, it is of paramount interest to review the most relevant bio-functionalities being brought to new meshes and to open new avenues for the innovative development of the next generation of meshes with enhanced properties for functional abdominal wall hernia repair.

AB  - Abstract This article reviews data on the prevalence of panic, social phobia, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder, and research documenting the comorbidity of these disorders with major depression (MDD). These anxiety disorders are frequently comorbid with MDD, and 50?60% of individuals with MDD report a lifetime history of one or more of these anxiety disorders. The anxiety disorders are also highly correlated with one another, and approximately one-quarter to one-half of individuals with each of the anxiety disorders report a lifetime history of an alcohol or substance use disorder. Anxiety disorders rarely exist in isolation, with several studies reporting that over 90% of individuals with anxiety disorders have a lifetime history of other psychiatric problems. Implications for research are discussed, including the potential benefit of using combined categorical and dimensional rating scale approaches in future genetic, biochemical, neuroimaging, and treatment studies. The clinical implications of the findings are also discussed, and the results of recent clinical trials summarized. Available data suggests selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first-line pharmacological treatment for these disorders, and that newer serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors show significant promise, especially for comorbid cases. Comorbidity among depression and anxiety disorders is associated with greater symptom severity, and a considerably higher incidence of suicidality. Increased public awareness about these disorders and the availability of effective treatments is sorely needed. Depression and Anxiety, Volume 12, Supplement 1:69?76, 2000.

AB  - Summary Background Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is a rare cause of lameness in the adult horse, and a haematogenous pathogenesis has been proposed in previous cases. Objectives To describe the features and outcome of synovial sepsis of unknown origin in adult Thoroughbred racehorses. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Hospital records for admissions between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed to identify adult horses diagnosed with synovial sepsis of unknown origin. Presentation, clinicopathological, microbiological and diagnostic imaging findings were recorded. Treatment methods, surgical findings, complications and long-term outcome were evaluated. Results Eleven cases were identified over the study period. Diagnosis was established from clinical examination and clinicopathologic findings, which were comparable to other aetiologies of synovial sepsis. Affected structures included synovial joints, tendon sheaths and bursae. Concurrent osteochondritis dissecans or articular cartilage lesions were evident during arthroscopic surgery in three cases. Significant intrasynovial haemorrhage was not identified. Microbial culture of synovial fluid or synovial biopsy was positive in 6/11 of cases, with all isolates being Gram-positive cocci. Of the 6 positive microbial cultures, all isolates demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to a cephalosporin antimicrobial agent. A concurrent remote wound was present in a single case. No other potential origins of bacteraemia were identified. Treatment methods included endoscopic surgery, standing multineedle lavage, intravenous regional limb perfusion, intrasynovial medication and/or systemic antimicrobial administration. All horses survived to hospital discharge. For the 6/11 cases that raced following synovial sepsis, the median period for return to racing was 221 days. Main limitations A small study population, which was retrospectively reviewed. Conclusions Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is rare in the adult Thoroughbred racehorse and can affect a range of synovial structures. A concurrent potential source of bacteraemia is rarely identified. With appropriate management, the prognosis to return to racing is fair.

AB  - A young asymptomatic patient, with moderate haemophilia due to factor IX deficiency, developed symptoms of upper cord compression caused by a haemorrhage 12?hours after riding a motorcycle on a poorly maintained road. This led to quadriparesis with respiratory paralysis. In spite of neurosurgical intervention and intensive management with respirator therapy, the patient died 13?days after the incident from pneumonia and multi-organ failure. This is a very rare presentation of moderate haemophilia with serious consequences and has not to our knowledge, previously been reported in the English literature.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Summary Primary care guidelines provide a reference point to guide clinicians based on a systematic review of the literature, contextualised by expert clinical opinion. These guidelines develop a modification of the GRADE framework for assessment of research evidence (vetGRADE) and applied this to a range of clinical scenarios regarding use of analgesic agents. Key guidelines produced by the panel included recommendations that horses undergoing routine castration should receive intratesticular local anaesthesia irrespective of methods adopted and that horses should receive NSAIDs prior to surgery (overall certainty levels high). Butorphanol and buprenorphine should not be considered appropriate as sole analgesic for such procedures (high certainty). The panel recommend the continuation of analgesia for 3 days following castration (moderate certainty) and conclude that phenylbutazone provided superior analgesia to meloxicam and firocoxib for hoof pain/laminitis (moderate certainty), but that enhanced efficacy has not been demonstrated for joint pain. In horses with colic, flunixin and firocoxib are considered to provide more effective analgesia than meloxicam or phenylbutazone (moderate certainty). Given the risk of adverse events of all classes of analgesic, these agents should be used only under the control of a veterinary surgeon who has fully evaluated a horse and developed a therapeutic, analgesic plan that includes ongoing monitoring for such adverse events such as the development of right dorsal colitis with all classes of NSAID and spontaneous locomotor activity and potentially ileus with opiates. Finally, the panel call for the development of a single properly validated composite pain score for horses to allow accurate comparisons between medications in a robust manner.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2012; 19: 402?408 ? 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Background:? Physical and molecular mechanisms for the neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia are not completely understood, and new therapeutic applications incorporating hypothermia remain to be developed and tested. Clinically relevant animal models of therapeutic hypothermia are not well established or consistent. Objectives:? The objective was to develop and test an inexpensive small animal therapeutic hypothermia system that models those in widespread clinical use and verify that such a system confers neuroprotection in a rat model of global brain ischemia. Methods:? A water-cooled extracorporeal system and attendant anesthesia/sedation protocol were developed and tested. In Stage 1, animals were instrumented for brain, temporalis, and rectal temperature monitoring, and the system was tested for its effect on temperature and hemodynamics. In Stage 2, animals were instrumented for rectal temperature only, subjected to global brain ischemia by two-vessel occlusion and hypotension for 8?minutes, and given either sham therapy (37°C) or hypothermia (32°C) for 4?hours. Viable CA1 neurons were counted at 7?days. Results:? The system was well tolerated, provided exquisite control of animal core and brain temperatures, and conferred robust neuroprotection at 7?days. The median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) of viable neurons per 300-?m field were 130 (IQR?=?128 to 135) for sham control, 19 (IQR?=?15 to 30) for untreated ischemic animals, and 101 (IQR?=?94 to 113) for ischemic animals treated with hypothermia (p?<?0.05 for comparison between all groups). Conclusions:? Like human protocols, this model incorporates sedation and analgesia, results in robust neuroprotection, is well tolerated, and offers exquisite temperature control. The system is noninvasive and inexpensive and offers a model that is similar to methods used in clinical practice. This system will be of interest to investigators using small animal models to examine neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia and translational strategies that combine hypothermia with targeted pharmacotherapy.

AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.
