AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence rate of dementia and its subtypes in Japan and to investigate the relationship of risk factors, such as demographic features and disease history, to the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. DESIGN: A prevalence study within a longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: The original Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort consisted of atomic-bomb survivors and their controls selected from residents in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using the 1950 national census supplementary schedules and the Atomic Bomb Survivors Survey. Since 1958, the AHS subjects have been followed through biennial medical examinations. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were 637 men and 1585 women aged 60 years or older in the AHS cohort. Forty-eight subjects resided in hospitals and institutions. MEASUREMENTS: In addition to the biennial medical examinations ongoing since 1958, a screening test for cognitive impairment (CASI) was conducted by trained nurses between September 1992 and September 1996. The prevalence of dementia and its subtypes was assessed in 343 subjects suspected to have dementia and in 272 subjects with high CASI scores who were selected randomly. RESULTS: The prevalence of dementia based on DSM III/R criteria, using neurological examination, the IQCODE, and CDR ≥ 1, was 7.2%. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 2.0% in men and 3.8% in women, and the prevalence of vascular dementia was 2.0% in men and 1.8% in women. The relationship of risk factors to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia was investigated by the multivariate logistic linear regression analysis. Odds ratios of Alzheimer's disease for age (in 10-year increments), attained education (in 3-year increments), history of head trauma, and history of cancer are 6.3, 0.6, 7.4, and 0.3, respectively. Odds ratios of vascular dementia for age, history of stroke, and history of hypertension are 2.0, 35.7, and 4.0, respectively. Neither type of dementia showed any significant effect of sex or radiation exposure. CONCLUSION: This study is the first study of Japanese dementia rates carried out with a protocol similar enough to that of a US study to allow meaningful comparisons. The prevalence rates demonstrated are more similar to US rates than were found in many previous reports in Japan. J Am Geriatr Soc 47:189?195, 1999.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2012; 19: 402?408 ? 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Background:? Physical and molecular mechanisms for the neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia are not completely understood, and new therapeutic applications incorporating hypothermia remain to be developed and tested. Clinically relevant animal models of therapeutic hypothermia are not well established or consistent. Objectives:? The objective was to develop and test an inexpensive small animal therapeutic hypothermia system that models those in widespread clinical use and verify that such a system confers neuroprotection in a rat model of global brain ischemia. Methods:? A water-cooled extracorporeal system and attendant anesthesia/sedation protocol were developed and tested. In Stage 1, animals were instrumented for brain, temporalis, and rectal temperature monitoring, and the system was tested for its effect on temperature and hemodynamics. In Stage 2, animals were instrumented for rectal temperature only, subjected to global brain ischemia by two-vessel occlusion and hypotension for 8?minutes, and given either sham therapy (37°C) or hypothermia (32°C) for 4?hours. Viable CA1 neurons were counted at 7?days. Results:? The system was well tolerated, provided exquisite control of animal core and brain temperatures, and conferred robust neuroprotection at 7?days. The median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) of viable neurons per 300-?m field were 130 (IQR?=?128 to 135) for sham control, 19 (IQR?=?15 to 30) for untreated ischemic animals, and 101 (IQR?=?94 to 113) for ischemic animals treated with hypothermia (p?<?0.05 for comparison between all groups). Conclusions:? Like human protocols, this model incorporates sedation and analgesia, results in robust neuroprotection, is well tolerated, and offers exquisite temperature control. The system is noninvasive and inexpensive and offers a model that is similar to methods used in clinical practice. This system will be of interest to investigators using small animal models to examine neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia and translational strategies that combine hypothermia with targeted pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Summary A broad range of fractures and associated injuries present to orthopedic and trauma surgeons for management. Fracture healing involves a combination of inflammatory, vascular, anabolic, and catabolic events. Fracture management can be divided into nonoperative and operative techniques. The nonoperative technique consists of a closed reduction, achieved by applying traction to the long axis of the injured limb and then reversing the mechanism of injury. If the fracture cannot be reduced, surgical intervention is likely to be required. Plates and screws are commonly used in the management of articular fractures as they provide strength and stability to neutralize the forces on the injured limb for functional postoperative aftercare. Osteoporotic fractures are usually low-energy injuries. Acute vertebral compression fractures can be painful and lead to disability, whereas multiple ?silent? compression fractures lead to kyphosis and loss of height.

AB  - Abstract In diabetes, the number of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) decreases and their differentiation is impaired. However, the exact mechanism is unclear. Patients with diabetes often experience sympathetic nerve injury. Norepinephrine (NE), a major mediator of the sympathetic nervous system, influences rat MSC migration in culture and in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of NE on MSCs under high glucose conditions; therefore MSCs were treated with high glucose and NE. High glucose-induced MSCs apoptosis, which was reversed by NE. To verify the effect of NE, mice underwent sympathectomy and were used to establish a diabetic model. Diabetic mice with sympathectomy had a higher apoptosis rate and higher levels of reactive oxygen species in their bone marrow-derived cells than diabetic mice without sympathectomy. High glucose inhibited p-AKT production and B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 expression, and promoted BAX and caspase-3 expression. NE reversed these effects of high glucose. An AKT inhibitor enhanced the effects of high glucose. Thus, NE had a protective effect on MSC apoptosis induced by high glucose, possibly via the AKT/BCL-2 pathway.

AB  - Abstract Objective To provide a current review of the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcomes in critically ill patients presenting to the ED with acute pancreatitis and subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre in Australia. Methods A retrospective single-centre study of adult patients admitted with pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis defined by Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score ≥2. Results Eighty-seven patients fulfilled criteria for inclusion during the study period, representing 0.9% of all ICU admissions. The median age of patients was 54. Survival was independent of patients? age, sex, aetiology and comorbidities. Mortality was 30.8% for both inpatient referrals to the ICU and for direct referrals via the ED. Higher mortality was identified among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (74.2 vs 24.6% in survivors; P?<?0.0001), vasopressor support (85.7 vs 33.8% in survivors; P?<?0.0001) or renal replacement therapy (60 vs 16.9% in survivors; P?<?0.002). BISAP score surpasses Ranson's and Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II scores in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors among unselected patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to ICU, whereas APACHE II discriminates better in the cohort admitted from ED. Conclusion Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Aetiology and comorbidity did not predict adverse outcomes in this population. BISAP score is non-inferior to APACHE II score as a prognostic tool in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used to triage admission. Evidence of persistent organ dysfunction and requirements for organ support reliably identify patients at high-risk of death.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Health, disease, and immune function are key areas of research in studies of ecology and evolution, but work on free-ranging primates has been inhibited by a lack of direct noninvasive measures of condition. Here, we evaluate the potential usefulness of noninvasive measurement of three biomarkers, the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin, and neopterin, a by-product of macrophage activity. Materials and Methods We took advantage of veterinary checks on captive rhesus (24) and long-tailed (3) macaques at the German Primate Center (DPZ) to analyze serum marker measures, before measuring concentrations in feces and urine, and evaluating relationships between matched serum, urine, and fecal concentrations. In a second study, we monitored excretion of these markers in response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and surgical tissue trauma, undertaken for a separate study. Results We found that each biomarker could be measured in each matrix. Serum and urinary concentrations of neopterin were strongly and significantly correlated, but neither haptoglobin nor CRP concentrations in excreta proxied circulating serum concentrations. Our infection study confirmed that urinary neopterin, in particular, is a reliable marker of viral infection in macaques, but also indicated the potential of urinary and fecal CRP and haptoglobin as indicators of inflammation. Discussion We highlight the potential of noninvasive markers of immune function, especially of urinary neopterin, which correlates strongly with serum neopterin, and is highly responsive to infection.

AB  - Summary Primary care guidelines provide a reference point to guide clinicians based on a systematic review of the literature, contextualised by expert clinical opinion. These guidelines develop a modification of the GRADE framework for assessment of research evidence (vetGRADE) and applied this to a range of clinical scenarios regarding use of analgesic agents. Key guidelines produced by the panel included recommendations that horses undergoing routine castration should receive intratesticular local anaesthesia irrespective of methods adopted and that horses should receive NSAIDs prior to surgery (overall certainty levels high). Butorphanol and buprenorphine should not be considered appropriate as sole analgesic for such procedures (high certainty). The panel recommend the continuation of analgesia for 3 days following castration (moderate certainty) and conclude that phenylbutazone provided superior analgesia to meloxicam and firocoxib for hoof pain/laminitis (moderate certainty), but that enhanced efficacy has not been demonstrated for joint pain. In horses with colic, flunixin and firocoxib are considered to provide more effective analgesia than meloxicam or phenylbutazone (moderate certainty). Given the risk of adverse events of all classes of analgesic, these agents should be used only under the control of a veterinary surgeon who has fully evaluated a horse and developed a therapeutic, analgesic plan that includes ongoing monitoring for such adverse events such as the development of right dorsal colitis with all classes of NSAID and spontaneous locomotor activity and potentially ileus with opiates. Finally, the panel call for the development of a single properly validated composite pain score for horses to allow accurate comparisons between medications in a robust manner.

PY  - 1997
AB  - This review summarizes the published literature on suicide by jumping, in particular focusing on the social and psychological characteristics of people who have chosen this method of suicide, and the opportunities for prevention. Suicide by jumping accounts for 5% of suicides in England and Wales, and there are marked variations in the use of this method world-wide. A number of locations have gained notoriety as popular places from which to jump. Such sites include The Golden Gate Bridge and Niagara Falls in the USA, and Beachy Head and the Clifton Suspension Bridge in the UK. There is no consistent evidence that those who commit suicide by jumping differ sociodemographically or in their psychopathology from those who use other methods of suicide, although this method is more often used for in-patient suicides, possibly due to lack of access to other means. Survivors of suicidal jumps experience higher subsequent rates of suicide and mental ill health, but the majority do not go on to kill themselves, suggesting that preventive efforts may be worthwhile. This view is supported by other evidence that restricting access to the means of suicide may prevent some would-be suicides. Such measures may also reduce the emotional trauma suffered by those who witness these acts. Health authorities and coroners should consider reviewing local patterns of suicide by jumping, and if necessary institute preventive measures.

AB  - Summary:? The interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts is regulated by reciprocal survival strategies, including competition for essential nutrients. Though paradoxical, mammalian hosts have learned to take advantage of amino acid catabolism for controlling pathogen invasion and, at the same time, regulating their own immune responses. In this way, ancient catabolic enzymes have acquired novel functions and evolved into new structures with highly specialized functions, which go beyond the struggle for survival. In this review, we analyze the evidence supporting a critical role for the metabolism of various amino acids in regulating different steps of both innate and adaptive immunity.

AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.

The DVI process requires that different expertise areas are integrated and work towards the common goal of identifying all victims. Police, medical and dental specialties all work together. The key to an efficient and accurate process is the strategy planning and coordination of a response. The accepted international documentation related to DVI is the INTERPOL ante-mortem (AM) and post-mortem (PM) forms, which can be downloaded from the Interpol website. AM dental records may contain handwritten and/or digital clinical information, dental and/or facial radiographs, clinical photographs and dental models, and possibly also specific information from relatives and friends.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background and objective:? Many trace elements play important roles in activating or inhibiting enzymatic reactions, by competing with other elements and metalloproteins for binding sites, by affecting the permeability of cell membranes and by other mechanisms. They play important roles in the oxidant/antioxidant balance. As such, trace elements are thought to be involved directly or indirectly in the pathogenesis of several diseases. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect trace elements (Se, Mn and Zn) intravenously administered on the period the COPD patients spend on mechanical ventilation. Methods:? In a randomized double-blinded controlled trial a set of 120 subjects (40 normal volunteers and 80 COPD) were recruited. Serum concentration levels of Se, Mn and Zn were determined for all enrolled subjects with Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy. COPD patients received intravenous supplementation of the above trace elements and the period the patients spent on mechanical ventilation was determined. Results:? There was a significant reduction (P?=?0.013) in the period the patients with COPD spent on the mechanical ventilation when received intravenous supplementation (9.4?±?7.3?days) compared with the COPD patients who received placebo (17.8?±?7.6?days). Conclusions:? Trace element (Se, Mn and Zn) status is altered in critically ill patients with COPD. The supplementation achieved a reduction in the period those patients spent on the mechanical ventilation. A larger multi-centre trial is required to confirm this preventive effect and to explore its applicability to other critical care conditions.

AB  - The biochemical, haemodynamic, clinical, and nutritional benefits of nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) compared with (c/w) 4?hr, 3/week conventional haemodialysis (CHD) are well known and accrue by increasing dialysis time and frequency either for 8?hrs alternate night/week (NHD3.5) or for 8?hrs 6 nights/week NHD (NHD6). However, there is little data yet comparing NHD3.5 with NHD6. 13 NHD6(8.15?hrs/night) were c/w 14 NHD3.5(7.8?hrs/night), all with similar demographic profiles. NHD6 had unrestricted diet and fluid intake but NHD3.5 needed some restriction. Before (b) and after (a) HD phosphate (PO4) control was ideal though bPO4 levels for NHD6 were lower (1.64?mmol/l) c/w NHD3.5(1.83?mmol/l). All NHD6 needed PO4 supplementation c/w 2/14 NHD3.5 but 5/14 NHD3.5 needed PO4 binders c/w 0/13 NHD6. Both had normal blood pressures with 3/14 NHD3.5 needing anti-hypertensives c/w 2/13 NHD6. The bHb was 122.8?g/l (NHD6) c/w 127.7?g/l (NHD3.5) and the balbumin was 38.3?g/l (NHD6) c/w 37.7?g/l (NHD3.5). NHD6 had lower b blood urea (10.2 c/w 19.5?mmol/l) and less interdialytic urea and creatinine fluctuation. NHD6 ultrafiltration rates (UFR) and intradialytic weight gains (mean?±?SEM) were significantly lower (248?±?22.7?ml/hr and 2.03?±?0.19?kg) c/w NHD3.5(453?±?34.6?ml/hr and 2.85?±?0.27?kg): UFR p?<?0.10. We conclude that NHD6 offers the optimum biochemical, volume, and clinical outcome but NHD3.5 still has a clear and major advantage over CHD and a dual additional appeal to providers seeking home-based therapy cost advantages and consumable expenditure control. A flexible dialysis program should offer all the time and frequency options of NHD but, in particular, should support NHD at a frequency sympathetic to the clinical, rehabilitation, and lifestyle aspirations of individual patients.

AB  - A seven-year-old, ovariohysterectomised female dwarf lop rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was referred with severe swelling and erythema of the mucocutaneous junctions of the lips, nares and vulva. Bilateral, severe periocular dermatitis was also present. Heavy pure growths of a member of the Staphylococcus intermedius group were cultured from nasal and aural swabs and skin biopsies. Other possible differential diagnoses were eliminated by standard tests. The clinical features and histopathological characteristics of the biopsies were most consistent with mucocutaneous pyoderma, a dermatosis previously reported in dogs but not in rabbits. Treatment of the bacterial infection with oral marbofloxacin and topical ofloxacin eye drops together with supportive therapy resulted in resolution of the lesions. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of mucocutaneous bacterial pyoderma, similar to mucocutaneous pyoderma of dogs, in a rabbit.

AB  - Human perinatal tissues have been used for over a century as allogeneic biomaterials. Due to their advantageous properties including angiogenecity, anti-inflammation, anti-microbial, and immune privilege, these tissues are being utilized for novel applications across wide-ranging medical disciplines. Given continued clinical success, increased adoption of perinatal tissues as a disruptive technology platform has allowed for significant penetration into the multi-billion dollar biologics market. Here, we review current progress and future applications of perinatal biomaterials, as well as associated regulatory issues.

AB  - Abstract A 5·5-year-old male castrated Bernese mountain dog presented with respiratory difficulties and was diagnosed with haemorrhagic pericardial effusion which transformed into chylopericardium. Thoracic duct ligation and subtotal pericardiectomy in combination with biopsy of an enlarged tracheobronchial lymph node were performed. Multiple clusters of mesothelial cell emboli were observed in the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node. No causative agent for the pericardial effusion could be identified, suggesting that this is a case of mesothelial cell embolisation associated with idiopathic -chylopericardium in a dog.

AB  - Abstract Pathogenic mutations of the mitochondrial genome are frequently found to co-exist with wild-type mtDNA molecules, a state known as heteroplasmy. In most disease cases, the mutation is recessive with manifestation of a clinical phenotype occurring when the proportion of mutated mtDNA exceeds a high threshold. The concept of increasing the ratio of healthy to mutated mtDNA as a means to correcting the biochemical defect has received much attention. A number of strategies are highlighted in this article, including manipulation of the mitochondrial genome by antigenomic drugs or restriction endonucleases, zinc finger peptide-targeted nucleases and exercise-induced gene shifting. The feasibility of these approaches has been demonstrated in a number of models, however more work is necessary before use in human patients.

AB  - Summary Florid Cushing's syndrome (CS) may be due to severe hypercortisolemia (or synthetic glucocorticoid) presenting as an acute emergency requiring urgent intervention and appropriate management. The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient, and at the same time efforts to lower cortisol levels are the priority compared to the investigation of CS etiology. When the patient is stabilized, an effort to identify the source of CS and proceed to definitive treatment can be considered. However, these specific patients are at increased risk of a fatal outcome. Advances in the medical treatment of CS may improve the prognosis of this small subgroup of CS patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT A two-year-old spayed female shih-tzu was referred with a 10-month history of lethargy, chronic diarrhoea and weight loss. On presentation, a partial response to antibiotics was noted. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass, and serum biochemistry and haematology revealed a mature neutrophilia, hypoalbuminaemia and a non-regenerative anaemia. Contrast radiography and abdominal ultrasound were suggestive of an intraluminal foreign body. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a surgical swab in the lumen of the jejunum that was associated with severe adhesions. Histopathology showed evidence of transmural migration of the swab from the peritoneal cavity to the lumen of the jejunum.
