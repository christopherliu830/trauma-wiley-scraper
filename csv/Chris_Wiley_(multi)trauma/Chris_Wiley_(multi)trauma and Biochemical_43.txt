AB  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility, low bone mass, and bone deformities. The majority of cases are caused by autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that encode type I collagen, the major component of the bone matrix. The remaining cases are caused by autosomal recessively or dominantly inherited mutations in genes that are involved in the post-translational modification of type I collagen, act as type I collagen chaperones, or are members of the signaling pathways that regulate bone homeostasis. The main goals of treatment in OI are to decrease fracture incidence, relieve bone pain, and promote mobility and growth. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach, utilizing pharmacological interventions, physical therapy, orthopedic surgery, and monitoring nutrition with appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Bisphosphonate therapy, which has become the mainstay of treatment in OI, has proven beneficial in increasing bone mass, and to some extent reducing fracture risk. However, the response to treatment is not as robust as is seen in osteoporosis, and it seems less effective in certain types of OI, and in adult OI patients as compared to most pediatric cases. New pharmacological treatments are currently being developed, including anti-resorptive agents, anabolic treatment, and gene- and cell-therapy approaches. These therapies are under different stages of investigation from the bench-side, to pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this review, we will summarize the recent findings regarding the pharmacological and biological strategies for the treatment of patients with OI. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial inhibition plays a major role in the development of multiple organ failure during sepsis. Early correction of tissue hypoxia, strict control of glycaemia and modulation of oxidative and nitrosative stress may protect mitochondria during the acute inflammatory response. Once mitochondrial dysfunction has developed, the regulated induction of a hypometabolic state, analogous to hibernation, may protect the cells from severe bioenergetic failure and a critical fall in ATP. Though this is clinically manifest as organ dysfunction, it may actually represent an adaptive response to a prolonged, severe inflammatory stress. Repair of damaged organelles, stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and re-activation of cellular metabolism may accelerate the recovery phase and thus improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this review is to discuss putative interventions aimed at preventing or reversing mitochondrial dysfunction that may have possible clinical relevance, and to stress the importance of the correct timing of intervention.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bone is one of the most transplanted tissues. While most bone defects heal spontaneously, critical size defects caused by major trauma/malignant tumor and osteonecrosis of femoral head in young adults pose a great challenge in treatment. While the golden standard in treating bone defects is autologous bone grafting, available bone for grafting is quite limited in an individual. To solve the dilemma, stem cell therapy has been tried as a new modality of treatment in lesions not amenable to autologous bone grafting. While successful results were reported from individual studies, the stem cell therapy is still not an established treatment modality for bone regeneration and needs further assessment. Our focus herein is to introduce stem cell sources that have been investigated so far and review the current status of stem cell reutilization for bone regeneration as well as suggesting future perspectives.

AB  - Abstract This paper studies the impact of multi-layered transport exclusion on the mobility and accessibility of Palestinian women in Jerusalem. Ethnic segregation, hostile social climate, poor infrastructure and low levels of public transportation create multifaceted barriers to daily travel throughout the city. This research sheds light on the individual needs and decisions of women in making their travel choices in an exclusionary urban environment. This research is based on eight in-depth interviews and 38 participants in focus-group of Palestinian women living in East Jerusalem. It examines their public transport and private car use, in light of physical and psychological barriers. Interviews find that cultural and social pressures and the sense of exclusion and fear pose significant limitations to public transport use and destination choice, alongside poor infrastructure, low service levels and discriminatory planning policies. Many women internalize expectations of violence and exclusionary linguistic and visual cues, which serve as fear-based barriers for public transport use. Women's responses fall into a number of categories: avoiding West Jerusalem and minimizing travel; adopting private cars as safer and more practical or, at times, accepting and barrelling through fears. Policy implications include both immediate changes to symbology and behaviour of transport personnel, and long term implications about consciously-inclusive route and infrastructure planning.

AB  - Objectives To document the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and to assess resolution of these abnormalities following corticosteroid therapy. Materials and Methods Steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis was diagnosed based on signalment, physical examination findings, complete blood count, biochemistry and CSF analysis. Echocardiography, C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I were measured in all cases before and 10 to 14 days after commencing corticosteroid therapy. Fibrinogen was also measured in a proportion of dogs. Results Fourteen dogs were prospectively enrolled. Increased cardiac troponin I was identified in five of 14 dogs and echocardiographic abnormalities were detected in 12 of 14 dogs, including spontaneous echo contrast (12 of 14), mild pericardial effusion (five of 14) and mildly decreased fractional shortening (five of 14). All dogs had increased C-reactive protein and fibrinogen was increased in 11 of 12. Corticosteroid treatment was associated with clinical improvement and normalisation of C-reactive protein in all dogs. The cardiac troponin I levels normalised in four of five and fibrinogen had normalised in all five dogs which were retested. Spontaneous echo contrast improved or completely resolved in 12 of 12 and pericardial effusion resolved in five of five dogs. Fractional shortening normalised in two of five dogs. Clinical Significance Cardiac changes are common in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and most resolve with therapy. Further investigation into the cause and significance of these changes is necessary in determining whether antithrombotic therapy or positive inotropic therapy is indicated.

AB  - Abstract A major challenge for fostering integrative cross-disciplinary collaborations at the graduate level arises from the divergent exposure and training of students from uni-disciplinary graduate programs. In this report, we present the design and preliminary analysis of an experimental forum to facilitate cross-disciplinary discourse within a NSF-sponsored Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program (IGERT) at Rutgers. This forum brings together IGERT Graduate Training Fellows and faculty from four diverse graduate programs in the engineering area and four related programs in life sciences and physical sciences for structured seminars and interchanges. Our report offers methodological and analytical tools grounded within a conceptual framework for promoting discourse that integrates content across diverse disciplines as well as across levels of inquiry. Both the theoretical framework and the research tools may be valuable to others seeking to develop integrative training environments for coalescing learning communities between engineers and their collaborators.

AB  - Objective To report the surgical technique and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for removal of unilateral noninvasive pheochromocytoma. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with unilateral noninvasive adrenal tumors (n=10). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for histologically confirmed pheochromocytoma were reviewed. Dogs were positioned in lateral recumbency with the table tilted up to create a semi-sternal position. Three or 4 ports were used and dissection of the mass proceeded using a combination of laparoscopic instrumentation, bipolar vessel-sealing devices, and in some cases monopolar electrosurgical probes. Conversion rate, complications, surgical time, hospitalization time, and long-term follow-up were recorded. Results The procedure was completed without the need for conversion in 9 of 10 dogs. In 1 dog, hemorrhage obscured the visual field and conversion to an open approach was elected. In 5 cases, a 3-port approach was used, and in 5 cases, a 4th port was placed. Median surgical time was 105 minutes (range, 65?250). Intraoperative complications included 1 splenic laceration. Postoperatively, 1 dog developed gastric dilatation-volvulus. All dogs were discharged from the hospital. Median follow-up time was 16.0 months (range, 6.9?38.0). Conclusion With careful case selection, laparoscopic adrenalectomy for resection of pheochromocytoma was feasible and could be performed efficiently by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.

AB  - Machine perfusion (MP) has been used as the kidney preservation method in our center for over 10 years. The first, small (n = 74) prospective, single-blinded randomized study comparing MP and Cold Storage (CS) showed that the incidence of delayed graft function was higher after CS. There have been no reports in the literature on the effect of storage modality on long-term function of renal allografts. This paper presents an analysis of long-term results of renal transplantation in 415 patients operated on between 1994 and 1999. Of those, 227 kidneys were MP-stored prior to KTx. The control group consisted of 188 CS kidney transplants. Kidneys were not randomized to MP or to CS. Donor demographics, medical and biochemical data, cold ischemia time, HLA match and recipient data were collected. Standard triple-drug immunosuppression was administered to both groups. Mortality, graft survival and incidence of return to hemodialysis treatment were analyzed. Despite longer cold ischemia time and poorer donor hemodynamics in MP group, 5-year Kaplan-Meier graft survival was better in MP-stored than in CS-stored kidneys (68.2% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: In this nonrandomized analysis, kidney storage by MP improved graft survival and reduced the number of patients who returned to dialysis.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, aggressive, soft-tissue infection that results in necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. It spreads rapidly and may progress to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death. Predisposing conditions include diabetes, chronic alcoholism, advanced age, vascular disease, and immunosuppression and many cases are preceded by an injury or invasive procedure. Necrotizing soft-tissue infection of the breast is uncommon, with only a few reported cases in the literature. We present a 53-year-old diabetic woman who presented to the emergency room with several weeks of worsening breast and shoulder pain, swelling, and erythema. Upon formal evaluation by the surgical service, a necrotizing soft-tissue infection was suspected, and the patient was scheduled for emergent, surgical debridement. Because of the aggressive nature and high mortality of this disease, immediate surgical intervention, coupled with antibiotic therapy and physiologic support, is necessary to prevent complications and death.

AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for expressing the genes encoding the ionotropic N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits from rats (NR1a, NR2A, NR2C) and mice (NR2B). Four plasmids were constructed by cloning the different NMDA receptor genes in the two multi-copy yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors pMB01 (?NR1a gene) and pMB02 (?NR2A-2C genes). The protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain cI3-ABYS-86 (leu?, ura?) was transformed or co-transformed with the resulting plasmids pMBNR1a (leu+) or pMBNR1a/pMBNR2A?C (ura+) respectively. Western blotting analysis with antibodies raised against amino acid sequences at the C-termini of the respective subunits revealed that the recombinant receptor proteins were differently expressed and only partially glycosylated in the cell membranes of the recombinant yeast strains. The expression and localization of the recombinant NMDA receptor proteins were also proved by immunofluorescence microscopy which indicated a distinct expression of the different NMDA receptor subunits in the plasma membrane of the transformed yeast cells. Pharmacological characterization of crude membrane preparations of the recombinant yeast cells showed saturable binding of the glycine antagonist [3H]MDL105,519 with Kd values of 56.9?Â±?6.19?nM (NR1a/NR2A), 26.72?Â±?2.13?nM (NR1a/NR2B), and 21.22?Â±?1.64?nM (NR1a/NR2C), and bound capacities of 17.94?Â±?1.24?pmol/mg membrane protein (NR1a/NR2A), 11.45?Â±?0.67?pmol/mg (NR1a/NR2B), and 16.15?Â±?0.86 (NR1a/NR2C) pmol/mg. The [3H]MDL105,519 binding was inhibited by the glycine antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenate, ethyl-2-carboxy-4,6-dichloro-3-indoleacetate, and itself, but not by glycine, D-serine or 1-amino-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. Specific binding of [3H]glycine or the NMDA channel blocker [3H]dizolcipine were not observed.

AB  - Abstract Studies on human patients and animal models of disease have shown that disruptions in prenatal and early postnatal brain development are a root cause of mental retardation. Since proper brain development is achieved by a strict spatiotemporal control of neurogenesis, cell migration, and patterning of synapses, abnormalities in one or more of these events during prenatal development can lead to cognitive dysfunction after birth. Many of underlying causes of mental retardation must therefore be studied in developing brains. To aid in this research, live imaging using laser scanning microscopy (LSM) has recently allowed neuroscientists to delve deeply into the complex three-dimensional environment of the living brain to record dynamic cellular events over time. This review will highlight recent examples of how LSM is being applied to elucidate both normal and abnormal cortical development. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MRDD Research Reviews 2005;11:303?316.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and lymphotoxin-Î±, have been described widely to play important roles in the brain in physiologic conditions and after traumatic injury. However, the exact mechanisms involved in their function have not been fully elucidated. We give some insight on their role by using animals lacking either Type 1 receptor (TNFR1KO) or Type 2 (TNFR2KO) and their controls (C57Bl/6). Both TNFR1KO and to a greater extent TNFR2KO mice showed increased exploration/activity neurobehavioral traits in the hole board test, such as rearings, head dippings, and ambulations, compared with wild-type mice, suggesting an inhibitory role of TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the elevated plus maze test, ruling out a major role of these receptors in the control of anxiety. We next evaluated the response to a freeze injury to the somatosensorial cortex. The effect of the cryolesion on motor function was evaluated with the horizontal ladder beam test, and the results showed that both TNFR1KO and TNFR2KO mice made fewer errors, suggesting a detrimental role for TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling for coping with brain damage. Expression of ?22600 genes was analyzed using an Affymetrix chip (MOE430A) at 0 (unlesioned), 1, or 4 days post-lesion in the three strains. The results show a unique and major role of both TNF receptors on the pattern of gene expression elicited by the injury but also in normal conditions, and suggest that blocking of TNFR1/TNFR2 receptors may be beneficial after a traumatic brain injury. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?The autosomally-inherited factor VII (FVII) deficiency and X-linked hemophilia B offer an attractive model to investigate whether reduced levels of FVII and FIX, acting in the initiation and amplification of coagulation respectively, influence hemostasis to a different extent in relation to age and bleeding site. Methods:?Hemophilia B patients (n?=?296) and FVII-deficient males (n?=?109) were compared for FVII/FIX clotting activity, F7/F9 genotypes and clinical phenotypes in a retrospective, multi-centre, cohort study. Results:?Major clinical differences between diseases were observed. Bleeding occurred earlier in hemophilia B (median age 2.0?years, IR 0.9?5.0) than in FVII deficiency (5.2?years, IR 1.9?15.5) and the bleeding-free survival in FVII deficiency was similar to that observed in ?mild? hemophilia B (P?=?0.96). The most frequent disease-presenting symptoms in hemophilia B (hematomas and oral bleeding) differed from those in FVII deficiency (epistaxis and central nervous system bleeding). Differences were confirmed by analysis of FVII-deficient women. Conclusions:?Our data support the notion that low FVII levels sustain hemostasis better than similarly reduced FIX levels. On the other hand, minute amounts of FVII, differently to FIX, are needed to prevent fatal bleeding, as indicated by the rarity of null mutations and the associated life-threatening symptoms in FVII deficiency, which contributes towards shaping clinical differences between diseases in the lowest factor level range. Differences between diseases are only partially explained by mutational patterns and could pertain to the specific roles of FVII and FIX in coagulation phases and to vascular bed-specific components.

AB  - Abstract Semen analysis is a basic step in the investigation of several disturbances affecting the male genital tract. Analysis of seminal parameters provides important clinical information on the spermatogenesis and functional competence of spermatozoa, as well as on the secretory pattern of the accessory genital glands. Semen analysis is particularly useful in the evaluation of couples requiring fertility investigation (to detect genital infections and pathologies) and in verifying the influence of environmental factors, drugs, lifestyle, chemical products, and professional activities on several diseases affecting male reproductive health. Measure of semen quality is of substantial interest for diagnoses in clinical urology, andrology, and gynecology. Currently, basic requirements for semen analysis are standardized by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that describe several procedures for an objective evaluation of the semen quality with diagnostic purposes. These guidelines include: parameters for the physical and biochemical evaluation of semen; parameters for the analysis of sperm characteristics; and other seminal parameters that can be easily adopted in any laboratory. This report summarizes current concepts on semen analysis and the significance of the seminal parameters for reaching a diagnosis based on the procedures recommended by WHO guidelines. J. Clin. Lab.

AB  - Aim To determine whether the placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube (PPFT) can be taught safely and effectively to a critical care dietitian. Methods This is a prospective observational study conducted in an adult intensive care unit (ICU). The intervention consisted of 19 attempts at post-pyloric intubation by the dietitian. The 10 ?learning? attempts were performed by the dietitian under the direction of an experienced (having completed in excess of 50 successful tube placements) user. A subsequent nine ?consolidation? attempts were performed under the responsibility of the intensive care consultant on duty. The primary outcome measures were success (i.e. tip of the PPFT being visible in or distal to the duodenum on X-ray) and time (minutes) to PPFT placement. Patients were observed for adverse events per standard clinical practice. Results A total of 19 post-pyloric tube placements were attempted in 18 patients (52 (23?70) years, ICU admission diagnoses: trauma n = 4; respiratory failure n = 3; and burns, pancreatitis and renal failure n = 2 each). No adverse events occurred. Most (75%) patients were sedated, and mechanically ventilated. Prokinetics were used to assist tube placement in 11% (2/19) of attempts, both of which were successful. Placement of PPFT was successful in 58% (11/19) of attempts. Whilst training, the success rate was 40% (4/10) compared with 78% (7/9) once training was consolidated (P = 0.17). In the successful attempts, the mean time to placement was 11.0 minutes (3.9?27.1 minutes). Conclusions A dietitian can be trained to safely and successfully place PPFT in critically ill patients.
