AB  - Abstract Semen analysis is a basic step in the investigation of several disturbances affecting the male genital tract. Analysis of seminal parameters provides important clinical information on the spermatogenesis and functional competence of spermatozoa, as well as on the secretory pattern of the accessory genital glands. Semen analysis is particularly useful in the evaluation of couples requiring fertility investigation (to detect genital infections and pathologies) and in verifying the influence of environmental factors, drugs, lifestyle, chemical products, and professional activities on several diseases affecting male reproductive health. Measure of semen quality is of substantial interest for diagnoses in clinical urology, andrology, and gynecology. Currently, basic requirements for semen analysis are standardized by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that describe several procedures for an objective evaluation of the semen quality with diagnostic purposes. These guidelines include: parameters for the physical and biochemical evaluation of semen; parameters for the analysis of sperm characteristics; and other seminal parameters that can be easily adopted in any laboratory. This report summarizes current concepts on semen analysis and the significance of the seminal parameters for reaching a diagnosis based on the procedures recommended by WHO guidelines. J. Clin. Lab.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate initial tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO2) in dogs presenting to an emergency room (ER) for acute hemorrhage. Design Prospective, observational study. Setting University veterinary teaching hospital. Animals Thirty-eight dogs with acute hemorrhage were enrolled between July 2009 and October 2010. Seventy-eight normal dogs from a previous observational study were included to represent healthy controls (?no shock?). Interventions Tissue oxygen saturation measurement was obtained at enrollment on dogs presented to the ER for acute hemorrhage. Baseline clinicopathologic (CBC, serum biochemical profile, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time) and physiologic (plasma lactate concentration, venous blood gas, blood pressure, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry) data were recorded from all patients with hemorrhage. An ER clinician blinded to the StO2 value guided patient management. Patient survival to discharge from the hospital in the study group was recorded. Once data collection was complete, 3 emergency and critical care clinicians blinded to the StO2 data retrospectively classified patients into 1 of 4 shock categories (no shock, mild, moderate, or severe shock). Measurements and Main Results The historical group of healthy dogs had higher StO2 concentrations compared to the dogs classified with shock at all 3 levels (mild, moderate, and severe, P = 0.0006, <0.0001, and 0.0018, respectively); however, there was no statistical difference in StO2 between the levels of shock. A cut-off StO2 value of 87.6% identified a patient as having shock (area under the curve: 0.824, 95% confidence interval 0.749, 0.899). Conclusions Dogs with hemorrhagic shock have lower StO2 than a population of healthy dogs.

AB  - Summary Pancreatitis can be either acute or chronic in nature. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis, which typically presents with epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, include gallstones and alcohol. The diagnosis is established by typical symptoms, biochemical evidence of pancreatic injury, and imaging studies. The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, which presents with chronic abdominal pain, is chronic alcohol use. The diagnosis is established by typical symptoms, imaging studies, and evidence of endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Treatment of acute pancreatitis includes analgesia, aggressive IV hydration, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in some instances of gallstone pancreatitis. Rarely, acute pancreatitis progresses to necrotizing pancreatitis. Management of chronic pancreatitis includes analgesia, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, and management of malnutrition and diabetes, if present. Finally, autoimmune pancreatitis, typically associated with IgG4 antibodies, responds to treatment with immunosuppression such as prednisone.

AB  - Abstract Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are endogenous bioactive lipids that participate in the regulation of mammalian cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis. These processes are each critical for successful embryogenesis, raising the possibility that lysophospholipid signaling may contribute to normal animal development. In fact, recent studies in developmental model systems have established that S1P and LPA are necessary for diverse developmental programs including those required for morphogenesis of vertebrate reproductive, cardiovascular and central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), as well as the establishment of maternal-fetal circulation and the immune system. Genetic, morphological, and biochemical characterization of developmental model systems offer powerful approaches to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of lysophospholipid signaling and its contributions to animal development and postnatal physiology. In this review, the routes of S1P and LPA metabolism and our current understanding of lysophospholipid-mediated signal transduction in mammalian cells will be summarized. The evidence implicating lysophospholipid signaling in the development of specific vertebrate systems will then be reviewed, with an emphasis on signals mediated through G protein-coupled receptors of the Edg family. Lastly, recent insights derived from the study of simple metazoan models and implications regarding lysophospholipid signaling in organisms in which Edg receptors are not conserved will be explored. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Glutaric aciduria type I (synonym, glutaric acidemia type I) is a rare organic aciduria. Untreated patients characteristically develop dystonia during infancy resulting in a high morbidity and mortality. The neuropathological correlate is striatal injury which results from encephalopathic crises precipitated by infectious diseases, immunizations and surgery during a finite period of brain development, or develops insidiously without clinically apparent crises. Glutaric aciduria type I is caused by inherited deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase which is involved in the catabolic pathways of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine and L-tryptophan. This defect gives rise to elevated glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid, and glutarylcarnitine which can be detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (organic acids) or tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitines). Glutaric aciduria type I is included in the panel of diseases that are identified by expanded newborn screening in some countries. It has been shown that in the majority of neonatally diagnosed patients striatal injury can be prevented by combined metabolic treatment. Metabolic treatment that includes a low lysine diet, carnitine supplementation and intensified emergency treatment during acute episodes of intercurrent illness should be introduced and monitored by an experienced interdisciplinary team. However, initiation of treatment after the onset of symptoms is generally not effective in preventing permanent damage. Secondary dystonia is often difficult to treat, and the efficacy of available drugs cannot be predicted precisely in individual patients. The major aim of this revision is to re-evaluate the previous diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients with this disease and incorporate new research findings into the guideline.

AB  - Abstract Objective Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses unstable angina (UA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). In 2007?2008 in Australia, there were 95?000 hospitalisations for ACS. There is limited data about the level of agreement between the ED and hospital discharge diagnosis. The objective of the present study is to describe the proportion of ED patients with a concordant ACS hospital discharge diagnosis and determine factors associated with this. Methods The present study was a retrospective case series of consecutive presentations of patients with ACS to the EDs of Southern Health, Victoria, Australia, during a 6 month period between August 2011 and January 2012. Results One thousand and twenty-eight patients diagnosed with ACS in the ED were identified. Hospital discharge diagnosis was recorded for 704 cases. The mean age was 63 years (SD 14.5) and 69% were male. One hundred and nineteen patients (16.9%) were diagnosed with a STEMI, 322 (45.7%) with a NSTEMI and 263 (37.4%) with UA. There were 68.3% who had a concordant discharge diagnosis of ACS. An ED diagnosis of STEMI (87.4), English as the primary language (OR 1.81 [1.13?2.89]) and chest pain as the presenting complaint (OR 2.70 [1.72?4.23]) were associated with a concordant diagnosis of ACS. Conclusion Almost one-third of patients who are admitted to the hospital with ACS have a different hospital discharge diagnosis. English as a primary language and presenting with chest pain are associated with a more concordant diagnosis. More research needs to be performed to better understand these findings.

AB  - Abstract The present study examined the relationship between military service during the Vietnam era and chronic stress among Vietnam combat veterans, noncombat military controls, and nonmilitary age-mates. Psychological, behavioral, and biochemical indices of stress were assessed. Results demonstrated that exposure to combat was not associated with symptoms of chronic stress. However, reported intrusiveness of recalled imagery associated with stressful combat events was an important predictor of long-term symptoms of stress irrespective of combat exposure. In addition, the interaction of combat exposure and intrusive thinking was significantly related to symptoms of chronic stress. These data suggest that intrusive thinking may reflect an important individual difference variable that could help predict long-term responding to stressors.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Intensive or extensive culture of aquatic animals requires chemicals that control disease, enhance the growth of cultured species, reduce handling trauma to organisms, improve water quality, disinfect water, and control aquatic vegetation, predaceous insects, or other nuisance organisms. The aquaculture chemical needs for various species have been described for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Atlantic and Pacific salmon, Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus sp.; channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus; striped bass, Morone saxatilis; milkfish, Chanos chanos; mollusks; penaeid shrimp; and a variety of other freshwater and marine species. Laws and regulations on the use of chemicals in aquaculture vary by country. Regulations and therapeutants or other chemicals that are approved or allowed for use in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Chile, and Australia are presented herein. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate the application of chemicals to organisms or to their environments. FDA controls the use of drugs and anesthetics, and EPA controls the application of chemicals and pesticides to the environment. Each agency develops appropriate guidelines and policies to implement the laws for its field of responsibility. Few therapeutants are registered in the United States for use on any cultured aquatic species. In the most critical area of antibacterials, only two (Terramycin for Fish and Romet-30) are approved and available. Formalin (Formalin-F, Parasite-S, Paracide-F) is the only registered fungicide and Paracide-F is the only formalin product currently labeled for use on eggs of all fish at 1000?2000 mg/L for 15 min. Formalin (Formalin-F, Parasite-S, Paracide-F) is the only parasiticide currently approved and available. Paracide-F is the only formalin product currently approved for use on all fish. Povidone-iodine compounds can be used to disinfect the surface of fish eggs because FDA has classified them as low regulatory priority substances. Water treatment compounds (potassium permanganate, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, tris buffer, and sodium sulfite), anesthetics (tricaine, carbon dioxide gas, and sodium bicarbonate), herbicides (copper sulfate, chelated copper compounds, and diquat dibromide) and piscicides (antimycin and rotenone) are also registered and regulated. The control of aquaculture drugs varies according to country from no regulation to restrictive regulations. Generally, few requirements are needed for a therapeutant to be licensed or registered in Africa, and most of Asia and South America. Except for environmental studies, requirements for registration data in Canada are similar to requirements in the United States. However, Canada has significantly different regulations and approval processes. Canadian aquaculturalists use drugs that are either licensed for other food animals and prescribed by veterinarians or used in an emergency under the direction of the Canadian Bureau of Veterinary Drugs (BVD). Chemicals authorized for use in aquaculture in Canada include oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim (Romet-30, Romet-B), and others. Chemicals authorized for use in aquaculture in certain European countries include ampicillin, chlortetracycline, and others. In Japan, registration of drugs for aquatic species requires the same data as those required for drugs on other animals. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Fisheries and the Ministry of Welfare control the use of chemicals and aquaculture in Japan. As of April 2001, more chemicals were registered for aquacultural use in Japan than in any other country. They include amoxicillin, ampicillin, florfenicol, tetracycline, thiamphenicol, eugenol, and hydrogen peroxide. More therapeutants and vaccines may soon be added to the medicine chest of fish farmers. Research has been conducted on important antibacterial compounds in the United States and the U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center is working on several fronts to improve the availability of anesthetics, fungicides and parasiticides.

AB  - Abstract Chronic diabetic complications ? both microvascular and macrovascular ? have become serious health issues with their increasing prevalence paralleling the dramatic rise of the diabetic population worldwide. Of these complications, foot disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, consuming more health care resource than all other complications combined. Diabetic polyneuropathy and peripheral vascular disease constitute the two main risk factors, with trauma and foot infection being the most important initiating factors and contributors to delayed healing. Intracellular oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycaemia along with hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking constitute the main pathological processes in the aetiology of both macrovascular and microvascular disease. Whilst the former remains the major cause of overall mortality in diabetes, the role of microangiopathy in the pathogenesis of diabetes foot disease and its contribution to delayed wound healing in diabetes has yet to be fully understood and indeed continues to be debated. This article will review the key findings to date on structural and functional microvascular abnormalities in the diabetic foot skin and consider their contribution to impaired would healing.

AB  - Abstract Background Stress during pregnancy is known to affect fetal neurodevelopment. It seems likely therefore that intimate partner violence (IPV) and domestic violence (DV) as extreme stressors will have a similarly adverse effect. Objectives A systematic review was conducted to assess the association between prenatal exposure to violence for mothers and developmental difficulties in their children. Data sources PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ERIC, Science Direct, SCOPUS, PsyARTICLES, Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Women's Studies International and Gender Studies Database were all searched using the agreed search terms. Study selection and data extraction We include studies of women who have experienced any violence, fear of violence or aggression while pregnant, including emotional, psychological, physical or sexual violence in the context of IPV or DV. Studies were excluded if the neurodevelopmental outcomes of the offspring were not assessed. Studies from all countries were included, in English or translated to English, and search dates were not restricted. We included all years from inception of the database until the search date. Synthesis Study design and biases, assessment tools, management of confounding, results and overall quality were assessed. Results We identified 11 papers reporting on observational studies. Almost three quarters of the studies found a relationship between prenatal exposure to violence and developmental difficulties in the offspring. Differing assessment tools were used with a range of data collected and not all adjusted their findings for the same confounders. Conclusions Current evidence on the relationship between prenatal violence exposure, as IPV or DV, and consequent child developmental disorders remains limited. Future research using comprehensive study designs, larger samples and longitudinal follow-up of the offspring could clarify this association. While maternal trauma resulting from exposure to violence may play an important role in childhood development disorders, additional intervening factors on the pathway need further explored.

AB  - Abstract Vitiligo is characterized by progressive loss of skin pigmentation. The search for aetiologic factors has led to the biochemical, the neurologic and the autoimmune theory. The convergence theory was then proposed several years ago to incorporate existing theories of vitiligo development into a single overview of vitiligo aetiology. The viewpoint that vitiligo is not caused only by predisposing mutations, or only by melanocytes responding to chemical/radiation exposure, or only by hyperreactive T cells, but rather results from a combination of aetiologic factors that impact melanocyte viability, has certainly stood the test of time. New findings have since informed the description of progressive depigmentation. Understanding the relative importance of such aetiologic factors combined with a careful selection of the most targetable pathways will continue to drive the next phase in vitiligo research: the development of effective therapeutics. In that arena, it is likewise important to acknowledge that pathways affected in some patients may not be altered in others. Taken together, the convergence theory continues to provide a comprehensive viewpoint of vitiligo aetiology. The theory serves to intertwine aetiologic pathways and will help to define pathways amenable to disease intervention in individual patients.

AB  - Summary The family Russulaceae is considered an iconic lineage of mostly mushroom-forming basidiomycetes due to their importance as edible mushrooms in many parts of the world, and their ubiquity as ectomycorrhizal symbionts in both temperate and tropical forested biomes. Although much research has been focused on this group, a comprehensive or cohesive synthesis by which to understand the functional diversity of the group has yet to develop. Interest in ectomycorrhizal fungi, of which Russulaceae is a key lineage, is prodigious due to the important roles they play as plant root mutualists in ecosystem functioning, global carbon sequestration, and a potential role in technology development toward environmental sustainability. As one of the most species-diverse ectomycorrhizal lineages, the Russulaceae has recently been the focus of a dense sampling and genome sequencing initiative with the Joint Genome Institute aimed at untangling their functional roles and testing whether functional niche specialization exists for independent lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Here we present a review of important studies on this group to contextualize what we know about its members' evolutionary history and ecosystem functions, as well as to generate hypotheses establishing the Russulaceae as a valuable experimental system.

Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Diffuse cerebellar meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to haematogenous dissemination from an anaplastic solid mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in an old German shepherd dog suffering from seizures and rapidly progressing to stupor. A single computed tomography cerebellar scan identified an unusual homogeneous density area that was considered to be associated with a vascular disorder, in the absence of space-occupying lesions. At necropsy, nodular masses were observed in the mammary gland, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were affected by diffuse blood effusion. Histology showed a solid mammary tumour, characterised by anaplastic cells with a cytoplasmic keratin-positive and vimentin-negative immunoreaction. The tumour had spread to the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were diffusely infiltrated by the cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells. Even though computed tomography scan gave no evidence of meningeal carcinomatosis, it was considered that a cerebellar vascular disorder might be present. This was subsequently confirmed by neuropathological investigation and seen to be associated with a cerebellar leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.
