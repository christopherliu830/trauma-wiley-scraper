AB  - Diffuse cerebellar meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to haematogenous dissemination from an anaplastic solid mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in an old German shepherd dog suffering from seizures and rapidly progressing to stupor. A single computed tomography cerebellar scan identified an unusual homogeneous density area that was considered to be associated with a vascular disorder, in the absence of space-occupying lesions. At necropsy, nodular masses were observed in the mammary gland, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were affected by diffuse blood effusion. Histology showed a solid mammary tumour, characterised by anaplastic cells with a cytoplasmic keratin-positive and vimentin-negative immunoreaction. The tumour had spread to the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were diffusely infiltrated by the cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells. Even though computed tomography scan gave no evidence of meningeal carcinomatosis, it was considered that a cerebellar vascular disorder might be present. This was subsequently confirmed by neuropathological investigation and seen to be associated with a cerebellar leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to examine temporal variations in synovial fluid composition and lubrication following articular fracture. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) was induced by creating an osteochondral fracture in the middle carpal joint of four horses while the contralateral limb served as a sham-operated control. Horses were exercised on a high-speed treadmill, and synovial fluid was collected pre-operatively and at serial timepoints until 75 days post-operatively. Lubricin and hyaluronic acid (HA) concentrations were measured using sandwich ELISAs, and the molecular weight distribution of HA was analyzed via gel electrophoresis. Synovial fluid viscosity and cartilage friction coefficients across all modes of lubrication were measured on days 0, 19, 33, and 61 using a commercial rheometer and a custom tribometer, respectively. HA concentrations were significantly decreased post-operatively, and high molecular weight HA (>6.1MDa) did not recover to pre-operative values by the study termination at day 75. Lubricin concentrations increased after surgery to a greater extent in the OA as compared to sham-operated limbs. Viscosity was significantly reduced after surgery. While boundary and elastoviscous mode friction coefficients did not vary, the transition number, representing the shift between these modes, was lower. Although more pronounced in the OA limbs, similar derangements in HA, HA molecular weight distribution, viscosity, and transition number were observed in the sham-operated limbs, which may be explained by synovial fluid washout during arthroscopy. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

His EDS diagnosis had been confirmed biochemically and genetically. Vascular complications are known to be associated with the vascular type of EDS, but this is the first report of a child with classical EDS who developed a major vascular complication. Clinicians should be aware that severe vascular complications albeit rare, can also occur in classical EDS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The records of six dogs in which a diagnosis of symmetrical lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO) had been made were examined retrospectively. The age at onset ranged from six months to eight years. All the dogs had been presented with onycholysis, onychomadesis, onychalgia and onychodystrophy. The diagnosis of SLO was confirmed in all cases by histological examination. Histological features were similar in all cases and included hydropic degeneration of the basal cell layer, pigmentary incontinence and a cell-rich Interface dermatitis. Response (defined as good, partial or failure) to various therapies was compared. Treatments (as initial therapy or following previous treatment failure) included essential fatty acids (EFA) (three cases), a combination of tetracycline and nicotinamide (four cases) and azathioprine and/or prednisolone (one case each). EFA therapy resulted in one good response, one partial and one failure, tetracycline and nicotinamide in two good responses, one partial and one failure, and azathioprine and/or prednisolone In one good and one partial response. Although all treatments were successful in some cases, none was universally effective.

AB  - Abstract Brain organoids are self-assembled, three-dimensionally structured tissues that are typically derived from pluripotent stem cells. They are multicellular aggregates that more accurately recapitulate the tissue microenvironment compared to the other cell culture systems and can also reproduce organ function. They are promising models for evaluating drug leads, particularly those that target neurodegeneration, since they are genetically and phenotypically stable over prolonged durations of culturing and they reasonably reproduce critical physiological phenomena such as biochemical gradients and responses by the native tissue to stimuli. Beyond drug discovery, the use of brain organoids could also be extended to investigating early brain development and identifying the mechanisms that elicit neurodegeneration. Herein, the current state of the fabrication and use of brain organoids in drug development and medical research is summarized. Although the use of brain organoids represents a quantum leap over existing investigational tools used by the pharmaceutical industry, they are nonetheless imperfect systems that could be greatly improved through bioengineering. To this end, some key scientific challenges that would need to be addressed in order to enhance the relevance of brain organoids as model tissue are listed. Potential solutions to these challenges, including the use of bioprinting, are highlighted thereafter.

AB  - Summary This prospective study was designed to evaluate whether early changes in actin-free Gc-globulin levels were associated with complications and outcomes and to identify factors associated with persistent low actin-free Gc-globulin levels in acute liver failure (ALF). Thirty-two consecutive ALF patients admitted from October 2011 to December 2012 were followed up until death or complete recovery. All had serum actin-free Gc-globulin estimation at admission and at day three or expiry. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed. Nonsurvivors had significantly lower median actin-free Gc-globulin levels than survivors (87.32 vs 180 mg/L; P < 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.771 and showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin level of ≤124 mg/L would predict mortality with 92% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Patients with lower serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels and decreasing trend in serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels were found to have more mortality and developed more complications. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin, total leucocyte count and serum creatinine at admission were independent predictors of mortality. Incorporating these variables, a score predicting mortality risk at admission was derived. The scoring system was compared to MELD score and King's College Criteria as individual predictor of mortality. Serum actin-free Gc-globulin level at presentation is predictive of outcome and can be used for risk stratification. Its persistent low-level predicts mortality and is correlated with various complications.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering (TE) is a multidisciplinary field that aims at the in vitro engineering of tissues and organs by integrating science and technology of cells, materials and biochemical factors. Mimicking the natural extracellular matrix is one of the critical and challenging technological barriers, for which scaffold engineering has become a prime focus of research within the field of TE. Amongst the variety of materials tested, silk fibroin (SF) is increasingly being recognized as a promising material for scaffold fabrication. Ease of processing, excellent biocompatibility, remarkable mechanical properties and tailorable degradability of SF has been explored for fabrication of various articles such as films, porous matrices, hydrogels, nonwoven mats, etc., and has been investigated for use in various TE applications, including bone, tendon, ligament, cartilage, skin, liver, trachea, nerve, cornea, eardrum, dental, bladder, etc. The current review extensively covers the progress made in the SF-based in vitro engineering and regeneration of various human tissues and identifies opportunities for further development of this field.

AB  - Summary Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

AB  - Abstract The assumption that anesthesia has no serious, long-term, adverse central nervous system consequences may be true for most patients between 6 months and 60 years of age. However, for patients younger than 6 months or older than 60 years, that status quo assumption is under challenge from a growing body of evidence. Fetuses and newborns appear to be at risk because systems that would enable them to fully recover from the effects of more than 2 hours of anesthesia are still in development. In distinction, the elderly appear to be at risk because systems that once enabled them to fully recover have ever-diminishing capacity. Even for those between the age of 6 months and 60 years, full recovery may require replacing apoptosed neurons and pruning overabundant dendritic spines ? perhaps leaving patients not quite the same person that they were before they were anesthetized.

AB  - Objective? To determine the clinical value of a novel osteoarthritis (OA) biomarker in detecting canine cruciate disease. Study Design? Cross sectional clinical study. Animals? Dogs (n=22) with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture and 12 control dogs. Methods? Concentrations of collagenase-generated cleavage epitope of type II collagen (Col2-3/4Clong mono, or C2C) in serum, urine, and joint fluid were compared between a group of dogs with CCL rupture and a control group. Correlation of C2C concentrations to the clinical stage of stifle OA was also evaluated. Results? There were no significant differences in C2C concentrations in serum, urine, and joint fluid between groups (P>.05). Subjective scores of lameness, joint effusion, osteophytosis were significantly more severe in the CCL rupture group compared with the control group (P<.05). There was no significant correlation of C2C concentrations with clinical stage of stifle OA (P>.05). Conclusion? This OA biomarker did not detect pathology associated with CCL rupture. Our results suggest that collagenase-specific degradation of type II collagen in articular cartilage may not be involved in the early stage of naturally occurring canine cruciate disease, and that pathology associated with naturally occurring CCL rupture is different from that of experimental OA model. Clinical Relevance? C2C is not clinically useful in detecting CCL rupture in dogs.

AB  - Summary The respiratory system is complex. Although it consists of upper and lower respiratory tracts, the former is the focus of this chapter. The primary function of the upper respiratory tract is to conduct air from the external environment into the lower airway. This process begins at the external nose. Air moves through the nares and into paired nasal cavities. Air is cleansed, warmed, and humidified during its passage through the upper respiratory tract. A small amount of serous nasal discharge can be considered normal in the companion animal patient. However, copious amounts of serous nasal discharge may be indicative of pathology. Nasal discharge is a common complaint in companion animal practice. Its presentation is immensely variable in terms of color, translucency, and consistency, but it is most frequently described by cellular content as being mucoid, mucopurulent, serohemorrhagic, or hemorrhagic. Onset of nasal discharge may be acute, chronic, or recurrent. Nasal discharge may be unilateral or bilateral, or laterality may change with disease progression. It may occur in isolation of systemic signs of disease? or the patient may be systemically ill. Each fact deduced from history taking and every finding on physical examination provides a clue as to the likelihood of the underlying cause. Nasal discharge is particularly frustrating to the veterinary client and clinician alike when it is chronic. In such cases, secondary bacterial infection is common, and although antibiotic therapy may provide transient resolution of clinical signs, recurrence is likely without having identified or addressed the primary issue. A definitive diagnosis requires a multifaceted approach. Signalment, case history, and physical examination findings collectively assist with disease localization and prioritization of differential diagnoses. However, ancillary diagnostic tests are invaluable. A combination of cytology, histopathology, bacteriology, mycology, and imaging studies may be necessary to rule out infectious, inflammatory, and/or neoplastic disease. Idiopathic rhinitis and sinorhinitis are relatively common among companion animal patients. Nasal disease may also be congenital, genetic, or iatrogenic in origin.

AB  - The care of 40 patients with primary liver cancer with obstructive jaundice treated with liver puncture bile drainage or biliary stent implantation was reported. Treated with the interventional therapy, patients were observed closely to identify symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy and pain; diet care was well performed. Bile drainage tube and skin acre were performed carefully. Liver function, bilirubin and other biochemical indicators were monitored; occurrence of bleeding, acute pancreatitis, biliary tract infection, leakage of ascites around drainage tube and other complication were observed with good discharge instruction. After this operation, three rounds of liver had poor function, and hepatic encephalopathy and death occurred during hospitalisation. Seven patients had bloody bile drainage fluid after operation; eight had increased blood amylase; nine had biliary infection and four had leakage of ascites around the drainage tube. After positive treatment and care, the situation was improved with varied degrees of jaundice increase.

AB  - Introduction:? Electric fields of the magnitude likely to occur in electrical injury can result in skeletal muscle electroporation. It has been reported that Poloxamer 188 (P188) is able to seal damaged cell membranes. Using a previously described rat hind limb model of electrical injury, in this study we employ MRI to demonstrate that intravenously administered P188 arrests muscle tissue edema caused by electrical shock. Methods:? Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat hindlimbs were subjected to 12 electrical shock pulses of 2?kV and ?2A amplitude with duration of 4?ms. There was a 10-second separation period between shocks to allow thermal relaxation. Animals received either P188 or Lactated Ringer?s Injection (control) intravenously at 60 minutes after shock. Proton MRI were recorded using a 4.7-Tesla Bruker scanner (200?MHz). A Multi-Slice Multi-Echo (MSME) spin echo sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted images. Ten slices over the entire midthigh region were taken. For each slice, images from 10 echos in the TE range of 10?ms?100?ms and TR?=?2000?ms were collected. Imaging began at 60 minutes and continued until 3 hours postshock. The signal intensities at different TE times were used to fit an exponential decay and measure the T2 value in each voxel. Voxels with T2 values?>?80?ms were considered injured. Results:? There were noticeable increases of injured area with time for electrically injured limbs due to development of edema. Control-treated rats averaged a 58.0%(±6.59% SD) increase in total area of injury. The total area of injury for P188-treated rats increased by 46.6%(±2.96% SD) In nonelectroporation limbs, no change in T2 occurred. Discussion:? Disruption of the plasma membrane due to electrical current leads to edema. We treated the injured muscles with P188 and observed that it helped to arrest edema. MRI proved effective not only in characterizing the degree of injury resulting from electrical shock but also in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes minimally invasive treatments for thrombosis including a multimodality approach centered on interventional radiology, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs target the clot directly by accelerating fibrinolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, and urokinase have been administered intravenously in cats and dogs with thrombosis with variable success. The chapter also talks about clinical signs, diagnostics, intervention, and long-term therapy of central venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, ischemia?reperfusion injury, and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in dogs and cats. Treatment of venous thrombi must be based upon consideration of the overall clot burden and extent, the resulting clinical signs associated with the venous obstruction, and the ability to control the underlying cause of the clot if it is identified. Echocardiography is an easily accessible modality useful in confirming a thrombus in the proximal pulmonary artery. Angiography, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are also useful modalities in confirming and locating the PTE.

AB  - ABSTRACT Renal amyloidosis was diagnosed in six related English foxhounds from two separate hunting kennels. There was no apparent age or sex predilection. All the dogs had clinical and laboratory findings compatible with renal disease. The onset of clinical signs was acute in all cases with death or euthanasia in five of the six affected dogs occurring within one week of presentation. The remaining dog was treated with diuresis which produced a temporary improvement. Histological examination of renal tissue from affected dogs identified the presence of both glomerular and interstitial amyloid, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining to be of the reactive type (amyloid A). There were occasional sclerosed glomeruli or glomeruli with thickened Bowman's capsules, in addition to interstitial and periglomerular infiltration with a predominance of plasma cells and lymphocytes and secondary changes including tubular eosinophilic casts. Renal papillary necrosis was identified in three dogs. One hound had concurrent multicentric lymphoma. Pedigree analysis of the affected dogs revealed that four individuals shared a common great grandsire and that the same dog was the grand-sire of a further case. Pedigree analysis of five additional dogs from one of the kennels, all of which had clinical signs of acute renal failure but from which renal tissue was not available, revealed a close relationship to those foxhounds with confirmed renal amyloidosis.

AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise throughout the world by patients looking for ?safer? alternatives. However, data on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to CAM are lacking. In a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we retrospectively studied CAM-related health-seeking behavior and attempted to identify those who developed possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF. In this study, we examine the clinical, biochemical, and liver histopathologic characteristics of possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF, describe implicated CAM agents, and discuss predictors of patient outcomes. Out of 1,666 patients with cirrhosis, 68% used CAM at some point. A total of 35.7% (n = 30/84) patients presented with CAM-related DILI leading to ACLF in the whole CAM-DILI-related decompensation cohort. The most common CAM was unlabeled polyherbal Ayurvedic formulations. Of possible patients with ACLF, 63% self-medicated with CAM based on social media sharing. Mean age ± SD was 51.9 ± 9.9 years, 83% were male patients, median follow-up duration was 173 (range, 14-584) days, median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 13 (range, 10-14), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium score was 30.1 ± 4.8, median chronic liver failure-organ failure (CLIF-C-OF) score was 11 (range, 8-14), and median CLIF-C-ACLF score was 98 (range, 87-127). Portal-based neutrophilic predominant mixed inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, autoimmune-like features, and severe cholestasis were seen on liver biopsy. Overall, 53% of patients died (median survival 194 days). Baseline overt hepatic encephalopathy and CLIF-C-OF score, total bilirubin, hyponatremia and leukocytosis, and grade of ACLF predicted 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month mortality, respectively. Conclusion: Possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF has a high mortality. Strict monitoring and identification of CAM use among people with cirrhosis and an integrative public health educational practice can help ameliorate this modifiable risk factor that potentiates heavy liver disease burden and resource use.

AB  - Repair of damaged skeletal-muscle tissue is limited by the regenerative capacity of the native tissue. Current clinical approaches are not optimal for the treatment of large volumetric skeletal-muscle loss. As an alternative, tissue engineering represents a promising approach for the functional restoration of damaged muscle tissue. A typical tissue-engineering process involves the design and fabrication of a scaffold that closely mimics the native skeletal-muscle extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing organization of cells into a physiologically relevant 3D architecture. In particular, anisotropic materials that mimic the morphology of the native skeletal-muscle ECM, can be fabricated using various biocompatible materials to guide cell alignment, elongation, proliferation, and differentiation into myotubes. Here, an overview of fundamental concepts associated with muscle-tissue engineering and the current status of muscle-tissue-engineering approaches is provided. Recent advances in the development of anisotropic scaffolds with micro- or nanoscale features are reviewed, and how scaffold topographical, mechanical, and biochemical cues correlate to observed cellular function and phenotype development is examined. Finally, some recent developments in both the design and utility of anisotropic materials in skeletal-muscle-tissue engineering are highlighted, along with their potential impact on future research and clinical applications.
