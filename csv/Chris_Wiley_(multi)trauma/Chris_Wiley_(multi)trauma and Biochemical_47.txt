AB  - Summary The first meeting of international specialists in the field of von Willebrand disease (VWD) was held in the Åland islands in 1998 where Erik von Willebrand had first observed a bleeding disorder in some members of a family from Föglö and a summary of the meeting was published in 1999. The second meeting was held in 2010 and a report of the meeting was published in 2012. Topics covered included progress in understanding of VWD over the last 50 years; multimers; classification of VWD; pharmacokinetics and laboratory assays; genetics; treating the paediatric patient; prophylaxis; geriatrics; gene therapy and treatment guidelines. This third meeting held over 3 days covered the structure and function of von Willebrand factor (VWF); type 1 VWD, the most common form of the disease; a lifespan of pharmacokinetics in VWD; detecting inhibitors in VWD patients; and special challenges in understanding and treating the female VWD patient.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Spatial behaviour of fishes in fresh and brackish water ranges in temporal scales between localized diel movements, often associated with foraging and predator evasion, to seasonal or life-cycle related events involving movements between freshwater habitats or freshwater and marine biotopes. Recent technological advances have resulted in dramatic improvements in the range of techniques available for the study of spatial behaviour of freshwater fishes in the natural environment, and broadly may be divided into two categories: capture dependent and capture independent. The former incorporates those methods that rely on sampling marked fish (mark?recapture) or unmarked fish (density estimates, catch per unit effort) over defined scales of time and space in order to derive information on distribution and movement. Captured fish may also be tagged with transmitters that radiate energy, enabling the fish to be tracked and/or environmental data to be gathered. Biochemical analysis of samples from fish, requiring non-destructive sampling (genetic analysis and scale microchemistry) or destructive sampling (otolith microchemistry) may also provide information on migration and ontogenetic processes. Capture independent techniques include visual observation and video techniques, hydroacoustics and automated fish counting. Catch per unit effort and mark?recapture techniques are most efficient where long-term fishery or monitoring studies are in place and data on crude spatial and temporal scales are acceptable. They also have the advantages of low technical requirements and low equipment costs. Where specific management or ecological questions are pertinent, recapture independent techniques may be more appropriate. Telemetric methods can provide high resolution information at the individual level, while hydroacoustics is increasingly providing information at the population level in large lake and river environments. Biochemical methods are becoming increasingly useful in determining the extent of population segregation, where DNA analysis is used, and in the study of migration and ontogenetic changes in behaviour, where otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analysis is used.

AB  - Macrophages are central to the inflammatory response and its ability to resolve effectively. They are complex cells that adopt a range of subtypes depending on the tissue type and stimulus that they find themselves under. This flexibility allows them to play multiple, sometimes opposing, roles in inflammation and tissue repair. Their central role in the inflammatory process is reflected in macrophage dysfunction being implicated in chronic inflammation and poorly healing wounds. In this study, we discuss recent attempts to model mathematically and computationally the macrophage and how it partakes in the complex processes of inflammation and tissue repair. There are increasing data describing the variety of macrophage phenotypes and their underlying transcriptional programs. Dynamic mathematical and computational models are an ideal way to test biological hypotheses against experimental data and could aid in understanding this multi-functional cell and its potential role as an attractive therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions and tissue repair.

AB  - Abstract Lasers are currently used in diagnostics, for example in metabolic monitoring (fluorescence diagnosis, laser Doppler) and optical imaging (laser scanning microscopy, optical coherence tomography, infrared diaphanoscopy). One main research focus remains therapeutic applications ? on one hand using lasers as a surgical instrument, on the other as a central, independent therapy method. Historically, the traditional indication for photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been malignant tumors, but experience of photodynamic therapy in this field and understanding of the biochemical metabolic processes involved, has expanded the use of this therapeutic principle to benign diseases. But even as developments in surgical applications (for example, the development of ?laser scalpels?) are recorded in the last few years advancements have also been made in other areas, such as virtual endoscopy in MRI.

AB  - Abstract We evaluated the efficacy and robustness of a second generation implantable stimulator for correcting drop foot (DF) in a patient with left-sided hemiplegia over 20 years of functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the common peroneal nerve (CPN). Dorsal flexion and eversion of the affected foot was partially restored by FES of the superficial region of the CPN innervating mostly the tibialis anterior (TA) and partly peroneus longus (PL) and peroneus brevis (PB) muscles. The reasons for implant failure during the long-term follow-up assessment were analyzed and resolving procedures were identified. The stimulator had an average failure rate of once every three years, due to repetitive mechanical load on the lead wires of its internal and/or external unit, and had to be serviced once per year to replace the heel switch integrated into the shoe sole. FES-associated mechanical trauma to the CPN elicited a thickening of the connective tissue around the CPN and a slightly compromised conduction velocity of the CPN. FES of the CPN, with the second generation implantable stimulator, improved gait parameters of the affected leg during the 20 years period. Long-term, daily FES enables a functional and reliable recruitment of nerve fibers, thus providing a sufficient dorsal flexion and optimal eversion of the affected foot to sustain unassisted, almost normal gait. Therefore, the presented implant is suitable for very long-term FES of the CPN.

AB  - Summary In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) advances in recent years have revolutionized the biochemical analysis of lipids in plants, and made possible new theories about the structural diversity and functional complexity of lipids in plant cells. Approaches have been developed to profile the lipidome of plants with increasing chemical and spatial resolution. Here we highlight a variety of methods for lipidomics analysis at the tissue, cellular and subcellular levels. These procedures allow the simultaneous identification and quantification of hundreds of lipids species in tissue extracts by direct-infusion MS, localization of lipids in tissues and cells by laser desorption/ionization MS, and even profiling of lipids in individual subcellular compartments by direct-organelle MS. Applications of these approaches to achieve improved understanding of plant lipid metabolism, compartmentation and function are discussed.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - An in vitro study of dural lesions produced by 25-gauge Quincke and Whitacre needles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. (Hospital de Mostoles, Madrid Spain) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:393?402. This study evaluated the dural lesions produced by Whitacre and Quincke spinal needles in the external and internal surface of the dura mater of the lower spine area in an attempt to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of postdural puncture headaches (PDPH). The T11-L4 dural membranes from 5 fresh (immediately after extraction of organs for transplantation) male patients declared brain dead, ages 23, 46, 48, 55, and 60, were excised by anterior laminectomy. Morphologic orientation of the membrane and normal pH were maintained; 100 punctures at 90-degree angles were done with a new needle each time, 50 with 25-gauge Whitacre and 50 with 25-gauge Quincke needles. Half of the punctures with the Quincke needles were done with the bevel in the parallel direction to the axis of the spinal cord, and the rest with the bevel perpendicular to it. Fixation in solutions of 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer, followed by dehydration with acetone, was done 15 min after the punctures. The acetone was removed and the specimens were metallized with carbon followed by gold and inspected under a scanning electron microscope. When the area of the dural lesions found in the external and internal surfaces produced by the 2 types of needles was compared, no significant differences were found. The percentage of lesion closing area with the Quincke needles was 88.3% and 82.7% in the external and internal surfaces, respectively. With the Whitacre needles, the percentage of closing was 86.8% and 84.8% in the epidural and arachnoid surfaces, respectively. There were differences noted in the morphology of the lesions. The Whitacre needles produced coarse lesions with significant destruction in the dura's fibers while the Quincke needles produced a ?U?-shaped lesion (flap) that mimics the opened lid of a tin can, regardless of the tip's direction. Conclude that the needles produced lesions in the dura with different morphology and characteristics. Lesions with the Quincke needles resulted in a clean-cut opening in the dural membrane while the Whitacre needle produced a more traumatic opening with tearing and severe disruption of the collagen fibers. The lower incidence of PDPH seen in the Whitacre needles may be explained, in part, by the inflammatory reaction produced by the tearing of the collagen fibers after dural penetration. The inflammatory reaction may result in a significant edema, which may act as a plug limiting the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article that explains why a patient will develop a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after receiving a spinal with a Quincke needle and not after a Whitacre-type needle. The explanation is based more upon an inflammatory reaction than the direction of the needle cut. The Quincke needle appears to make a sharp cut while the Whitacre needle induced an inflammatory response including edema, which could block off the dura from leaking. It is very interesting that the response seen after the Whitacre needle was utilized occurred as quickly as it did. The article introduces the question as to whether a Quincke needle or a Whitacre needle is associated with more trauma to the dura, and which is better for decreasing the incidence of PDPD.

AB  - A seven-year-old male, entire rottweiler was presented to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital with a 24 hour history of blindness, chemosis, exophthalmus, pain on opening the mouth and hypersialism. Bilateral mandibular and zygomatic salivary gland enlargement with concurrent bilateral zygomatic salivary gland sialocoeles were identified. The cause of the mandibular salivary gland enlargement was confirmed as necrotising sialadenitis, while the cause of the zygomatic gland enlargement was presumed to be because of a similar disease process. No underlying aetiology was identified. Treatment consisted of supportive management, corticosteroids and paracentesis of the sialocoeles and resulted in resolution of the salivary gland enlargement and the associated clinical signs. This is an unusual presentation of salivary gland disease in the dog with multiple gland involvement and a spectrum of disease processes occurring at the same time.

AB  - Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) Int J Dermatol 2000;39:481?486. This review aimed to familiarize the dermatologist with the essential features of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It highlights areas that are most likely to be of interest to the dermatologist. Information regarding diagnosis, pathogenesis theories, and treatment are included. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This paper analyses RSD from the point of view of a specialist in dermatology. It addresses in depth the definition of RSD (or the new name, CRPS type I), the symptoms required for adequate diagnosis, some theories to explain this syndrome, and some of the treatments available. It highlights the clinical pictures, which can cause RSD (trauma, ischemia, tumors, infection, neurological and iatrogenic causes), and particularly dermatological syndromes (minor surgery, postherpetic neuralgia, Dupuytren, vasculitis ?). The treatment has a bipolar objective: to relieve pain in order to be able to apply appropriate physical therapy, which will allow recovery of the involved limb. There are more than 60 treatments reported in the literature, suggesting that there is no universal protocol. However, prevention of RSD, and particularly the early onset of treatment are essential for achieving functional and pain relief. To suppress sympathetic hyperactivity, nerve blocks (somatic and sympathetic), intravenous regional blockade with guanethidine or reserpine, alpha blockers (phentolamine), beta blockers (propranolol), and calcitonine can be used. No reference is made to anticonvulsants (gabapentine, topiramate), antidepressants (ie, amitriptyline), intravenous lidocaine, or spinal cord stimulation.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Application of the lactose 13C-ureide breath test (LUBT) for measurement of equine orocaecal transit time (OCTT) has not been reported previously. The ability to assess OCTT noninvasively, and to investigate its relationship to gastric emptying rate and small intestinal transit, would be of both clinical and research value. Objectives: 1) Assessment of the LUBT in healthy horses, with comparison of induced versus noninduced test protocols. 2) Application of a new dual stable isotope breath test (lactose 13C-ureide and 13C-octanoic acid) for gastrointestinal transit measurement. Hypothesis: The LUBT will allow quantification of equine OCTT, and test efficacy will be enhanced by prior administration of lactose 12C-ureide as shown in vitro. The dual tracer breath test will permit simultaneous measurement of gastric emptying, OCTT and small bowel transit times. Methods: Induced and noninduced LUBTs were performed in 3 healthy mature horses in randomised order using a standard test meal and protocol. Combined LUBT and 13C-octanoic acid breath tests (13C-OABT) were performed in 4 individuals on 4 occasions at weekly intervals. Expiratory isotopic recovery was modelled to allow generation of gastric emptying data, small bowel transit times and caecal transit parameters. Results: The induction protocol for the LUBT increased the rate and magnitude of expiratory 13CO2 significantly. Mean ± s.d. values for OCTT, caecal lag phase (tlag) and caecal t1/2 using the induced LUBT were 3.24 ± 0.65 h, 5.62 ± 1.22 h and 6.31 ± 1.21 h, respectively. Dual stable isotope tests resulted in the production of 2 discrete peaks in expiratory 13CO2 in 15/16 tests from which gastric t1/2, OCTT and small bowel transit (SBT) parameters could be calculated. Conclusions: The induced LUBT provides a reliable noninvasive measure of equine OCTT and can be paired with the 13C-OABT to provide further information about small intestinal motility.

AB  - Abstract Changes in RNA localization and concentration in mouse uteri taken from one-half to seven and one-quarter days after mating were visualized as changes in basophilia following staining by a histochemical method specific for RNA. The basophilia of the luminal epithelium falls abruptly between one-half and two days and is still lower at two and three-quarter days. By 2 and three-quarter days, however, that of the stroma and especially that of the subepithelial endothelial cells is increasing. A further slight increase is found at three and three-quarter days and by four days, a band of subepithelial stromal cells, wider in the antimesometrial than in the mesometrial portion of the uterus, is highly basophilic. At four and one-quarter days, when a distinct decidual reaction is evident, cells in the primary decidual zone are less basophilic than at four days. During the remaining period of observation, cells in different regions of the uterus show increased and often, later, decreased basophilia. It was concluded that these results are in complete accord with those from a recent biochemical study of changes in RNA in the intact rat uterus during the interval from induction of pseudopregnancy through deciduoma formation if the difference in timing in the two species is taken into account.

AB  - Abstract Hypoxic?ischemia injury occurs after trauma causes consequential bone necrosis. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used in orthopedic clinics for pain relief. However, the underlying mechanism and outcome for usage of NSAIDs is poorly understood. To investigate the damage and loss of osteoblast function in hypoxia, two hypoxia mimetics, cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and desferrioxamine (DFO), were used to create an in vitro hypoxic microenvironment. The cell damage was observed by decreases of cell viability and increases in cyclooxygenase-2 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Cell apoptosis was confirmed by WST-1 cytotoxic assays and flow cytometry. The functional expression of osteoblast in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was significantly decreased by CoCl2 and inhibited when treated with DFO. To simulate the use of NSAID after hypoxic injury, four types of anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac sulfide (SUL), indomethacin (IND), aspirin (Asp), and sodium salicylate (NaS), were applied to osteoblasts after 1?h of hypoxia mimetic treatment. SUL and IND further enhanced cell death after hypoxia. ALP activity was totally abolished in hypoxic osteoblasts under IND treatment. Facilitation of osteoblast apoptosis occurred regardless of IND dosage under hypoxic conditions. To investigate osteoblast in vivo, local hypoxia was created by fracture of tibia and then treated the injured mice with IND by oral feeding. IND-induced osteoblast apoptosis was confirmed by positive staining of TUNEL assay in fractured mice. Significant delay of fracture healing in bone tissue was also observed with the treatment of IND. These results provide information pertaining to choosing appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs for orthopedic patients. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 148?155, 2012. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
