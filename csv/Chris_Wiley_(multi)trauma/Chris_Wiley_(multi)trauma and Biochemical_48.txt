AB  - Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) Int J Dermatol 2000;39:481?486. This review aimed to familiarize the dermatologist with the essential features of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It highlights areas that are most likely to be of interest to the dermatologist. Information regarding diagnosis, pathogenesis theories, and treatment are included. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This paper analyses RSD from the point of view of a specialist in dermatology. It addresses in depth the definition of RSD (or the new name, CRPS type I), the symptoms required for adequate diagnosis, some theories to explain this syndrome, and some of the treatments available. It highlights the clinical pictures, which can cause RSD (trauma, ischemia, tumors, infection, neurological and iatrogenic causes), and particularly dermatological syndromes (minor surgery, postherpetic neuralgia, Dupuytren, vasculitis ?). The treatment has a bipolar objective: to relieve pain in order to be able to apply appropriate physical therapy, which will allow recovery of the involved limb. There are more than 60 treatments reported in the literature, suggesting that there is no universal protocol. However, prevention of RSD, and particularly the early onset of treatment are essential for achieving functional and pain relief. To suppress sympathetic hyperactivity, nerve blocks (somatic and sympathetic), intravenous regional blockade with guanethidine or reserpine, alpha blockers (phentolamine), beta blockers (propranolol), and calcitonine can be used. No reference is made to anticonvulsants (gabapentine, topiramate), antidepressants (ie, amitriptyline), intravenous lidocaine, or spinal cord stimulation.

AB  - Recent advances in understanding of cell?matrix interactions and the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulation of cellular behavior have created new perspectives for regenerative medicine. Supramolecular peptide nanofiber systems have been used as synthetic scaffolds in regenerative medicine applications due to their tailorable properties and ability to mimic ECM proteins. Through designed bioactive epitopes, peptide nanofiber systems provide biomolecular recognition sites that can trigger specific interactions with cell surface receptors. The present Review covers structural and biochemical properties of the self-assembled peptide nanofibers for tissue regeneration, and highlights studies that investigate the ability of ECM mimetic peptides to alter cellular behavior including cell adhesion, proliferation, and/or differentiation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Few pooled analyses of antiresorptive (AR) treatment trials relate short-term changes in bone turnover markers (BTMs) to subsequent fracture reduction. Such information would be useful to assess new ARs or novel dosing regimens. In the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Bone Quality project, we analyzed individual-level data from 28,000 participants enrolled in 11 bisphosphonate (BP) and three selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) placebo-controlled fracture endpoint trials. Using BTM results for two bone formation markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [bone ALP] and pro-collagen I N-propeptide [PINP]) and two bone resorption markers (N-terminal and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) and incident fracture outcome data, we performed a meta-regression relating the mean net effect of treatment on change in bone turnover (active minus placebo % difference after 3 to 12 months) to the log of study-wide fracture risk reduction, and used linear regression to plot the best fitting line. Separate analyses were performed for incident morphometric vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures over 1 to 4 years of follow-up. Change in bone ALP and PINP were available for over 16,000 and 10,000 participants, respectively. For vertebral fracture, the results showed a strong relationship between treatment-related bone ALP or PINP changes and vertebral fracture risk reduction (r2?=?0.82 [p?<?0.001] and r2?=?0.75 [p?=?0.011], respectively) Relationships were weaker and no longer statistically significant for nonvertebral (r2?=?0.33 [p?=?0.053] and r2?=?0.53 [p?=?0.065], respectively) and hip fracture (r2?=?0.17 [p?=?0.24] and r2?=?0.43 [p?=?0.11], respectively) outcomes. Analyses limited to BP trials gave similar results. For all fracture types, relationships were weaker and nonsignificant for bone resorption markers. We conclude that short-term AR treatment-related changes in bone ALP and PINP strongly predict vertebral fracture treatment efficacy, but not nonvertebral or hip fracture treatment efficacy. Change in bone formation markers might be useful to predict the anti-vertebral fracture efficacy of new AR compounds or novel dosing regiments with approved AR drugs. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract In this ?Summary Guidance for Daily Practice?, we describe the basic principles of prevention and management of foot problems in persons with diabetes. This summary is based on the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) Guidance 2015. There are five key elements that underpin prevention of foot problems: (1) identification of the at-risk foot; (2) regular inspection and examination of the at-risk foot; (3) education of patient, family and healthcare providers; (4) routine wearing of appropriate footwear; and (5) treatment of pre-ulcerative signs. Healthcare providers should follow a standardized and consistent strategy for evaluating a foot wound, as this will guide further evaluation and therapy. The following items must be addressed: type, cause, site and depth, and signs of infection. There are seven key elements that underpin ulcer treatment: (1) relief of pressure and protection of the ulcer; (2) restoration of skin perfusion; (3) treatment of infection; (4) metabolic control and treatment of co-morbidity; (5) local wound care; (6) education for patient and relatives; and (7) prevention of recurrence. Finally, successful efforts to prevent and manage foot problems in diabetes depend upon a well-organized team, using a holistic approach in which the ulcer is seen as a sign of multi-organ disease, and integrating the various disciplines involved.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Although increasing evidences emphasize the importance of early cardiovascular evaluation in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) of unexplained aetiology, impaired masturbation-induced erections in young men are usually overlooked and habitually presumed to be psychological origin. Aims To evaluate the young men presenting weaker masturbatory erection with no sexual intercourse (WME-NS) and verify if this cohort have early cardiovascular risks associated with ED. Methods Male subjects aged 18?40 years with WME-NS were screened by analyzing detailed sexual intercourse and masturbatory history. The age-matched ED and non-ED population were identified by using International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). All subjects with acute and/or chronic diseases (including diagnosed hypertension and diabetes) and long-term pharmacotherapy were excluded. Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR), systemic vascular parameters and biochemical indicators related to metabolism were assessed. Main Outcome Measures Comparison analysis and logistic regression analysis were conducted among WME-NS, ED and non-ED population. Results In total, 78 WME-NS cases (mean 28.99?±?5.92 years), 179 ED cases (mean 30.69?±?5.21 years) and 43 non-ED cases (mean 28.65?±?4.30 years) were screened for analysis. Compared with non-ED group, WME-NS group had higher prevalence of early ED risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, high level of glycosylated serum protein and abnormal NPTR. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed endothelia dysfunction (odds ratio: 8.83 vs. 17.11, both P?<?0.001) was the independent risk factor for both WME-NS and ED. Conclusions Weaker masturbatory erection may be a sign of early cardiovascular risk associated with ED in young men without sexual intercourse. More studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical benefits by targeting these formulated strategies. Huang Y-P, Chen B, Yao F-J, Chen S-F, Ouyang B, Deng C-H, and Huang Y-R.

AB  - Abstract We report on a 5-year-old female born to consanguineous parents, ascertained at the age of 23?months for an elevated plasma methionine level, a mildly abnormal total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), and elevated aminotransferases. She had global developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, hypotonia, nystagmus and tremor in her upper extremities. Metabolic investigations demonstrated elevations in plasma methionine, plasma S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), with normal urine adenosine levels. Some of the elevations persisted for over 1?year. Sequencing of the ADK and AHCY genes was negative for causative variants. Plasma methionine normalized 1?year after ascertainment, but SAM and SAH continued to be elevated for six more months before normalization, and aminotransferases remained mildly elevated. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated a homozygous pathogenic variant; NM_018297.3(NGLY1):c.1405C>T (p.Arg469*) in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene, for which both parents were heterozygous. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NGLY1 deficiency with elevations in plasma methionine, SAM and SAH and a slight elevation of tHcy. Less than 20 patients have been reported with NGLY1 deficiency worldwide and this case expands on the biochemical phenotype of this newly discovered inborn error of metabolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:? It has been reported that metron factor-1 (MF-1), an engineered chimerical factor containing selected functional domains of hepatocyte growth factor and macrophage-stimulating protein (HGF?MSP), could prevent apoptosis and have an anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, we investigate the protective effect of MF-1 on liver ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. METHODS:? Overall 30 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: the I/R model group (n?=?12), the MF-1 treatment group (n?=?12), and the sham-operated group (n?=?6). Liver I/R injury was induced by clamping the blood supply to the left and median lobes of liver by an atraumatic clamp for 90?min, then removing the clamp and allowing reperfusion. Blood samples were obtained on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 to assess liver biochemistry and the histology of liver tissue. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase were measured. In addition, the anti-oxidative effect of MF-1 on hepatocytes was assessed in vitro. RESULTS:? MF-1 treatment improved the rat survival rate significantly (P?<?0.05). Liver biochemistry and histological changes were significantly ameliorated. MDA increased and SOD and NO decreased in the liver tissue. In vitro, MF-1 protected the human hepatic cell line HL-7702 from damage of oxidative stress. CONCLUSION:? MF-1 could protect the liver from I/R injury, which might involve the reduction of oxygen free radicals and the increase of NO synthesis in an injured liver.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the outcomes of dogs treated at a single institution for single extrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) by thin film banding (TFB) or by placement of an ameroid constrictor (AC). Study design Retrospective case series. Animals Seventy-six client-owned dogs with CPSS treated with TFB (n = 53) or AC (n = 23). Methods Records were reviewed for signalment, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management and short-term outcomes. Data on second surgeries were reviewed. Long-term outcomes were obtained via an owner-directed health-related quality of life questionnaire. The rates of complications, mortality, and revision surgery were compared between the treatment groups. Results Postoperative complications occurred in 15 (28%) dogs with TFB (9% mortality, n = 5) and 8 (35%) dogs with an AC (4% mortality, n = 1). Long-term follow-up was available in 41 of 56 dogs at a median of 55?months (range, 15-89). Revision surgery for persistent shunting was performed in 14 (29%) dogs treated initially with TFB and in no dogs treated initially with AC (P = .007). Median long-term outcome scores were good in both groups; nine of 14 revision surgeries led to favorable outcomes. Conclusion Persistent shunting requiring revision surgery was more common when CPSS were treated with TFB than with an AC, but both treatments achieved favorable long-term outcomes. Clinical significance Treatment of CPPS by placement of an AC rather than TFB seems more reliable for shunt attenuation and prevention of revision surgeries.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - Abstract During brain development, a population of uniform embryonic cells migrates and differentiates into a large number of neural phenotypes ? origin of the enormous complexity of the adult nervous system. Processes of cell proliferation, differentiation and programmed death of no longer required cells, do not occur only during embryogenesis, but are also maintained during adulthood and are affected in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease states. As neurogenesis is an endogenous response to brain injury, visible as proliferation (of to this moment silent stem or progenitor cells), its further stimulation can present a treatment strategy in addition to stem cell transfer for cell regeneration therapy. Concise techniques for studying such events in vitro and in vivo permit understanding of underlying mechanisms. Detection of subtle physiological alterations in brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis can be explored, that occur during environmental stimulation, exercise and ageing. Here, we have collected achievements in the field of basic research on applications of cytometry, including automated imaging for quantification of morphological or fluorescence-based parameters in cell cultures, towards imaging of three-dimensional brain architecture together with DNA content and proliferation data. Multi-parameter and more recently in vivo flow cytometry procedures, have been developed for quantification of phenotypic diversity and cell processes that occur during brain development as well as in adulthood, with importance for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Despite numerous hypotheses regarding the action of laser light, the use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury is still being verified. The present study investigates the effects of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on I/R injury of the musculus gracilis in rats. Materials and Methods I/R injury of the musculus gracilis flap was induced in male adult Sprague?Dawley rats (n?=?84). Rats were subdivided depending on treatment into four subgroups: (1) healthy group, (2) I/R injury without irradiation, (3) R group irradiated only during reperfusion after injury, and (4) IR group irradiated during ischemia and reperfusion injury. LLLT (AlGaInP; ??=?670?nm; 4?J/cm2; 40?mW/cm2) was applied to the injured muscle four times daily until euthanasia. Results Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) levels were significantly lower (P<0.05) in the irradiated groups during the first 12?120?hours, while the lower creatine kinase (CK) level reached statistical significance only at 24?hours in the irradiated group when compared to the control group. The number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the gracilis muscle was significantly lower in the treated group only on the second day (P<0.0001). The lowered percentage of necrosis in the muscle tissue was statistically significant after 6 and 10 days of treatment (P<0.0001), while lower atrophy and higher neovascularization were observed at 6?14 days of irradiation (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the group irradiated only during reperfusion and that irradiated during ischemia and reperfusion. Conclusion LLLT confers a protective effect against early inflammatory tissue response, further atrophy, and necrosis of the muscle and it stimulates neovascularization after I/R injury. Lasers Surg.

AB  - Abstract Sorafenib is the first multi-kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) and is increasingly being used to treat patients with well-differentiated radioiodine-resistant thyroid cancer (DTC). Sorafenib demonstrates targeted activity on several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression of cancer. Sorafenib treatment results in long-term efficacy and low incidence of life-threatening toxicities. Although sorafenib has demonstrated many benefits in patients, the adverse effects cannot be ignored. The most common treatment-related toxicities include diarrhoea, fatigue, hand?foot skin reaction and hypertension. Most of these toxicities are considered mild to moderate and manageable to varying degrees; however, cardiovascular events might lead to death. In this MiniReview, we summarize the adverse effects of sorafenib that commonly occur in patients with advanced cancers.

AB  - Abstract The versatile electrospinning technique is recognized as an efficient strategy to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients and has gained tremendous progress in drug delivery, tissue engineering, cancer therapy, and disease diagnosis. Numerous drug delivery systems fabricated through electrospinning regarding the carrier compositions, drug incorporation techniques, release kinetics, and the subsequent therapeutic efficacy are presented herein. Targeting for distinct applications, the composition of drug carriers vary from natural/synthetic polymers/blends, inorganic materials, and even hybrids. Various drug incorporation approaches through electrospinning are thoroughly discussed with respect to the principles, benefits, and limitations. To meet the various requirements in actual sophisticated in vivo environments and to overcome the limitations of a single carrier system, feasible combinations of multiple drug-inclusion processes via electrospinning could be employed to achieve programmed, multi-staged, or stimuli-triggered release of multiple drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of the designed electrospun drug-eluting systems is further verified in multiple biomedical applications and is comprehensively overviewed, demonstrating promising potential to address a variety of clinical challenges.

AB  - Abstract The recent tremendous progress in understanding physical plasma phenomenon, together with the development of new plasma sources has put growing focus on the application of plasmas in health care. Active plasma components, such as molecules, atoms, ions, electrons and photons, reactive species, ultraviolet radiation, optical and infrared emission and heat have the ability of activating, controlling and catalysing reactions and complex biochemical procedures. Thermal and non-thermal (i.e. cold) plasmas ? both already widely established in medicine ? are used for various therapeutic applications. Particularly in dermatology, plasma applications hold big potential, for example, in wound healing, such as efficient disinfection or sterilization, therapy of various skin infections or tissue regeneration. This review gives an overview on potential plasma applications in medicine ? including the recent research on skin diseases ? and summarizes possible interactions between plasmas and living tissue.

AB  - Abstract Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by corneal endothelial abnormalities, which can lead to blindness due to loss of corneal transparency and sometimes glaucoma. We mapped a new locus responsible for PPCD in a family in which we excluded the previously reported PPCD locus on 20q11, and the region containing COL8A2 on chromosome 1. Results of a 317-marker genome scan provided significant evidence of linkage of PPCD to markers on chromosome 10, with single-point LOD scores of 2.63, 1.63, and 3.19 for markers D10S208 (at $\hat \theta = 0.03$), D10S1780 (at $\hat \theta = 0.00$), and D10S578 (at $\hat \theta = 0.06$). A maximum multi-point LOD score of 4.35 was found at marker D10S1780. Affected family members shared a haplotype in an 8.55 cM critical interval that was bounded by markers D10S213 and D10S578. Our finding of another PPCD locus, PPCD3, on chromosome 10 indicates that PPCD is genetically heterogeneous. Guttae, a common corneal finding sometimes observed along with PPCD, were found among both affected and unaffected members of the proband's sib ship, but were absent in the younger generations of the family. Evaluation of phenotypic differences between family members sharing the same affected haplotype raises questions about whether differences in disease severity, including differences in response to surgical interventions, could be due to genetic background or other factors independent of the PPCD3 locus. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
