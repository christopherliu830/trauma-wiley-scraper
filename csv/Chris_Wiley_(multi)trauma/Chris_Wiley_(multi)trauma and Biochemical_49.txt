AB  - SUMMARY Parenteral magnesium sulfate has been used to control acute convulsions of diverse etiologies and is currently a mainstay in controlling eclamptic convulsions. However, the site of this anticonvulsant action has remained controversial and not well studied in experimental epileptic models. Therefore we determined the effects of intravenously infused magnesium sulfate on the epileptic neural activity induced by topical application of penicillin G to motor cortex in anesthetized cats and dogs and in awake, undrugged primates. Magnesium sulfate was able to directly suppress neuronal burst firing and interictal EEG spike generation at serum levels below those producing paralysis. The degree of suppression corresponded to the serum magnesium concentration and was reversible. These results corroborate the clinical observations in patients that magnesium can produce an anticonvulsant effect apart from neuromuscular blockade and suggest it may have clinical applicability in treating a wider range of acute convulsions. RÉSUMÉ Les injections parentérales de sulfate de magnésium ont de utilisées pour le traitement d'états convulsifs d'étiologies diverses et sont encore couramment utilisées pour le traitement des convulsions éclamptiques. Cependant le lieu de Taction anticonvulsivante de ce produit est encore L'objet de discussions et n'a pas de bien étudié du point de vue expérimental. Les auteurs ont done déterminé les effets d'une perfusion intra-veineuse de sulfate de magnesium sur L'activitéépileptique provoquée par L'application de pénicilline G sur le cortex moteur de chats et de chiens anesthesies et de primates eveilles. Le sulfate de magnesium s'est revele capable de supprimer directement les decharges neuroniques et les pointes intercritiques sur L'EEG pour des taux seriques inferieurs a ceux entrainant la paralysie. Le degré de suppression correspond àa la concentration sérique du magnésium et la suppression est réversible. de tels résultats corroborent les observations cliniques suivant lesquelles le magnesium petit avoir un effet antiepileptique en dehors d'un blocage neuromusculaire et ils suggàerent que ce produit pour-rait être utilisé pour le traitement d'un large éventail d'états convulsifs aigus. RESUMEN El sulfato de magnesio por via parenteral se ha usado para control de las convulsiones agudas de diversas etiologías y todavía constituye una medicación de elección en el control de las convulsiones eclampsicas. A pesar de todo, el lugar de su acción anticonvulsiva permanece bajo controversia y no se ha estudiado bien en modelos epilépticos experimen-tales. Por esta raz6n hemos determinado los efectos de la inyección endovenosa de sulfato magnésico sobre la actividad epileptica neuronal inducida mediante la aplicación táopica de penicilina G en la corteza motora de perros y gatos anestesiados y de primates despiertos y sin medicar. El sulfato magnesico suprimió los brotes de descargas neuronales y la generación de puntas en el electroencefalograma interictal con nive-les sericos inferiores a los que produce paralisis. El grado de supresi6n correspondi6 a la concentración s6rica de magnesio y fue reversible. Estos resultados corroboran las observaciones clinicas en pacientes, de los que se deduce que el magnesio puede producir un efecto anticonvulsivo ajeno al bloqueo neuromuscular y sugieren que puede tener una aplicación clinica en el tratamiento de un amplio espectro de convulsiones agudas. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Parenterale Gaben von Magnesiumsulfat werden genutzt, akut aufgetretene Anfalle unterschiedlicher Atiologie zu kupieren. Gegenwartig ist Magnesiumsulfat eine Hauptstiitze in der Behandlung eklamp-tischer Anfalle. Die Lokalisation seiner antikonvul-siven Wirkung jedoch blieb kontrovers und nicht ausreichend an experimentellen Epilepsiemodellen untersucht. Wir haben daher die Wirkungen intravenos applizierten Magnesiumsulfats auf die epileptische Neuronenaktivitat untersucht, wobei die épilepsie hervorgerufen worden war durch lokale Gabe von Penicillin G an die motorische Rindenregion von anaesthesierten Katzen und Hunden und von wachen, nicht medikamentos vorbehandelten Primaten. Magnesiumsulfat war in der Lage, unmittelbar neuronale Paroxysmen und interictale encephalographische spikes zu unterdriicken bei Serumspiegeln, die unter dem paralysierenden Bereich lagen. Der Grad der Unterdriickung korrespondierte zu der Konzentration von Magnesiumsulfat im Serum und war reversibel. Diese Ergebnisse bestarken die klinischen Beobach-tungen an Patienten, daß Mg einen antikonvulsiven Effekt haben kann abgesehen von neuromuskularer Blockade, und sie lassen annehmen, daß es klinisch anwendbar ist für einen groBeren Teil akuter cerebraler Anfalle.

AB  - This study presents the first case report of neuritis of the cauda equina in a dog, including characterisation of the inflammatory infiltrate. The dog in question, a 6-year-old Welsh springer spaniel, was presented with flaccid tail and faecal and urinary incontinence. The histological lesions included severe mononuclear cell infiltration of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and of the lumbar nerve roots. The infiltrate was composed of large numbers of T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes and small numbers of macrophages. Polymerase chain reactions of brain and spinal tissues were positive for Neospora caninum.

AB  - Background Changes in water balance and the presence of unmeasured anions perturb the inverse relationship between serum chloride (Cl) and bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations in people, affecting accurate interpretation of acid-base status. Objectives The aim of this study was to demonstrate that corrected serum Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations, based on serum sodium (Na) concentration and anion gap (AG), would be inversely correlated and could be used to better characterize causes of acid-base disorders in dogs. Methods In this retrospective study, electrolyte data from dogs with at least one abnormality in serum Na, Cl, or HCO3 concentrations were analyzed. Profiles were classified before and after calculations using 2 methods, a modified Feldman and an institutional method, to correct Cl concentration and predict HCO3 concentrations based on Na concentration and AG. Dogs were classified as low (L), normal (N), or high (H) based on Cl (first letter) and HCO3 (second letter) concentrations, as follows: LL, LN, LH, NL, NN, NH, HL, HN, or HH. Results For profiles from 261 dogs, reclassifying corrected Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations resulted in a shift from the initial classification into a different one in 73% of dogs; in most cases, the shift was to LH, NN, or HL categories. Albumin concentration was a significant factor in acid-base balance. Conclusions When interpreting acid-base status based on results of a standard biochemical panel, erroneous conclusions can be drawn if concentrations of Na, unmeasured anions, and albumin are not taken into account. The inverse relationship between serum Cl and HCO3 concentrations may be used to identify frequent acid-base disorders as well as to unmask abnormalities obscured by irregularities in water balance or AG.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Summary Autosomal recessive disorders of galactose metabolism are caused by one of three sequential enzymes such as galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) and uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase (GALE). The disorders are galactokinase deficiency, galactosaemia and glycogen storage disorders. The chapter describes clinical features, diagnosis and treatment method and dietary management for the three types of disorders. Classical galactosaemia presents in the neonatal period with life threatening illness after galactose is introduced in the diet. Symptoms and signs include poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea, weight loss, jaundice, hypotonia, cataracts, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatocellular insufficiency and encephalopathy. Three forms of galactosaemia are classical galactosaemia, clinical variant galactosaemia and biochemical variant galactosaemia. Management with a ketogenic diet (KD) is the first line treatment including cases where there is a strong clinical suspicion and low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose, but absent SLC2A1 mutation.

AB  - Summary The use of contrast media in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing in horses. These contrast-enhanced imaging techniques provide improved tissue delineation and evaluation, thereby expanding diagnostic capabilities. While generally considered safe, not all contrast media exhibit the same safety profiles. The safety of contrast media use and descriptions of adverse events occurring in horses are sparsely reported. This review summarises the reported evidence of contrast media use and adverse events that occur in horses, with added contribution from other veterinary species and studies in man for comparison. This comprehensive data set empowers equine clinicians to develop use and monitoring strategies when working with contrast media. Finally, it summarises the current state-of-the-art and highlights the potential applications of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for assessment of diseased or injured equine tissues, as well as (patho)physiological processes.

AB  - This is the author's third revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 250 new references from 135 different journals. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unrefereed article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by the concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society, and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Abstract Bone repair after trauma or surgical intervention involves a tightly regulated cascade of events that starts with hemostasis and an inflammatory response, which are critical for successful healing. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are routinely prescribed for pain relief despite their potential inhibitory effect on bone repair. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of administration of the non-selective NSAID diclofenac in the inflammatory phase of bone repair in mice with or without lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. Repair of femoral window defects was characterized using micro computed tomography imaging and histological analyses at 2 weeks postoperative. The data indicate (a) impaired bone regeneration associated with reduced osteoblast, osteoclast, and macrophage activity; (b) changes in the number, activity, and distribution of mast cells in regenerating bone; and (c) impaired angiogenesis due to a direct toxic effect of diclofenac on vascular endothelial cells. The results of this study provide strong evidence to support the conjecture that administration of NSAIDs in the first 2 weeks after orthopaedic surgery disrupts the healing cascade and exacerbates the negative effects of systemic inflammation on the repair process.

Methods: Medical records for 23 cats diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations available were reviewed. Three groups were compared; cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations 2·0 to 6·8 µg/l (group A), 6·9 to 11·9 µg/l (group B) and ≥12·0 µg/l (group C). Results: Sixteen of the 23 cats had increased serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations; 9 cats in group B and 7 cats in group C. The remaining seven cats were in group A. Cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations ≥12·0 µg/l had significantly lower median serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations. No significant differences were identified between the three groups for age, serum alanine amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, feline inflammatory bowel disease clinical disease activity index, pancreatic ultrasound findings, intestinal histopathology scores, clinical outcome, treatment or clinical response. Clinical Significance: Hypoalbuminaemia and hypocobalaminaemia were more frequently observed in cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations ≥12·0 µg/l.

The overall objectives of the meeting were to expand ideas, approaches, and collaborations for members of the society by bringing together experts in disciplines relevant to pigment cell research and associated diseases such as melanoma, albinoism, vitiligo, and other diseases of pigment cells. The meeting focused on recent developments in the genetics, novel gene function, gene expression pattern, and post-transcriptional processing of melanocyte specific proteins, melanosome function, melanin structure, and implications of recent basic advances for understanding human pigmentary diseases. These areas have been particularly productive due to recent breakthroughs and rapid progress in microarray gene expression, mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and other physical chemical and molecular biotechnologies.

AB  - Abstract The contemporary concept of evaluation of risks with humans caused by xenobiotics in food is critically reviewed. In this context it is pointed out that epidemiologic studies, in most cases, give little reliable evidence only. Mankind's risk factors are of a multi-dimensional composition, depending on genetic aspects and the differring health and nutrition statuses of the individuals. This leads to an enormously wide scope of variations in the individual sensitivity to xenobiotics. Contemporary knowledge leaves the question open, whether predisposed population groups are always sufficiently protected by the level of the permissible amount of xenobiotics.

AB  - The genes encoding the ionotropic N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1a, NR2B and NR2D were cloned in the multi-copy yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors pMB01 and pMB02. The protease-deficient yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cl3-ABYS-86 (leu?, ura?, his?) was transformed with the recombinant plasmids pMBNR1a (leu+), pMBNR1a/pMBNR2D (ura+), pMBNR1a/pMBNR2D/pMBNR2B (his+) or pMBNR1a/pMBNR2A/pMBNR2B, respectively, and was used to express the different NMDA receptor subunit genes. Western-blotting analysis with the specific NMDA receptor antibodies showed a clear but differently strong expression of the recombinant receptor proteins which were found to be only partially glycosylated in the cell membranes of the recombinant yeast strains. By immunofluorescence microscopy using the specific subunit antibodies and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies, the distinctly expressed NR1a and NR2D subunits could be located in the plasma membrane of the transformed yeast cells. Pharmacological characterization of crude membrane preparations of the recombinant yeast cells expressing 1?3 NMDA receptor subunits showed saturable binding of the glycine antagonist [3H]MDL105,519 with different Kd values of 56.88?±?5.38 nM (NR1a), 1365.11?±?76 nM (NR1a/NR2D), 22.97?±?3.37 nM for NR1a/NR2B/NR2D and 7.4?±?1.2 nM for NR1a/NR2A/NR2B. The bound capacities were 13.07?±?0.92 (NR1a), 14.63?±?0.50 (NR1a/NR2D), 12.85?±?1.68 (NR1a/NR2B/NR2D) and 8.3?±?0.7 (NR1a/NR2A/NR2B) pmol/mg membrane protein. The [3H]MDL105,519 binding was inhibited by the glycine antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenate (DCKA), ethyl-2-carboxy-4.6-dichloro-3-indoleacetate (ECDI) and itself, but not by glycine, D-serine and 1-amino-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACPC). Each of these recombinant receptor proteins consisting both of NR1 and NR2 subunits also showed a specific binding site for the NMDA agonist glutamate when using L-[3H]glutamate as a radioligand. Analysis of saturation experiments revealed that this ligand binds to a specific site with Kd values of 536?±?43, 688?±?60, and 856?±?48?nM for NR1a/NR2B, NR1a/NR2D, and NR1a/NR2B/NR2D respectively.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) occurs in ≤12% of pediatric recipients of liver transplantation (LT). Known complications of PVT include portal hypertension, allograft loss, and mortality. The management of PVT is varied. A single-center, case-control study of pediatric LT recipients with portal vein (PV) changes after LT was performed. Cases were categorized as early PVT (if PVT was detected within 30 days of transplantation) or late PVT (if PVT was detected more than 30 days after transplantation or if early PVT persisted beyond 30 days). Two non-PVT control patients were matched on the basis of the recipient weight, transplant indication, and allograft type to each patient with PVT. Thirty-two of the 415 LT recipients (7.7%) received 37 allografts and developed PVT. In comparison with control patients, a higher proportion of patients with PVT had PVT present before LT (13.3% versus 0%, P = 0.01). Patients with early PVT usually returned to the operating room, and 9 of 15 patients (60%) had PV flow restored. Patients with late PVT had lower white blood cell (4.9 [1000/?L] versus 6.8 [1000/?L], P < 0.01) and platelet counts (140 [1000/?L] versus 259 [1000/?L], P < 0.01), an elevated international normalized ratio (1.2 versus 1.0, P < 0.001), and more gastrointestinal bleeding (25% versus 8.3%, P = 0.03) compared to controls. Patients with PVT were also less frequently at the expected grade level (52% versus 88%, P < 0.001). The patient survival rates were 84%, 78%, and 78% and 91%, 84%, and 79% for cases and controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The allograft survival rates were 90%, 80%, and 80% for cases and 94%, 89%, and 87% for controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. In conclusion, patients with early and late PVT had preserved allograft function, and there was no impact on mortality. Patients diagnosed with early PVT often underwent operative interventions with successful restoration of flow. Patients diagnosed with late PVT experienced variceal bleeding, and some required portosystemic shunting procedures. Academic delays were also more common. In late PVT, the clinical presentation dictates care because the optimal management algorithm has not yet been determined. Multi-institutional studies are needed to confirm these findings and improve patient outcomes. Liver Transpl 19:315?321, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

AB  - Our aims are to review animal models of tauopathies, which include a number of brain disorders with various aetiologies, including ageing, genetics, infectious diseases, toxins, trauma and other unknown factors. Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of filaments of the microtubule-associated tau protein. The different aetiopathogeneses and distinct molecular events involved in tau aggregation have led to the development of various animal models for these diseases. In this review, rather than listing all current models, we focus on specific animal models addressing, among others, the question of tau hyperphosphorylation, tau aggregation and tau spreading. Physiological conditions, including normal ageing and hibernation, may exhibit tau phosphorylation and some aspects of tauopathies. However, most of the models of tauopathies involve genetically modified animals (mostly rodents, but also fruit fly, zebrafish and worm). Some of these models have been crucial for the development of therapeutic approaches in humans. The present review shows the difficulty in pinpointing a specific mechanism that may be targeted in tauopathies but also opens up new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Abstract Some nuclear-encoded proteins are imported into higher plant plastids via the endomembrane (EM) system. Compared with multi-protein Toc and Tic translocons required for most plastid protein import, the relatively uncomplicated nature of EM trafficking led to suggestions that it was the original transport mechanism for nuclear-encoded endosymbiont proteins, and critical for the early stages of plastid evolution. Its apparent simplicity disappears, however, when EM transport is considered in light of selective constraints likely encountered during the conversion of stable endosymbionts into fully integrated organelles. From this perspective it is more parsimonious to presume the early evolution of post-translational protein import via simpler, ancestral forms of modern Toc and Tic plastid translocons, with EM trafficking arising later to accommodate glycosylation and/or protein targeting to multiple cellular locations. This hypothesis is supported by both empirical and comparative data, and is consistent with the relative paucity of EM-based transport to modern primary plastids.

AB  - Symmetrical alopecia in dogs can be a clinical presentation that is frustrating to address in daily practice. A complete work-up should include evaluating the breed characteristics, taking a complete history and carrying out a complete physical and dermatological evaluation. A list of differential diagnoses should help to decide which diagnostic tests should be performed to rule out ectoparasites, infections, endocrine disorders and follicular disorders. The treatment options should be discussed with the owners because, for some alopecic conditions, e.g. follicular dysplasia, there may be no effective therapy and the alopecia may be just a cosmetic disorder.

AB  - Summary Background During 2016?2018, 15 critically ill neonatal foals with acute respiratory distress associated with Chlamydia psittaci infection were presented to three referral hospitals in New South Wales. Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with the development of neonatal respiratory disease. Objectives To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C. psittaci infection in neonatal foals. Study design Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C. psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. Results Thirteen foals with C. psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36 h of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of nonsurviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C. psittaci was achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). Main limitations Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C. psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. Conclusions Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and a personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection.

AB  - A multi-institutional study ?Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth? (PDAY) was initiated to document the natural history of atherosclerosis, its relationship to risk factors, and pathobiology of lesion development in young subjects. Pathology laboratories in nine centers collected arteries and tissues from over 2000 persons from 15 through 34 years of age whose deaths were attributed to homicides, accidents, or suicides. Arteries were evaluated for lesions, and risk factors were analyzed in a central laboratory. Postmortem risk factors included serum lipoproteins, serum thio-cyanate (smoking), glycohemoglobin (diabetes), thickness of panniculus adiposus (obesity), small renal artery changes (hypertension) and apoprotein isoforms. This study documents the development of atherosclerosis at an early age. It also shows that the recognized risk factors for coronary heart disease are associated with lesion development in the arteries of these young subjects. The PDAY study has a counterpart in Japan where the development of atherosclerosis has been studied in young subjects. This Japanese study, in a population in which coronary heart disease has not yet become a major epidemic, has findings quite similar to the findings from the PDAY study. Studies of atherosclerosis in both Japan and the USA provide strong justification for reducing risk factors in young persons.
