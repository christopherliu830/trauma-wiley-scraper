AB  - Bone degenerative diseases are on the increase globally and are often problematic to treat. This has led to a demand to identify supplements that aid bone growth and formation. Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral food supplement, derived from the red algae Lithothamnion species which contains calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. It has been previously reported to increase bone formation and mineralisation. This study aimed to investigate the 28 day in vitro osteogenic response of Aquamin supplemented with Vitamin D. The osteogenic potential of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells was analysed in standard osteogenic medium supplemented with Aquamin +/? Vitamin D3, and the controls consisted of osteogenic medium, +/? Vitamin D3. Proliferation of osteoblasts, metabolic activity and cell viability did not differ between Aquamin and the osteogenic control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and mineralisation were increased by the supplementation of Aquamin, and the addition of Vitamin D3 increased mineralisation for all groups. The combination of Aquamin and Vitamin D3 yielded a significant increase in ALP and mineralisation over Aquamin alone and the standard osteogenic control +/? Vitamin D3. This study demonstrates that Aquamin aids osteogenesis, and that its osteogenic response can be enhanced by combining Aquamin with Vitamin D3. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Accurate and timely identification of anaerobic bacteria is critical to successful treatment. Classic phenotypic methods for identification require long turnaround times and can exhibit poor species level identification. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is an identification method that can provide rapid identification of anaerobes. We present a multi-centre study assessing the clinical performance of the VITEK? MS in the identification of anaerobic bacteria. Five different test sites analysed a collection of 651 unique anaerobic isolates comprising 11 different genera. Multiple species were included for several of the genera. Briefly, anaerobic isolates were applied directly to a well of a target plate. Matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry. Mass spectra results were generated with the VITEK? MS, and the comparative spectral analysis and organism identification were determined using the VITEK? MS database 2.0. Results were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 651 isolates analysed, 91.2% (594/651) exhibited the correct species identification. An additional eight isolates were correctly identified to genus level, raising the rate of identification to 92.5%. Genus-level identification consisted of Actinomyces, Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces neuii and Bacteroides uniformis were notable for an increased percentage of no-identification results compared with the other anaerobes tested. VITEK? MS identification of clinically relevant anaerobes is highly accurate and represents a dramatic improvement over other phenotypic methods in accuracy and turnaround time.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia in adult patients with traumatic brain injury is not fully understood. The historical use of therapeutic hypothermia at extreme temperatures was associated with severe complications and led to it being discredited. Positive results from animal studies using milder temperatures led to renewed interest. However, recent studies have not convincingly demonstrated the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia in practice. Aim This review aims to answer the question: in adults with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), does the use of therapeutic hypothermia compared with normothermia affect neurological outcome? Design Systematic review. Method Four major electronic databases were searched, and a hand search was undertaken using selected key search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The studies were appraised using a systematic approach, and four themes addressing the research question were identified and critically evaluated. Results A total of eight peer-reviewed studies were found, and the results show there is some evidence that therapeutic hypothermia may be effective in improving neurological outcome in adult patients with traumatic brain injury. However, the majority of the trials report conflicting results. Therapeutic hypothermia is reported to be effective at lowering intracranial pressure; however, its efficacy in improving neurological outcome is not fully demonstrated. This review suggests that therapeutic hypothermia had increased benefits in patients with haematoma-type injuries as opposed to those with diffuse injury and contusions. It also suggests that cooling should recommence if rebound intracranial hypertension is observed. Conclusion Although the data indicates a trend towards better neurological outcome and reduced mortality rates, higher quality multi-centred randomized controlled trials are required before therapeutic hypothermia is implemented as a standard adjuvant therapy for treating traumatic brain injury. Relevance to clinical practice Therapeutic hypothermia can have a positive impact on patient outcome, but more research is required.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury can cause extensive damage to the white matter (WM) of the brain. These disruptions can be especially damaging in children, whose brains are still maturing. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the most commonly used method to assess WM organization, but it has limited resolution to differentiate causes of WM disruption. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) yields spectra showing the levels of neurometabolites that can indicate neuronal/axonal health, inflammation, membrane proliferation/turnover, and other cellular processes that are on-going post-injury. Previous analyses on this dataset revealed a significant division within the msTBI patient group, based on interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT); one subgroup of patients (TBI-normal) showed evidence of recovery over time, while the other showed continuing degeneration (TBI-slow). We combined dMRI with MRS to better understand WM disruptions in children with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI). Tracts with poorer WM organization, as shown by lower FA and higher MD and RD, also showed lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal and axonal health and myelination. We did not find lower NAA in tracts with normal WM organization. Choline, a marker of inflammation, membrane turnover, or gliosis, did not show such associations. We further show that multi-modal imaging can improve outcome prediction over a single modality, as well as over earlier cognitive function measures. Our results suggest that demyelination plays an important role in WM disruption post-injury in a subgroup of msTBI children and indicate the utility of multi-modal imaging.

AB  - Abstract A natural history study was conducted in 142 Thalassemic (Thal), 199 transfused Sickle Cell Disease (Tx-SCD, n = 199), and 64 non-Tx-SCD subjects to describe the frequency of iron-related morbidity and mortality. Subjects recruited from 31 centers in the US, Canada or the UK were similar with respect to age (overall: 25 ± 11 years, mean ± SD) and gender (52% female). We found that Tx-SCD subjects were hospitalized more frequently compared with Thal or non-Tx-SCD (P < 0.001). Among those hospitalized, Tx-SCD adult subjects were more likely to be unemployed compared with Thal (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0?2.5) or non-Tx-SCD (RR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.3?7.3). There was a positive relationship between the severity of iron overload, assessed by serum ferritin, and the frequency of hospitalizations (r= 0.20; P = 0.009). Twenty-three deaths were reported (6 Thal, 17 Tx-SCD) in 23.5 ± 10 months of follow-up. Within the Tx-SCD group, those who died began transfusion (25.3 vs. 12.4 years, P < 0.001) and chelation therapy later (26.8 vs. 14.2 years, P = 0.01) compared with those who survived. The unadjusted death rate in Thal was lower (2.2/100 person years) compared with that in Tx-SCD (7.0/100 person years; RR = 0.38: 95% CI 0.12?0.99). However, no difference was observed when age at death was considered. Despite improvements in therapy, death rate in this contemporary sample of transfused adult subjects with Thal or SCD is 3 times greater than the general US population. Long term follow-up of this unique cohort of subjects will be helpful in further defining the relationship of chronic, heavy iron overload to morbidity and mortality. Am. J.

AB  - Cellular interaction with biomaterials determines the fate of the implant. Naturally derived biomaterials such as small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and renal capsule matrix (RCM) may provide optimal structure and composition for cellular repopulation in certain wound healing applications. Porcine renal capsule matrix (RCM) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix undergoing characterization and preclinical investigation for the treatment of soft tissue injury. Early studies have demonstrated that RCM constructs induce host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. RCM consists primarily of collagen, although the other proteins have been detected, including the growth factors basic FGF, VEGF, and CTGF. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to envision the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that RCM is a dense, heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse following lyophilization, much of the native structure seen in the hydrated isolate is preserved. These differences are maintained following rehydration in normal saline. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture likely facilitates host interaction at the cellular level. Further compositional characterization is under way. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated, West Lafayette, IN.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives The increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and the consequent progression to cirrhosis is expected to become a major cause of liver transplantation. This will exacerbate the organ donor shortage and mean that ?marginal? fatty liver grafts are more frequently used. Autofluorescence spectroscopy is a fast, objective, and non-destructive method to detect change in the endogenous fluorophores distribution and could prove to be a valuable tool for NAFLD diagnosis and transplant graft assessment. Materials and Methods A system was constructed consisting of a fibre probe with two laser diodes that provided excitation light at 375 and 405?nm, and an imaging spectrograph system. This was used to distinguish fluorescence spectra acquired from the harvested livers from mice with NAFLD of differing severity (healthy, mild steatotic and steatohepatitic). The fluorescence data were entered into a sparse multiclass probabilistic algorithm for disease classification. Histopathology, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and alanine transaminase (ALT) assays were conducted in addition to the fluorescence measurements Results TBARS and ALT assays enabled differentiation of the steatohepatitic group from the mild steatosis and control groups (P?≤?0.028) but failed to separate the mild steatotic group from the control group. The three groups were all clearly differentiated from each other using fluorescence spectroscopy, and classification accuracy was found to be 95%. Conclusion Fluorescence spectroscopy appears to be a promising approach for the analysis of diseased liver tissue. Lasers Surg. Med. 43:392?400, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Although myocardial injury can be a significant component of multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in association with septicemia in critically ill human patients, it is as yet an undefined clinical entity in equine septicemia. With septicemia as the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of MODS will be important in further improving survival rates. We designed a prospective study to establish normal ranges for cardiac troponin I (cTnI), T (cTnT) and CKMB mass in healthy 24?48 hour old foals, as well as septicemic neonatal foals seen over a 2-year period in a teaching hospital. We also performed a comparison of these biomarkers in surviving and non-surviving septicemic foals. Sepsis was judged on the basis of the presence of any of the 3 following criteria: blood culture positive at admission, admission sepsis score ≥11, or 3 or more sites of infection during hospitalization in foals ≤14 days of age. cTnI was measured by the ACCESS? (Beckman Coulter), cTnT was measured using the Elecsys 2010? Immunoassay (Roche), and CKMB mass measurements were performed using the Elecsys 2010?. Each parameter was described using range and 95th and 50th percentile. Comparisons were made for each parameter between normal and septic foals as well as surviving and non-surviving septic foals using the non-parametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Significance was set at p<0.05. There were 52 control foals and 38 septic foals of which 22 survived. Significant differences were documented for CKMB between septicemic and normal foals, but not for cTnT or cTnI. However, CKMB and cTnT were significantly lower in surviving versus non-surviving septicemic foals. The 50th and 95th percentiles alongside the ranges for the normal foal population were 0.14, 0.49, (0.01?0.51)??g/L for cTnI, 0.009, 0.03, (0.009?0.04)??g/L for cTnT and 2.3, 7.4, (0.4?9.3)??g/L for CKMB. Our findings suggest that myocardial injury is a component of MODS during septicemia in foals, and that quantitatively significant increases in CKMB and cTnT are seen in non-surviving septicemic foals versus survivors.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare demographics and disease characteristics in dogs in which peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) had been diagnosed and report outcomes after surgical treatment (ST) or conservative treatment (CT). Study design Retrospective study. Sample population One hundred twenty-eight dogs (91 ST, 37 CT) in which PPDH had been diagnosed. Methods Medical records were reviewed for demographics, perioperative findings, and outcomes. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and email correspondence with owners and referring veterinarians. Baseline variables were compared between treatment groups. Results Dogs treated surgically were younger (P < .001), more likely to be sexually intact (P = .002), more likely to have clinical signs from PPDH vs an incidental diagnosis (P < .001), and more likely to have other congenital abnormalities (P = .003) compared with dogs treated conservatively. Ninety-seven percent of ST dogs were discharged from hospitals. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were reported in 22% and 41% of dogs, respectively, although most complications were classified as low grade (75% and 83%, respectively). Follow-up was available in 87 dogs, at a median of 1062?days. Hernia recurrence was not reported in any surgically treated dog. The deaths of nine dogs (five ST, four CT) could be attributed to PPDH, and long median survival times were observed in both the ST and CT groups (8.2 and 5?years, respectively). Conclusion Preoperative characteristics differed between dogs treated conservatively vs surgically. Surgical treatment was associated with low operative mortality, and both ST and CT dogs had good long-term survival. Clinical significance A diagnosis of PPDH can confer a good long-term prognosis for both ST and CT dogs.

AB  - Wounding of Norway spruce by inoculation with sterile agar, or agar containing the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica, induced traumatic resin duct formation in the stem. Visible anatomical responses occurred in the cambium 6?9 d post-inoculation. Near the inoculation site cellular proliferation, polyphenolic accumulation, and lignification were induced as a wound reaction to seal the damaged area. Five centimetres from the inoculation site cells in the cambial zone swelled and divided to form clusters. By 18 d post-inoculation, these cells began to differentiate into resin duct epithelial cells surrounding incipient schizogenous lumens. Mature axial traumatic ducts appeared by 36 d as a row of ducts in the xylem centripetal to the cambium. The ducts formed an interconnected network continuous with radial resin ducts. Parenchyma cells surrounding the ducts accumulated polyphenols that disappeared as the cells differentiated into tracheids. These polyphenols appeared to contain fewer sugar residues compared to those accumulating in the secondary phloem, as indicated by the periodic acid?Schiff's staining. The epithelial cells did not accumulate polyphenols but contained immunologically detectable phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.5), indicating synthesis of phenolics as a possible resin component. These findings may represent a defense mechanism in Norway spruce against the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica.

AB  - Abstract Bone grafts are an important part of orthopaedic surgeon's armamentarium. Despite well-established bone-grafting techniques, large bone defects still represent a challenge. Efforts have therefore been made to develop osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic bone-replacement systems. The long-term clinical goal in bone tissue engineering is to reconstruct bony tissue in an anatomically functional three-dimensional morphology. Current bone tissue engineering strategies take into account that bone is known for its ability to regenerate following injury, and for its intrinsic capability to re-establish a complex hierarchical structure during regeneration. Although the tissue engineering of bone for the reconstruction of small to moderate sized bone defects technically feasible, the reconstruction of large defects remains a daunting challenge. The essential steps towards optimized clinical application of tissue-engineered bone are dependent upon recent advances in the area of neovascularization of the engineered construct. Despite these recent advances, however, a gap from bench to bedside remains; this may ultimately be bridged by a closer collaboration between basic scientists and reconstructive surgeons. The aim of this review is to introduce the basic principles of tissue engineering of bone, outline the relevant bone physiology, and discuss the recent concepts for the induction of vascularization in engineered bone tissue. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - An improved understanding and characterization of glial activation and its relationship with white matter injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination after brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public healthcare burden and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Particularly, traumatic white matter (WM) injury or traumatic axonal injury has been reported as being associated with patients' poor outcomes. However, there is very limited data reporting the importance of glial activation after TBI and its interaction with WM injury. This article presents a systematic review of traumatic WM injury and the associated glial activation, from basic science to clinical diagnosis and prognosis, from advanced neuroimaging perspective. It concludes that there is a disconnection between WM injury research and the essential role of glia which serve to restore a healthy environment for axonal regeneration following WM injury. Particularly, there is a significant lack of non-invasive means to characterize the complex pathophysiology of WM injury and glial activation in both animal models and in humans. An improved understanding and characterization of the relationship between glia and WM injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3 years (range: 54?75 years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma n = 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) n = 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma n = 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5 years (range: 51?69 years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

AB  - Background and Objective Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by oral bacterial infection, is considered to be a risk factor for systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus, bacterial pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin against periodontal inflammation-induced multiple organ injury in rats. Material and Methods Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups of six rats each: control; lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and LPS + melatonin. During the experimental period (10 d) all rats in the LPS and LPS + melatonin groups were given 10 ?L of LPS (from a 10 mg/mL standard solution of LPS dissolved in saline) on days 1, 3 and 5. The rats in the LPS + melatonin group were given 50 mg/kg of melatonin, daily for 10 d, starting on day 1 after the administration of LPS. All rats were killed at the end of the experimental period. Liver, kidney and lung tissues were removed for investigation by light microscopy. Results The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in the LPS group compared with the LPS + melatonin group (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the serum creatinine levels in the groups. However, the changes in serum AST, ALT and BUN levels in the experimental groups did not correlate with changes in histological data. Both LPS and LPS + melatonin groups displayed structural features similar to those of the control group. Conclusion The results revealed that increased serum AST, ALT and BUN levels following periodontitis are ameliorated with melatonin treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY This paper presents the computational modeling of a variety of flow-diverting stents, deployed in a number of patient-specific aneurysm geometries. We consider virtual device deployment and hemodynamics as well as thrombus formation, with the scope to assess pre-operatively the efficacy of specific devices in treating particular aneurysms. An algorithm based on a linear and torsional spring analogy is developed for the fast virtual deployment of stents and similar minimally invasive devices in patient-specific vessel geometries. The virtual deployment algorithm is used to accurately deploy a total of four stent designs in three aneurysm geometries. A variety of different flow-diverting stent designs, representing the commercially available and the entirely novel, are presented, varying in both mesh design and porosity. Transient computational hemodynamics simulations are performed on multiple patient-specific geometries to predict the reduction in aneurysm inflow after the deployment of each device. Further, a thrombosis initiation and growth model is implemented, coupled with the hemodynamic computations. Hemodynamic simulations show large variations in flow reduction between devices and across different aneurysm geometries. The industry standard of flow-diverters with 70% porosity, assumed to offer the best compromise in flexibility and flow reduction, is challenged in at least one aneurysm geometry.

AB  - Background The aims of this study were to assess the activity of the human fetal atrial natriuretic peptide system in hypertensive pregnancies with and without signs of increased fetal systemic venous pressure and to investigate the association between severe placental insufficiency and fetal myocardial cell destruction. Method Control group consisted of 50 newborns with uncomplicated pregnancy and labor. In group 1, 22 newborns after hypertensive pregnancies were included. Doppler ultrasonography revealed abnormal umbilical artery (UA) blood velocity waveform in five cases, and normal nonpulsatile umbilical vein (UV) blood velocity profile in every case. Group 2 consisted of five newborns after pregnancies complicated by maternal hypertensive disorder. Atrial pulsations in the UV and retrograde diastolic blood velocity pattern in the UA were detected in every case. Immediately after birth blood samples were collected from the UA and plasma N-terminal peptide of proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and serum cardiac specific troponin-T concentrations were measured. Results In group 1, nt-proANP concentrations were higher (P?<?0.001) than in the control group. In group 1, newborns with abnormal UA blood velocity pattern had higher (P?<?0.006) NT-proANP concentrations than newborns with normal UA Doppler findings. Troponin-T concentrations in group 1 did not differ from the control group. In group 2, NT-proANP (P?<?0.002) and troponin-T (P?<?0.0001) concentrations were higher than in the control group and study group 1. Conclusion Maternal hypertensive disorder stimulates fetal atrial natriuretic peptide production, being greatest in fetuses with severe placental insufficiency and a rise in systemic venous pressure. These fetuses also have evidence of myocardial cell destruction.
