AB  - Background:? Muscle disuse atrophy is observed in patients recovering from trauma and there is an increased risk and severity of injury in patients abusing alcohol (EtOH). However, the interaction of EtOH and disuse on muscle protein balance has not been examined. Therefore, the present study addressed the hypothesis that EtOH accelerates the disuse atrophy and/or impairs the accretion of muscle protein during muscle recovery. Methods:? To address this aim, disuse atrophy was induced in rats by 3?days of unilateral hindlimb immobilization (casting), using the contralateral leg as control, with EtOH or saline being orally gavaged twice, each day during this period. In a separate study, EtOH-treated rats received Velcade to inhibit proteasomal degradation. Finally, in the last study, rats had 1 limb casted for 5?days, the cast removed, and EtOH or saline gavaged twice daily during a 5-day recovery period. Muscle protein metabolism was assessed using surrogate markers of protein synthesis [i.e., phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (BP1) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)] and protein degradation (i.e., mRNA content of the ubiquitin E3 ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1). Results:? Ethanol alone did not decrease muscle weight in the uncasted muscle. However, the loss of mass of immobilized muscle from EtOH-gavaged rats was 80% greater than in the animals not receiving EtOH. This atrophic response was not associated with a change in Akt, 4E-BP1 or S6K1 phosphorylation among groups. In contrast, immobilization alone increased both atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNA, and EtOH further increased their expression in immobilized muscle. The proteasome inhibitor Velcade attenuated atrophy produced by EtOH?+?disuse. When administered during the recovery period, EtOH prevented the normal accretion of muscle mass. This EtOH effect was associated with increased atrogin-1 mRNA, a reduction in 4E-BP1 and S6 phosphorylation, and an increased AMP-activated kinase phosphorylation. Conclusions:? Based on the changes in these surrogate markers, our data suggest that EtOH accelerates disuse atrophy by stimulating ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and blunts repletion of muscle protein during recovery from disuse by increasing proteolysis and decreasing protein synthesis.

AB  - Abstract This study was aimed to compare the subjective and objective nutritional assessments and to analyse the performance of subjective global assessment (SGA) of nutritional status in diagnosing undernutrition in paediatric patients. One hundred and forty children (aged 2?12 years) hospitalized consecutively in Tabriz Paediatric Hospital from June 2008 to August 2008 underwent subjective assessment using the SGA questionnaire and objective assessment, including anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Agreement between two assessment methods was analysed by the kappa (?) statistic. Statistical indicators including (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, error rates, accuracy, powers, likelihood ratios and odds ratio) between SGA and objective assessment method were determined. The overall prevalence of undernutrition according to the SGA (70.7%) was higher than that by objective assessment of nutritional status (48.5%). Agreement between the two evaluation methods was only fair to moderate (??=?0.336, P?<?0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the SGA method for screening undernutrition in this population were 88.235%, 45.833%, 60.606% and 80.487%, respectively. Accuracy, positive and negative power of the SGA method were 66.428%, 56.074% and 41.25%, respectively. Likelihood ratio positive, likelihood ratio negative and odds ratio of the SGA method were 1.628, 0.256 and 6.359, respectively. Our findings indicated that in assessing nutritional status of children, there is not a good level of agreement between SGA and objective nutritional assessment. In addition, SGA is a highly sensitive tool for assessing nutritional status and could identify children at risk of developing undernutrition.

AB  - Chronic pain is a widely recognised problem in humans and is being increasingly recognised as a significant problem in dogs. Whilst a large number of therapies are described and utilised to treat chronic pain in dogs, there is a severe shortage of evidence to guide practitioners in selection of treatments. Until more evidence becomes available, practitioners should adopt a cautious approach, utilising licensed treatments first when possible. Non-pharmacological therapies should be incorporated into the chronic pain management plan whenever possible. Given the probable prevalence of chronic pain in dogs there is an urgent need for research to identify effective treatments.

AB  - Symmetrical alopecia in dogs can be a clinical presentation that is frustrating to address in daily practice. A complete work-up should include evaluating the breed characteristics, taking a complete history and carrying out a complete physical and dermatological evaluation. A list of differential diagnoses should help to decide which diagnostic tests should be performed to rule out ectoparasites, infections, endocrine disorders and follicular disorders. The treatment options should be discussed with the owners because, for some alopecic conditions, e.g. follicular dysplasia, there may be no effective therapy and the alopecia may be just a cosmetic disorder.

AB  - Cartilage is one of the most essential tissues for healthy joint function and is compromised in degenerative and traumatic joint diseases. There have been tremendous advances during the past decade using quantitative MRI techniques as a noninvasive tool for evaluating cartilage, with a focus on assessing cartilage degeneration during osteoarthritis (OA). In this review, after a brief overview of cartilage composition and degeneration, we discuss techniques that grade and quantify morphologic changes as well as the techniques that quantify changes in the extracellular matrix. The basic principles, in vivo applications, advantages, and challenges for each technique are discussed. Recent studies using the OA Initiative (OAI) data are also summarized. Quantitative MRI provides noninvasive measures of cartilage degeneration at the earliest stages of joint degeneration, which is essential for efforts toward prevention and early intervention in OA.

AB  - Abstract Clinical Development Phases I-III Regulatory, Quality, Manufacturing Thrombosis as a clinical phenotype is ubiquitous in human diseases and conditions, ranging from atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders to trauma, surgery, malignancy, infections, blood dyscrasias, auto-immunity, and complications of pregnancy. While each condition carries its own distinct signature and predisposition for thrombosis as a nonphysiological event, there are several common themes that center on cellular and noncellular elements, including well-characterized coagulation proteases. Over the past decade, our group has been actively involved with the development of a factor IXa inhibitor, pegnivacogin, and its complementary antidote or control agent, anivamersen. The following review provides a summary of fundamental constructs, milestones, and the current status of our translational journey.

AB  - Objective:? Many anti-stigma programmes use the ?mental illness is an illness like any other? approach. This review evaluates the effectiveness of this approach in relation to schizophrenia. Method:? The academic literature was searched, via PsycINFO and MEDLINE, to identify peer-reviewed studies addressing whether public espousal of a biogenetic paradigm has increased over time, and whether biogenetic causal beliefs and diagnostic labelling are associated with less negative attitudes. Results:? The public, internationally, continues to prefer psychosocial to biogenetic explanations and treatments for schizophrenia. Biogenetic causal theories and diagnostic labelling as ?illness?, are both positively related to perceptions of dangerousness and unpredictability, and to fear and desire for social distance. Conclusion:? An evidence-based approach to reducing discrimination would seek a range of alternatives to the ?mental illness is an illness like any other? approach, based on enhanced understanding, from multi-disciplinary research, of the causes of prejudice.

AB  - Summary In humans, the process of olfaction begins when volatile molecules enter the nasal cavity and activate receptors in the olfactory epithelium (OE). The olfactory receptor (OR) proteins are located in hair-like projections of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Activation of the olfactory receptor (OR) proteins sets in chain a complex sequence of biochemical reactions. The signals from the OR cells responding to odorants and their metabolites are picked up by the olfactory bulb (OB). The signal patterns leaving the OB then travel to the piriform cortex (PC). Output from the PC goes to various other brain regions and, combined with other inputs, is eventually interpreted as an odour percept in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This chapter describes the human olfaction process in the simplified above-described sequence, and compares the process with that found in other species. It also discusses second messenger cascade and anosmia.

Outcome Postoperative complications occurred due to unusually large volume ileostomy output in the subsequent 4 weeks, resulting in severe volume depletion and the sequelae that required intensive care support. These were triggered and prolonged by two episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis. Conclusions Sepsis-induced high ileostomy output following intestinal resection for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia is a serious complication. Early restoration of intestinal continuity following bowel resection for established infarction may prevent this complication.

One client-owned castrated male goat. Results? An 8-month-old Pygmy cross wether was admitted for urolithiasis and PU stricture. After repeated unsuccessful attempts at urethrostomy reversal and urethral reconstruction, a buccal mucosal graft was used for urethroplasty. Buccal mucosa proved to be an excellent graft for urethral repair. Normal urination has occurred through the reconstructed region for at least 24 months. Conclusions? Buccal mucosa worked well as a graft for urethroplasty and PU reversal. Clinical Relevance? Grafting with buccal mucosa may also prove useful in other urethral repair techniques in small ruminants.

AB  - Summary. Successful percutaneous liver biopsy was carried out on 12 multi-transfused haemophiliacs from the Manchester area with persistently abnormal liver function tests. Only one patient showed evidence of chronic active hepatitis with progression to active micronodular cirrhosis although a further four patients showed some evidence of mild chronic active hepatitis. This represents a much lower incidence of severe histological liver damage than many previous reports and implies that liver biopsy in asymptomatic haemophiliacs may not be indicated as a routine procedure, particularly in the absence of proven therapy. Dynamic liver function tests may prove to be a useful indicator of deteriorating liver function in the otherwise asymptomatic haemophiliac.

AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Background and Purpose (R,S)-ketamine produces rapid and significant antidepressant effects in approximately 65% of patients suffering from treatment-resistant bipolar depression (BD). The genetic, pharmacological and biochemical differences between ketamine responders and non-responders have not been identified. The purpose of this study was to employ a metabolomics approach, a global, non-targeted determination of endogenous metabolic patterns, to identify potential markers of ketamine response and non-response. Experimental Approach Plasma samples from 22 BD patients were analyzed to produce metabolomic patterns. The patients had received ketamine in a placebo-controlled crossover study and the samples were obtained 230?min post-administration at which time the patients were categorized as responders or non-responders. Matching plasma samples from the placebo arm of the study were also analysed. During the study, the patients were maintained on either lithium or valproate. Key Results The metabolomic patterns were significantly different between the patients maintained on lithium and those maintained on valproate, irrespective of response to ketamine. In the patients maintained on lithium, 18 biomarkers were identified. In responders, lysophosphatidylethanolamines (4) and lysophosphatidylcholines (9) were increased relative to non-responders. Conclusions and Implications The results indicate that the differences between patients who respond to ketamine and those who do not are due to alterations in the mitochondrial ?-oxidation of fatty acids. These differences were not produced by ketamine administration. The data indicate that pretreatment metabolomics screening may be a guide to the prediction of response and a potential approach to the individualization of ketamine therapy.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process, which is not yet completely understood. Satellite cells, the skeletal muscle stem cells, become activated after trauma, proliferate, and migrate to the site of injury. Depending on the severity of the myotrauma, activated satellite cells form new multinucleated myofibers or fuse to damaged myofibers. The specific microenvironment of the satellite cells, the niche, controls their behavior. The niche contains several components that maintain satellite cells quiescence until they are activated. In addition, a great diversity of stimulatory and inhibitory growth factors such as IGF-1 and TGF-?1 regulate their activity. Donor-derived satellite cells are able to improve muscle regeneration, but their migration through the muscle tissue and across endothelial layers is limited. Less than 1% of their progeny, the myoblasts, survive the first days upon intra-muscular injection. However, a range of other multipotent muscle- and non-muscle-derived stem cells are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. These stem cells can occupy the satellite cell niche and show great potential for the treatment of skeletal muscle injuries and diseases. The aim of this review is to discuss the niche factors, growth factors, and other stem cells, which are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. Knowledge about the factors regulating satellite cell activity and skeletal muscle regeneration can be used to improve the treatment of muscle injuries and diseases. J. Cell.

AB  - Objectives To determine if serum cardiac troponin I concentrations ? measured with both a first-generation assay and a high-sensitivity assay ? were greater in dogs with generalised seizures than in controls and to identify clinical variables associated with cardiac troponin I concentration. Materials and Methods Prospective study of 30 dogs with recent generalised seizures and 30 healthy controls. Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was measured using two commercially available assays, and the correlation of clinical factors with concentration was examined. Results Serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I were higher in dogs that had recent seizures compared to controls when measured by both assays. The predictors most clearly associated with cardiac troponin I concentration were number of seizures and age. Both predictors were positively associated with increasing concentrations of troponin I. Clinical Significance Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was significantly elevated in dogs that had recent generalised seizures when compared to controls, and concentrations were higher in dogs that experienced more seizures. This association may indicate that generalised seizures are associated with damage to the myocardium.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of the current literature that examines impulsivity in individuals with eating disorders (ED). Studies were obtained from Embase, Pubmed and Psycinfo, and were included if they assessed impulsivity in individuals over 18 years of age with an ED diagnosis and published in the last 10 years. The methodological quality of the studies was rated. Twelve studies were included in this review, with methodological quality varying across studies. Findings suggest that impulsivity is best assessed multi-modally, with a combination of self-report, behavioural and physiological measures. In general, impulsivity was found to differentiate individuals with EDs from controls, as well as across diagnostic subtypes. The current findings have important clinical implications for our understanding and treatment of both impulsivity and eating disorders.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate efficacy of hypotonic water as adjuvant therapy after marginal resection of canine mast cell tumors (MCT). Study Design? Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized study. Animals? Dogs (n=30) with spontaneous, cutaneous, solitary MCT. Methods? The wound bed of MCT, resected with margins <0.5?cm, was injected with either hypotonic or isotonic water according to a standardized protocol. Follow-up was obtained by clinical examination at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months and annual telephone contact with the owner. Results? Eighteen dogs were treated with isotonic lactated Ringer's solution and 12 dogs with hypotonic distilled water. All MCT were stage 0 tumors and most grade II. Six tumors (4 isotonic, 2 hypotonic) recurred locally, 3 of these dogs died from disease-related reasons within 4 months. The surviving 3 dogs were alive with a median survival time (ST) of 1092 days. The calculated 2-year recurrence-free rate was 92.7%; the 2-year disease-free rate 79.1%; and the 2-year survival rate 89.5%. No significant differences in local recurrence and ST were observed between treatment groups. Histologic grading was the only significant prognosticator for ST and recurrence-free periods. Conclusion? No significant differences in local recurrence and ST were observed between adjunctive hypotonic water and placebo treatment after marginal resection of solitary MCT. Clinical Relevance? Hypotonic water does not decrease the rate of local recurrence in dogs with solitary MCT after marginal surgical excision.

AB  - Abstract The ultimate goal of tissue engineering serves to repair, restore damaged tissue or organ due to accident or disease. In this research, we are aimed at investigating the feasibility of processing cyclic type polylactic acid (PDLLA)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)/hydroxyapatite (HA) biomaterial into tissue engineering scaffold (TES) with variable mechanical properties, well interconnected pore architecture, and controlled hydrophilicity. For this, an in-house built bone scaffold 3D printing (BS3P) system was applied to two biomaterials, namely PDLLA-PCL and HA-PCL. These two biomaterials were produced by optimizing the robotic control system. Morphological investigation by scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed both TES formed by new materials able to show honeycomb-like architectures, excellent fusion at the filament junctions, high uniformity, complete interconnectivity, and controlled channel characteristics of the TES. Compression tests align with the typical behavior of a porous material undergoing deformation. In vitro cell culture study and confocal laser microscopy (CLM) showed enhanced cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. The results demonstrated the eligibility of the BS3P system to produce TES, and the suitability of the new biomaterial scaffolds in enhancing cell biocompatibility.
