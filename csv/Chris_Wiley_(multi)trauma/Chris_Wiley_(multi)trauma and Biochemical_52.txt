AB  - Abstract In classic anatomic atlases, the spinal cord is standardly represented in its anatomical form with symmetrically emerging anterior and posterior roots, which at the level of the intervertebral foramen combine into the spinal nerves. The parts of the cord delimited by the boundaries of the roots are called segments or myelomeres. Associated with their regular repetitive appearance is the notion that the cord is segmentally organized. This segmental view is reinforced by clinical practice. Spinal cord roots innervate specific body parts. The level of cord trauma is diagnosed by the de-innervation symptoms of these parts. However, systemically, the case for a segmentally organized cord is not so clear. To date, developmental and genetic research points to a regionally rather than a segmentally organized cord. In the present study, to what degree the fila radicularia are segmentally implanted along the cord was investigated. The research hypothesis was that if the fila radicularia were non-segmentally implanted at the cord surface, it would be unlikely that the internal neuron stratum would be segmented. The visual segmented aspect of the myelomeres would then be the consequence of the necessary bundling of axons towards the vertebral foramen as the only exits of the vertebral canal, rather than of an underlying segment organization of the cord itself. To investigate the research hypothesis, the fila radicularia in the cervical-upper thoracic part of five spinal cords were detached from their spinal nerves and dissected in detail. The principal research question was if the fila radicularia are separated from their spinal nerves and dissected from their connective tissues up to the cord, would it be possible to reconstruct the original spinal segments from the morphology and interspaces of the fila? The dissections revealed that the anterior fila radicularia emerge from the cord at regular regionally modulated interspaces without systematic segmental delineations. The posterior fila radicularia are somewhat more segmentally implanted, but the pattern is individually inconsistent. The posterior and anterior roots have notable morphological differences, and hypotheses are presented to help explain these. The macroscopic observations are consistent with a regionally but not a segmentally organized cord. This conclusion was visually summarized in photographs of spinal cords with ipsilateral intact roots and contralateral individually dissected fila radicularia. It was suggested that this dual view of the spinal cord be added to the standard anatomic textbooks to counterbalance the current possibly biased view of a segmented cord.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the safety of an intraoperative fluorescein sodium (FS) injection and elucidate the relationships between the MRI findings, pathological diagnoses, and intraoperative staining characteristics of intracranial lesions in 22 dogs. Study Design Prospective case series. Animals Twenty-two dogs with intracranial lesions. Methods FS was intravenously administered to 22 dogs undergoing craniotomy for suspected intracranial tumors to evaluate perioperative and postoperative adverse effects. The intensities and patterns of gadolinium (Gd) enhancement on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative FS staining were graded, and their relationship was evaluated. Intraoperative FS staining characteristics and pathological diagnoses were compared. Results The only adverse effect noted was repetitive vomiting in 2 dogs. The intensities and patterns between preoperative Gd enhancement and intraoperative FS staining appeared to agree. High-grade glioma and histiocytic sarcoma had more intense FS staining. Lesions with strong Gd enhancement, including meningiomas and choroid plexus tumors, also had intense FS staining. Conclusion The intraoperative use of FS is a simple and safe technique to guide the resection of intracranial lesions in dogs. The findings on Gd enhancement, FS staining, and histopathology appeared to agree but require validation in a larger set of cases. Clinical Significance The intraoperative use of FS may improve the prognosis of dogs with brain tumors by guiding the resection of lesions.

AB  - The role of chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular complications and in neuropathy has been clearly established by intervention studies. However, the biochemical or cellular links between elevated blood glucose levels, and the vascular lesions remain incompletely understood. This review focuses on the consequences of hyperglycemia on the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and on the role of AGEs and of their specific receptors (RAGE) in the functional and anatomical alterations of the vascular wall. AGEs are formed during the Mailiard reaction by the binding of aldoses on free NH2 groups of proteins, which, after a cascade of molecular rearrangements, result in molecules of brown color and specific fluorescence. Experimental studies have indicated that the binding of AGEs to RAGE activates cells, particularly monocytes and endothelial calls. Activated endothelial cells produce cytokines, and express adhesion molecules and tissue factor. The role of AGEs in increased oxidative stress, and in the functional alterations in vascular tone control observed in diabetes, in part related to a reduction in nitric oxide, is also discussed. The microvascular retinal, glomerular and nerve lesions induced by experimental diabetes in animals are prevented by an inhibitor of AGEs formation, aminoguanidine. The administration in diabetic animals of recombinant RAGE, which hinders AGEs-RAGE interaction, prevents hyperpermeability and vascular lesions. These data suggest a central role of AGEs and RAGE in the development of chronic complications of diabetes.

AB  - Abstract Preeclampsia/eclampsia (PE/E) is a common disease of human pregnancy with a strong genetic component. The etiology of PE/E is unknown. Two recent reports indicated that the angiotensinogen gene (AGT) could be involved in susceptibility to PE/E. We performed a population-based case-control study in Australian and Chinese populations to investigate whether AGT is a good candidate gene for PE/E. A microsatellite polymorphism within AGT was typed as well as a molecular variant T235 (Met?Thr) of AGT using allele-specific PCR and allele-induced restriction site PCR. The allele distributions of the microsatellite and the variant T235 of AGT were significantly different between the two ethnic groups. However, no significant allele associations were found with disease when comparing PE/E patients and controls in Australian or Chinese populations, which is in contrast to the two earlier reports. The results suggest that the contribution of AGT to the occurrence of PE/E is small, if anything, and is not constant across populations.

AB  - The technique involving filtration of diluted blood enables the separate analysis of the flow properties of different cell subpopulations. This study was designed to assess the changes occurring in the flow properties and function of blood cells in stored bank blood and salvaged blood compared to patient blood in a given clinical situation. We measured hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils and the filterability, through 5??m Nucleopore filters, of isolated red blood cells and of diluted blood. Samples were obtained from patients undergoing aortic surgery and blood intended for transfusion: either salvaged during surgery or stored bank blood. Both salvaged and bank blood were much less filterable than patient blood, with reduced deformability of both red and white blood cells. However, salvaged blood contained highly activated neutrophils with a prolonged transit time of the ?fast-flowing? cells in the analysis compared to bank blood. Bank blood contained significantly more particles which acted as pore-blockers. Cells in bank and salvaged blood therefore have markedly abnormal flow and biochemical properties compared to patient blood.

AB  - Summary Central venous pressure (CVP) is determined by the interrelationship between venous return and right heart function. Monitoring CVP can help to guide fluid therapy in animals with abnormalities in circulating blood volume or abnormal right heart function. Specific indications for CVP measurement include the presence of persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, extensive third space losses, oliguria or anuria, hemorrhage, trauma, sepsis, burns, and heart failure. CVP is measured from a specialized catheter that is inserted into the external jugular vein and advanced into the cranial vena cava or the right atrium. Either single-lumen or multilumen vascular catheters can be used and should be of sufficient length to reach the thoracic vena cava from the point of insertion. The two methods of obtaining the CVP are intermittent measurement and continuous measurement. In both methods, the catheter is connected via a fluid-filled tubing system to a pressure-measuring device displaying CVP.

AB  - Summary Hypothalamic obesity is an intractable form of obesity syndrome that was initially described in patients with hypothalamic tumours and surgical damage. However, this definition is now expanded to include obesity developing after a variety of insults, including intracranial infections, infiltrations, trauma, vascular problems and hydrocephalus, in addition to acquired or congenital functional defects in central energy homeostasis in children with the so-called common obesity. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hypothalamic obesity are complex and multifactorial. Weight gain results from damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus, which leads, variously, to hyperphagia, a low-resting metabolic rate; autonomic imbalance; growth hormone-, gonadotropins and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency; hypomobility; and insomnia. Hypothalamic obesity did not receive enough attention, as evidenced by rarity of studies in this group of patients. A satellite symposium was held during the European Congress of Obesity in May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss recent developments and concepts regarding pathophysiology and management of hypothalamic obesity in children. An international group of leading researchers presented certain aspects of the problem. This paper summarizes the highlights of this symposium. Understanding the central role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism will help us gain insights into the pathogenesis and management of common obesity.

AB  - Intravenous clodronate in the treatment of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. (Istituto Ortopedico Gaetano Pini, Milan, Italy) J Rheumatol 2000;27:1477?1483. This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) and assessed the urinary excretion of type 1 collagen crosslinked N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after treatment. Thirty-two patients with RSDS were randomized to receive either IV Clodronate 300 mg daily for 10 consecutive days or placebo. Forty days later, the placebo treated patients received the clodronate treatment. Outcome measures included as a primary endpoint the visual analog scale of pain (VAS, range 0?100); secondary endpoints were a clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3) and an efficacy verbal score (EVS, range 0?3). Clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before the treatment, 40 (T40), 90 (T90), and 180 (T180) days later. At T40 the 15 patients randomized to clodronate treatment showed significant decreases of VAS and CGA (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively). Compared with the placebo group (17 patients), significant differences were found in all clinical variables. A further clinical improvement was observed throughout the study. Pooling the results of all 32 patients after clodronate treatment, at T180 the overall percentage decrease of VAS was 9.32 ± 15.6% with 30 patients significantly improved or asymptomatic. Significant inverse correlations between baseline NTx values and decreases of VAS were found at T90 (P = 0.03) and T180 (P = 0.01). No adverse events related to treatment occurred. Conclude that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and effective in the treatment of RSDS. NTx seems to be a predictive factor for clodronate efficacy. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized double blind placbo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) or complex regional pain syndrome type I. It is also to assess the urinary excretion of type I collogen crosslink N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after the treatment. Thirty-two patients with complex regional pain syndrome type I were randomized to receive either a placebo or IV clodronate 300mg daily for 10 consecutive days. At the end of 40 days, the placebo group was then treated with the clodronate. The primary endpoint measures with the visual analog scale (VAS, range 0?100) and a secondary endpoint was the clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3), and an efficacy vocal score (EVS, range 0?3). In addition, the patient had clinical and biochemical assessments performed before the treatment at 40 days, at 90 days, and at 180 days later. The purpose of the study was valued at the efficacy of the IV clodronate in pain relief. The second purpose was to evaluate the possibility of using NTx as a predicting factor for evaluating complex regional pain syndrome type I or the clodranate efficacy. On day 40, 15 patients that were randomized to the clodronate treatment showed significant decreases in their VAS and CGA when compared with the placebo group with 17 patients. In addition, the patients who had originally received placebo infusions showed decreased VAS and CGA scores after 40 days of treatment with the clodronate when compared to their VAS and CGA scores after placebo. At 180 days, the patients continued to show significant improvement or were asymptomatic. Bisphosphonates have been proposed since 1988 for the treatment of CRPS type I. The most frequently used is pamidronate, which is given intravenously showing varied results. The pamidronate did not seem to be well tolerated. Alendronate is also given intravenously demonstrating good efficacy. It, however, has a high relapse rate. Clodronate was chosen for this study because it was efficacious in treatment of various painful skeletal disorders and was more tolerable and safe than the pamidronate. The length of the time of the study was chosen to be 10 consecutive days so that it followed the study with successful use of pamidronate. These results suggest that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and is an effective complex regional pain syndrome type I treatment that may induce prompt and long lasting improvement. This study also attempted to demonstrate NTx as a predictive factor for clodranate efficacy. While NTx has shown to be a specific and sensitive marker of bone resorption, in this study, they found a low association between high NTx values and the complex regional pain syndrome type I. This finding could weaken the relationship between NTx baseline values and the responsiveness to clodronate treatment. It should be noted, however, that there were significant immerse correlations found between the baseline NTx values and in the pain improvement measured on the percentage change of VAS at 90 days and 180 days. Therefore, while significant inverse correlations may have been determined, and the NTx may be a promising tool, it is not yet possible to determine the predictive rolls of NTx as a marker.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Summary Pyothorax is an infection of the pleural space. It occurs in dogs and cats and is characterized by a septic suppurative pleural effusion. Animals with the pyothorax can have severe systemic signs, and despite a variety of potential causes the principles of therapy are relatively similar between species and etiologies. The pyothorax is most often associated with a bacterial infection. Clinical history and physical examination abnormalities in animals with the pyothorax relate to respiratory and systemic illness. Clinical signs can be present in animals for weeks to months prior to presentation. The principles of treatment of animals with the pyothorax include removal of the septic effusion and long-term treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Indications for surgical treatment of the pyothorax include evidence of a surgically resectable lesion thought to be responsible for the pyothorax, such as an abscess, mass, or foreign body, or inadequate response to medical management.

AB  - Summary Infants of birth weight ≤2500?g are termed low birth weight (LBW). These children often have considerable morbidity from prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction. Additionally, LBW infants have increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac congenital anomalies and may require surgery. Primary rather than palliative surgical repair of cardiac lesions has been preferred in recent years. However, LBW remains a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity after open-heart surgery (OHS). There is a paucity of information about the anesthetic challenges presented by LBW infants undergoing OHS. This review summarizes the perioperative issues of relevance to anesthesiologists who manage these high-risk patients. Emphasis is placed on management concerns that are unique to LBW infants. Retrospective data from the authors? institution are provided for those aspects of anesthetic care that lack published studies. Successful outcome often requires substantial hospital resources and collaborative multi-disciplinary effort.

AB  - The recent clinical availability of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) opens the door for potential therapeutic repurposing for non-oncological indications. Considering (a) the preclinical efficacy data with PARP inhibitors in non-oncological diseases and (b) the risk?benefit ratio of treating patients with a compound that inhibits an enzyme that has physiological roles in the regulation of DNA repair, we have selected indications, where (a) the severity of the disease is high, (b) the available therapeutic options are limited, and (c) the duration of PARP inhibitor administration could be short, to provide first-line options for therapeutic repurposing. These indications are as follows: acute ischaemic stroke; traumatic brain injury; septic shock; acute pancreatitis; and severe asthma and severe acute lung injury. In addition, chronic, devastating diseases, where alternative therapeutic options cannot halt disease development (e.g. Parkinson's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis or severe fibrotic diseases), should also be considered. We present a preclinical and clinical action plan for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors.

AB  - Objective To investigate local and systemic pharmacokinetics of gentamicin after intra-articular implantation of a gentamicin impregnated collagen sponge (GICS) in the inflamed canine joint. Study Design Descriptive repeated measures experimental study. Animals Dogs (n?=?9). Methods Stifle joint inflammation was caused by urate injection. Twenty-four hours later a GICS (gentamicin dose, 6?mg/kg) was arthroscopically implanted. Synovial fluid and plasma gentamicin concentrations were measured for 14 days after implantation, and pharmacokinetic parameters modeled using statistical moment analyses. Results Intra-articular gentamicin concentrations fell to sub-MIC for Staphylococcus sp. (4?µg/mL) by 22.4?hours (95% CI: 18.6?26.2) after sponge implantation. Cmax synovial was 2397?µg/mL (95%CI: 1161?3634?µg/mL) at 1.2?hours (95%CI: 0.5?1.8?hours). Plasma gentamicin concentrations achieved levels of Cmax plasma?=?8.0?µg/mL (95%CI: 6.1?10.0?µg/mL) at 1.5?hours (95%CI: 0.8?2.1) after GICS placement and fell below target trough of 2.0?µg/mL by 5.6?hours (95%CI: 4.7?6.5?hours) after GICS placement. Conclusions Intra-articular gentamicin concentration after GICS placement at an IV-equivalent dose reached high levels and declined rapidly. The maximum plasma levels attained were ?1/3 of the recommended sub-toxic target for people after parenteral gentamicin administration.

AB  - Summary Urinary stones are an ailment that can leave the patients asymptomatic or lead to significant morbidity or even mortality. Understanding the basic concepts of stone formation is vital in its prevention, which is key not only as a preventative measure but also to ensure patients do not form further stones. In this chapter, we discuss the pathophysiology of stone formation as well as the diagnostic and management modalities.

AB  - Aim The Western world has an expanding older population, who are living longer with increasing numbers of comorbidities. In addition, expectations of patients and relatives are increasing. As a general hospital operating in a rural setting, our University Hospital Kerry, Tralee, Ireland, deals with a significant number of emergency presentations to the acute surgical service. The aim of the present study was to examine outcomes for patients in the extremes of age who present requiring emergency surgical procedures. Methods A retrospective review of theater and admission logs was carried out to identify all emergency surgeries from January 2008 to December 2015. All patients aged >80?years at the time of surgery were identified. Details of surgery were recorded, in addition to biochemical and hematological data, use of intensive care unit, length of stay and mortality. Results In total, 128 octogenarians underwent an emergency surgery. The average patient age was 84.3?years (range 80?94?years). The commonest procedures were laparotomy (65%, n =?84), repair of strangulated/incarcerated hernia (18%, n =?23) and laparoscopic procedures (16%, n =?21). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 22.6%. On multivariate analysis, American Society of Anesthesia status and intensive care unit utilization predicted mortality (P =?0.04 and 0.05, respectively). A total of 82 patients required intensive care unit admission, with an average length of stay of 4.8?days, using 484 bed days in total. Conclusions Emergency surgery in octogenarians is a significant part of the workload of general surgeons. Poor baseline status is associated with an increased risk of mortality. Emergency surgery in older adults only utilizes a fraction of available intensive care unit resources. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 1211?1214.

AB  - Abstract Aims To follow up at least 100 patients for 3 years who were originally found to have benign adrenal adenomas which were non-functional or had subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCS). Methods This study prospectively evaluated consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with benign adrenal incidentalomas (AI), not treated with adrenalectomy, which were non-functioning or had SCS. The initial and follow up evaluation, including clinical assessment, hormonal investigations and imaging were coordinated via a standardised nurse-led AI clinic. Results Of 233 patients referred to the AI clinic, 101 patients met the inclusion criteria and completed 3-year follow up. Most of those excluded were due to incomplete initial or follow-up evaluation, or were not true AI. Most AI either remained stable or decreased in size on repeat imaging, whilst 5% of patients had AI enlargement of >5mm diameter. No patient developed features suggesting adrenal carcinoma. Ninety-two patients had an initial diagnosis of non-functioning adenoma and nine patients had SCS. After three years (range 2.9-4.7 years), 5 of the 9 patients with SCS showed normalisation of cortisol parameters (44%), and 5 of the 92 non-functional AI patients developed SCS (5%). Conclusion After three years of follow-up, approximately half of patients with SCS normalised, while 5% of patients with initially non-functioning adenomas developed biochemical evidence of SCS. This study found a low likelihood of progressive hormonal excess with no evidence of malignancy developing on follow-up evaluation, providing support for the shift towards the more conservative approach to management of AI recommended in recent guidelines.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To systematically review published studies evaluating pain associated with onychectomy in cats, and to assess the efficacy of the analgesic therapies applied. Databases used Four sources were used to identify manuscripts for review. Databases searched were those of the National Library of Medicine, EMBASE and CAB International. In addition, pertinent references in the bibliographies of included articles were retrieved. Results Twenty manuscripts published in refereed journals were reviewed. These included papers reporting 18 clinical trials and two studies conducted in conditioned research cats. Twelve analgesics were evaluated, including seven opioids, four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and one local anesthetic. Nine studies involved a direct comparison of analgesic agents. Limb use was abnormal when measured at 2 and 12 days following onychectomy, and neither fentanyl patch nor butorphanol administration resulted in normal use of the surgical limb. In another study, cats evaluated at 6 months after this surgery were not lame. Differing surgical techniques were compared in six studies; the results indicated that pain scores were lower after laser surgery than after scalpel surgery. The difficulties associated with assessing pain in cats and the lack of sensitivity of the evaluation systems utilized were highlighted in many of the studies. Huge variations in dose and dosing strategies had significant impacts on drug efficacy. Statistically significant differences among treatments were found in most studies; however, no clearly superior analgesic treatment was identified. A combination of meloxicam or robenacoxib with an opioid may provide more effective analgesia and should be evaluated.

AB  - Purpose: About 10% to 20 % of patients with epilepsy have medically intractable seizures. In some patients, the intractable course may be interrupted by seizure-free periods. Transient remission was reported in mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), but few studies have examined this phenomenon in detail. We retrospectively reviewed 99 patients with intractable cryptogenic or symptomatic localization-related epilepsy and studied the clinical features of those with transient remission lasting for >2 years. Methods: We investigated 99 patients with cryptogenic or symptomatic localization-related epilepsies who were treated in Nagoya University Hospital for >5 years and had medically intractable seizures. The underlying diseases of these 99 patients consisted of mesial tem- poral sclerosis (13 patients), tuberous sclerosis (9), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (9). central nervous system infection (7), iieuronal migration disorder (7), cerebrovascular disease (4), and periventricular leukomalacia (1). No underlying disease was determined in the remaining 49 patients. The epileptic focus was located in the temporal lobe in 37 patients, frontal lobe in 29, occipital lobe in 5, parietal lobe in 2, and was not determined in the remaining 26. The age of onset ranged from 0 month to 14 years (mean 4 years and 3 months). The duration of follow-up ranged from 5 to 33 years (mean 15 years). The age at the last visit ranged from 9 to 34 years (mean 21 years). Eight (8%)patients had a family history of febrile convulsions, and 13 (I 3%) had a family history of epilepsy. Forty-nine (50%) patients had mental deficits. Result: Among 99 patients with intractable cryptogenic or symptomatic localization-related epilepsies of childhood onset, 10 (10%) patients had transient remission that lasted for 2 years or more. The underlying diseases of these 10 patients consisted of mesial temporal sclerosis (3 patients), tuberous sclerosis (1), cortical dysplasia (I), intracranial hemorrhage (1), head trauma (1), and porencephalic cyst (1). No underlying disease was determined in the remaining 2 patients. The epileptic focus was located in the temporal lobe in 5 patients, frontal lobe in 2, and was not determined in the remaining 3 patients. Transient remission occurred within a few months after initiation of medical treatment if an appropriate anticonvulsant was given and lasted for 28 to 99 months. Epileptiforin discharges on the EEG disappeared in 7 patients during transient remission, and reappeared in 5 after recurrence of intractable seizures. Two (20%) patients had mental deficits, and 5 (50%) had a family history of epilepsy. Among 89 patients without transient remission, 57 (64%) patients had mental deficits, and 8 (9%) had a family history of epilepsy. Conclusions: Transient remission in intractable localization-related epilepsy occurs in a variety of pathological conditions and may reflect the progressive nature of some types of epileptic foci.

AB  - Summary There are several differences in treatment of neonatal foals with antimicrobials, compared to mature horses. Firstly, the dose of many antimicrobials is different in the foal. For orally administered drugs, this may also affect their efficacy, due to different enteral absorption. Secondly, neonatal foals are not yet hindgut fermentors and this allows antimicrobials with a high propensity to cause colitis in mature horses to be used. Thirdly, toxicities are different and some antimicrobials used in mature horses, such as enrofloxacin, are not suitable for use in foals. Foal-specific information is therefore needed for their safe and effective treatment with antimicrobials.
