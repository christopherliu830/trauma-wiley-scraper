AB  - Summary Neuro-oncology covers both the scientific and clinical aspects of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neurological complications of cancer. Improvements in radiological and histological diagnosis and surgical technique, advances in molecular neuro-oncology, the application of new biological agents and increasing use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumours such as gliomas have led to small but definite improvements in survival. This chapter provides a clinically dominated guide to the key issues in neuro-oncology. It reflects the highly specialised nature of disciplines within neuro-oncology. The chapter outlines the multi-disciplinary aspects of care on clinical management. Brain tumours include primary tumours arising from intracranial structures and metastases from outside the CNS. There are a number of other rarer tumours in childhood that often present with seizures and behave in a benign fashion. They are usually treated with surgery alone.

AB  - A 4-year-old female Chihuahua was presented with progressive seizures, blindness and lethargy. Neurolocalisation was consistent with a diffuse brain lesion affecting the forebrain and cerebellum. MRI demonstrated dilation of the subarachnoid space dorsolaterally surrounding the cerebrum, filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ventricular system size was normal, but mild cerebral atrophy was suspected. There was pachymeningeal contrast enhancement, but CSF analysis was unremarkable. This lesion was interpreted to be an external hydrocephalus of suspected congenital origin.

AB  - A 20-month-old, female French bulldog was presented with a three-month history of generalised seizures and progressive ataxia with occasional falling over on either side. Neurological examination revealed signs, suggesting a multifocal intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed two connected lesions on the left side of the caudal brainstem and a further lesion in the cerebrum. The dog was euthanased, and histopathological examination revealed lesions which closely resembled those of necrotising encephalitis in Yorkshire terriers. This is the first case describing this type of necrotising encephalitis in a French bulldog.

AB  - The serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), also known as GC-globulin, is a multifunctional protein known for its role in the transport of vitamin D metabolites. DBP also binds fatty acids and actin monomers, preventing their polymerization that could be detrimental in the circulatory system. DBP may have immune functions independent of its role as a transporter of vitamin D. Because of the abundance of DBP, many aspects of its basic biochemistry were quickly established. Other features of vitamin D action, particularly transcriptional mechanisms of regulation, received greater focus and early interest in DBP centred on its value as a tool for population genetics because of its intriguing genetic variations. Nonetheless, knowledge of DBP mechanisms in physiology was obtained, and functions beyond vitamin D ligand binding were identified. With the recent increased attention regarding the benefits of vitamin D (bone health and immunological regulation), there has been a resurgence of interest in DBP. Because DBP is the primary transporter of vitamin D, it has a role in maintaining the total levels of vitamin D for the organism and in regulating the amounts of free (unbound) vitamin D available for specific tissues and cell types to utilize. This review will describe the findings on the basic biochemistry and molecular biology of DBP, the studies that elucidated its biological functions and highlight these results in light of the current renewed interest in vitamin D and human health, as well as the debate over what constitutes sufficient levels of vitamin D.

AB  - Abstract Background Hospital malnutrition is a significant problem that still remains under-recognised and under-treated in India. The present study assessed the effects of oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) in conjunction with dietary counselling versus dietary counselling (control) alone in malnourished patients when given in hospital and post-hospital discharge. Methods The present study was conducted in nine private and four public hospitals. Patients from various medical wards were screened for malnutrition using modified Subjective Global Assessment (mSGA) and randomised to control (n = 106) or ONS (n = 106) for 12 weeks. Two servings (460 mL) of ONS were prescribed daily, providing 432 kcal, 16 g of protein and 28 micronutrients. The primary outcome was weight gain over 12 weeks. Other outcomes included change in body mass index (BMI), serum pre-albumin, albumin and C-reactive protein levels, energy and nutrient intakes, and handgrip strength at weeks 4, 8 and 12, as well as mSGA score at week 12. Results The mean age of patients was 39 years. Fifty-five percent were males and 90.3% were moderately malnourished (mSGA score B) at baseline. At week 12, ONS significantly improved certain parameters compared to control: weight (2.0 versus 0.9 kg; P < 0.001), BMI (0.76 versus 0.37 kg m?2; P < 0.001) and energy intake per day (560 versus 230 kcal; P < 0.05). There were no differences in biochemical parameters and mSGA score between groups. Additionally, patients on ONS who were more functionally impaired at baseline had significantly greater weight gain and improved handgrip strength scores than controls. Conclusions ONS use throughout hospital stay and post-hospital discharge significantly improved energy intake and weight in malnourished Indian patients. Those patients with poorer functional status at baseline demonstrated the most benefit.

AB  - An eight-year-old bull mastiff dog underwent a craniotomy for surgical excision of an olfactory lobe meningioma. Rapidly progressive neurological deficits with cervical pain developed within the early postoperative period. Intraventricular and cervical subarachnoid space air accumulation (pneumorrhachis) was identified through magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Repair of a dural defect using synthetic dura substitute resulted in gradual resolution of neurological signs attributable to the tension pneumocephalus and subarachnoid space pneumorrhachis. Regrowth of the meningioma was not observed. Postoperative intraventricular tension pneumocephalus and air accumulation within subarachnoid space are uncommon but life-threatening complications of intracranial surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a satisfactory outcome.

AB  - The incidence and severity of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) increase with advancing age, as does the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Not surprisingly, heterogeneous forms of CVD may coexist with AD changes in the ?ageing brain?. These include angiopathies (affecting both large and small arteries) that result from ?classical? risk factors (hypertension, smoking and diabetes) and others (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) that are biochemically closely linked to AD. The morphologic consequences of these various vascular diseases are infarcts and/or haemorrhages of varying sizes within the brain, which lead to neurocognitive decline that may mimic AD ? though the vascular abnormalities are usually detectable by neuroimaging. More subtle effects of CVD may include neuroinflammation and biochemical ?lesions? that have no reliable morphologic correlate and thus escape the attention of even an experienced Neuropathologist. The pathogenesis of hippocampal injury resembling ischaemic change ? commonly seen in the brains of geriatric subjects ? remains controversial. In recent years, genetically determined forms of microangiopathy (e.g. CADASIL, CARASIL, Trex1-related microangiopathies, CARASAL, familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or CAA) have provided interesting cellular and molecular clues to the pathogenesis of sporadic microvascular disease such as arteriolosclerosis and AD-related CAA.

AB  - Abstract Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies among populations in the United States and Western Europe, and one of the leading causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality due to cancer. The early detection of colon cancer is central to the effective treatment of this disease and early detection markers are needed. We have demonstrated that high-resolution two-dimensional gel analysis of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) demonstrated a specific oncological fingerprint of colon cancer. Utilizing this approach, four proteins specific for colon cancer was identified. Additionally, one protein was expressed much more strongly in colon cancer compared to adjacent and normal donor tissue. The amino acid composition of this protein revealed sequence similarity with calreticulin. The multi-functional protein, calreticulin, is normally found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum although some reports have described a nuclear localization of the protein. The aim of this study was to confirm the identity of the protein as calreticulin as well as to evaluate the localization of calreticulin in the nuclear matrix of colon cancer tissue. J. Cell.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was isolated in pure culture from ultrasound-guided pulmonary aspirates taken from a young cat with severe, chronic, pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography before therapy demonstrated severe diffuse alveolar disease. Twelve months combination therapy with doxycycline, rifampicin and clarithromycin resolved the infection. Thoracic radiographs taken at the completion of therapy showed multifocal pulmonary mineralisation. M thermoresistibile has been infrequently reported as a human or animal pathogen. This is the first reported pulmonary infection by M thermoresistibile in a cat and documents the successful treatment of the organism in a feline patient.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to use the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium to evaluate oxidative stress as a primary mechanism in the pathogenesis of degenerative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease. Materials and Methods: Forty-nine Sprague-Dawley adult female rats were used to generate the standard rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium. This was accomplished by daily air injections (20 cc) subdermally through the dorsal skin. Hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron (components of the Fenton reaction which generate free radicals) were introduced into the pouches of the 4-, 7-, and 14-day groups to generate oxidative stress. Control rats were injected with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.4. Either N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a powerful free radical scavenger, or ibuprofen were simultaneously injected with the Fenton reagents into the pouches of the 14-day treatment groups to modulate free radical-mediated protein damage to the synovium. Animals were euthanized at appropriate experimental intervals and biopsies obtained from specimens to analyze: (1) proteins' amino acid modification (carbonyl group formation), (2) protein hydrophobicity, (3) detection of low molecular weight protein degradation products, and (4) histological and gross anatomical observations. Results: Free radicals introduced into the rat air pouch interacted with synovial tissues causing oxidation and breakdown of proteins. Clinical evidence of adhesion formation consistent with features found in osteoarthritis of the TMJ developed. The groups subjected to oxidative stress experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and low molecular weight protein fragments. These groups also showed significant (p < 0.05) hydrophobicity changes consistent with free radical attack. Control synovial tissues were statistically undamaged. The 14-day NAC and ibuprofen treatment groups experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in total carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and hydrophobicity. Histological and gross observations in free radical damaged synovium exhibited features consistent with known arthoscopic and arthrocentesis findings in diseased TMJs. Conclusions: This study suggests that the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium develops clinical evidence of adhesions and biochemical signs of protein modification when subjected to free radical attack. NAC and ibuprofen prevented carbonyl formation as well as hydrophobicity changes indicative of oxidative stress damage in facsimile synovium. These findings are consistent with features of degenerative human TMJ disease. Future direction may be taken from this study to postulate new analysis techniques and treatment modalities for patients with degenerative TMJ disease.

AB  - Summary Intellectual disability (ID) is a global and persistent reduction in cognitive abilities beginning early in development and associated with impairment in daily functioning including communication, social skills, personal independence and school/work functioning. Classification systems distinguish levels of severity based on measured intellectual quotient (IQ) and degree of impairment in adaptive functioning. Prevalence estimates for ID vary widely but aggregate around 2-3% in high income countries, with mild ID about five times more common than severe forms. The multiple factors associated with ID are discussed including chromosomal disorders, genetic abnormalities, psychosocial adversity, exposure to prenatal infections and alcohol, postnatal exposure to environmental toxins and severe early deprivation. ID is associated with a three- to five-fold increased risk for all psychiatric disorders and about 15% of children with psychiatric disorders have ID. In childhood, ID is most strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Milder ID is often under-recognized and clinicians should be alert to warning signs, including poor academic attainments, school non-attendance and family history of learning and educational problems. When diagnosing psychiatric disorder in people with ID, considerations include the appropriateness of the behaviour in relation to developmental (rather than chronological) age and the multiple possible underlying causes for ?behaviour that challenges? should be carefully assessed so that targeted interventions can be used. In general, there are at present no effective treatments for the core cognitive deficits of ID. Interventions focus on appropriate education and support for affected individuals and their families that maximize quality of life and community participation. Treatment planning should be multi-disciplinary and multi-agency. The limited evidence base for treating psychiatric disorders in ID supports the use of similar interventions, although effect sizes may be diminished. Pharmacotherapy should involve lower starting doses, more gradual increases and careful monitoring, as people with ID are more sensitive to adverse effects. Psychological interventions should utilize behavioural strategies, supported with visual materials and the involvement of parents, carers and other professionals such as teachers. Family-wide support and respite care from voluntary groups and social services may be invaluable.

AB  - Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising cell resource of osteoprogenitor cells for bone tissue engineering. However, the diverse characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells within the bone marrow of individual subjects require varying treatments to stimulate osteogenic differentiation. Thus, an effective monitoring system is needed to identify the progression of osteogenesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy was used in the present study to monitor osteogenesis of tissue engineering (TE) constructs prepared by human bone MSCs seeded on scaffolds of gelatin sponges. The characteristics of MR images and parameters corresponded to osteogenic progression of TE constructs exposed to differentiation medium, significantly differing from control groups exposed to basic medium. Upon quantification, MR image and parameters correlated well to cell seeding densities and alkaline phosphatase activities of various TE constructs. In conclusion, MR can effectively detect the biochemical cascades of osteogenic differentiation of TE constructs and may be a promising, noninvasive monitoring system to provide three-dimensional information for bone tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe surgical techniques, caval occlusion times, and short-term outcomes in dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy. Study design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy between October 1, 2010 and May 31, 2018. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy were reviewed for signalment, perioperative management, surgical details, perioperative complications, mortality, and histopathology. Computed tomography images were reviewed to describe tumor morphology and signs of thrombus extension. Results Nineteen dogs had adrenal tumor thrombi extending into the prehepatic (14 dogs, 74%), hepatic (3 dogs, 16%), and posthepatic (2 dogs, 11%) caudal vena cava. Tumors occurred in left (11) and right (8) adrenal glands. Median caval occlusion was 6.5 minutes (range, 2?25). Two to six vascular tourniquets were used. Venotomy closure was performed under full caval occlusion in 11 dogs and by using a partial occlusion clamp in 8 dogs. Left ureteronephrectomy was performed in 5 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 21% (4 dogs). Conclusion Extension of caval tumor thrombus beyond the hepatic hilus did not preclude a good outcome. Longer caval occlusion than has been previously reported was tolerated in some cases. Number of vascular tourniquets used reflected the location of phrenicoabdominal vein insertion on the cava and length of the caval tumor thrombus. Venotomy closure under full occlusion was often required for right adrenal tumors. When required, ureteronephrectomy was left sided. Clinical significance Dogs with adrenal tumors extending beyond the hepatic hilus and those requiring a long caval occlusion time can survive adrenalectomy.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of alfaxalone required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to noxious stimulation. Study Design Prospective, experimental. Animals Eight healthy goats; four does and four wethers. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with alfaxalone 3 mg kg?1 intravenously (IV). A continuous IV infusion of alfaxalone, initially at 0.2 mg kg?1 minute?1, was initiated. Following endotracheal intubation the goats breathed spontaneously via a circle breathing circuit delivering supplementary oxygen. The initial infusion rate was maintained for 30 minutes before testing for responses. The stimulus was clamping on the proximal (soft) part of one digit of the hoof with Vulsellum forceps for 60 seconds. In the absence or presence of purposeful movement of the extremities, the infusion rate was reduced or increased by 0.02 mg kg?1 minute?1 and held constant for 30 minutes before claw-clamping again. Alfaxalone MIR was calculated as the mean of the infusion rates that allowed and abolished movement. Cardio-respiratory parameters were measured. Recovery from general anaesthesia was timed and quality scored. Results are presented as median (range). Results The MIR of alfaxalone was 0.16 (0.14?0.18) mg kg?1 minute?1 or 9.6 (8.4?10.8) mg kg?1 hour?1. Induction of and recovery from anaesthesia were excitement-free. Cardio-respiratory changes were minimal, although compared to baseline HR increased, and at 2 minutes post-induction, (prior to oxygen supplementation), PaO2 decreased significantly from 84 (80?88) to 70 (51?72) mmHg [11.2 (10.7?11.7) to 9.3 (6.8?9.6) kPa]. Sporadic muscle twitches, unrelated to depth of anaesthesia, were observed during the period of general anaesthesia. Time (minutes) to sternal recumbency and standing were 4.0 (3.0?10.0) and 41.5 (25.0?57.0) respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Alfaxalone can be used for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) in goats and is associated with minimal adverse effects. Oxygen supplementation is advised, especially when working at higher altitudes.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies and Déjérine-Sottas Syndrome are associated with mutations in the gene encoding Myelin Protein Zero. Here we report the characterization of two lines of transgenic mice expressing, in addition to the wild type protein, different point mutations in the extracellular domain of P0: the first is a deletion of Ser63 (DSer63), described in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B patients, whereas the second is a substitution of Ser 63 with a Cys (Ser63Cys) reported in a Déjérine-Sottas patient. By crossing the transgenic mice with P0 null mice, we produced animals that expressed only the mutated P0. We then investigated in vivo the expression and the effect of the two mutated proteins by morphological, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0DSer63 show severe hypomyelination, with the presence of onion bulbs and some uncompacted myelin sheaths. P0DSer63 does not reach the myelin sheaths and it accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is probably degraded. In contrast, sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0Ser63Cys present a milder hypomyelination with rare onion bulbs and, surprisingly, normal myelin sheaths. The mutated protein is a full-length protein that, presumably, is integrated into the myelin sheaths. This study demonstrates that different mutations in P0 glycoprotein, leading to disorders of different severity in human, have different fates in the Schwann cells.
