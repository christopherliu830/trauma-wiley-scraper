AB  - Abstract Conventional wound therapy utilizes wound coverage to prevent infection, trauma, and fluid and thermal loss. However, this approach is often inadequate for large and/or chronic wounds, which require active intervention via therapeutic cells to promote healing. To address this need, a patch which delivers multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) is developed. Medical-grade polyurethane (PU) films are modified using plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII), which creates a radical-rich layer capable of rapidly and covalently attaching biomolecules. It is demonstrated that a short treatment duration of 400 s maximizes surface activation and wettability, minimizes reduction in gas permeability, and preserves the hydrolytic resistance of the PU film. The reactivity of PIII-treated PU is utilized to immobilize the extracellular matrix protein tropoelastin in a functional conformation that stably withstands medical-grade ethylene oxide sterilization. The PIII-treated tropoelastin-functionalized patch significantly promotes MAPC adhesion and proliferation over standard PU, while fully maintaining cell phenotype. Topical application of the MAPC-seeded patch transfers cells to a human skin model, while undelivered MAPCs repopulate the patch surface for subsequent cell transfer. The potential of this new wound patch as a reservoir for the sustained delivery of therapeutic MAPCs and cell-secreted factors for large and/or non-healing wounds is indicated in the findings.

AB  - Summary This article outlines the main features of growth regulation by auxin and places them side-by-side with the physiological properties of fusicoccin. The fundamental role of the plasma membrane located H+/K+ ATPase in growth responses is examined and the information about this enzyme briefly reviewed. The effects of wounding on the activity of this enzyme are detailed and it is concluded that growth in excised tissue segments ceases not from lack of hormone but from impairment of ATPase function. An additional conclusion of major importance for hormone studies is reached; that is, that the experimentally-realized reactivation of growth by auxin in excised tissues represents largely an accelerated recovery from injury. Furthermore the calmodulin/Ca2+ system may be an essential intermediary in this recovery step. Finally, the major area of ignorance, predisposition to growth, is considered.

AB  - Despite its past anonymity, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type is a disease with a major impact on our ageing society. It affects a considerable percentage of old and very old people (some 20% of people over the age of eighty), causing distress and discomfort for the sufferers and the carers; it causes close to 50% of all nursing home admissions and costs the nation probably more than $2 billion annually; it is, with cardiovascular diseases and cancer, a leading cause of death. One of the particular difficulties with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) is that the diagnosis only can be confirmed in the post-mortem ? during life the diagnosis can only be made with a limited degree of certainty by following established inclusion and exclusion criteria (Glen and Christie 1979); that is, by ruling out other known causes of dementia in a patient with a dementia syndrome it is concluded that it must be senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. One other interesting aspect is that in SDAT, a disease which I compared before with cancer and cardio-vascular disease, a defeatist attitude amongst the medical profession is frequently noticed. Had the same attitude been adopted in the past towards cancer and cardio-vascular disease, progress in diagnosis and treatment of these diseases would never have happened. I am suggesting that it is possible to adopt a less defeatist and more positive attitude towards SDAT and this then stimulates the development of working strategies and working hypotheses. A working hypothesis can never claim to be a final solution to the problem, it is merely a frame of thought that directs step by step research working towards piecemeal solution of the problem. Summary A working hypothesis is presented, describing SDAT as a multi-factorial condition, in which genetic factors, toxic factors and nutritional factors are interacting and may play an accelerating role in the development of SDAT. Depression, frequently co-existing with SDAT, contributes to symptomatology and can be considered as playing an accelerating role. A tremendous amount of research has to be done. A working strategy at present could be: 1. Increase research. 2. Maintenance of a good nutritional status in the individual patient is mandatory. Nutritional research deserves high priority, based on early indications that secondary changes in nutritional condition may accelerate the process. 3. More attention should be given, before the verdict of ?Alzheimer? is pronounced, to the possibility that toxic factors have been contributing to the condition. Extra attention should be given to careful prescription of medication. 4. Prevention, early recognition and vigorous treatment of depression seems to be a most important factor. The importance of psycho-social stimulation should be recognised. The influence of the depression-like state on the blood-brain barrier function and on nutritional status of the brain should have high priority in future research.

AB  - A cat with a history of seizures and clinical suspicion of forebrain disorder underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the left temporal lobe. The mass was surgically removed, and cytological, histological and immunohistochemical examinations documented the presence of Toxoplasma gondii. A definitive diagnosis of an intracranial T gondii granuloma was made. The cat was treated with clindamycin and phenobarbital and the seizures did not recur. After 10 months, a second magnetic resonance imaging showed severe brain atrophy, but T gondii granuloma recurrence was not noted. Twenty-one months after surgery, the cat?s condition deteriorated, and another magnetic resonance imaging showed a presumptive recurrence of T gondii granuloma. In cats, T gondii granuloma must be considered as a differential diagnosis even when only a single intracranial mass is present. Cytology and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in making a definitive diagnosis and to follow the evolution of the lesion.

AB  - Two littermates, a young male and female boxer, were admitted to the Utrecht University?s Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals within a three month period. Both dogs suffered from anaemia caused by chronic intestinal blood loss, vomiting and weight loss. In both cases, there was no response to conservative medical management. Eventually, the dogs suffered significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage that resulted in collapse. Gastroduodenoscopy and exploratory surgery showed a duodenal diverticulum in both dogs. This is the first report that describes this congenital anomaly in two siblings.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the benefit of supplementing amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy with metronidazole in dogs presenting to a primary care veterinary practice with severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Materials and Methods Prospective randomised blinded trial on dogs presenting with haemorrhagic diarrhoea of less than 3 days duration to a primary care veterinary hospital and also requiring intravenous fluid therapy. Cases were randomised to receive either metronidazole or saline, in addition to standard supportive therapy consisting of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, intravenous fluid therapy, buprenorphine and omeprazole. Treatment efficacy was measured by duration of hospitalisation and daily scoring of disease severity. Results Thirty-four cases successfully completed the trial. There was no significant difference in hospitalisation time between treatment groups (mean for dogs receiving metronidazole was 29.6 hours and for controls was 26.3 hours) nor in daily clinical scores. Clinical Significance This study strongly suggests that addition of metronidazole is not an essential addition to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy for treatment of severe cases of haemorrhagic diarrhoea in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, levels of increased CSF tau protein and decreased levels of ?-amyloid 1?42 (A?42) have been shown to correlate with brain plaque formation and tangle pathology. Intracellular Lewy inclusions containing aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) represent a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In most ? but not all ? studies published to date total CSF α-syn concentrations have been found to be decreased in disorders related to α-syn pathology, that is, PD, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. However, these reports show extensive signal overlap among tested individuals, thereby diminishing its potential for routine use in clinical practice. To investigate potential biological (i.e., non-technical) confounders of reported CSF levels for α-syn, A?42, and tau in PD and related disorders, we carried out a methodical review of known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. We discuss several biological factors, such as neuropathology, demographics, clinical phenotype, progression and duration of disease, concomitant illnesses and, last but not least, pharmacotherapy, which in isolation or combination can substantially alter values for CSF proteins of interest. Enhanced implementation of standardized clinical protocols, streamlined operating procedures, and further progress in the development of validated assays for CSF proteins have the potential to (i) inform us as to the pathogenesis of disease, (ii) support the laboratory-based diagnosis for symptomatic subjects in the future, and (iii) facilitate breakthrough therapies to alter the course of neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD and Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate potential biological confounders of reported CSF levels for α-synuclein (α-Syn), amyloid-? 1-42(A?42) and tau protein in Parkinson's disease and related disorders, we reviewed the current literature for known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.

AB  - A seven-year-old, neutered male greyhound was presented with a history of episodic shifting hindlimb lameness and pain. Ischaemic necrosis of areas of the hindlimb digits and skin and a firm swelling within the medial right thigh musculature were found on physical examination. Investigation demonstrated thrombosis of the terminal aorta and right external iliac artery with ischaemic necrosis of muscular and dermal tissue distal to the sites of thrombosis. The dog was euthanased due to poor prognosis. Necropsy findings were of a poorly differentiated invasive sarcoma of the skeletal muscle of the proximal right hindlimb, thrombosis of the aorta and right external iliac artery and secondary renal glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemistry of the neoplastic tissue indicated angiosarcoma based on expression of CD31 and factor VIII-related antigen. Thrombosis was considered likely to be due to systemic hypercoagulability because of the presence of altered flow characteristics and endothelial damage in the vascular tumour bed. Aortoiliac thrombosis, paraparesis and hindlimb ischaemia are unusual sequelae of angiosarcoma in the dog.

AB  - Abstract Although the medical profession is slowly realizing that many disorders in the aged must be treated differently than in the young, there is still no proper appreciation of these age differences. Too often, when a patient reaches life-expectancy age, the physician relaxes his medical attention. It is assumed that the patient will die soon, although the actuarial statistics may show that he has many more years of life. Accordingly, therapy should be more intensive in order to attain the maximal life span. Elderly people will tolerate many major operations (e.g., herniorrhaphy or thyroidectomy) as well as young people. However, when it comes to serious major operations (e.g., radical neck dissection or radical excision of the rectum for carcinoma), the mortality rate for the aged may be four to eight times higher than for young patients. Elderly patients tolerate emergency major operations and complications very poorly. The chronologic age is not the chief factor in the mortality rate; more important are the operative complications. Therefore, preoperatively, every effort should be made to identify and treat diseases that might cause complications postoperatively. After operation a close watch must be kept for complications so that they may be treated promptly and effectively. Operative technic must be meticulous, with no excessive trauma and with particular attention to hemostasis and wound closure. The operation should be completed in the shortest possible time consistent with safety. A summary of 6 reports in the medical literature shows an operative mortality rate for major operations of 2.6 per cent in patients under 60, compared to 7.2 per cent for patients over 60. The mortality rate for emergency operations is much higher than for elective operations?18.5 per cent versus 6.5 per cent, respectively. A summary of 4 reports shows that cardiac complications were the greatest single cause of postoperative mortality (21.6 per cent), with pneumonia and atelectasis a close second. Despite precautions such as bandaging the extremities and early ambulation, pulmonary embolism accounted for 9.4 per cent of the deaths. [Though inoperable carcinoma caused more deaths (22.2 per cent of the entire group) than any of the other diseases, it is classified as a multiple cause.] Since the mortality rate for major operations in both aged and young patients is still significant, there is great need for more accuracy in determining operability.

AB  - Abstract Bioprinting as an enabling technology for tissue engineering possesses the promises to fabricate highly mimicked tissue or organs with digital control. As one of the biofabrication approaches, bioprinting has the advantages of high throughput and precise control of both scaffold and cells. Therefore, this technology is not only ideal for translational medicine but also for basic research applications. Bioprinting has already been widely applied to construct functional tissues such as vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In this review, the authors introduce the most popular techniques currently applied in bioprinting, as well as the various bioprinting processes. In addition, the composition of bioink including scaffolds and cells are described. Furthermore, the most current applications in organ and tissue bioprinting are introduced. The authors also discuss the challenges we are currently facing and the great potential of bioprinting. This technology has the capacity not only in complex tissue structure fabrication based on the converted medical images, but also as an efficient tool for drug discovery and preclinical testing. One of the most promising future advances of bioprinting is to develop a standard medical device with the capacity of treating patients directly on the repairing site, which requires the development of automation and robotic technology, as well as our further understanding of biomaterials and stem cell biology to integrate various printing mechanisms for multi-phasic tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To perform baseline T2 mapping of the hips of healthy volunteers, focusing on topographic variation, because no detailed study has involved hips. T2 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that evaluates cartilage matrix components. Materials and Methods Hips of 12 healthy adults (six men and six women; mean age = 29.5 ± 4.9 years) were studied with a 3.0-Tesla MRI system. T2 measurement in the oblique-coronal plane used a multi-spin-echo (MSE) sequence. Femoral cartilage was divided into 12 radial sections; acetabular cartilage was divided into six radial sections, and each section was divided into two layers representing the superficial and deep halves of the cartilage. T2 of these sections and layers were measured. Results Femoral cartilage T2 was the shortest (?20° to 20° and ?10° to 10°, superficial and deep layers), with an increase near the magic angle (54.7°). Acetabular cartilage T2 in both layers was shorter in the periphery than the other parts, especially at 20° to 30°. There were no significant differences in T2 between right and left hips or between men and women. Conclusion Topographic variation exists in hip cartilage T2 in young, healthy adults. These findings should be taken into account when T2 mapping is applied to patients with degenerative cartilage. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2007;26:165?171. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias show increasing clinical prevalence, yet our understanding of the etiology and pathobiology of disease-related neurodegeneration remains limited. In this regard, noninvasive imaging with radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) presents a unique tool for quantifying spatial and temporal changes in characteristic biological markers of brain disease and for assessing potential drug efficacy. PET radiotracers targeting different protein markers are being developed to address questions pertaining to the molecular and/or genetic heterogeneity of AD and related dementias. For example, radiotracers including [11C]-PiB and [18F]-AV-45 (Florbetapir) are being used to measure the density of A?-plaques in AD patients and to interrogate the biological mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. Our focus is on the development of novel PET imaging agents, targeting proteins beyond A?-plaques, which can be used to investigate the broader mechanism of AD pathogenesis. Here, we present the chemical basis of various radiotracers which show promise in preclinical or clinical studies for use in evaluating the phenotypic or biochemical characteristics of AD. Radiotracers for PET imaging neuroinflammation, metal ion association with A?-plaques, tau protein, cholinergic and cannabinoid receptors, and enzymes including glycogen-synthase kinase-3? and monoamine oxidase B amongst others, and their connection to AD are highlighted.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 1057?1067. Abstract We analyzed the mechanism of microglial proliferation in rat axotomized facial nucleus (axotFN). In immunoblotting analysis for possible mitogens, we noticed that the amounts of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) increased in the axotFN for 3?7?days after transection. In contrast, the amounts of granulocyte macrophage-CSF and interleukin-3 did not significantly increase. A potential source for M-CSF was immunohistochemically verified to be microglia. Immunoblotting showed that the amounts of receptor for M-CSF (cFms) increased in the axotFN for 3?14?days after injury, and immunohistochemical staining showed that cFms is expressed in microglia. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen as a marker of proliferation was immunohistochemically identified in microglia in axotFN, and the level was found to peak 3?days after transection in immunoblotting. Hypothesizing that up-regulated M-CSF triggers the above phenomena, we investigated the effects of M-CSF on cFms and proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels in primary microglia. The biochemical experiments revealed that M-CSF induces cFms and drives the cell cycle in microglia. The neutralization of M-CSF in microglia derived from axotFN significantly reduced the proliferation. These results demonstrate that up-regulated M-CSF triggers the induction of cFms in microglia and causes the microglia to proliferate in the axotFN.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - The particular combination of polydeoxyribonucleotides, l-carnitine, calcium ions, proteolytic enzyme and other ingredients acts in a synergetic way in the regeneration of skin and connective tissues. This new formulation of active principles was tested in vitro as a cell and tissue culture medium and in vivo for various preparations in support of tissue regeneration. In vitro, the new blend allowed the maintenance of skin biopsies for more than 1?year in eutrophic conditions. Immunocytochemical analyses of fibroblasts isolated from these biopsies confirmed a significant increase of the epidermal and connective wound-healing markers such as collagen type I, collagen type IV, cytokeratin 1 (CK1), CK5, CK10 and CK14 versus controls. To examine the effects of the new compound in vivo, we studied impaired wound healing in genetically diabetic db/db mice. At day?18, diabetic mice treated with the new composition showed 100% closure of wounds and faster healing than mice treated with the other solutions. This complex of vital continuity factors or life-keeping factors could be used as a tissue-preserving solution or a cosmetic/drug/medical device to accelerate wound healing in the treatment of patients with deficient wound repair to promote the regeneration of cutaneous and connective tissues (injuries?wound, dermatitis) and prevent the recurrent relapses.

AB  - Abstract The monoamine hypothesis has dominated our understanding of depression and of pharmacological approaches to its management and it has produced several generations of antidepressant agents, ranging from the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), through tricyclics (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to the recently introduced selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NARI), reboxetine. Greater receptor selectivity has improved tolerability, but not efficacy, when newer compounds are compared with the original tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Essentially, the newer antidepressants have the same distinguishing feature as older ones, i.e. acute enhancement of monoaminergic neurotransmission. The monoamine hypothesis cannot conclusively link the acute biochemical action of antidepressants on monoamine levels with their delayed clinical effect of 10?14 days, nor can it explain the mode of action of antidepressants that are effective despite being very weak inhibitors of monoaminergic transmission (e.g. iprindole) or, incongruously, enhancing monoamine uptake (e.g. tianeptine). Compared with other fields of medicine, there has been a lack of progress in understanding the pathophysiology of depression and producing truly novel antidepressant agents. Other biological approaches to depression, such as overactivity of the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal axis, hippocampal neural plasticity in response to stress, and the link between the inflammatory response and depression, offer new approaches to finding pharmacological agents, aided by improved techniques for visualising the human brain, better animal models, and increased knowledge of human markers of depression.

AB  - A 12-year-old German shepherd crossbreed dog was presented with a submandibular mass that was initially diagnosed as myxosarcoma on incisional biopsy. Chest radiographs were taken for staging, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery before adjuvant radiotherapy. The dog underwent debulking surgery, and histology permitted reclassification of the tumour as a malignant mesenchymoma (with myxosarcomatous and osteosarcomatous differentiation). The dog was subsequently treated with four fractions of radiotherapy given at seven-day intervals and three doses of carboplatin. The dog remained stable following therapy until its condition acutely deteriorated, and it was euthanased 153 days after surgery. On postmortem examination, there were no signs of local tumour recurrence, but metastases were observed both in the thorax and in the abdomen.

AB  - Abstract Interdisciplinary research endeavors are directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative and chronic diseases that affect human lifestyle. Hence the potential for developing medicinal herb-derived and food plant-derived prophylactic agents directed at neurological, metabolic, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders abounds. Oligonol is a novel technology product emanating from the oligomerization of polyphenols, typically proanthocyanidin from a variety of fruits (grapes, apples, persimmons etc.) that has optimized bioavailability. It is an optimized phenolic product containing catechin-type monomers and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, the easily absorbed forms. Typically the constituents of Oligonol are 15?20% monomers, 8?12% dimers and 5?10% trimers. Supplementation of mice with Oligonol prior to the administration of ferric-nitrilotriacetic complex (a Fenton chemistry model) significantly reduced the extent of lipid peroxidation in the kidney, brain and liver. Oligonol triggers apoptosis in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through modulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, an observation suggesting its important chemopreventive effects. The senescence-accelerated strain of mice (SAM) are models of senescence acceleration and geriatric disorders which exhibit learning and memory deficits and enhanced production or defective control of oxidative stress leading to neuronal damage. Oligonol has been suggested to modulate behavioral deficits, decrease the extent of inflamma-tion scores in the SAMP8 mice as well as prolonging their life-span. Oligonol modulates the A? induced oxidative insult and dysfunction in mitochondrial membrane integrity in PC12 cells indicating potential neuroprotection functions. Safety studies indicate no adverse effects in mice with an LD50 of 5 g/kg which equates to a dose of approximately 300 g for an average human with a 60 kg body weight. The application of Oligonol in pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics, dairy, processed meat and food products, supplements and in functional beverages can be envisaged.
