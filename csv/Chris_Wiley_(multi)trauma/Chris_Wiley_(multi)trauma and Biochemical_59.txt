AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 1057?1067. Abstract We analyzed the mechanism of microglial proliferation in rat axotomized facial nucleus (axotFN). In immunoblotting analysis for possible mitogens, we noticed that the amounts of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) increased in the axotFN for 3?7?days after transection. In contrast, the amounts of granulocyte macrophage-CSF and interleukin-3 did not significantly increase. A potential source for M-CSF was immunohistochemically verified to be microglia. Immunoblotting showed that the amounts of receptor for M-CSF (cFms) increased in the axotFN for 3?14?days after injury, and immunohistochemical staining showed that cFms is expressed in microglia. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen as a marker of proliferation was immunohistochemically identified in microglia in axotFN, and the level was found to peak 3?days after transection in immunoblotting. Hypothesizing that up-regulated M-CSF triggers the above phenomena, we investigated the effects of M-CSF on cFms and proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels in primary microglia. The biochemical experiments revealed that M-CSF induces cFms and drives the cell cycle in microglia. The neutralization of M-CSF in microglia derived from axotFN significantly reduced the proliferation. These results demonstrate that up-regulated M-CSF triggers the induction of cFms in microglia and causes the microglia to proliferate in the axotFN.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the point prevalence of proteinuria in dogs presenting to the University of Georgia Oncology Service for the first time. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 60 client-owned dogs with a confirmed cancer diagnosis were included but those with lower urinary tract neoplasia were excluded. Each dog's signalment, cancer diagnosis, previous cancer treatments, current medications and travel history were recorded. Renal values, electrolytes, packed cell volume, total solids, systolic blood pressure, urinalysis, urine protein:urine creatinine and retinal examinations were recorded. Non-proteinuric, borderline proteinuria and overt proteinuria were defined as urine protein:urine creatinine <0·2, ≥0·2 but <0·5, and ≥0·5, respectively. Urine culture was performed in dogs with active urine sediments or overt proteinuria. Results Twenty-nine dogs were non-proteinuric (48·3%), 22 (36·7%) borderline proteinuric and nine (15%) overtly proteinuric. None were azotaemic. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) was detected in 18 (30%) dogs. Of these, six were non-proteinuric, nine borderline proteinuric, and three overtly proteinuric. Proteinuria was detected in 51% of dogs presented to our oncology service, the majority of which were classified as borderline. Clinical Significance The high proportion of proteinuria in dogs in this study suggests that screening for proteinuria in dogs with cancer may be prudent. Larger studies are required to correlate specific cancer types and the impact of treatment with the development, magnitude and persistence of proteinuria.

AB  - Abstract Interdisciplinary research endeavors are directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative and chronic diseases that affect human lifestyle. Hence the potential for developing medicinal herb-derived and food plant-derived prophylactic agents directed at neurological, metabolic, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders abounds. Oligonol is a novel technology product emanating from the oligomerization of polyphenols, typically proanthocyanidin from a variety of fruits (grapes, apples, persimmons etc.) that has optimized bioavailability. It is an optimized phenolic product containing catechin-type monomers and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, the easily absorbed forms. Typically the constituents of Oligonol are 15?20% monomers, 8?12% dimers and 5?10% trimers. Supplementation of mice with Oligonol prior to the administration of ferric-nitrilotriacetic complex (a Fenton chemistry model) significantly reduced the extent of lipid peroxidation in the kidney, brain and liver. Oligonol triggers apoptosis in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through modulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, an observation suggesting its important chemopreventive effects. The senescence-accelerated strain of mice (SAM) are models of senescence acceleration and geriatric disorders which exhibit learning and memory deficits and enhanced production or defective control of oxidative stress leading to neuronal damage. Oligonol has been suggested to modulate behavioral deficits, decrease the extent of inflamma-tion scores in the SAMP8 mice as well as prolonging their life-span. Oligonol modulates the A? induced oxidative insult and dysfunction in mitochondrial membrane integrity in PC12 cells indicating potential neuroprotection functions. Safety studies indicate no adverse effects in mice with an LD50 of 5 g/kg which equates to a dose of approximately 300 g for an average human with a 60 kg body weight. The application of Oligonol in pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics, dairy, processed meat and food products, supplements and in functional beverages can be envisaged.

AB  - Abstract Acellular nerves possess the structural and biochemical features similar to those of naive endoneurial tubes, and have been proved bioactive for allogeneil graft in nerve tissue engineering. However, the source of allogenic donators is restricted in clinical treatment. To explore sufficient substitutes for acellular nerve allografts (ANA), we investigated the effectiveness of acellular nerve xenografts (ANX) combined with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on repairing peripheral nerve injuries. The acellular nerves derived from Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits were prepared, respectively, and BMSCs were implanted into the nerve scaffolds and cultured in vitro. All the grafts were employed to bridge 1 cm rat sciatic nerve gaps. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10 per group): ANA group, ANX group, BMSCs-laden ANA group, BMSCs-laden ANX group, and autologous nerve graft group. At 8 weeks post-transplantation, electrophysiological study was performed and the regenerated nerves were assayed morphologically. Besides, growth-promoting factors in the regenerated tissues following the BMSCs integration were detected. The results indicated that compared with the acellular nerve control groups, nerve regeneration and functional rehabilitation for the xenogenic nervetransplantation integrated with BMSCs were advanced significantly, and the rehabilitation efficacy was comparable with that of the autografting. The expression of neurotrophic factors in the regenerated nerves, together with that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord and muscles were elevated largely. In conclusion, ANX implanted with BMSCs could replace allografts to promote nerve regeneration effectively, which offers a reliable approach for repairing peripheral nerve defects.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effect of intravenous infusion of amino acids on the prevention of hypothermia during anaesthesia in dogs. Study design Randomized experimental trial. Animals Seven healthy Beagle dogs. Methods Four concentrations of amino acids were prepared with a 10% amino acid solution and an acetated Ringer's solution, and dogs were infused with each of the solutions at 1 week intervals. Dogs were infused with amino acid solution at 12 mL kg?1 hour?1 for 60 minutes before and for 60 minutes after induction of anaesthesia. Acetated Ringer's solution was infused at the same rate for the remaining 60 minutes of anaesthesia. The infusion treatments were: 1) A0, nutrient-free acetated Ringer's solution; 2) A6, 0.6 g kg?1 hour?1; 3) A9, 0.9 g kg?1 hour?1; and 4) A12, 1.2 g kg?1 hour?1. Rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood insulin, glucose, urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations, and time to extubation were measured. Results Before anaesthesia, RT was not affected by amino acid infusion. RT decreased progressively during anaesthesia and the absolute values of RT from 30 to 120 minutes were significantly higher in A12 than in A0 (p < 0.05). Reductions in HR and MAP during anaesthesia were attenuated by amino acid infusion in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher in A12 than in A0 during amino acid infusion and the increase in insulin concentration was greater during than before anaesthesia. BUN increased during amino acid infusion in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Time until extubation was shorter in A12 than in A0. Conclusions and clinical relevance Amino acids infused at 1.2 g kg?1 hour?1 in dogs attenuated the decrease in RT, HR, and MAP during anaesthesia, and induced a significant increase in plasma insulin concentration.

AB  - ABSTRACT Well documented limitations associated with primary chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering applications have led to increased interest in the use of multi-potent stem/progenitor cells. The objective of this study was to firstly investigate if infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (FPSCs) could be used to engineer cartilage-like tissues through a self-assembly (SA) process, and secondly to compare the properties of such grafts to those engineered by agarose hydrogel encapsulation (AE). Self-assembled cartilaginous tissues were first engineered by geometrically confining FPSCs on tissue culture plastic, and then either continuously or transiently supplementing these constructs with transforming growth factor-?3 (TGF-?3). Transient supplementation with TGF-?3 (for the first 21 days of culture) enhanced the development of self-assembled grafts, with sGAG accumulation reaching levels of 8.4?±?1.5% w/w after 6 weeks of culture. While overall levels of matrix synthesis were higher with AE compared to SA, when normalized to tissue wet weight, ECM accumulation was significantly greater in the lighter SA constructs. A potential drawback with the SA approach on tissue culture plastic was that it often led to the development of contracted, geometrically inconsistent tissues. We therefore next explored if SA on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) transwell membranes would lead to the development of more morphologically stable and homogenous tissues. At high seeding densities, SA on such transwell membranes led to the formation of geometrically uniform constructs that underwent minimal contraction during culture. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the potential of SA using FPSCs for cartilage tissue engineering, with grafts attaining relatively high levels of sGAG content within clinically relevant timeframes. Such an approach is easily scalable and may lend itself to treating large, full thickness cartilage defects. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 1686?1698. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Objective Recent studies have shown that an elevated 1-h postload plasma glucose (1hPG) is able to identify subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at high risk for future type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, clinical studies about the characteristics of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with elevated 1hPG are lacking. The aim of this study was to analyse the 1hPG level in CHD patients with NGT. Methods A total of 204 CHD patients with NGT were recruited. Subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, echocardiography and coronary angiography. Demographic data were recorded and blood samples obtained. According to the 1hPG cut-off point of 8·6 mm, patients were divided into two groups: 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm (n = 65) and 1hPG < 8·6 mm (n = 139). Results Compared with the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, subjects with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm had a worse metabolic profile, exhibiting significantly higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride level and lower HDL-cholesterol level. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels were higher in the 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm group than in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group. Coronary angiography revealed that single-vessel changes were more frequent in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, but there were no significant differences in the Gensini score. Conclusions Patients with CHD with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm have a worse metabolic profile, higher levels of hsCRP and multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that, in patients with CHD, elevated 1hPG increases coronary risk factors and may be a marker for early-stage glucose intolerance.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been under development for several decades, but so far none has completed clinical trials due to safety issues, including fundamental concerns regarding hemoglobin-induced vasoconstriction and oxidative reactions. The question becomes whether these attributes are inherent to the hemoglobin molecule itself, or if the molecule can be modified in such a way as to avoid untoward side effects. To this end, Sangart designed a new type of oxygen therapeutic, Hemospan?, based on site-specific, maleimide poly(ethylene) glycol conjugation chemistry. The product, also referred to as MP4, is neither vasoconstrictive nor does it promote oxidation in vivo. The design principles were three-fold: (i) increase hemoglobin molecular size to prolong intravascular retention; (ii) increase oxygen affinity to prevent premature unloading of oxygen in the arterioles, thus avoiding arteriolar vasoconstriction; and (iii) optimize colloidal osmotic pressure and viscosity to enhance blood flow. Preclinical studies with Hemospan in animal models of hemodilution and hemorrhage show maintenance of blood pressure and cardiac output, with improved oxygen delivery compared to early-generation products of cross-linked and polymerized hemoglobins. Four Phase I and II clinical trials have been completed, showing that Hemospan is generally well tolerated in humans, with additional evidence of efficacy through Hemospan's capacity to impart hemodynamic stability in surgical patients. Two multi-center Phase III trials of Hemospan in orthopedic surgery are now underway in Europe.

The hybrid scaffold has shown promise as a potential strategy for the treatment of such defects. In this study, a novel biomimetic porous collagen (Col)/hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold was fabricated through assembling layers of Col containing gradual amount of HA under the assistance of ?iterative layering? freeze-drying process. The scaffold presents a double gradient of highly interconnected porosity and HA content from top to bottom, mimicking the inherent physiological structure of bone. Owing to the biomimetic structure and component, significant increase of cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro was observed, illustrating potential application of the excellent Col/HA scaffold as a promising strategy for bone tissue engineering. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to study the localization of platelet factor 4 (PF4), fibronectin (Fn) and factor VIII related antigen in washed normal platelets and those from patients with severe von Willebrand's disease (vWd). Platelets were prepared by an improved multi-unit modification of the Sayk chamber. This facilitated the preparation of samples with minimum disruption of platelets and readily permitted the demonstration of intact platelet granules by the immunological techniques used. The antigens were demonstrated by treating the same preparations sequentially with appropriate heterologous antisera and species specific fluorescein or rhodamine conjugated antisera. Comparison of the different antigens in identical platelets indicated that Fn and VIIIR:Ag were localized to the same granules as PF4 and the results were thus consistent with their presence in alpha granules. Fn and PF4, but not VIIIR:Ag, were present in platelet granules of patients with severe vWd. The antigens were always detected in the same granules, and major sub-populations of differently stained granules were not observed. The methods were applied to investigate normal platelets aggregated with collagen. Fn and VIIIR:Ag were detected in platelet granules after aggregation although the granules themselves were possibly differently distributed in these samples compared with the non-aggregated platelets. The localization of PF4 could not be reliably assessed in aggregated platelets by these methods. The techniques may be useful in localizing platelet antigens and studying release during aggregation.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the agreement between cardiac output (CO) values obtained using a transpulmonary thermodilution technique (TPTDCO) and conventional thermodilution technique (TDCO) in anaesthetized dogs with fluid overload. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six healthy Beagle dogs aged 7?8 years. Methods Dogs were anaesthetized with sevoflurane in oxygen, and catheters were inserted for TPTDCO and TDCO measurement. After instrumentation, baseline CO was measured using each technique at a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3?7 mmHg. Dogs were subsequently administered lactated Ringer's solution and 6% hydroxyethyl starch to induce fluid overload. CO measurements were obtained using each technique at CVP values of 8?12 mmHg, 13?17 mmHg, 18?22 mmHg and 23?27 mmHg. Agreements between CO measurements obtained with the respective techniques were analysed using Dunnett's test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland?Altman analysis. Results Thirty pairs of CO values were obtained, ranging from 1.45 L minute?1 to 4.69 L minute?1 for TPTDCO and from 1.30 L minute?1 to 4.61 L minute?1 for TDCO. TPTDCO and TDCO values correlated strongly (r2 = 0.915, p < 0.001). The bias and mean relative bias between TPTDCO and TDCO were 0.26 ± 0.30 L minute?1 (limits of agreement ? 0.29 to 0.81 L minute?1) and 9.7%, respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance TPTDCO and TDCO measurements obtained in anaesthetized dogs during fluid overload exhibited good agreement. Accordingly, transpulmonary thermodilution provides an accurate measurement of CO in dogs with fluid overload.

AB  - Clinical manifestation of overt vascular disease may be preceded for years by endothelial dysfunction. Objective:? This study was undertaken to evaluate endothelial function in ESRD patients and correlation between endothelial function and clinical and biochemical parameters. Methods:? 32 stable ESRD patients (male?:?female?=?16?:?16, average age: 55.2?±?13.0) on hemodialysis were included. A 10-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to image the brachial artery. Brachial artery diameter was measured, and reactive hyperemia was induced by inflation to 250?mmHg for 5?min and then deflation of a pneumatic cuff. After release of the cuff, brachial artery diameter was measured. Results:? In the entire study population and non-diabetic group, the %FMD (% flow-mediated dilatation, % change of brachial artery diameter between before and after cuff inflation) did not show any significant correlation with duration of dialysis, age, hypertension, albumin, CRP, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, the %FMD of diabetic patients was lower than that of non-diabetics. Among the patients with diabetes, the group of patients with FMD of <5.2% showed significant lower serum albumin and significantly higher ln(CRP) levels compared to the group of patients with FMD ≥5.2%. The %FMD showed significant positive correlation with serum albumin level and significant negative correlation with ln(CRP) in diabetic patients. Conclusion:? These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction, estimated by FMD, was significantly more prominent in diabetic ESRD, especially with low serum albumin and high CRP levels.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether doxorubicin?piroxicam combination is safe and has activity against transitional cell carcinoma in dogs. Methods Data was collected retrospectively from 34 dogs from two institutions over a 6-year period. Signalment, clinical presentation, treatment specifics, adverse events, response, progression-free survival and overall survival time were evaluated. Results Dogs received doxorubicin every 3 weeks and daily piroxicam; 17 dogs (50%) had surgery. Clinical presentations were those typically reported for transitional cell carcinoma. Mean number of doses administered was 3·5. Of the 23 dogs with measurable disease, 14 (60·5%) had stable disease, 7 (30·5%) had progressive disease and 2 (9%) a partial response. Adverse events were generally manageable, and gastrointestinal in origin; one dog died of treatment-related complications. Overall median progression-free survival and overall survival were 103 and 168 days, respectively. Cytoreductive surgery did not result in prolongation of progression-free survival, but significantly prolonged overall survival. All dogs but one died as a result of disease progression. Clinical Significance Doxorubicin?piroxicam combination therapy is well-tolerated in dogs with transitional cell carcinoma although progression-free survival, overall survival and biological response rates appear modest. Combination with surgery appears to offer a survival advantage; however, this may reflect tumour location and volume. Prospective studies are necessary to compare activity of combination doxorubicin?piroxicam to currently applied therapies.

AB  - Abstract First-hand and second-hand tobacco smoke are causally linked to a huge number of deaths and are responsible for a broad spectrum of pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, and eye diseases as well as adverse effects on female reproductive function. Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of different chemical species, which exert their negative effects on macromolecules and biochemical pathways, both directly and indirectly. Many compounds can act as oxidants, pro-inflammatory agents, carcinogens, or a combination of these. The redox behavior of cigarette smoke has many implications for smoke related diseases. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (both radicals and non-radicals), reactive carbonyl compounds, and other species may induce oxidative damage in almost all the biological macromolecules, compromising their structure and/or function. Different quantitative and redox proteomic approaches have been applied in vitro and in vivo to evaluate, respectively, changes in protein expression and specific oxidative protein modifications induced by exposure to cigarette smoke and are overviewed in this review. Many gel-based and gel-free proteomic techniques have already been used successfully to obtain clues about smoke effects on different proteins in cell cultures, animal models, and humans. The further implementation with other sensitive screening techniques could be useful to integrate the comprehension of cigarette smoke effects on human health. In particular, the redox proteomic approach may also help identify biomarkers of exposure to tobacco smoke useful for preventing these effects or potentially predictive of the onset and/or progression of smoking-induced diseases as well as potential targets for therapeutic strategies. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract This study utilises multi-isotopic analysis to reconstruct diet and source-water consumption from human remains collected at Carrizales, in the Zaña Valley of northern coastal Peru. Carrizales is a multicomponent site that encompasses the remains of (a) Early Intermediate Period (200?800 CE) cemeteries (Conjuntos 126 and 127), (b) Late Sicán/Lambayeque period (ca. 1100?1350 CE) domestic occupations (Conjuntos 125, 128, and 131), and (c) a planned town (reducción) into which indigenous people were resettled under Spanish rule, ca. 1572 CE (Conjunto 123). Faunal and botanical assemblages at the site differ significantly between the Late Sicán/Lambayeque and early colonial phases, suggesting a distinct shift in local subsistence regimes following Spanish colonisation and resettlement. Human remains were collected from Carrizales for the characterisation of dietary isotopes and further examination of the impacts of Spanish colonialism on native foodways. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope values were characterised in the enamel carbonate, bone carbonate, and bone collagen of individuals associated with Early Intermediate Period contexts (N = 4) and the late 16th century chapel within the site's reducción (N = 21). Over half of the study sample failed to produce viable bone collagen, an issue that is common in bioarchaeological samples from the north coast of Peru. However, among those with viable bone collagen and carbonate, there were minimal differences in δ13C, δ18O, and δ15N values between the two phases. This extends to values in enamel carbonate, which is highly resistant to diagenesis. Therefore, patterns in isotope values do not mirror the significant differences manifest in food remains from Carrizales. We suggest that (a) the diets of Early Intermediate Period individuals and Early Colonial period individuals buried at the site were quite similar, contrasting with the patterns indicated by Late Intermediate Period food remains, and (b) both populations obtained water from similar sources?a pattern that reinforces the characterisation of reducción in the Zaña Valley as a relatively local phenomenon in which nearby populations were concentrated into planned towns, rather than drawn from distant valleys.

AB  - Abstract The diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of lower extremity amputation worldwide and is directly associated with comorbidity, disability and mortality. Oxidative stress mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these wounds. Intra-lesional infiltration of epidermal growth factor has emerged as a potential therapeutic alternative to allow for physiological benefit while avoiding the proteolytic environment at the centre of the wound. The aim of this study was to characterise the response of patients with DFUs to epidermal growth factor treatment in terms of redox status markers. Experimental groups included patients with DFUs before and 3?4 weeks after starting treatment with epidermal growth factor; compensated and non-compensated diabetic patients without ulcers; and age-matched non-diabetic subjects. Evaluations comprised serum levels of oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve markers. Patients with DFUs exhibited the most disheveled biochemical profile, with elevated oxidative stress and low antioxidant reserves, with respect to non-ulcerated diabetic patients and to non-diabetic subjects. Epidermal growth factor intra-lesional administration was associated with a significant recovery of oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve markers. Altogether, our results indicate that epidermal growth factor intra-ulcer therapy contributes to restore systemic redox balance in patients with DFUs.
