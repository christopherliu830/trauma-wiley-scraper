AB  - Summary The physiological derangements that are frequently witnessed in the heartbeating brainstem-dead multiorgan donor are a result of both the adverse somatic consequences of treatment strategies for acute catastrophic brain injury as well as the well-described and specific consequences of brainstem ischaemia. The latter include diabetes insipidus, hypothermia, cardiovascular instability, neurogenic pulmonary oedema and systemic inflammation, and together they jeopardise the donation potential of the brainstem-dead donor. Donor management protocols are designed to help clinical staff detect and reverse these various derangements and require a continuation, and on occasion escalation, of physiological monitoring and support on the intensive-care unit. By increasing the number and quality of organs that are available for transplantation, physiological optimisation more completely fulfils the altruistic gift being made by the donor and their family, and should therefore be seen as an important component of the donor's end of life care.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and socioeconomic problem throughout the world. It is a complicated pathological process that consists of primary insults and a secondary insult characterized by a set of biochemical cascades. The imbalance between a higher energy demand for repair of cell damage and decreased energy production led by mitochondrial dysfunction aggravates cell damage. At the cellular level, the main cause of the secondary deleterious cascades is cell damage that is centred in the mitochondria. Excitotoxicity, Ca2+ overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Bcl-2 family, caspases and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) are the main participants in mitochondria-centred cell damage following TBI. Some preclinical and clinical results of mitochondria-targeted therapy show promise. Mitochondria- targeted multipotential therapeutic strategies offer new hope for the successful treatment of TBI and other acute brain injuries.

AB  - Abstract The use of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to data independent tandem mass spectrometry with traveling wave ion mobility for detection and structural identification of ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine is described. The experimental design generates 4D data (chromatographic retention time, precursor accurate mass, drift time with associated calculated collisional cross-section, and time-aligned accurate mass diagnostic product ions) for each ionization mode. Confident structure identification depends on satisfying 4D data confirmation in both positive and negative ion mode. Using this methodology, a number of ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine lipids are structurally elucidated from mouse brain lysosomes. It is further determined that several ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine structures are differentially abundant between lysosomes isolated from mouse cortex following traumatic brain injury as compared to that of sham animals. The combined effort of aligning multi-dimensional mass spectrometry data with a well-defined traumatic brain injury model lays the foundation for gaining mechanistic insight in the role lysosomal membrane damage plays in neuronal cell death following brain injury.

AB  - Objective? To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported. Design? Retrospective/prospective study. Results? Nocardia spp infections were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable, from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1 entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured. Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion? Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of therapy leads to disease recurrence.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Polyurethane hydrogel foams synthesized through a facile one-pot, solvent-free process are described. The roles of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecular weight, crosslinking density, and foam stabilizer concentration on polymer properties are evaluated for potential applications as wound dressing materials. Material characterization and wound dressing relevant performance evaluations are performed to understand effects of individual components and identify promising formulations. Surprisingly for a solvent-free reaction, complete polymerization is confirmed by IR and gel fraction analyses. Foam stabilizing agent loading increases mechanical properties including Young's modulus, extensibility, and toughness while decreasing pore size and drug release rate. Mechanical properties are also dependent on the crystalline melting temperature of the PEG diol. Utilizing caffeine as a drug surrogate, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) drug-release analysis identifies that polyurethane hydrogel foams exhibit initial burst release kinetics followed by sustained release over 24 h. Antibiotic compatibility and release is demonstrated for all formulations by zone of inhibition testing against gram-positive and negative bacteria.

AB  - Abstract Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs at a high frequency in severe orthopaedic extremity injuries; however, the etiology of traumatic HO is virtually unknown. Osteogenic progenitor cells have previously been identified within traumatized muscle. Although the signaling mechanisms that lead to this dysregulated differentiation pathway have not been identified, it is assumed that inflammation and fibrosis, which contribute to an osteoinductive environment, are necessary for the development of HO. The hypothesis of this study was that cytokines related to chronic inflammation, fibrogenesis, and osteogenesis become up-regulated following severe muscle trauma where HO forms. Classification of these cytokines by their differential expression relative to control muscle will provide guidance for further study of the mechanisms leading to HO. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed no significant up-regulation of cytokines typically associated with HO (e.g., BMP-4, as observed in the genetic form of HO, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva). Instead, the cytokine gene expression profile associated with the traumatized muscle included up-regulation of cytokines associated with osteogenesis and fibrosis (i.e., BMP-1 and TGF-?1). Using immunohistochemistry, these cytokines were localized to fibroproliferative lesions, which have previously been implicated in HO. This study identifies other cell and tissue-level interactions in traumatized muscle that should be investigated further to better define the etiology of HO. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Literature describing medical treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC) is sparse. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes, including time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST), of canine PC treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or chemotherapy, and to identify prognostic factors. Records from 8 institutions were searched for dogs with cytologically or histologically confirmed PC without bladder involvement: 67 dogs were included. Presenting signs were urinary (25), gastrointestinal ([GI], 11) and systemic (3); 16 dogs had GI and urinary signs, 7 dogs had systemic signs with concurrent GI or urinary signs and in 5 dogs the tumour was an incidental finding. Out of 27 dogs, 9 (33%) had positive urine culture. Metastases were identified in 26 dogs to lymph nodes (19), lungs (10), bone (2) and liver (1). Treatment included NSAIDs and chemotherapy (32), NSAIDs alone (31) and chemotherapy alone (4). The overall MST was 82 days (range 9-752) and median TTP was 63 days (range 9-752). Dogs receiving NSAIDs combined with chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer MST (106 vs 51 days; P?=?.035) and TTP (76 vs 44 days; P?=?.02) compared to dogs receiving NSAIDs alone. Intact dogs and those with metastatic disease had significantly shorter MST (31 vs 90 days, P?=?.018 and 49 vs 109 days, P?=?.037, respectively); intact dogs also had significantly shorter TTP (25 vs 63 days, P?=?.0003). This study suggests that a combination of NSAIDs and chemotherapy may improve outcomes in canine PC. Metastatic disease and being entire negatively influenced prognosis.

AimÂ  To provide more precise estimates of the efficacy of MMX mesalazine over placebo by combining the patient populations from the two phase III studies. Methods? Combined data from two 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Patients randomized to MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day (once daily or 1.2?g twice daily), 4.8?g/day (once daily) or placebo were reviewed. The primary end point was clinical and endoscopic remission (modified Ulcerative Colitis-Disease Activity Index of â‰¤1 calculated as: rectal bleeding and stool frequency scores of 0, a combined Physician?s Global Assessment and sigmoidoscopy score of â‰¤1, no mucosal friability and a â‰¥1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from week 0). Results? Data from 517 patients were analysed. 8-week remission rates were 37.2% and 35.1% in the MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day and 4.8?g/day groups, vs. 17.5% on placebo (P?<?0.001, both comparisons). 8-week complete mucosal healing rates were 32% in both MMX mesalazine groups compared with 16% on placebo. Adverse event frequency was similar in all groups. Conclusion? MMX mesalazine is effective and generally well tolerated for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.

Our main aim was to assess the penetration of correct diagnostic and clinicopharmacological information into routine practice. A detailed analysis and discussion are given of data concerning reasons for hospital admission (therapeutic adjustment accounting for 27.3%; diagnostic ascertainment, 53.8%); characteristics of the disease, in terms of duration, clinical manifestations, and pattern of seizures; associated disorders; prevalence and criteria for the use of instrumental diagnostic procedures (EEG, brain scan, computed tomography, etc.); pattern of prescriptions of anticonvulsant drugs at admission and at discharge, with particular emphasis on specific drug choices by specialty; prevalence of single-drug therapy (41% at admission and 47.0% at discharge) versus polytherapy; degree of correspondence between recommended and observed dosage regimens (undertreatment being a more common problem than excessive dosing); and reporting of side effects. Although some of the findings of some recent studies are confirmed, this report documents the feasibility of a regular audit program of the performance of an entire health care system in the treatment of epilepsy. RÃ‰SUMÃ‰ 1104 Patients admis dans 27 des 46 dÃ©partements de neurologie (64,5%), de neurochirurgie (23,0%) et neurologie pÃ©diatrique (12,5%), de Lombardie, la plus grande rÃ©gion d'ltalie (9.000.000 d'habitants), ont Ã©tÃ© inclus dans une enquÃªte dont le but principal Ã©tait d'apprÃ©cier la pÃ©nÃ©tration d'un diagnostic et d'une information clinico-pharmacologique corrects dans la pratique de routine.

AB  - Summary Over two decades ago, the St. Vincent Declaration set a 50% reduction of lower-limb amputations as a principal target for patients with diabetes. During this time, enormous strides have been taken in our understanding of diabetic foot disease, the complexities of wound healing and the organization of care to prevent what is one of the most feared complications of the disease. Despite this, we are aware that worldwide, we have not achieved the target set in 1989, with current estimations being that a limb is lost to diabetes somewhere in the world every 30?s. However, it has to be remembered that amputation is a treatment and not a disease, and it is indeed a treatment usually prescribed at the end of a long chronic illness. It is well known that patients whose disease is severe enough for amputation to be considered frequently have other complications of their diabetes, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases and end-stage renal disease, in particular. The life expectancy of the patients is therefore frequently reduced, and their functional status poor even prior to the intervention of surgeons. Just as the functional status of the patients is often a contra-indication to other disease treatments, chemotherapy for some cancers, for example, then we should be considering carefully whether we should be removing limbs from patients whose functional and medical status will not improve significantly as a result. Equally, there may be patients who may benefit from an early amputation and ambulation with a prosthesis. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?Â±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?Â±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?Â±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?Â±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?Â±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?Â±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?Â±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?Â±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?Â±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?Â±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?Â±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?Â±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by UFRRJ Ethics Committee on Animal Research: number 263/2012. Sources of funding:?CNPq, CAPES and FAPERJ. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract Development of an organ and subsequently the whole system from an embryo is a highly integrated process. Although there is evidence that different systems are interconnected during developmental stages, the molecular understanding of this relationship is either not known or only to a limited extent. Nervous system development, amongst all, is maybe the most crucial and complex process. It relies on the correct distribution of specific neuronal growth factors and hormones to the specific receptors. Among the plethora of proteins that are involved in downstream signalling of neuronal growth factors, we find the kinase-D interacting substrate of 220 kDa (KIDINS220), also known as ankyrin-rich repeat membrane spanning (ARMS) protein. KIDINS220 has been shown to play a substantial role in the nervous system and vascular system development as well as in neuronal survival and differentiation. It serves as a downstream regulator for many important neuronal and vascular growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the neurotrophin family, glutamate receptors and ephrin receptors. Moreover, activation and differentiation of B- and T-cells, as well as tumour cell proliferation has also shown to be related to KIDINS220. This review comprehensively summarises the existing research data on this protein, with a particular interest in its role in cancer and in other pathologies.

AB  - Summary Fragility fracture accounts for a large percentage of hospital attendances and admissions in orthopaedic trauma settings. Such fractures occur as a result of weakened bone mainly due to osteoporosis. The majority of this type of fracture occurs in older people who have sustained the injury following minimal trauma or following a fall. The most common reason for hospital admission is following a hip fracture. This chapter considers fragility fracture generally and then focusses on the care of the older following hip fracture. This type of injury presents numerous challenges for the orthopaedic practitioner because it often occurs in frail older people and necessitates surgery followed by a protracted period of rehabilitation. The chapter considers how evidence based practice can be applied to ensuring that this vulnerable group of patients can receive care that is focused on achieving the best outcomes.

AB  - Summary Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for several diseases of the aging brain, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While advancing age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, onset and progression can be strongly influenced by genetics, comorbid conditions, and environmental exposures. Cumulative subconcussive blows, such as those sustained in amateur or professional contact sports, may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite gaps in knowledge, the Committee on Long Term Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of studies, that there was sufficient evidence to support an association between severe TBI and dementia, and a ?suggestive? association between moderate TBI and dementia.

AB  - Summary Changes in physiological parameters that are induced by acute exercise on a treadmill in healthy military dogs have not been thoroughly investigated, especially with regard to age. This study investigated the effects of acute exercise on a treadmill on cardiovascular function, biochemical parameters and gastric antral motility in military dogs. Thermography was used to assess variations in superficial hindlimb muscle temperature. Nine healthy dogs were distributed into three groups according to their age (Group I: 25Â Â±Â 7Â months; Group II: 51Â Â±Â 12Â months; Group III: 95Â Â±Â 10Â months) and sequentially subjected to running exercise on a treadmill for 12Â min (3.2Â km/h at 0Â° incline for 4Â min, 6.4Â km/h at 0Â° incline for 4Â min and 6.4Â km/h at 10Â° incline for 4Â min). Heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), gastric motility, haematocrit and biochemical analyses were performed at rest and after each session of treadmill exercise. Infrared thermographic images of muscles in the pelvic member were taken. Exercise decreased DAP in Group I, increased systolic arterial pressure in Groups II and III and increased mean arterial pressure in Group III (all pÂ <Â 0.05). After the exercise protocol, plasma creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels increased only in Group I (pÂ <Â 0.05). Exercise increased heart rate and decreased the gastric motility of a solid meal at 180Â min in all groups (all pÂ <Â 0.05). Exercise also elevated temperature in the femoral biceps muscles in Group I compared with the older dogs. The results indicate that acute exercise decreased gastric motility in dogs, regardless of age, and caused more pronounced cardiovascular changes in older dogs than in younger dogs. Acute exercise also altered biochemical parameters and superficial hindlimb muscle temperature in younger military dogs.
