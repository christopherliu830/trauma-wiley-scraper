AB  - Abstract Purpose:? The objective of the present study was to identify and report on the key challenges confronted by emergency doctors following the introduction of Computerised Provider Order Entry system in a major metropolitan hospital in Sydney. Basic procedures:? A qualitative study was undertaken during the period May 2006 to December 2006. The study included a series of eight interviews with three senior doctors and one focus group involving six registrars. Participants were chosen on the basis of their experience of planning for, or working with the new electronic ordering system. The study also incorporated five observation sessions and document analysis. Data were analysed iteratively, which led to the identification and elaboration of issues relevant to the research question. Findings:? Three major issues emerged from the findings: (i) the implementation of the new system was accompanied by major shifts in ED work responsibilities and tasks; (ii) the appearance of dysfunctional consequences of the new system related to the excess time it took to electronically order and the usability of some features of the new system; and (iii) doctors' concerns that their views and opinions about the design and implementation of the new system had not been adequately addressed. Conclusion:? The implementation of electronic ordering has important implications for ED functioning and the delivery of patient care. The complexity of the ED makes it vulnerable to disruption caused by inadequate system design and ineffective channels of communication across the hospital.

AB  - Abstract This study utilises multi-isotopic analysis to reconstruct diet and source-water consumption from human remains collected at Carrizales, in the Zaña Valley of northern coastal Peru. Carrizales is a multicomponent site that encompasses the remains of (a) Early Intermediate Period (200?800 CE) cemeteries (Conjuntos 126 and 127), (b) Late Sicán/Lambayeque period (ca. 1100?1350 CE) domestic occupations (Conjuntos 125, 128, and 131), and (c) a planned town (reducción) into which indigenous people were resettled under Spanish rule, ca. 1572 CE (Conjunto 123). Faunal and botanical assemblages at the site differ significantly between the Late Sicán/Lambayeque and early colonial phases, suggesting a distinct shift in local subsistence regimes following Spanish colonisation and resettlement. Human remains were collected from Carrizales for the characterisation of dietary isotopes and further examination of the impacts of Spanish colonialism on native foodways. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope values were characterised in the enamel carbonate, bone carbonate, and bone collagen of individuals associated with Early Intermediate Period contexts (N = 4) and the late 16th century chapel within the site's reducción (N = 21). Over half of the study sample failed to produce viable bone collagen, an issue that is common in bioarchaeological samples from the north coast of Peru. However, among those with viable bone collagen and carbonate, there were minimal differences in δ13C, δ18O, and δ15N values between the two phases. This extends to values in enamel carbonate, which is highly resistant to diagenesis. Therefore, patterns in isotope values do not mirror the significant differences manifest in food remains from Carrizales. We suggest that (a) the diets of Early Intermediate Period individuals and Early Colonial period individuals buried at the site were quite similar, contrasting with the patterns indicated by Late Intermediate Period food remains, and (b) both populations obtained water from similar sources?a pattern that reinforces the characterisation of reducción in the Zaña Valley as a relatively local phenomenon in which nearby populations were concentrated into planned towns, rather than drawn from distant valleys.

AB  - Abstract? The microsurgical application of a pulsed ruby laser used in conjunction with a multi-objective microscope is discussed. Some design criteria and various technical and practical problems relating to such use of a laser-microscope complex are considered. Control of the volumetric energy density at the specimen by means of the instrumentation variables is established on the basis of systematic studies conducted on a stained protein ?model tissue?. The instrumentation variables offering the greatest degree of control are the beam energy, the objective focal length, and the degree of defocusing of the laser beam. Results of the ?model tissue? study enable one to predict in advance the size and severity of destructive effect that will be produced in thin layers of green plant tissue using a particular combination of variables. A judicious extension of these results enables single cell and intracellular microsurgery to be performed with precision. In addition, various biological tests and experiments were conducted in order to determine the applicability of a laser-microscope system to biological research and to delineate its limitations.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of hypocobalaminaemia in cats with moderate to severe hyperthyroidism and to investigate the relationship between cobalamin status and selected haematologic parameters. Methods: Serum cobalamin concentrations were measured in 76 spontaneously hyperthyroid cats [serum thyroxine (T4) concentration ≥100 nmol/L] and 100 geriatric euthyroid cats. Erythrocyte and neutrophil counts in hyperthyroid cats with hypocobalaminaemia were compared with those in hyperthyroid cats with adequate serum cobalamin concentrations (≥290 ng/L). Results: The median cobalamin concentration in hyperthyroid cats was lower than the control group (409 versus 672 ng/L; P=0·0040). In addition, 40·8% of hyperthyroid cats had subnormal serum cobalamin concentrations compared with 25% of controls (P=0·0336). Weak negative correlation (coefficient: ?0·3281) was demonstrated between serum cobalamin and T4 concentrations in the hyperthyroid population, and the median cobalamin concentration was lower in cats with T4 above the median of 153 nmol/L compared with cats with T4 below this value (P=0·0281). Hypocobalaminaemia was not associated with neutropenia or anaemia in hyperthyroid cats. Clinical Significance: This study indicates that a substantial proportion of cats with T4≥100 nmol/L are hypocobalaminaemic and suggests that hyperthyroidism directly or indirectly affects cobalamin uptake, excretion or utilisation in this species.

AB  - Summary? The aim was to systematically review and find evidence to determine when to extract deciduous teeth and place implants in young individuals with tooth agenesis. A search was made in MEDLINE on combinations of the terms ?tooth agenesis?, ?deciduous teeth? and ?dental implants?. Publications with an abstract and written in the English language only were included. To give a background to the clinical management of young individuals with agenesis of teeth, publications on epidemiology of tooth agenesis, persistence of deciduous teeth, treatment outcomes after multi-disciplinary treatment planning and experiences of treatment with dental implants in young individuals were also reviewed. A search on the terms ?tooth agenesis?, ?deciduous teeth? and ?dental implants? resulted in nine references and a search on ?dental implants? and ?tooth agenesis? gave 132 references; 46 met the inclusion criteria. Only two were prospective studies on treatment with implants in young individuals. A vast majority of publications on the clinical management of young individuals with tooth agenesis are reflections of clinical experiences and single case reports. Deciduous teeth are extracted for different reasons and at different ages in an optimal plan for a good treatment result from aesthetic and functional point of view. For ethical reasons, randomized clinical trials on when to extract deciduous teeth and place implants cannot be made in young individuals. There was only limited, low level evidence on when to extract deciduous teeth and place implants. Recommendations on treatment are based mainly on clinical experience.

AB  - Abstract Foot infections are common in persons with diabetes and are often the proximate cause of lower extremity amputation. There have been many publications in the past few years dealing with the appropriate ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections. This review presents information gathered from a comprehensive, ongoing surveillance of the literature (published and abstracts) over the past 4 years. Prospective studies have now defined the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections, as well as methods to score and classify the wounds. Several recently published guidelines can assist clinicians in managing these infections. The etiologic agents of infection have been well-defined, and the prevalence of multi-drug-resistance pathogens is growing. Molecular methods offer great promise for quicker and more sensitive diagnosis of infection. New antimicrobial agents, both systemic and topical, as well as novel local treatments, have been shown to be effective in various studies. Improved methods of deploying older agents have added to the variety of treatment approaches now available. Several adjunctive treatments may benefit some patients but their role is as yet unclear. While there is much yet to learn about the most cost-effective ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections the main effort is now to disseminate the available information and facilitate employing the evidence-based guideline recommendations.

AB  - BACKGROUND Perineal urethrostomy is a surgical method for alleviating urethral obstruction in cats with complicated or recurrent obstructive feline lower urinary tract disease. However, long-term outcome of perineal urethrostomy in cats with feline lower urinary tract disease has only been described in studies with relatively few cats. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis, recurrent episodes, quality of life and survival times in cats with feline lower urinary tract disease who underwent perineal urethrostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data was collected from 86 cats from medical records, including 75 cats with at least 6 months survival, whose owners responded by questionnaire-based telephone interviews. RESULTS Long-term follow-up ranged from 1·0 to 10·4 years. The median survival time for all cats was 3·5 years after surgery. Forty-seven cats were still alive at the time of the study. Five cats (5·8%) did not survive the first 14 days after perineal urethrostomy surgery; another six cats (7·0%) did not survive 6 months. Seventy-five cats (87%) lived longer than 6 months; 45 (60%) of these were asymptomatic after surgery; 8 of 75 cats (10·7%) experienced severe signs of recurrent feline lower urinary tract disease. For 19 cats, data were available for more than 6 years. Among these, 13 cats were still alive at the time of this study. The six non-surviving cats had all been euthanased for diseases unrelated to the urinary tract. Eighty-eight percent of the owners categorised their cat's long-term quality of life as good. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study shows that long-term quality of life after perineal urethrostomy in cats with obstructive feline lower urinary tract disease is good (as assessed by owners) and the recurrence rate is low.

AB  - Summary Linear ubiquitination is a post-translational protein modification recently discovered to be crucial for innate and adaptive immune signaling. The function of linear ubiquitin chains is regulated at multiple levels: generation, recognition, and removal. These chains are generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), the only known ubiquitin E3 capable of forming the linear ubiquitin linkage de novo. LUBAC is not only relevant for activation of nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in various signaling pathways, but importantly, it also regulates cell death downstream of immune receptors capable of inducing this response. Recognition of the linear ubiquitin linkage is specifically mediated by certain ubiquitin receptors, which is crucial for translation into the intended signaling outputs. LUBAC deficiency results in attenuated gene activation and increased cell death, causing pathologic conditions in both, mice, and humans. Removal of ubiquitin chains is mediated by deubiquitinases (DUBs). Two of them, OTULIN and CYLD, are constitutively associated with LUBAC. Here, we review the current knowledge on linear ubiquitination in immune signaling pathways and the biochemical mechanisms as to how linear polyubiquitin exerts its functions distinctly from those of other ubiquitin linkage types.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Bone remodeling is characterized as a cyclic and lengthy process. It is currently accepted that not only this dynamics is triggered by a biological process, but also biochemical, electrical, and mechanical stimuli are key factors for the maintenance of bone tissue. The hypothesis that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) may favor bone repair has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bone repair in defects created in rat lower jaws after stimulation with infrared LLLT directly on the injured tissue. Study Design/Materials and Methods Bone defects were prepared on the mandibles of 30 Holtzman rats allocated in two groups (n?=?15), which were divided in three evaluation period (15, 45, and 60 days), with five animals each. control group?no treatment of the defect; laser group?single laser irradiation with a GaAlAs semiconductor diode laser device (??=?780 nm; P?=?35 mW; t?=?40 s; Θ?=?1.0 mm; D?=?178 J/cm2; E?=?1.4 J) directly on the defect area. The rats were sacrificed at the pre-established periods and the mandibles were removed and processed for staining with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's Trichrome and picrosirius techniques. Results The histological results showed bone formation in both groups. However, the laser group exhibited an advanced tissue response compared to the control group, abbreviating the initial inflammatory reaction and promoting rapid new bone matrix formation at 15 and 45 days (P<0.05). On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the groups at 60 days. Conclusion The use of infrared LLLT directly to the injured tissue showed a biostimulating effect on bone remodeling by stimulating the modulation of the initial inflammatory response and anticipating the resolution to normal conditions at the earlier periods. However, there were no differences between the groups at 60 days. Lasers Surg. Med. 39:788?796, 2007. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little is reported about the successes and challenges experienced by veterinary surgeons while managing cases of laminitis. Such information could enhance the effectiveness of communication of management and preventive health strategies for laminitis. Objectives To explore veterinary surgeons? experiences of dealing with laminitis and examine how veterinary?client communication influences the treatment and management of cases. Study design Focus group discussions conducted among first-opinion equine veterinary surgeons. Methods First-opinion ambulatory veterinary practices from Cheshire (n?=?15), Lancashire (n?=?14) and the Rutland region (n?=?14) were identified. Letters of invitation were sent and all practices were telephoned to invite veterinary surgeons to participate in the study. Key questions relating to laminitis were explored within semi-structured focus group discussions: veterinary perceptions of laminitis information, reasons for horse-owners? seeking veterinary advice, veterinary perceptions of horse-owners? knowledge, attitudes and practices, situations where the advice of other professionals may be sought. All discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Results Three focus group discussions were held with veterinary surgeons with a range of experience; 2 in the North West (9 vets) and one in Rutland (4 vets). Emerging themes relating to veterinary surgeons? experience of dealing with laminitis included; veterinary?client communication, challenges faced by vets, managing clients perceptions and expectations, client recognition and management of laminitis, feeding and obesity management, issues of compliance, causes of laminitis, strategies to prevent laminitis, diagnosing, treating and prognosticating in laminitis cases, sources of veterinary information and collaboration with other professionals. Conclusions The findings illustrate key features of the veterinary?client relationship in supporting owners through the variable course of this disease. This study demonstrates the complexity of issues that veterinary surgeons may encounter when managing cases of laminitis and communicating healthcare messages to the client.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine general anaesthesia carries a higher risk of perioperative fatality compared with humans and companion animals. Multiple studies have examined the risk factors associated with general anaesthesia, most notably the ongoing confidential enquiry into perioperative equine fatalities (CEPEF) studies initially published by Johnston et?al. [1]. Desflurane is a modern inhalational anaesthetic with low solubility and potentially beneficial reduced cardiorespiratory effects, but its use in a large number of horses has not been investigated. Objectives To evaluate the perioperative mortality rates of horses undergoing general anaesthesia maintained using desflurane. Study design Retrospective analysis. Methods Anaesthetic records of all horses undergoing general anaesthesia over a 4-year period at a single hospital were retrospectively examined. Horses were excluded if general anaesthesia was not maintained using inhaled desflurane. Outcome variables of dead (anaesthetic related), alive or euthanased (for other reasons) were recorded consistent with previous CEPEF studies. Results 427 horses met the inclusion criteria, of which 406 (95.1%) were alive at 7 days post operatively, 16 (3.7%) were euthanased and 5 (1.2%) died. Four of the perioperative fatalities suffered cardiac arrest, one suffered a catastrophic fracture. Mean age was 7.6 years (range 1 month?26 years), mean weight was 503.3?kg (range 60?828?kg). Mean duration of anaesthesia was 63.0?min (range 15?200?min). Mean recovery time to standing was 28.3?min (range 5?70?min) with mean recovery score 1.4/5 (range 1?4). Conclusions Use of desflurane led to comparable mortality rates to other inhalational anaesthetics in this small number of horses at a single hospital. Further multicentre studies with larger numbers are warranted to examine any potential benefits.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of equine lameness frequently requires a period of rest and restricted exercise. The financial impact of restricted exercise should be considered when making investigation and treatment decisions. Objectives To describe and quantify the cost and time commitment associated with horse maintenance in the UK and to quantify the incidence of lameness and number of days of exercise lost. Study design Online survey of UK horse owners. Methods An online survey was performed between June and November 2013. The questionnaire contained 35 open and closed questions related to 1) owner age, gender, geographical location; and 2) type and use of horse, purchase price, location, travel, healthcare and maintenance costs; and 3) lameness episodes within the last 12 months. Results 560 respondents fully completed the questionnaire, 98.2% were female aged between 16 and 54 years old. Horses (62.5% geldings, 37.1% mares, 0.8% stallions) were of mixed breed with a median age of 13 years. Horses were predominantly used for general purpose riding. Most horses were kept on or within 5 miles of the owner's residence (77.4%) and 65% of owners spent >10?h per week on horse maintenance. Median basic maintenance cost was £2660 per year or £7.29 per day including routine healthcare, dentistry, farriery, feed, housing, and insurance fees. Most horses (71.3%) experienced an episode of lameness within the previous 12 months. The median duration of restricted exercise (days wasted) was 70 (range 0?880) days. Conclusions This unique dataset quantifies the financial and time outlay required with horse ownership. Determining the number of wasted days and basic average cost per day has allowed us to quantify the cost of inactivity. Considerable cost is associated with a period of inactivity following an episode of lameness, which should be taken into account when considering investigation and treatment options. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow. Sources of funding:?The Geoffrey Serth Charitable Trust. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With the aim of evaluating predictive power, three simple screening tests as alternates to nerve conduction tests for diagnosing diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) were investigated. Results of the screening tests, along with the subjects' demographic and clinical characteristics, were planned as the variables for the development of a risk assessment tool for predicting DPN. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional multi-group comparison study. The study utilized a predictive model derived from one subset of the study population, and prospectively tested in the other subset to predict the presence of neuropathy. SETTING: Diabetic Neuropathy Research Clinic of the Toronto General Hospital and University Health Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from June 1998 to August 1999. Sample population: data come from 478 subjects consisting of non-diabetic reference subjects, and patients with type I and type 2 diabetes mellitus. OUTCOME MEASURES: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) comprised the primary defined outcome. The three screening sensory tests examined in the study were the Semmes-Weinstein 10 g monofilament examination (SWME), superficial pain sensation, and vibration by the on-off method. RESULTS: The three screening tests are significantly and positively correlated with NCS. An increase in the number of insensate responses in the screening test is associated with an increase in the abnormal NCS score. The strength of the association between NCS and each sensory test was greater when the neuropathy severity stage of the subject was added to the model. Both the SWME and vibration by the on-off method tests demonstrated sufficient statistical power to differentiate non-diabetic control subjects from subjects with diabetes, as well as to differentiate subjects with diabetes with and without neuropathy. These two tests, when compared with NCS, also demonstrated acceptable diagnostic performance characteristics in terms of high sensitivity and specificity, total number of correctly predicted cases, and receiver-operating characteristic curves. CONCLUSION: This data, through the development of a model involving training and validation sets, demonstrates that the knowledge of clinical risk factors alters the interpretation of sensory tests for DPN. This finding lends further support to the validity of simple sensory testing maneuvers in the conditional diagnosis of DPN. We recommend annual screening with either the SWME or vibration by the on-off method in the primary care and diabetes clinics.

AB  - Objectives To investigate thalidomide as an adjuvant treatment for canine haemangiosarcoma. Materials and Methods Fifteen dogs with splenic haemangiosarcoma, initially treated by splenectomy, were included. Following recovery from surgery, all dogs received thalidomide continuously until their death. Tumour stage was established using CT scans of the chest and abdomen immediately before starting thalidomide treatment and again three months later. Cause of death was confirmed by post mortem examination. Results The median survival time of dogs receiving thalidomide was 172?days (95% confidence interval: 93 to 250?days). Five dogs (33% of the population receiving thalidomide) survived more than 1 year (range 458 to 660?days) after surgery. Dogs with stage 2 disease that received thalidomide also had a longer survival time than dogs with stage 3 disease (median survival time 303 versus 40?days). Of 15 dogs, 13 died from metastatic haemangiosarcoma. Clinical Significance Treatment using thalidomide may improve survival of dogs with splenic haemangiosarcoma and should be considered a possible adjuvant therapy.

AB  - Abstract Aims To report the findings of a multidisciplinary group of scientists focusing on issues in basic science and translational research related to female pelvic floor disorders, and to produce recommendations for a research agenda for investigators studying female pelvic floor disorders. Methods A National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored meeting was held on November 14?15, 2002, bringing together scientists in diverse fields including obstetrics, gynecology, urogynecology, urology, gastroenterology, biomechanical engineering, neuroscience, endocrinology, and molecular biology. Recent and ongoing studies were presented and discussed, key gaps in knowledge were identified, and recommendations were made for research that would have the highest impact in making advances in the field of female pelvic floor disorders. Results The meeting included presentations and discussion on the use of animal models to better understand physiology and pathophysiology; neuromuscular injury (such as at childbirth) as a possible pathogenetic factor and mechanisms for recovery of function after injury; the use of biomechanical concepts and imaging to better understand the relationship between structure and function; and molecular and biochemical mechanisms that may underlie the development of female pelvic floor disorders. Conclusions While the findings of current research will help elucidate the pathophysiologic pathways leading to the development of female pelvic floor disorders, much more research is needed for full understanding that will result in better care for patients through specific rather than empiric therapy, and lead to the potential for prevention on primary and secondary levels. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To compare thawing times of fresh frozen canine plasma between a 37?°C warm water bath, running water bath and dry plasma thawer and compare haemostatic protein stability after thawing in a warm water bath or dry plasma thawer. Materials and Methods To measure thawing times, a 240-mL bag of frozen plasma was thawed in warm water bath, running water bath or dry plasma thawer-10 times for each method. To evaluate stability of haemostatic proteins, fresh canine donor plasma samples were split into 120-mL bags and 3-mL control aliquots before freezing. Bags were thawed by warm water bath or dry plasma thawer and aliquots equilibrated to room temperature. Concentrations of haemostatic proteins, albumin, D-dimers, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were obtained. Results The running water bath had the shortest thaw time: median thaw time of 15?minutes versus 18?minutes for both the dry plasma thawer and warm water bath. Statistically significant differences in partial thromboplastin time, factor VII, factor X, von Willebrand factor, and von Willebrand factor collagen binding assay were detected among groups but were unlikely to be clinically relevant. Clinical Significance A traditional running water bath provided the fastest thawing time but the dry plasma thawer resulted in the most stable haemostatic proteins.

AB  - An eight-year-old, spayed, female golden retriever was presented with progressive right hindlimb lameness and polyuria/polydipsia. Multiple soft tissue masses were palpable within the hindlimb muscles. A tentative diagnosis of sarcoma was made on fine needle aspiration. A computed tomography scan of the hindlimb and thorax confirmed the presence and location of the masses, none of which were associated with the bones of the hindlimb. In addition, two pulmonary lesions were identified in the right cranial lung lobe. A diagnosis of chondrosarcoma was confirmed on histopathology with a final diagnosis of extraskeletal chondrosarcoma. A high, hindlimb amputation was performed, and chemotherapy was initiated. Polyuria and polydipsia resolved 2 weeks postoperatively. Numerous lung lesions, suspected to be metastases were found on routine followup radiographs, 73 days post surgery after which the dog was lost to follow-up.
