AB  - Reasons for performing study We have already demonstrated that vaccination with empty BPV1 capsids termed virus-like particles (VLP) protects horses from experimental infection with BPV1 virion. Long-term monitoring of antibody titres in experimental horses and data from other species suggest that this protection is long lasting. Objectives To test protection against experimental infection with BPV-1 virion in horses that were vaccinated with BPV-1 L1 VLP approximately 5 years earlier. Study design Controlled experiment. Methods Seven horses, vaccinated 3 times (boosters after 4 weeks and 6 months) in 2007/2008 with doses of BPV1 L1 VLP ranging from 50??g to 150??g/dose and 3 unvaccinated control horses were challenged by intra-dermal inoculation with cow wart derived BPV1 virion (5???107 BPV-1 virions per wheal, 10 wheals per horse). Inoculation sites were monitored for 10 weeks. Blood for serum antibody titre determination by pseudovirion neutralisation assay was taken on the day of challenge and after 6 months. Results Six of 7 vaccinated horses had measurable serum antibody titres (1:50 to 1:400). These titres were boosted by inoculation (about one step of dilution). Two of 3 unvaccinated controls remained sero-negative. One control horse showed sero-conversion. All control horses developed tumours at all 10 inoculation sites. Tumours appeared approximately 2 weeks after inoculation and reached maximum sizes of up to 8?mm. Regression was complete by 8 weeks after their first appearance in all horses. All vaccinated horses remained completely free from tumours. No influence of dose rate or antibody titre on the level of protection could be determined. Conclusions BPV-1 L1 VLP vaccination proves to be fully effective in protecting horses from experimental infection and tumour formation 5 years post immunisation. The protection was complete even in horses with low or unmeasurable antibody titres. This is another step towards establishing a vaccination against equine sarcoids.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Most complications in equine castrations result from insufficient ligation and contamination. Objectives Stapling instruments reduce tissue handling, decrease surgical time, minimise contamination and provide secure visceral and vascular closure when used correctly. Using a stapler device might therefore increase ligation security and decrease contamination, and by this, reduce the complication rate seen in routine castration. Study design The applicability and safety of a TA-30 premium stapler as a ligation method in castration of the horse was tested in 15 horses under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency. Three horses were cryptorchids, one horse suffered a scirrous chord, and one horse suffered an infectious orchitis. Methods The vaginal process was approached inguinally. A noncutting emasculator was applied to compress the closed vaginal process. Consecutively a TA-30 Premium stapler was applied to the compressed site. The distal part of the vaginal process was then removed, the stapler device was released and the incision was closed. The TA-30 stapler accommodates 3 different staple cartridges of 30?mm width, accommodating 1.0 to 2.5?mm tissue thickness. The thickness of the vaginal process after compression was measured to be 1.0?mm (0.9?1.1?mm) in 10 fresh specimens. The 30-V3 cartridges (triple row, 1?mm closed diameter) were chosen in 9 horses with smaller vaginal processes and the 30-3.5 cartridges (double row 1.5?mm closed diameter) in 6 other horses with larger vaginal processes. Results All horses recovered without intra- or post operative complications. Conclusions A TA-30 stapler is a safe ligation instrument in equine castrations. The use of titanium staples may reduce infection rate in routine castrations, even more in ligation of precontaminated vaginal processes in cases of post operative haemorrhage control after practice castrations or in closing the vaginal process after the removal of an infected testis or scirrous chord.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It is unknown how students develop lameness assessment skills. Objectives To quantify student performance, visual approaches and attitudes to lameness evaluation. Study design Comparison of student cohorts. Methods Twenty 3rd year (inexperienced cohort) and thirteen 4th to 5th year (experienced cohort) students evaluated 30 video clips showing horses on the straight line or circle, followed by a general questionnaire. Eyetracking records (Tobii X102) were collected in parallel. The percentage of correctly evaluated horses was calculated based on verified expert opinion. From the eyetracking records on the straight line, the percentage time spent on different regions on the horse was calculated and compared between cohorts. Results For both cohorts, while the correct detection of lameness per se was high (median ≥92%), detection of the correct limb was lower (median 40?80% depending on quarters and cohort) and detection of sound horses was at chance level (median?=?50%). The correct limb was indicated significantly more often by the experienced cohort (P?≤?0.032) except for forelimb lameness on the circle (P?=?0.053). The inexperienced cohort dedicated more time to looking at limb movement, while the experienced cohort focused on head and pelvis movement. Students judged their expected task performance realistically, on average underestimating themselves slightly by around 8%. The task difficulty was rated as a mean (s.d.) of 4.10 (0.48) out of 5 by the inexperienced and 3.35 (0.47) by the experienced cohort. Conclusions Lameness detection skills evolve and improve over the course of the curriculum, with a shift from limb assessment to upper body assessment. Students must learn to reliably determine soundness, and hindlimb lameness proved more difficult than forelimb lameness. Students find lameness detection comparatively difficult, but have a realistic understanding of their skill level, suggesting that they can determine their needs for further practice.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in horses has not been evaluated. Objectives 1) To establish a technique for measuring MPS?in vivo in the horse using a labelled amino acid tracer and 2) to determine basal MPS in the horse using this technique. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg bwt D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) i.v. and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?h. Pharmacokinetic modelling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% plasma enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6?h of infusion and the effect of treadmill exercise and sedation (0.4?mg/kg bwt) were also determined. Horses subsequently received the calculated D5-Phe infusion rate and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were collected after 1 and 3?h, allowing basal MPS to be calculated. Precursor intramuscular phe labelling was measured by GC-MS and tracer phe incorporation into muscle myofibrillar protein was determined using GC-pyrolysis-IRMS to calculate fractional synthetic rate. Results The mean rate of whole body phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56??mol/kg bwt/h (s.d. 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41??mol/kg bwt (s.d. 8.8). From this a priming dose of 3.3??mol/kg bwt and an infusion rate of 4.5??mol/kg bwt/h D5-Phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently confirmed to achieve steady state tracer enrichment from 5.6?9.1 APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). D5-Phe incorporation revealed a basal FSR of 0.029%/h (s.d. 0.013) in the horse. Conclusions D5-Phenylalanine is a suitable amino acid tracer for measurement of MPS in the horse yielding rates of MPS in line with other large mammals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Interpretation of clinical diagnostic imaging of the equine musculoskeletal system requires accurate reference anatomical materials. In the case of MRI, this includes images acquired from low and high field systems. Using ultra-high field MRI, higher resolution images with small slice thickness and gap suitable for reconstruction in any anatomical plane can be produced. Objectives To describe the normal equine metacarpophalangeal joint using ultra-high field MRI and compare ultra-high and high field MR images. Study design Limbs (n?=?14) from horses (n?=?5) with no history of orthopaedic disease were frozen at -20°C until imaging. Fetlock joints were scanned using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI unit. T1 (280 slices, thickness?=?0.356?mm) and T2 (140 slices, thickness?=?0.713?mm) weighted sequences were acquired. Limbs were scanned using a 1.5T MRI unit in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes using T1 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) and T2 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) sequences. Images were analysed using OsiriX software. Results Ultra-high field MR images visualised the fine detail of trabecular and subchondral bone, the articular cartilage surface of P1 and McIII, the short, oblique, straight and oblique sesamoidean ligaments including origins and insertions, the fasicular structure of superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon and ligaments and the regional neurovascular structures. Whilst T1 high field images visualised the majority of tissues, structural detail was reduced compared to ultra-high field imaging, margins were less well defined in some instances, e.g. articular cartilage, and a number of smaller structures were indistinct, e.g. short and cruciate sesamoidean ligaments. Conclusions 7T MRI produced images of the fetlock with excellent anatomical detail. Future publication of open-source ultra-high field MRI files could aid the interpretation of 0.3T and 1.5T field MR images, especially with the capacity to reconstruct image slices orientated exactly to match those of interest.

AB  - Abstract Background Enormous progress has been made in recent decades in our understanding of lead neurotoxicology in children, but an important obstacle to additional progress is the striking variability that is evident in any plot of a lead biomarker versus a health endpoint. Methods In this article, three potential sources of variability are identified: (1) errors or imprecision in characterizing dose (and/or outcome); (2) incomplete characterization of endpoint variance attributable to factors other than lead; and (3) inter-individual differences in susceptibility to lead neurotoxicity. Results Strategies are suggested for reducing the variability contributed by these sources, including the development of validated PBPK models and biomarkers of early biological effects; the development of more comprehensive models of outcome variance and, specifically, the application of multi-level models that incorporate supra-individual and supra-family risk factors; and the use of study designs that permit assessments of the effect modifying influence of contextual factors on the form and severity of neurotoxicity. Conclusion Decomposing the variability in the distribution of observed scores around the best-fit lines that describe the dose?effect relationships for lead neurotoxicity in children is a major research need.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little is reported about the successes and challenges experienced by veterinary surgeons while managing cases of laminitis. Such information could enhance the effectiveness of communication of management and preventive health strategies for laminitis. Objectives To explore veterinary surgeons? experiences of dealing with laminitis and examine how veterinary?client communication influences the treatment and management of cases. Study design Focus group discussions conducted among first-opinion equine veterinary surgeons. Methods First-opinion ambulatory veterinary practices from Cheshire (n?=?15), Lancashire (n?=?14) and the Rutland region (n?=?14) were identified. Letters of invitation were sent and all practices were telephoned to invite veterinary surgeons to participate in the study. Key questions relating to laminitis were explored within semi-structured focus group discussions: veterinary perceptions of laminitis information, reasons for horse-owners? seeking veterinary advice, veterinary perceptions of horse-owners? knowledge, attitudes and practices, situations where the advice of other professionals may be sought. All discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Results Three focus group discussions were held with veterinary surgeons with a range of experience; 2 in the North West (9 vets) and one in Rutland (4 vets). Emerging themes relating to veterinary surgeons? experience of dealing with laminitis included; veterinary?client communication, challenges faced by vets, managing clients perceptions and expectations, client recognition and management of laminitis, feeding and obesity management, issues of compliance, causes of laminitis, strategies to prevent laminitis, diagnosing, treating and prognosticating in laminitis cases, sources of veterinary information and collaboration with other professionals. Conclusions The findings illustrate key features of the veterinary?client relationship in supporting owners through the variable course of this disease. This study demonstrates the complexity of issues that veterinary surgeons may encounter when managing cases of laminitis and communicating healthcare messages to the client.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine general anaesthesia carries a higher risk of perioperative fatality compared with humans and companion animals. Multiple studies have examined the risk factors associated with general anaesthesia, most notably the ongoing confidential enquiry into perioperative equine fatalities (CEPEF) studies initially published by Johnston et?al. [1]. Desflurane is a modern inhalational anaesthetic with low solubility and potentially beneficial reduced cardiorespiratory effects, but its use in a large number of horses has not been investigated. Objectives To evaluate the perioperative mortality rates of horses undergoing general anaesthesia maintained using desflurane. Study design Retrospective analysis. Methods Anaesthetic records of all horses undergoing general anaesthesia over a 4-year period at a single hospital were retrospectively examined. Horses were excluded if general anaesthesia was not maintained using inhaled desflurane. Outcome variables of dead (anaesthetic related), alive or euthanased (for other reasons) were recorded consistent with previous CEPEF studies. Results 427 horses met the inclusion criteria, of which 406 (95.1%) were alive at 7 days post operatively, 16 (3.7%) were euthanased and 5 (1.2%) died. Four of the perioperative fatalities suffered cardiac arrest, one suffered a catastrophic fracture. Mean age was 7.6 years (range 1 month?26 years), mean weight was 503.3?kg (range 60?828?kg). Mean duration of anaesthesia was 63.0?min (range 15?200?min). Mean recovery time to standing was 28.3?min (range 5?70?min) with mean recovery score 1.4/5 (range 1?4). Conclusions Use of desflurane led to comparable mortality rates to other inhalational anaesthetics in this small number of horses at a single hospital. Further multicentre studies with larger numbers are warranted to examine any potential benefits.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of equine lameness frequently requires a period of rest and restricted exercise. The financial impact of restricted exercise should be considered when making investigation and treatment decisions. Objectives To describe and quantify the cost and time commitment associated with horse maintenance in the UK and to quantify the incidence of lameness and number of days of exercise lost. Study design Online survey of UK horse owners. Methods An online survey was performed between June and November 2013. The questionnaire contained 35 open and closed questions related to 1) owner age, gender, geographical location; and 2) type and use of horse, purchase price, location, travel, healthcare and maintenance costs; and 3) lameness episodes within the last 12 months. Results 560 respondents fully completed the questionnaire, 98.2% were female aged between 16 and 54 years old. Horses (62.5% geldings, 37.1% mares, 0.8% stallions) were of mixed breed with a median age of 13 years. Horses were predominantly used for general purpose riding. Most horses were kept on or within 5 miles of the owner's residence (77.4%) and 65% of owners spent >10?h per week on horse maintenance. Median basic maintenance cost was £2660 per year or £7.29 per day including routine healthcare, dentistry, farriery, feed, housing, and insurance fees. Most horses (71.3%) experienced an episode of lameness within the previous 12 months. The median duration of restricted exercise (days wasted) was 70 (range 0?880) days. Conclusions This unique dataset quantifies the financial and time outlay required with horse ownership. Determining the number of wasted days and basic average cost per day has allowed us to quantify the cost of inactivity. Considerable cost is associated with a period of inactivity following an episode of lameness, which should be taken into account when considering investigation and treatment options.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the effects of intravenous (IV) magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) as a bolus followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) on anaesthetic requirements, neuroendocrine stress response to surgery, haemostasis and postoperative analgesia in healthy dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study design? Blinded randomized clinical trial. Animals? Sixteen female dogs. Methods? After intramuscular premedication with acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) and morphine (0.3?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was induced with diazepam (0.2?mg?kg?1) and propofol (2?mg?kg?1) intravenously and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen in all dogs. Dogs were randomly assigned to two groups, M and C. Group M received MgSO4 (50?mg?kg?1 over 15?minutes, followed by a 15?mg?kg?1?hour?1 CRI). Group C received an equivalent bolus and CRI of lactated Ringer?s solution. In addition, all dogs received lactated Ringer?s solution (10?mL?kg?1 over 15?minutes followed by 10?mL?kg?1?hour?1). End-tidal isoflurane and carbon dioxide tensions, cardio-respiratory variables, arterial blood gases, electrolytes, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were measured at different time points. Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed pre- and post-anaesthesia. Postoperative pain was evaluated using the short form of the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale. Data were analysed with repeated measures anova and Mann?Whitney U tests (p?<?0.05). Results? No statistically significant differences between groups were found in any of the measured variables. However, the alpha angle and maximal amplitude recorded by TEG in group M were significantly increased post-anaesthesia, but remained within the reference interval. One dog in Group M and two in Group C received rescue analgesia during recovery. Conclusions and clinical relevance? As used in this study, MgSO4 failed to decrease isoflurane requirements, postoperative pain and stress hormone concentrations; however, it did not produce any cardio-respiratory or major haemostatic side effects. Administration of intravenous MgSO4 together with an opioid during ovariohysterectomy in dogs does not seem to provide any clinical advantage.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Insulin resistance (IR) can be difficult to diagnose from basal insulin and glucose concentrations, so a field-based oral sugar test (OST) is preferred. However, the repeatability of this test has not been reported. Objectives To determine the repeatability of an in-feed OST in ponies. Study design A repeated measures, longitudinal study. Methods Eight mixed-breed ponies received an in-feed OST at 08.00?h, after an overnight fast, once weekly for 3 weeks. D-glucose powder (0.75?g/kg bwt), wheat bran (200?g) and water (500?ml) were combined, and mixed with lucerne chaff (0.3% bwt). Blood samples were taken before, and 90 and 180?min after, feeding. All meals were consumed. Blood glucose concentration was determined immediately and serum was obtained for insulin determination by equine-specific ELISA. Fasting glucose, insulin and glucose:insulin ratios were used to classify ponies as IR, compensated IR or normal on each occasion and the results were compared to the OST. Results Diagnosis of IR from basal values was consistent in only 3/8 ponies, with a large mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 51% for baseline insulin, across tests. The OST results were repeatable in 7/8 ponies, with mean CV at 25% for the 90?min insulin sample (CV for 7 ponies: 19%). The OST was repeatable on 2/3 occasions in the eighth pony, however, resting hyperinsulinaemia meant that IR was diagnosed on 3/3 occasions using basal values in this pony. There was significant (P<0.05) variability in insulin concentration at 180?min, but not 90?min, across tests. Conclusions An OST is more repeatable when assessing IR in ponies than basal values/ratios. Both resting hyperinsulinaemia and insulin responses to oral sugar can be assessed with the OST, which increases the likelihood of accurately diagnosing IR. Blood sampling at 90?min post feeding is recommended for more consistent results.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Commingling of horses from various populations, together with stress associated with transport and confinement at a sales complex, may predispose horses to EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Current information on the prevalence and associated risk factors of EHV-1 and -4 in South Africa is limited. Relevant research could enhance scientific-based risk management strategies for horses attending sales events. Objectives Detect nasal shedding of EHV-1 and -4 at a sales event. Identify the temporal pattern of viral shedding. Investigate the association between clinical signs and EHV-1 and -4 shedding. Identify risk factors for EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Data was collected over a 9 day period during August 2013 at the National Two Year Old Sales in Germiston, South Africa. The study population included 90 Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) in their second year of life that originated from 8 studs situated in 3 provinces. Nasal swabs were collected from each horse on arrival and on departure from the event. During their stay horses were monitored twice daily for pyrexia and once daily for nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected daily from any horse with nasal discharge and/or pyrexia. Nasal swabs were submitted for qPCR to detect EHV-1 and -4. Results No EHV-1 shedding was detected; however, 14.4% of the population shed EHV-4. A biphasic shedding pattern with peaks one day post arrival and on the first day of auction was observed. Pyrexia, with or without nasal discharge, was observed prior to first shedding in 61.5% of EHV-4-positive horses. Province, associated longer travel duration and smaller resident horse populations on farms of origin were associated with increased risk of EHV-4 shedding. Conclusions Young Thoroughbreds consigned to a South African sale shed EHV-4. Pyrexia proved useful to identify impending EHV-4 shedding. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of the University of Pretoria (Study V040-13). Informed, written consent for participation was obtained from the owners of each of the studs included in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are approximately 100 million working equids in developing countries worldwide. These animals? role in impoverished communities is generally unrecognised by national and international policy makers and their needs are overlooked in national animal health systems. Additionally, despite increased international development attention on women and livestock, the specific contributions of equids to poor womens? lives are also unquantified and overlooked. Objectives This study aimed to document the relationship between working equids and women in equine owning communities in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and Pakistan. Study design Qualitative semi-structured focus group discussions elicited opinions from small groups of women (up to 12/group) in selected rural and peri-urban areas in each country. Methods An experienced local language-speaking community facilitator guided each discussion using a standardised questionnaire based on UK Department for International Development sustainable livelihoods framework asset categories. Women's experiences of working equids? roles in their lives were audio-recorded, transcribed in local language and key themes summarised in English. Results Twenty-two discussions (7 in India, 5 each in Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan) comprising 259 women took place between February and October 2013. When asked to rank their livestock, all 12 groups in India and Kenya and 17 out of 22 groups overall ranked equids most important, due to their income generation and contribution to household chores, including transporting feedstuffs and water for other livestock species. Whilst specific responsibilities varied between communities, women reported undertaking many equine husbandry activities but lacked access to equine-specific knowledge and skills training. Conclusions The study findings can inform development of targeted training interventions for female working equid owners and users. Further work is required to quantify the contribution to livelihoods of working equids in developing countries to underpin engagement with government stakeholders on the benefit of providing for their needs in animal health and welfare systems.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Real-time tissue elastography (RTE) can provide objective information associated with mechanical properties of tendon tissue and add value to the structural information obtained by greyscale ultrasound. Serial RTE assessment would be useful for monitoring and optimising safe rehabilitation for horses with tendon injury. Objectives To test the hypothesis that RTE could measure change in tissue stiffness in the healing process of injured superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) of horses. Study design Prospective field study. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses with SDFT injury and standardised rehabilitation were used. Both greyscale and RTE images were recorded approximately every 4 weeks up to 40 weeks from occurrence. Greyscale ratio (GR: dividing the grey-value of injured area by it of surrounding noninjured area) and strain ratio (SR: dividing the strain value of stand-off gel pad, which can be a standard, by it of injured area) was calculated at each examination. Tissue strain is displayed by colour which suggests hard (blue), intermediate (yellow), soft (red) on RTE image. Strain of injured area was evaluated by colour-scale grade (CSG) of 1 to 3 (1; blue to green, 2; yellow and 3; red) by 3 veterinarians who didn't know the case history. Results GR was returned to nearly 1 quickly within 8 weeks and it was unchanged thereafter. This continuous change of GR was best-fitted to logarithmic trendline (r2?=?0.66). SR increased gradually up to the last examination and was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.89). CSG was decreased gradually and it was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.84). Both change of SR and CSG suggested that an injured tissue would gradually increase in stiffness. Conclusions RTE could provide useful information regarding monitoring and optimising restoration of the tissue stiffness of tendon, even if GR was unchanged by progress of scar formation, for safer and more effective rehabilitation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is limited information on tarsocrural arthroscopy for osteochondrosis dissecans lesions (OCD) in Great Britain, and routine examination of the plantar pouch has not been described. Objectives To describe clinical features of cases undergoing tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD and estimate the prevalence of abnormalities within the plantar pouch. Study design Retrospective case review. Methods Case records of all horses that had tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD at Rossdales Equine Hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2013 were included (n?=?99). Descriptive data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed in Microsoft Excel. Results Warmbloods/Warmblood-crosses were significantly over-represented compared to the normal hospital population, comprising 42.4% (CI 32.7?52.2%) of the study (P<0.001), followed by Thoroughbreds/Thoroughbred-crosses (33.7%, CI 25.0?43.7%), 22 other horse breeds and one pony. Cases were predominantly male (70.7%, CI 63.6?81.3%) with 48.5% geldings, 19.2% colts and 3.0% stallions. Median age was 2.9 years (0.1?13.5 years) and median weight was 523?kg (112?919?kg). Most were nonracing sports horses (40.4%, CI 30.7?50.1%), or unbroken (27.0%, CI 18.5?36.0%) with the remainder used for breeding, general purpose or racing. Reasons for presentation were lameness (52.7%, CI 42.5?63.0%), effusion (36.3%, CI 26.4?46.1%), or survey radiographs (11.0%, CI 4.6?17.4%). Tarsocrural arthroscopy was most frequently performed bilaterally (41.8%, CI 32.1?51.6%), followed by left hind (35.7%, CI 26.2?45.2%), then right hind (22.4%, CI 14.2?30.7%). Irrespective of pathology in the dorsal pouch, examination of the plantar pouch was performed in 70 joints (50 horses), and in 78.0% (CI 66.5?89.5%) abnormalities were found. Of these, 10 required removal of organised fibrinous debris or osteochondral fragments (25.6% CI 11.9?39.3%), none of which were recorded using diagnostic imaging presurgery. Conclusions Investigation of the plantar pouch is indicated in routine tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD as it often reveals additional pathology, which may necessitate surgical intervention. Further work will evaluate how plantar pouch pathology may influence prognosis. Ethical animal research:?Ethical approval obtained, project number AHT48-2013.

AB  - Objectives To determine the safety and efficacy of posaconazole and terbinafine for the treatment of naturally occurring sino-nasal aspergillosis in dogs refractory to conventional topical and systemic treatment. Materials and Methods Ten client-owned dogs with sino-nasal aspergillosis and not responsive to conventional treatments were prospectively enrolled to receive a dose of 5 mg/kg posaconazole orally every 12 hours for six months. All dogs were concurrently treated with doses of 30 mg/kg terbinafine orally every 12 hours and 5 mg/kg doxycycline orally every 12 hours for 6 to 18 months. Results All 10 enrolled dogs completed the study. The treatment response was defined as complete clinical remission (n=7) or partial clinical remission (n=3). Two dogs relapsed after cessation of combination therapy. All dogs lived more than one year after starting combination therapy and eight dogs are alive at the time of writing. No clinically relevant adverse reactions or increases in hepatic enzyme activity occurred during the combination therapy. Clinical Significance The results of this study suggest that this combination therapy appears safe and well-tolerated for the treatment of refractory sino-nasal aspergillosis in dogs. Long-term survival is possible with prolonged treatment, but relapse is possible. Larger prospective studies are warranted to further evaluate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Abstract.? ?Objectives: Because the trigone is a unique region in the caudal bladder with a higher risk of neoplasia, we hypothesized that this area would have a high proportion of progenitor cells. As yet there is no marker nor methodology to specifically isolate urothelial stem cells, and thus demonstrate multi-potential differentiation and self-renewal. Here, our goal was to evaluate the distribution of progenitor cells that carry two general major attributes of stem cells: clonogenicity and proliferative capacity. Materials and methods: The bladders of Fisher rats were divided into caudal and cephalic segments and primary cultures were established from the harvested urothelial cells. Results: We found that colony-forming efficiency was almost 2-fold higher for cells from the caudal bladder compared to the cephalic bladder. Doubling time was significantly faster for cells harvested from the caudal bladder at initial plating. This suggested that the caudal bladder harbours a higher density of urothelial progenitor cells. With passage to p4, the differences between the upper and lower bladder were lost, suggesting selection of proliferative cells with serial passage. Based on Ki-67 staining, there was no geographical difference in cell proliferation under normal homeostatic in vivo conditions. Conclusions: These results demonstrate geographical sequestration of urothelial progenitor cells to the area of the bladder that encompasses the bladder neck and trigone, which may be a factor in pathological disparities between the trigone and remaining bladder.

AB  - SUMMARY Donation criteria have been becoming more flexible over the years. Currently, the only absolute exclusion criteria are human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), uncontrolled tumor disease and bacterial or viral infections. Clinical conditions dictate organ viability criteria: biochemical, morphological and functional, that must be fulfilled by the donors and their organs in order to focus the decision on which donor organs can be used. These criteria attempt to assure that the transplanted organs function after the extraction, transformation, implantation and reperfusion process without transmitting any infectious or tumour disease. In recent years, the gross and microscopic appearance has become one of the fundamental criteria for selection of potentially viable organs. At present, there is no age limit for hepatic and renal donation; the principal contra-indication is chronic organ damage. The use of each organ must be decided individually after a profound analysis of all the viability criteria, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the implant of a certain organ for the recipient.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is challenging for the lack of a specific diagnostic test. Recent researches in quantitative proteomics, however, offer new opportunities for biomarker discovery and the study of disease pathogenesis. To find more potential protein biomarkers, we used two technologies, 2-dimensional fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromato-graph coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS), to quantitatively analyse differential proteomic expression in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between patients with MS (the experiment group) and patients with other neurological diseases (ONDs; the control group). Analysis by the former technology identified more than 43 different protein spots (39 proteins), of which 17 spots (13 proteins) showed more than 1.5-fold difference in abundance as analysed by DeCyder software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway. NJ, USA) between the MS and the ONDs groups. The expression of five protein spots was elevated and the expression of 12 protein spots was decreased in the MS group. Meanwhile, the latter method, UPLC/Q-TOF MS showed 68 different proteins. There were 45 proteins with a difference of more than 1.5 folds between the two groups, in which the expression of 20 proteins was elevated and the expression of 25 proteins was decreased in the MS group. Data provided by the two methods indicated that the proteins overlapped ratio was 27% in the 26 significant proteins that had the same regulation tendency. The differential CSF proteins were analysed further by biological network and it revealed interaction of them. The subsequent ELISA measuring the concentration of cystatin C (P < 0.01), which was one of the proteins discovered simultaneously with the two technologies, confirmed the results of the two quantitative proteomic analysis. The combination of the two quantitative proteomic technologies was helpful in discovering differentially expressed proteins that may have a connection with MS disease physiology and serve as useful biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of MS diseases.

AB  - Summary.? Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of liver disease in haemophilia. Few data exist on the proportion with liver fibrosis in this group after long-term HCV and HIV co-infection. We conducted a cross-sectional multi-centre study to determine the impact of HIV on the prevalence and risk factors for fibrosis in haemophilic men with chronic hepatitis C. Biopsies were independently scored by Ishak, Metavir and Knodell systems. Variables were tested for associations with fibrosis using logistic regression and receiver operating curves (ROC). Of 220 biopsied HCV(+) men, 23.6% had Metavir ≥F3 fibrosis, with higher mean Metavir fibrosis scores among HIV/HCV co-infected than HCV mono-infected, 1.6 vs. 1.3 (P?=?0.044). Variables significantly associated with fibrosis included AST, ALT, APRI score (AST/ULN ??100/platelet???109/L), alpha-fetoprotein (all P <?0.0001), platelets (P?= 0.0003) and ferritin (P?=?0.0008). In multiple logistic regression of serum markers, alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ALT were significantly associated with ≥F3 fibrosis [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.86)]. Alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ferritin were significant in HIV(?) [AUROC?=?0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92)], and alpha-fetoprotein and platelets in HIV(+) [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 0.88]. In a multivariable model of demographic and clinical variables, transformed (natural logarithm) of alpha-fetoprotein (P?=?0.0003), age (P?=?0.006) and HCV treatment (P?=?0.027) were significantly associated with fibrosis. Nearly one-fourth of haemophilic men have Metavir ≥3 fibrosis. The odds for developing fibrosis are increased in those with elevated alpha-fetoprotein, increasing age and past HCV treatment.
