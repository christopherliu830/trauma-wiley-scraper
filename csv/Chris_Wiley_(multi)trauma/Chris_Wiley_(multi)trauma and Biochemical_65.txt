AB  - Abstract To study the expression level of a panel of pro/anti-apoptotic factors and inflammation-related receptors in chondral fragments from patients undergoing surgical treatment for intra-articular calcaneal fractures, cartilage fragments were retrieved from calcaneal fractures of 20 patients subjected to surgical treatment. Primary cultures were performed using chondral fragments from fractured and control patients. Chondrocyte cultures from each patient of the fractured and control groups were subjected to immunofluorescence staining and quantitatively analyzed under confocal microscopy. Proteins extracted from the cultured chondrocytes taken from the fractured and control groups were processed for Western blot experiments and densitometric analysis. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using the cleaved PARP-1 antibody. The proportion of labelled cells was 35% for fractured specimens, compared with 7% for control samples. Quantification of caspase-3 active and Bcl-2 proteins in chondrocyte cultures showed a significant increase of the apoptotic process in fractured specimens compared with control ones. Fractured chondrocytes were positively stained for ChemR23 with statistically significant differences with respect to control samples. Densitometric evaluation of the immunoreactive bands confirmed these observations. Human articular chondrocytes obtained from patients with intra-articular calcaneal fractures express higher levels of pivotal pro-apoptotic factors, and of the chemo-attractive receptor ChemR23, compared with control cultures. On the basis of these observations, the authors hypothesize that consistent prolonged chondrocyte death, associated with the persistence of high levels of pro-inflammatory factors, could enhance the deterioration of cartilage tissue with consequent development of post-traumatic arthritis following intra-articular bone fracture.

AB  - Cardiovascular complications affect diabetic subjects early and the more susceptible ones are those on hemodialysis. Objective:? This study was designed to observe prevalent cardiac involvement in both pre- and already on dialysis diabetics. Method:? Sixty diabetics, 30 predialysis (predialysis diabetics, group 1), and 30 on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD, group 2) were randomly selected and their different clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters were compared. Result:? Both groups of patients were matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Features like systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in predialysis diabetics group than in MHD group [138?±?19 vs. 152?±?32, p?<?0.02 and 74?±?10 vs. 87?±?10?mmHg (p?<?0.001)]; hemoglobin higher [10.3?±?2.1 vs. 7.5?±?1.5 g/dL (p?<?0.001)]; serum creatinine was lower [3.49?±?1.8 vs. 9.5?±?2.5 mg/dL (p?<?0.001)] (due to recruitment criteria); left ventricular muscle mass index (LVMI) also lower [137?±?96 vs. 211?±?77?g/m2 (p?<?0.001)]; left ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) less [58?±?21 vs. 85?±?25 mL/m2 (p?<?0.001) and fractional shortening (FS, %) higher [33?±?4.3 vs. 28?±?5.8 (p?<?0.006)]. Only 11% of Pre subjects had LV hypertrophy (LVMI >131?g/m2 in male and in female LVMI >110?g/m2) whereas it was 51% in MHD (p?<?0.001). Systolic dysfunction (FS?=?<25%) was 4% in Pre subjects and 24% in MHD (p?<?0.03) group. Correlation study showed systolic and diastolic blood pressure; both had positive correlation with LVMI (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.008 and r?=?0.32, p?<?0.02) and LVEDVI (r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and r?=?0.35, p?<?0.01) and also similarly positive with serum creatinine (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.02 and r?=?0.5, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? It may be concluded that cardiac parameters are grossly altered in majority of diabetics on dialysis and higher serum creatinine and uncontrolled blood pressure may be responsible for this.

AB  - Accessible summary ?? The aim of this literature review is to identify the risk factors of aggressive behaviour in adolescents and to describe available intervention strategies. ?? The risk factors comprise personal and environmental risk factors. Some risk factors can be influenced by nursing intervention strategies. ?? The most effective intervention programmes focus on interpersonal skills training in combination with parent management training. ?? There is a need for specific nursing intervention programmes to deal with aggressive behaviour in adolescent psychiatric settings. Abstract This study was aimed to identify the risk factors of aggressive behaviour in adolescents (13?18 years), and to describe available intervention strategies. The findings are evaluated on the basis of their implications for nursing practice. Aggressive behaviour in adolescent psychiatric settings is a neglected research area. The consequences of aggressive behaviour on nurses, other patients and the therapeutic environment can be profound. For the development and implementation of innovative intervention strategies aimed at preventing aggressive behaviour in adolescent psychiatric patients, knowledge of risk factors and evidence-based interventions for aggressive behaviour are of the utmost importance. A systematic search of PubMed, Cinahl, PsychINFO and Cochrane Systematic Reviews (1991?2007) was employed. The risk factors for aggressive behaviour comprise personal and environmental risk factors. Some risk factors can be influenced by nursing intervention strategies. Available intervention programmes range from interpersonal skills training to massage therapy, parent management training, functional family therapy and multi-systemic therapy. The most effective programmes combine interpersonal skills training with parent management training. No specific nursing intervention programmes were found for dealing with aggressive behaviour in adolescent patients. Nursing staff can assist in achieving a systematic improvement in the treatment outcomes of existing intervention programmes for the prevention of aggression. There is a need for specific nursing intervention programmes to deal with aggressive behaviour in adolescent psychiatric settings.

AB  - Abstract Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common and often devastating birth defect that can occur in isolation or as part of a malformation complex. Considerable progress is being made in the identification of genetic causes of CDH. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of ?1Mb resolution to 29 CDH patients with prior normal karyotypes who had been recruited into our multi-site study. One patient, clinically diagnosed with Fryns syndrome, demonstrated a de novo 5Mb deletion at chromosome region 1q41?q42.12 that was confirmed by FISH. Given prior reports of CDH in association with cytogenetic abnormalities in this region, we propose that this represents a locus for Fryns syndrome, a Fryns syndrome phenocopy, or CDH. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Circulatory and respiratory effects of five h of constant 1.06 per cent alveolar halothane in oxygen were identified in eight healthy horses, which breathed spontaneously, were otherwise unmedicated and positioned in sternal recumbency. Only a few important significant (P<0.05) changes occurred with time. Total peripheral resistance was about 15 per cent lower after two hours of constant dose halothane than after 30 mins of constant dose (P<0.05) and accounted for the significant 10 per cent reduction in mean carotid arterial blood pressure. By 5 h, the reduction in resistance and arterial blood pressure was 20 and 25 per cent respectively. Heart rate increased progressively with time and the increase became significant at 5 h (15 per cent increase). However, the heart rate change was not large enough to alter cardiac output. There were no major time-related changes in PaO2 or PaCO2. Three of four horses recovered from anaesthesia had markedly elevated serum creatine kinase levels and clinical signs of severe post anaesthetic myopathy.

AB  - Abstract Clinical neurophysiologic examination of the pelvic floor is performed worldwide, but there is no consensus on the choice of tests, nor on technical details of individual methods. Standardized methods are, however, necessary to obtain their valid application in different laboratories for the purpose of collection of normative data, comparison of patient data and organization of multi-center studies. It is proposed that in patients with suspected ?lower motor neuron? type lesions concentric needle electromyography (CNEMG) is the most informative test to detect pelvic floor denervation/reinnervation, and the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle is the most appropriate muscle to be examined (either in isolation?when a selective lesion is suspected?or in addition to examination of other muscles). An algorithm consisting of standardized tests including a standardized approach to CNEMG examination of the EAS is presented. The proposed electrophysiologic assessment consists of a computer-assisted analysis of denervation and reinnervation features of the CNEMG signal, a qualitative assessment of reflex and voluntary activation of EAS motor units, and of electrical (or mechanical) elicitation of the bulbocavernosus reflex in those patients in whom manual anogenital stimulation failed to elicit a robust response in the EAS. The proposed protocol could serve as a basis for further studies on validity, sensitivity and specificity of electrophysiologic assessment in patients with different types of ?lower motor neuron? involvement of pelvic floor muscles and sacral dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract As in any part of the hospital system, safety incidents can occur in the ED. These incidents arguably have a distinct character, as the ED involves unscheduled flows of urgent patients who require disparate services. To aid understanding of safety issues and support risk management of the ED, a comparison of published ED specific incident classification frameworks was performed. A review of emergency medicine, health management and general medical publications, using Ovid SP to interrogate Medline (1976?2016) was undertaken to identify any type of taxonomy or classification-like framework for ED related incidents. These frameworks were then analysed and compared. The review identified 17 publications containing an incident classification framework. Comparison of factors and themes making up the classification constituent elements revealed some commonality, but no overall consistency, nor evolution towards an ideal framework. Inconsistency arises from differences in the evidential basis and design methodology of classifications, with design itself being an inherently subjective process. It was not possible to identify an ?ideal? incident classification framework for ED risk management, and there is significant variation in the selection of categories used by frameworks. The variation in classification could risk an unbalanced emphasis in findings through application of a particular framework. Design of an ED specific, ideal incident classification framework should be informed by a much wider range of theories of how organisations and systems work, in addition to clinical and human factors.

AB  - Abstract Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2-CDG) is the most common congenital disorder of N-glycosylation and is caused by a deficient PMM2 activity. The clinical presentation and the onset of PMM2-CDG vary among affected individuals ranging from a severe antenatal presentation with multisystem involvement to mild adulthood presentation limited to minor neurological involvement. Management of affected patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, a systematic review of the literature on PMM2-CDG was conducted by a group of international experts in different aspects of CDG. Our managment guidelines were initiated based on the available evidence-based data and experts' opinions. This guideline mainly addresses the clinical evaluation of each system/organ involved in PMM2-CDG, and the recommended management approach. It is the first systematic review of current practices in PMM2-CDG and the first guidelines aiming at establishing a practical approach to the recognition, diagnosis and management of PMM2-CDG patients.

AB  - Summary Background? SPD476 (MMX? mesalazine), is a novel, once daily, high-strength mesalazine formulation (1.2?g/tablet) that utilizes Multi Matrix System? (MMX) technology to delay and extend delivery of the active drug throughout the colon. Aim? To assess the safety and efficacy of MMX mesalazine in patients with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis, in a pilot, phase II, randomized, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging study (SPD476-202). Methods? Thirty-eight patients with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis were randomized to MMX mesalazine 1.2, 2.4 or 4.8?g/day given once daily for 8?weeks. Remission ulcerative colitis-disease activity index (UC-DAI) ≤1, a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and stool frequency, and ≥1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from baseline was the primary end point. Results? Week 8 remission rates were 0%, 31% and 18% of patients receiving MMX mesalazine 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8?g/day respectively. No statistically significant difference in remission was observed between treatment groups. MMX mesalazine 2.4 and 4.8?g/day groups demonstrated greater improvement in overall UC-DAI and component scores from baseline, compared with the 1.2?g/day group. Conclusion? MMX mesalazine given as 2.4 or 4.8?g/day once daily is well tolerated and effective for the treatment of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare the efficacy and cardiopulmonary effects of propofol and fentanyl, with propofol and midazolam for total intravenous anaesthesia. Study design? Prospective, randomized, crossover experimental study. Animals? Six goats; three does and three wethers. Methods  Goats received either fentanyl 0.02?mg kg?1 (treatment FP) or midazolam 0.3 mg kg?1 (treatment MP) intravenously. One minute later anaesthesia was induced with propofol, then maintained by constant rate infusion of propofol 12.0?mg kg?1?hour?1 and fentanyl 0.02?mg?kg?1 hour?1 (treatment FP) or propofol 12.0?mg?kg?1 hour?1 and midazolam 0.3?mg??kg?1?hour?1 (treatment MP) for 90?minutes. Response to noxious stimulus was tested every 10?minutes and propofol dose adjusted to prevent purposeful movement. Cardiopulmonary parameters were measured continuously, and arterial blood-gas analysis performed intermittently. Recovery was timed and quality scored. Results are presented as median (IQR). Results? Differences in the propofol induction dose [4.00 (3.96?4.01) and 3.97 (3.91?4.00) mg?kg?1 for treatments FP and MP, respectively] were not significant. Quality of induction in both groups was smooth. The median propofol dose for maintenance was less (p?=?0.004) with treatment FP (12.0?mg?kg?1?hour?1) than MP (18.0?mg?kg?1?hour?1). Cardiopulmonary function was well maintained with both treatments. Recovery times in minutes from the end of anaesthetic infusion for treatments FP and MP respectively were; to extubation 3.0 (3.0?3.0) and 4.5 (3.3?5.0); to sternal position, 4.5 (3.3?5.0) and 5.0 (5.0?6.5) and to standing 13.0 (10.3?15.0) and 15.0 (11.3?17.3). Quality of recovery was acceptable in both groups, but abnormal behavioural signs were observed after treatment FP. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl or propofol and midazolam, at the doses studied, in spontaneously-breathing, oxygen-supplemented goats is practicable. Recovery from the fentanyl-propofol combination is not always smooth.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Keloids are disfiguring, proliferative scars that are a pathologic response to cutaneous injury. An organotypic tissue culture system (the Raft model 1?10) was used to investigate the feasibility of using photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an adjunctive therapy to treat keloids following surgical excision. The Raft co-culture system mimics skin by layering keratinocytes on top of fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. PDT uses drugs that produce singlet oxygen in situ when irradiated by light, and may lead to a number of effects in living tissues varying from the modulation of growth to apoptosis. PDT is already used to treat several benign and malignant diseases in organs such as the skin, retina, and esophagus. Study Design/Materials and Methods Normal adult, neonatal, and keloid fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated from skin obtained from patients undergoing elective procedures and used to construct the Rafts. Mature Rafts (after 4 days) were incubated with 5-amino levulinic acid (5-ALA), a photosensitizer, for 3 hours and were laser-irradiated (635 nm) for total energy delivery of 5 J/cm2, 10 J/cm2, or 20 J/cm2. Rafts were examined 24 hours and 14 days later. Cell viability was determined using confocal imaging combined with live-dead fluorescent dyes. Multi-photon microscope (MPM) imaged collagen structure and density. As Rafts contract over time, surface area was measured using optical micrometry daily. Results At 10 and 20 J/cm2, near-total cell death was observed in all constructs, while at 5 J/cm2 cell viability was comparable to controls. Cell viability in keloid and neonatal Rafts was greater than that observed in normal adult Rafts. Treated Rafts contracted less over the 14-day period compared to controls. Contraction and collagen density were greatest in keloid and neonatal Rafts. Conclusions A PDT dosimetry range was established, which reduces tissue contraction and collagen density while minimizing injury to fibroblasts. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary The intestine may be subjected to simple obstruction, in which only the lumen is obstructed, strangulating obstruction, in which both the lumen and vasculature are obstructed, or infarction, in which only the vasculature is obstructed. Each of these may injure intestinal tissues, particularly with interruption of blood flow and subsequent ischemic injury. This can also occur in simple obstruction as the luminal pressure causes collapse of the vasculature within the intestinal wall. Once reperfused, ischemic-injured mucosa may undergo reperfusion injury, depending on the circumstances. This relates to the level of reactive oxygen metabolite generation and infiltration of neutrophils. More recently, repair of the mucosa has been studied in depth, including villus contraction (in the small intestine), epithelial restitution, tight junction closure, and mucosal proliferation. Other layers of the intestine are also injured, particularly the serosa, which can lead to inflammation and development of adhesions.

Mesodermal tissues ?? Heart ?? Bone and cartilage ?? Circulatory system ?? Endodermal tissues ?? Pancreas ?? Liver ?? Future challenges Abstract Recent advances in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology now offer an alternative cell source for tissue engineers, as these cells are capable of proliferating indefinitely and differentiating to many clinically relevant cell types. Novel culture methods capable of exerting spatial and temporal control over the stem cell microenvironment allow for more efficient expansion of hESCs, and significant advances have been made toward improving our understanding of the biophysical and biochemical cues that direct stem cell fate choices. Effective production of lineage specific progenitors or terminally differentiated cells enables researchers to incorporate hESC derivatives into engineered tissue constructs. Here, we describe current efforts using hESCs as a cell source for tissue engineering applications, highlighting potential advantages of hESCs over current practices as well as challenges which must be overcome.

AB  - Inflammatory pathologies are a growing burden for developed societies, and the tools offered by medicinal chemistry/biotechnology have provided us with an armamentarium of active principles. Unfortunately, most of them are marred by very significant side effects that can be summarized by two words: poor targeting (of cells, of tissues, etc.). This review provides a broad overview of the approaches and of the materials used to obtain an inflammation-responsive or inflammation-targeted behavior, which can be used to improve anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we first define the biochemical factors that may allow both to recognize and to target an inflamed environment, for example, the leakiness of capillaries, the presence of oxidants (reactive oxygen species), or of upregulated receptors/enzymes. We then review the systems that have shown the possibility to accumulate in inflamed tissues, respond to its stimuli, or bind to activated inflammatory cells, separately discussing payload/carrier (guest/host) systems and macromolecular prodrugs/conjugates.

AB  - Abstract Concentration gradients play an important role in controlling biological and pathological processes, such as metastasis, embryogenesis, axon guidance, and wound healing. Microfluidic devices fabricated by photo- and soft lithography techniques can manipulate the fluidic flow and diffusion profile to create biomolecular gradients in a temporal and spatial manner. Furthermore, microfluidic devices enable the control of cell-extracellular microenvironment interactions, including cell?cell, cell?matrix, and cell?soluble factor interaction. In this paper, we review the development of microfluidic-based gradient devices and highlight their biological applications.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine now widely recognized to contribute to the molecular events that follow CNS injury. Little is known, however, about its action on axonal sprouting and regeneration in the brain. We addressed this issue using the model of transection of Schaffer collaterals in mice organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Transection of slice cultures was associated with a marked release of IL-6 that could be neutralized by an IL-6 blocking antibody. We monitored functional recovery across the lesion by recording synaptic responses using a multi-electrode array. We found that application of IL-6 antibodies to the cultures after lesioning significantly reduced functional recovery across the lesion. Furthermore, the level of expression of the 43-kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43) was lower in slices treated with the IL-6 neutralizing antibody than in those treated with a control IgG. Conversely, addition of exogenous IL-6 to the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of functional recovery across the lesion and a higher level of expression of GAP-43. Co-culture of CA3 hemi-slices from thy1-YFP mice with CA1 hemi-slices from wild-type animals confirmed that IL-6-treated co-cultures exhibited an increased number of growing fluorescent fibres across the lesion site. Taken together these data indicate that IL-6 plays an important role in CNS repair mechanisms by promoting regrowth and axon regeneration.
