AB  - Inflammatory pathologies are a growing burden for developed societies, and the tools offered by medicinal chemistry/biotechnology have provided us with an armamentarium of active principles. Unfortunately, most of them are marred by very significant side effects that can be summarized by two words: poor targeting (of cells, of tissues, etc.). This review provides a broad overview of the approaches and of the materials used to obtain an inflammation-responsive or inflammation-targeted behavior, which can be used to improve anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we first define the biochemical factors that may allow both to recognize and to target an inflamed environment, for example, the leakiness of capillaries, the presence of oxidants (reactive oxygen species), or of upregulated receptors/enzymes. We then review the systems that have shown the possibility to accumulate in inflamed tissues, respond to its stimuli, or bind to activated inflammatory cells, separately discussing payload/carrier (guest/host) systems and macromolecular prodrugs/conjugates.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Background The medications produced from natural products are widely used as prophylactics for sickness induced by alcohol consumption. One such prophylactic is produced from the Reishi mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum. Because of the antioxidant properties of these preparations, we expect neuroprotective prophylactic effects of Reishi-based medications in alcohol-treated animals. Methods The Reishi (R) suspension was produced as water extract from Altaian mushrooms. Sprague?Dawley male rats were separated into the following 3 experimental groups: Group A + R received R (6 days per week) starting 1 week before alcohol exposure, and during the next 3 weeks, they received both R and alcohol; group A received alcohol; and group C received water. At the end of experiment, we determined the metabolic profile using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) of the brain cortex and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the liver. Additionally, the blood cells were collected, and the serum biochemistry and liver histology were performed after euthanasia. Results Partial least squares discriminant analysis processing of the brain 1H MRS gave 2 axes, the Y1 axis positively correlated with the level of taurine and negatively correlated with the level of lactate, and the Y2 axis positively correlated with the content of GABA and glycine and negatively correlated with the sum of the excitatory neurotransmitters, glutamate and glutamine. The Y1 values reflecting the brain energetics for the A + R group exceeded the corresponding values for groups C and A. The maximal level of Y2 reflecting the prevalence of inhibitory metabolites in the brain was observed in the rats exposed to alcohol. Moderate alcohol consumption did not cause significant pathological changes in the livers of the experimental animals. However, 20 days of alcohol consumption significantly increased the number of binuclear hepatocytes compared to the control. This effect was mitigated in the rats that received the Reishi extract. Conclusions Regular administration of the Reishi suspension improved the energy supply to the brain cortex and decreased the prevalence of inhibitory neurotransmitters that are characteristic of alcohol consumption. The alcohol-induced increase in liver proliferation was significantly suppressed by regular administration of the G. lucidum water suspension.

AB  - Introduction:? Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an established treatment of chronic wounds. There is limited understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of NPWT. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the biochemical composition of wound fluid collected from chronic pressure ulcer wounds in adults treated with NPWT. Methods:? Nine stage III or IV pressure ulcer patients scheduled for NPWT (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI, San Antonio, TX) were recruited. Their ages ranged between 30 and 99. Concentrations of cytokines (IL-1?, TNF-α), metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in wound fluids were measured at baseline and after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days of continuous NPWT. Results:? At days 1, 3, and 7, TNF-α levels were significantly and comparably lower than baseline (p?<?0.05). MMP- 3 levels significantly decreased from baseline at days 1 and 3 (p?<?0.05) and significantly increased from baseline at day 7 (p?<?0.05) with continuous NPWT. IL-1? levels significantly increased at day 3 (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in TIMP-1 or MMP-2 levels at any of the time points when compared to baseline. Discussions and Conclusions:? A key finding of this study is that with NWPT, reductions in levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, from baseline levels were observed and this effect was sustained for at least 1 week. This, together with effects on IL-1 and MMP-3, may be an indication that the NPWT has a rapid and sustained effect on the inflammatory state of chronic wounds. Further studies are being conducted to expand sample size and to analyze other wound healing indicators.

AB  - Abstract The increased content of soluble glycosaminoglycan-containing forms in sciatic nerves during recovery from crush injury [Shum & Chau (1996) J. Neurosci. Res., 46, 465] suggests that the glycosaminoglycans modulate the environment for post-traumatic tissue remodelling and axonal regrowth. To test this, defined amounts of soluble heparan sulphates from bovine kidney or guinea-pig nerve were introduced into the regenerating environment via silicone conduits that bridged 8-mm gaps of transected sciatic nerves of adult guinea-pigs. Controls were bridged using the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle or a chondroition sulphate preparation from whale cartilage. After timed periods of recovery, the animals were assessed for electromyographic signals at the target gastrocnemius muscle to determine the conduction velocity across the bridged nerve. Sections of the bridge were also histologically examined for nerve fibres. Transected sciatic nerves bridged with heparan sulphates or chondroitin sulphate showed earlier stimulated myelination of axons (week 5?6) than PBS-bridged nerves (week 9). Initial electromyographic indication of reconnection with the target was at week 9 post-transection. In the course of 20?weeks, transected sections of the bridge indicated similar numbers of unmyelinated axons irrespective of bridge material, but distinctly higher numbers of myelinated axons in heparan sulphate-bridged nerves than either PBS- or chondroitin sulphate-bridged nerves. At the end of the same period, heparan sulphate-bridged nerves resumed normal conduction velocities, but both PBS- and chondroitin sulphate-bridged nerves remained at 50% of that of the intact contralateral nerves. These results are the first to demonstrate that supplementation of soluble heparan sulphate to the fluid regenerative neural environment can restore functional, axonal reconnection of the severed nerve with the target muscle.

AB  - Abstract Background Treatment for diabetic foot infections requires properly diagnosing infection, obtaining an appropriate specimen for culture, assessing for any needed surgical procedures and selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen. Therapy will often need to be modified based on results of culture and sensitivity testing. Because of excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections, resistance to the usually employed bacteria has been increasing to alarming levels. Review This article reviews recommendations from evidence-based guidelines, informed by results of systematic reviews, on treating diabetic foot infections. Data from the pre-antibiotic era reported rates of mortality of about 9% and of high-level leg amputations of about 70%. Outcomes have greatly improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. While there are now many oral and parenteral antibiotic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in treating diabetic foot infections, the rate of infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens is growing. This problem requires a multi-focal approach, including providing education to both clinicians and patients, developing robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes and using new diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Recently, new methods have been developed to find novel antibiotic agents and to resurrect old treatments, like bacteriophages, for treating these difficult infections. Conclusion Medical and political leaders have recognized the serious global threat posed by the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. By a multipronged approach that includes exerting administrative pressure on clinicians to do the right thing, investing in new technologies and encouraging the profitable development of new antimicrobials, we may be able to stave off the coming ?post-antibiotic era?.

Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis from 2009 to 2016 at six specialist referral centres were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 49 dogs. Springer spaniels appeared to be over-represented (16 of 49 dogs). Young dogs (median age: 3?years and 9 months) and females (31 of 49) were frequently affected. Clinical presentation was variable, with pyrexia (39 of 49), lethargy (35 of 49) and anorexia (21 of 49) the most commonly reported clinical signs. Lymph node cytology or histopathology demonstrated neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous, granulomatous or necrotising lymphadenitis without a detectable underlying cause in all cases. Because a sterile immune-mediated aetiology was suspected, all dogs received prednisolone, which was followed by rapid resolution of clinical signs and lymphadenopathy in most cases. Clinical Significance Sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis should be considered in dogs with pyrexia of unknown origin with inflammatory lymphadenopathy if no underlying cause can be found and often responds well to immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are non-hematopoietic multi-potent stem-like cells that are capable of differentiating into both mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lineages. In fact, in addition to bone, cartilage, fat, and myoblasts, it has been demonstrated that MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons and astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. MSCs are of interest because they are isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow and can be easily expanded in vitro. As such, these cells are currently being tested for their potential use in cell and gene therapy for a number of human diseases. Nevertheless, there are still some open questions about origin, multipotentiality, and anatomical localization of MSCs. In this review, we discuss clinical trials based on the use of MSCs in cardiovascular diseases, such as treatment of acute myocardial infarction, endstage ischemic heart disease, or prevention of vascular restenosis through stem cell-mediated injury repair. We analyze data from clinical trials for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which is a genetic disease characterized by production of defective type I collagen. We describe progress for neurological disease treatment with MSC transplants. We discuss data on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and on lysosomal storage diseases (Hurler syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy). A section of review is dedicated to ongoing clinical trials, involving MSCs in treatment of steroid refractory Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD); periodontitis, which is a chronic disease affecting periodontium and causing destruction of attachment apparatus, heart failure, and bone fractures. Finally, we will provide information about biotech companies developing MSC therapy. J. Cell. Physiol. 211: 27?35, 2007. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - SUMMARY Three major antiprotease components in equine serum were identified and characterised. These were the acidic prealbumin Pr, the homologue of human alpha-1 antitrypsin and 2 protease binding proteins, the acidic prealbumin Xc and alpha-2 macroglobulin, both capable of inhibiting the proteolytic activity of trypsin, but with only limited inhibitory effect on its esterolytic activity. The possible role of these serum antiproteases in the onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), analogous to the hereditary dysproteinaemia of alpha-1 antitrypsin in man, was investigated. There was no evidence of a genetically determined variation in the protease binding proteins but an increased frequency of the electrophoretically slower Pr antitrypsin alleles was present in horses affected with COPD. However, because of both the mixed breeding of the animals investigated and the lack of correlation with low serum trypsin inhibitory capacity, measured by inhibition of DL-BAPA hydrolysis, the significance of this observation could not be critically assessed. RÉSUMÉ Trois antiproteases majeures ont été identifiées dans le serum du cheval, et caractérisées. Il s'agit de la Pr préalbumine acide, homologue de l'alphaantitrypsine humaine, et de deux protéases, la préalbumine X c acide et la macroglobuline alpha 2, toutes deux capables d'inhiber l'activité protéolytique de la trypsine, mais avec seulement un effet inhibiteur limité sur l'activité estérolytique de cette enzyme. Le rôle éventuel de ces antiprotéases dans l'apparition de la maladie pulmonaire chronique obstructive, analogue à la dysproteinémie héréditaire de l'antitrypsine alpha 1 chez l'Homme, a été recherché. On n'a pas constaté une variation liée à des facteurs génétiques chez ces protéases à l'exception d'une fréquence accrue d'alléles correspondants à des antitrypsines Pr. Cependant, en raison de l'imprécision génétique des animaux étudiés et du manque de corrélation avec la capacité inhibitrice trypsique du serum, la signification de cette observation parait difficile à exploiter. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Drei wichtige Antiproteasen konnten im Pferdeserum identifiziert und charakterisiert werden. Es handelte sich um das saure Prealbumin Pr, ein Homolog des menschlichen alpha-1 Antitrypsins und um zwei Protease-bindenden-Proteine, das saure Praealbumin Xc und alpha-2 Macroglobulin, beide befähigt, die proteolytische Aktivität von Trypsin zu hemmen aber mit nur eingeschränkter, hemmender Wirkung auf dessen esterolytische Aktivität. Die mögliche Bedeutung dieser Serum-Antiproteasen für das Auftreten chronisch obstruktiver Lungenkrankheiten?analog der hereditären Dysproteinaemie von alpha-1 Antitrypsin beim Menschen ?wurde untersucht. Es fanden sich keine Hinweise auf eine genetisch fixierte Variation bei den protease-bindenden Proteinen, aber die elektrophoretisch langsameren Pr Antitrypsinallele kamen bei Pferden mit chronisch obstruktiven Lungenleiden häufiger vor. Die Signifikanz dieser Beobachtung konnte indessen nicht kritisch beurteilt werden, weil die Pferde nicht aus einer Reinzucht stammten und weil sich keine Korrelation mit der tiefen Serumtrypsin-Hemmkapazität (gemessen durch die Hemmung der DL-BAPA Hydrolyse) ergeben hatte.

Materials and Methods Medical records of three referral centres were reviewed from 2008 to 2016 to identify a cohort of dogs diagnosed and treated for suspected inflammatory meningoencephalitis after testing for evidence of exposure to these pathogens. Results In our sample of 400 dogs the prevalence for exposure (IgG>1:50) to Toxoplasma gondii was 8/201 (3∙98%). Active infection (IgG titre >1:400 or/and an IgM titre >1:64 and/or positive PCR in CSF) was suspected in 1/400 (0∙25%). The prevalence for exposure [Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titre >1:50] and active infection (IFA titres ≥?1:400 and/or positive PCR in CSF) with Neospora caninum were 14/201 (6∙96%) and 9/400 (2∙25%), respectively. Clinical Significance In view of the low prevalence of protozoan infections, the risk associated with starting immunosuppressive medication in dogs with evidence of inflammatory meningitis or encephalitis in the UK appears low.

AB  - Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as crucial players in chromatin regulation. Their diversity allows them to partake in the regulation of numerous cellular processes across species. During development, long and short ncRNAs act in conjunction with each other where long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are best understood in establishing appropriate gene expression patterns, while short ncRNAs (sRNAs) are known to establish constitutive heterochromatin and suppress mobile elements. Additionally, increasing evidence demonstrates roles of sRNAs in several typically lncRNA-mediated processes such as dosage compensation, indicating a complex regulatory network of noncoding RNAs. Together, various ncRNAs establish many mitotically heritable epigenetic marks during development. Additionally, they participate in mechanisms that regulate maintenance of these epigenetic marks during the lifespan of the organism. Interestingly, some epigenetic traits are transmitted to the next generation(s) via paramutations or transgenerational inheritance mediated by sRNAs. In this review, we give an overview of the various functions and regulations of ncRNAs and the mechanisms they employ in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks and multi-generational transmission of epigenetic traits.

AB  - A 42-year-old female Testudo graeca was referred with a five-month history of a non-healing carapacial wound. Previous treatment had involved long-term antibiotic therapy and conscious debridement of necrotic tissue. On presentation an extensive deep wound with purulent discharge was visible on the right side of the carapace. A computed tomographic scan was performed to assess the extent of the wound. This revealed a large carapacial deficit with two underlying soft tissue masses. Surgical debridement was performed under general anaesthesia resulting in an even larger defect. Because of the extensive nature of the deficit, negative pressure wound therapy was applied to aid wound healing. A negative pressure of approximately 120?mmHg was maintained and bandages were changed every third day. Wound healing progressed rapidly and a healthy granulation bed was formed within 16 days.

AB  - ABSTRACT An eight-month-old female great dane was referred for investigation of exercise intolerance that had developed progressively over one month. Examination revealed poor muscle mass, elevated plasma levels of muscle-associated enzymes and electromyographic abnormalities. The dog was euthanased at 15 months old because of severe exercise intolerance. Tissue obtained by biopsy and at post mortem examination revealed prominent well defined central core structures within most muscle fibres, but no other abnormalities. The condition was diagnosed as a central core myopathy.

AB  - Ammonia was necessary for the origin of life. However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth (>3·8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NOx., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2? resulting from the NOx. to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NOx. and NHy thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2? and NO3? generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NOx. and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3·5 Gyr ago, any O2 accumulation was local until 2·0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2?. However, localized O2 accumulation before 2·0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NOx. production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2·0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N2 and O2. Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1·0 Gyr onwards; NOx. and NH3 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NOx. and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin (and related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem (on present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 104 as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NOx.per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NOx. on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NHy, NOx. and N2O (and O3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NOx., and locally for NHy, so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO2 from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).

AB  - Abstract The diabetic foot constitutes a tremendous challenge for patients, caregivers and the health care system. The International Consensus Document of 1999 was a milestone in the recognition of the importance and consequences of the diabetic foot. Since then, many original papers have been published in this area. Large cohort studies have given us a deeper understanding regarding factors related to the outcome of diabetic foot ulcers: according to these studies, the severity of diabetic foot ulcers is greater than previously reported. More than 50% of individuals' foot ulcers have signs of infection at admission, and one-third have signs of both peripheral artery disease (PAD) and infection. The co-morbidities increase significantly with increasing severity of the foot disease. However, the trend in all these studies is a successive improvement in healing rate (50?60% at 20 weeks follow-up, > 75% at 1 year). It is important to differentiate between neuropathic and neuro-ischaemic ulcers with regard to factors related to outcome and co-morbidities. Recent research has emphasized the importance of psychological factors in the development and outcome of diabetic foot ulcers. Studies have shown that perceptions of the individual's own risks based on symptoms, and their own beliefs in the efficacy of self-care, can affect foot-care practice. The importance and influence of the health care organization and reimbursement should not be underestimated, both in the prevention and management of diabetic foot lesions. The diabetic foot should be considered a lifelong condition, as having had one ulcer dramatically increases the risk of developing a new ulcer. In an individual with diabetes and a foot ulcer, the ulcer should be considered as a sign of multi-organ disease, and a holistic approach to both management and prevention is recommended.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine those factors which are predictive of outcome in cases of thoracic empyema that are solely community acquired. All patients admitted with a diagnosis of thoracic empyema in the Auckland region between 1993 and 1995 were reviewed retrospectively. Both clinical and radiological outcomes were determined at 3?6 month follow up. Radiological outcomes were scored on admission, discharge and follow up by blinded chest radiograph review based on lung field opacification, extent and thickness of pleura. Forty-six cases fulfilled inclusion criteria. Mean age was 56 ± 21 years, 67% were male and there was no ethnic preponderance. Forty-six per cent of cases had specific underlying risk factors. Multi-loculated cases of empyema occurred in 63%, pleural aspirate was culture positive in 59% and Streptococcus milleri represented 42% of all positive cultures. Delay in appropriate management was 5.2 ± 4.2 days. Fifty-six per cent of total procedures incorporated intrapleural streptokinase as an adjunct to drainage. The cure rate was 93.3% without requirement for surgical intervention. Two patients died early giving a 4.3% mortality rate. Radiological scores were 8.6 ± 0.6 on admission, 6.3 ± 1.5 on discharge and 2.5 ± 2.5 at follow up. Improvement in radiological scores was statistically significant from admission to discharge and follow up (P<0.001). The total duration of hospitalization was 22 ± 10 days and by univariate analysis was predicted by: pleural sepsis not involving S. milleri (P = 0.001), specific predisposing factors (P = 0.02), and frank pus on pleural aspiration (P = 0.03). Total delay in management was suggestive in prolonging the duration of hospitalization (P = 0.07). Parapneumonic thoracic empyema is an important source of morbidity which is determined by both patient and management factors. Good results can be obtained by prompt medical therapy including tube drainage and intrapleural streptokinase without need for surgical intervention.
