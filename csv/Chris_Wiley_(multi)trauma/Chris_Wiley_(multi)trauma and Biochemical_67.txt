AB  - ABSTRACT An eight-month-old female great dane was referred for investigation of exercise intolerance that had developed progressively over one month. Examination revealed poor muscle mass, elevated plasma levels of muscle-associated enzymes and electromyographic abnormalities. The dog was euthanased at 15 months old because of severe exercise intolerance. Tissue obtained by biopsy and at post mortem examination revealed prominent well defined central core structures within most muscle fibres, but no other abnormalities. The condition was diagnosed as a central core myopathy.

AB  - Summary Parkinson's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal and other neuronal networks caused by cell loss in the substantia nigra and many other neuronal systems, associated with widespread occurrence of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies and dystrophic Lewy neurites mainly containing phosphorylated α-synuclein. The resulting striatal dopamine deficiency and other biochemical deficits cause the clinical picture of this multisystem disorder. For the diagnosis of definite Parkinson's disease, histopathological confirmation is required. The etiology of Parkinson's disease remains still elusive, but a complex combination of environmental factors, intrinsic cellular metabolic properties and susceptible genetic alleles has been assumed, and important genetic and pathological clues have been found. Two forms of Parkinson's disease are recognized: a ?familial? or early-onset Parkinson's disease (<10% of all patients) in which gene mutations have been identified, and a sporadic late-onset Parkinson's disease (>85%) that does not appear to exhibit heredity, but familial components suggest genetic factors. Although genetic and experimental models have contributed to explore the pathomechanisms and treatment options of Parkinson's disease, there is still no optimal animal model of the disease, and the etiology of Parkinson's disease is still far from being elucidated.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

AB  - Abstract The diabetic foot constitutes a tremendous challenge for patients, caregivers and the health care system. The International Consensus Document of 1999 was a milestone in the recognition of the importance and consequences of the diabetic foot. Since then, many original papers have been published in this area. Large cohort studies have given us a deeper understanding regarding factors related to the outcome of diabetic foot ulcers: according to these studies, the severity of diabetic foot ulcers is greater than previously reported. More than 50% of individuals' foot ulcers have signs of infection at admission, and one-third have signs of both peripheral artery disease (PAD) and infection. The co-morbidities increase significantly with increasing severity of the foot disease. However, the trend in all these studies is a successive improvement in healing rate (50?60% at 20 weeks follow-up, > 75% at 1 year). It is important to differentiate between neuropathic and neuro-ischaemic ulcers with regard to factors related to outcome and co-morbidities. Recent research has emphasized the importance of psychological factors in the development and outcome of diabetic foot ulcers. Studies have shown that perceptions of the individual's own risks based on symptoms, and their own beliefs in the efficacy of self-care, can affect foot-care practice. The importance and influence of the health care organization and reimbursement should not be underestimated, both in the prevention and management of diabetic foot lesions. The diabetic foot should be considered a lifelong condition, as having had one ulcer dramatically increases the risk of developing a new ulcer. In an individual with diabetes and a foot ulcer, the ulcer should be considered as a sign of multi-organ disease, and a holistic approach to both management and prevention is recommended.

AB  - ABSTRACT Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a fatal thrombohemorrhagic disorder. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that have tremendous therapeutic effect. Our aim was to explore whether the immune mechanisms were associated with BMSCs-afforded protection against DIC. We generated a rat model of DIC by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 3?mg/kg) injection via the tail vein. In the treatment group, rats were pre-treated with 1???l03, 1???l04, 1???l05, and 1???l06 allogeneic BMSCs before LPS injection. Blood sample was withdrawn from the abdominal aorta at 0 (before), 4, and 8?h after LPS injection and used for biochemical analyses. After experiments, the mice were sacrificed and their organs were harvested and observed by H&E and PTAH staining. Continuous infusion of LPS into the rats gradually impaired the hemostatic parameters and damaged organ functions. However, pre-treatment with BMSCs dose-dependently improved the hemostatic parameters. Meanwhile, the treatment significantly suppressed the fibrin microthrombi formation and alleviated liver, heart, lung, and renal injuries. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that BMSCs pre-treatment inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of CD3+CD8+ T cells and CD3+/CD161a+ NKT cells in the peripheral blood. BMSCs pre-treatment reversed the upregualtion of the B-cell population and the percentage of CD43+/CD172a+ monocytes in the DIC models. Finally, BMSCs pre-treatment decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-? (IFN-?), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and increased the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in LPS-induced DIC models. Pre-treatment with BMSCs can reduce coagulation and alleviate organ dysfunction via peripheral immune responses in LPS-induced DIC rat model. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Background Survival after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has improved because of advancements in allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT has been performed in Australia since the late 1970s. However, there are few published data about health problems of allo-HSCT survivors in Australia. Aims Identify health issues in long-term survivors of allo-HSCT in an Australian centre to manage better and prevent long-term complications. Methods The health records of all patients of allo-HSCT in a single centre from January 2000 to December 2007 and survived beyond 2 years were assessed. Results Ninety-nine of the 200 allo-HSCT patients survived beyond 2 years, and the median time from allo-HSCT was 74 months. Twenty-eight?per?cent died at a median of 37 months after allo-HSCT because of relapsed malignancy (12%), stroke (1%), infection (3%), chronic graft versus host disease (9%), secondary malignancy (2%) and unknown cause (1%). Ninety-one?per?cent reported one or more chronic health conditions. Health issues were chronic graft versus host disease (70%); respiratory (66%), ophthalmic (40%), bone (33%), and renal (26%) problems; and malignancies (14% skin, 3% solid organ). Seventy-nine?per?cent resumed vocation at full or reduced capacity 2 years after allo-HSCT. Clinicians identified 40% with quality of life (QOL) issues, but survivors? self-reported QOL was comparable with the general Australian population. Conclusion This study shows that allo-HSCT patients are living with high burdens of chronic diseases that warrant lifelong surveillance and engagement with healthcare. Structured, multi-disciplinary care as recommended by published guidelines for allo-HSCT survivors may reduce long-term effects and improve their outcomes.

AB  - Summary Tolerance has been recognized for some time where chronic exposure to certain drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and opioids, is associated with apparent tachyphylaxis. When these drugs are stopped or progressively reduced as in ?tapering?, withdrawal symptoms may result. Tolerance and the flip side of the coin, withdrawal, are the determinants of addiction. It is increasingly apparent that tolerance can occur acutely, even within the time span of a single anesthetic for a surgical procedure. Addiction is caused by agents, foreign to the body, that provoke adaptation by homeostatic biological processes. When these agents are withdrawn, the adaptive mechanisms, devoid of substrate, take time to diminish and produce symptoms recognizable under the term of ?withdrawal?. Children may be exposed to these agents in different ways; in utero, as a result of substances that the mother ingests by enteral, parenteral or inhalational means that are transmitted to the infant via the placenta; as a result of an anesthetic for surgery; or as a result of sedation and analgesia administered to offset the stresses and trauma inherent from intensive care treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit or pediatric intensive care unit. Additionally, anesthetic and intensive care staff are exposed to powerful and addictive drugs as part of everyday practice, not simply by overt access, but also by subliminal environmental exposure.

AB  - Does early intervention with a light mobilization program reduce long-term sick leave for low back pain? (Central Hospital in Hedmark, Ottestad, Norway) Spine 2000;25:1973?1976. This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. Early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. In this experiment, patients were referred to a low back pain clinic and given a simple and systematic program as an outpatient treatment. Patients sick-listed 8 to 12 weeks (N = 457) for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. At 12-month follow-up assessment, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full-duty work, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Conclude that early intervention with examination, information, and recommendations to stay active showed significant effects in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patients that have been sick listed for more than 8 weeks in Norway. Comparison was between a control group that received conventional primary health care and an intervention group that was examined at a spine clinic, given information, and advised to stay active. The authors wanted to examine if an early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. This study involved 457 patients that were sick listed 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain. The inclusion criteria for the study was based on 1) 8 to 12 weeks being ?sick-listed,? 2) age (18 to 60 years), and 3) diagnosis that included back pain, low back pain, leg and thigh pain, back pain without sciatica, and sciatica. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, recent low back trauma, cauda equina symptoms, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatic low back disease, and ongoing low back treatment. The intervention used was modification of Indahl's light mobilization program where the patient was referred to a spine clinic, answered standard questionnaires, and was interviewed and examined by a treatment team consisting of a physician and a physiotherapist. Any somatic findings during the examination were explained to the patient and information was given about their importance. All radiographs were shown and explained. The idea was to educate the patient and dedramatize their problems. The patient was assured of a good prognosis and informed of the importance of remaining active to avoid development of muscle dysfunction. The physiotherapist individually advises the patient on how to train and stretch at home. They were also advised on how to manage the back pain and resume normal activity. The patients in the control group were not examined at the clinic, but were treated with primary health care, which included at least one visit to a general practitioner. The patients were reassessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The assessment was to determine if the patient had returned to full duty work. At each of the assessments, the intervention group had a higher percentage of patients that had returned to full duty work. At the 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full duty work as compared with 56.4% in a controlled group. This study demonstrates that a consultation with thorough examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement shows a significant effect in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain as compared to the conventional health care guidelines used by general practitioners that tend to recommend bed rest, caution, and reduced activities. The authors suggest that information and fear reduction when offered systematically may reduce the fear of ?doing something wrong? to the back. This may then prevent unnecessary activity and long sick leave.

AB  - The pathophysiology of wound repair is a delicately balanced, dynamic process involving both stimulatory and degradative factors to remove damaged tissue and synthesize new tissue. An imbalance of any of these factors may result in the formation of a chronic wound. Previous studies have indicated that the chronic wound environment is detrimental to cell and cytokine function, leading to delayed healing. The presence of a hostile chronic wound environment has been supported by many studies reporting elevated proteolytic activity in these wounds. However, it has not been determined if this elevation is due to an excess of a particular protease or a reduction in inhibitor levels. In this study we investigated the effect of PROMOGRANTM, a protease 'modulating matrix, on wound healing in patients with venous leg ulcers and examined the effect on the wound environment. Wound fluid samples were collected from a number of patients throughout the course of treatment and both protease and inhibitor levels were analyzed. Our results indicate that wounds which respond to PROMOGRANTM also exhibited an overall decrease in human neutrophil-derived elastase and MMP activity. An increase in the ratio of alpha-1-antitrypsin to human neutrophil-derived elastase was also observed suggesting a greater degree of regulation post therapy, and a return to a more acute-like wound environment. Wounds that did not respond to this treatment demonstrated a greatly reduced ratio, signifying a persistent excess of proteolytic activity and a continued delay in healing. It is unclear whether the observed biochemical changes in the wound environment are responsible for healing or merely symptomatic of the disease state. We have, however, shown that an overall reduction in proteolytic activity is concomitant with healing. This suggests that therapies that redress the balance of inhibitor to protease may be beneficial in treatment of chronic wounds.

AB  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) sponsored a May 2002 workshop on gene-environment interaction (G ? E) research to identify potential roadblocks to further research and to propose solutions to those roadblocks, to optimize investigative opportunities and multidisciplinary or multi-institution collaborations, and to explore ways that NIAAA can facilitate G ? E studies. Sessions included panels on animal models; phenotypes; genetic findings in humans; study designs and analytical methods; and assessment of environmental risk. Key among the identified challenges to progress in G ? E research were issues of study design and sampling strategies; logistic and methodological costs and constraints; availability and understanding of data analysis techniques; potential stigmatization of study populations; and organizational/bureaucratic structures that are inadequate to address the unique needs of large-scale, multicenter, longitudinal projects.

AB  - Abstract Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a neoplasm arising from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities. Over 20 million people in the US are at risk of developing MM due to asbestos exposure. MM mortality rates are estimated to increase by 5?10% per year in most industrialized countries until about 2020. The incidence of MM in men has continued to rise during the past 50 years, while the incidence in women appears largely unchanged. It is estimated that about 50?80% of pleural MM in men and 20?30% in women developed in individuals whose history indicates asbestos exposure(s) above that expected from most background settings. While rare for women, about 30% of peritoneal mesothelioma in men has been associated with exposure to asbestos. Erionite is a potent carcinogenic mineral fiber capable of causing both pleural and peritoneal MM. Since erionite is considerably less widespread than asbestos, the number of MM cases associated with erionite exposure is smaller. Asbestos induces DNA alterations mostly by inducing mesothelial cells and reactive macrophages to secrete mutagenic oxygen and nitrogen species. In addition, asbestos carcinogenesis is linked to the chronic inflammatory process caused by the deposition of a sufficient number of asbestos fibers and the consequent release of pro-inflammatory molecules, especially HMGB-1, the master switch that starts the inflammatory process, and TNF-alpha by macrophages and mesothelial cells. Genetic predisposition, radiation exposure and viral infection are co-factors that can alone or together with asbestos and erionite cause MM. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare the anaesthetic and cardiopulmonary effects of alfaxalone with propofol when used for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) during ovariohysterectomy in dogs. Study design? A prospective non-blinded randomized clinical study. Animals? Fourteen healthy female crossbred bitches, aged 0.5?5?years and weight 16?42?kg. Methods? Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine 0.01?mg?kg?1 and morphine 0.4?mg?kg?1. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with either propofol or alfaxalone to effect for tracheal intubation followed by an infusion of the same agent. Dogs breathed spontaneously via a ?circle? circuit, with oxygen supplementation. Cardiopulmonary parameters (respiratory and heart rates, end-tidal carbon dioxide, tidal volume, and invasive blood pressures) were measured continuously and recorded at intervals related to the surgical procedure. Arterial blood samples were analysed for blood gas values. Quality of induction and recovery, and recovery times were determined. Non-parametric data were tested for significant differences between groups using the Mann?Whitney U-test and repeatedly measured data (normally distributed) for significant differences between and within groups by anova. Results? Both propofol and alphaxalone injection and subsequent infusions resulted in smooth, rapid induction and satisfactory maintenance of anaesthesia. Doses for induction (mean?±?SD) were 5.8?±?0.30 and 1.9?±?0.07?mg?kg?1 and for the CRIs, 0.37?±?0.09 and 0.11?±?0.01?mg?kg?1 per minute for propofol and alfaxalone respectively. Median (IQR) recovery times were to sternal 45 (33?69) and 60 (46?61) and to standing 74 (69?76) and 90 (85?107) for propofol and alphaxalone respectively. Recovery quality was good. Cardiopulmonary effects did not differ between groups. Hypoventilation occurred in both groups. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Following premedication with acepromazine and morphine, both propofol and alphaxalone produce good quality anaesthesia adequate for ovariohysterectomy. Hypoventilation occurs suggesting a need for ventilatory support during prolonged infusion periods with either anaesthetic agent.

AB  - This study was performed primarily to clarify whether pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection is possible using postmortem imaging (PMI), and whether this is worthwhile. A total of 33 cadavers that underwent systematic anatomical dissection at our medical school also underwent PMI. Fixative solution was injected into the corpus 3?4 days after death. PMI was then performed using an 8-slice multi-detector CT scanner 3 months before dissection. Before dissection, a conference was held to discuss the findings of the PMI. First, two radiologists read the postmortem images without any medical information and deduced the immediate cause of death. Then, the anatomy instructor revealed the medical information available. Based on this information, the radiologist, anatomy instructor, and pathologists suggested candidate sampling sites for pathological examination. On the last day of the dissection period, the pathologists resected the sample tissues and processed them for pathological examination. In 12 of 33 cases, the presumed causes of death could be determined based on PMI alone, and revision of the cause of death described in the death certificate was considered in five (15.2%) cases, based on PMI and pathological analysis. This article presents a novel method of pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection using PMI without disturbing the anatomy education of medical students.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 814?828. Abstract Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) encompasses vascular dementia and is the second most common cause of dementing illness after Alzheimer?s disease. The main causes of VCI are: cerebral small vessel disease; multi-infarct dementia; strategic infarct (i.e. located in a functionally-critical brain area); haemorrhage/microbleed; angiopathy (including cerebral amyloid angiopathy); severe hypoperfusion (e.g. cardiac arrhythmia); and hereditary vasculopathy (e.g. cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, CADASIL). In this systematic analysis, we aimed to relate cognitive and neuropathological features of experimental models to clinical VCI. We extracted data from 107 studies covering 16 models. These included: brief global ischaemic insults (in rats, mice or gerbils); chronic global hypoperfusion (rats, mice, gerbils); chronic hypertension (in primates or stroke-prone, spontaneously-hypertensive rats); multiple ischaemic lesions because of intra-vascular emboli (in rodents, rabbits or primates); strategic ischaemic lesions (in rats or mini-pigs); generalised vasculopathies, because of mutant Notch3, hyperhomocysteinaemia, experimental diabetes mellitus or lack of cerebral vasodilator M5 receptors (rats or mice). Most cognitive testing showed deficits in working and reference memory. The lesions observed were microinfarcts, diffuse white matter lesions, hippocampal neuronal death, focal ischaemic lesions and micro-haemorrhages. The most-used model was bilateral carotid artery occlusion in rats, leading to chronic hypoperfusion and white matter injury.

AB  - 1 Jose F. Tellez-Zenteno, 1 Scott B. Patten, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Studies indicate that up to 50% of patients with epilepsy have mental health disorders, with mood, anxiety, and psychotic disturbances being the most common. However, the prevalence of psychiatric illnesses in persons with epilepsy in the general population varies, owing to differences in methods, population, case ascertainment, and heterogeneity of epilepsy syndromes. We assessed the prevalence of self-reported, physician diagnosed mental health conditions associated with epilepsy in a large Canadian population health survey Methods: The Canadian Community Health Survey (CHS, N = 36,984) used probabilistic sampling to explore numerous aspects of mental health in the entire Canadian population, of whom 253 subjects had epilepsy. With sampling weights, the prevalence of epilepsy was 0.6%. Depression was ascertained with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Short Form). Other valid scales various aspects of psychiatric comorbidity. The prevalence of drug and alcohol use, and abnormal ideation were ascertained through personal interviews. We explored age specific prevalence of mental health problems in epilepsy Results: The lifetime prevalence of depression was 22.2% (95%CI 14.0?30.4%) compared with 12.2% in the general population. The prevalence of depression in people with epilepsy was higher than in the general population in younger, but not older (>64 years) age groups. There was a marked effect of age on the prevalence of major depression (higher in younger individuals). The prevalence of social phobia was 15.8% (8.4?23.2) in people with epilepsy and 8.1% (7.6?8.5) in the general population. The 12-month prevalence of drug or alcohol dependence was not higher in people with epilepsy (3.0%) than in the general population (3.1%). Lifetime suicidal ideation was higher in patients with epilepsy 25.0% (95% CI 16.6?33.3) than in the general population 13.3% (95% CI 12.8?13.9) Conclusions: The prevalence of depression was considerable higher in younger people with epilepsy than in the general population. Social phobia and low indices of well being were more prevalent in epilepsy. We corroborated a high prevalence of suicidal ideation was in epilepsy patients. In contrast to other reports, we did not find a higher prevalence of alcohol and drug dependence in people with epilepsy. The complete analysis of mental health comorbidity will be presented 1 Miranda Geelhoed, 1 Anne Olde Boerrigter, 2 Peter R. Camfield, 1 Ada T. Geerts, 1 Willem Arts, 2 Bruce M. Smith, and 2 Carol S. Camfield ( 1 Department of Pediatric Neurology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands ; and 2 Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University and IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada ) Rationale: About 50?60% of children with epilepsy eventually outgrow their seizure disorder. A number of predictive factors have been statistically associated with remission but it is unclear how accurate these factors are when applied to an individual child. Two large prospective cohort studies of childhood epilepsy (Nova Scotia and the Netherlands) each developed a statistical model to predict long-term outcome. We evaluated the accuracy of a prognostic model based on the two studies combined. Methods: A wealth of clinical and EEG variables were available for patients in both cohort studies. Data analyses with classification tree models and stepwise logistic regression produced predictive models for the combined dataset and the two separate cohorts. The resulting models were then externally validated on the opposite cohort. Remission was defined as no longer receiving daily medication for any length of time at the end of follow-up. Results: The combined cohorts yielded 1055 evaluable patients. At the end of follow up (≥5 years in >96%), 622 (59%) were in remission. Using the combined data, the classification tree model and the logistic regression model predicted the outcome (remission or no remission) correctly in approximately 70% (sensitivity ?72%, specificity?65%, positive predictive value?75%, negative predictive value ? 62%). The classification tree model split the data on epilepsy syndrome and age at first seizure. Independent statistically significant predictors in the logistic regression model were: seizure number before treatment, age at first seizure, absence seizures, epilepsy types of symptomatic generalized and symptomatic partial, pre-existing neurological signs, intelligence and the combination of febrile seizures and cryptogenic partial epilepsy. When the prediction models from each cohort were cross-validated on the opposite cohort, the outcome was predicted slightly less accurately than the model from the combined data. Conclusions: Based on currently available clinical and EEG variables, predicting the outcome of childhood epilepsy is difficult and appears to be incorrect in about one of every three patients. Predictions schemes are statistically robust but clinically relatively inaccurate. We suggest that clinicians should be cautious in applying prediction models when developing management strategies for individual children with epilepsy. 1 A. T. Berg, 2 B. G. Vickrey, 3 S. Smith, 3 F. M. Testa, 4 S. Shinnar, 3 S. R. Levy, 5 F. DiMario, and 3 B. Beckerman ( 1 BIOS, NIU, DeKalb, IL ; 2 Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Pediatrics, Yale, New Haven, CT ; 4 Neurology, Montefiore Hospital, Bronx, NY ; and 5 Neurology, CCMC, Hartford, CT ) Rationale: It is typically assumed that intractablility is evident soon after the onset of epilepsy. Retrospective histories from surgical patients, however, suggest that intractable seizures may not be evident for many years, particularly in partial epilepsy of childhood onset. Methods: In a community-based study of 613 children in Connecticut with newly diagnosed epilepsy (1993?97) prospectively followed a median of 9 years, the timing of the appearance of intractable epilepsy from date of initial diagnosis was determined. Two definitions for intractable epilepsy were used: 1) ?Strict:? 2 AED failures, ≥1 seizure/month for 18 months; 2) ?Loose:? 2 AED failures. Differences in the timing of the appearance of intractability were examined as a function of type of epilepsy syndrome. Results: Eighty-two children met the strict criteria for intractability: 38/294 (13%) of those with cryptogenic or symptomatic partial epilepsy (C/S-PE), 35/67 (52%) of those with an epileptic encephalopathy (EE) and 9/241 (4%) of those with idiopathic or other forms of epilepsy (p < 0.0001). Eleven children followed<18 months were not assigned an outcome. Twenty-five (30%) of the 82 intractable cases took >3 years to meet the strict criteria for intractability. The primary interest was in comparing EE and C/S-PE groups. Five of 35 (14%) intractable cases in the EE group versus 17/38 (45%) in the C/S-PE group met criteria at >3 years (p = 0.005). Loose criteria for intractability (2 AED failures) were met by 135 children. Of these, 32 (24%) met criteria >3 years after diagnosis: 1/46 in the EE group versus 25/69 in the C/S-PE group (p < 0.0001). In the C/S-PE group, 18/25 (72%) 25 who failed a second drug >3 years after diagnosis had experienced a 1+ year remission before the second drug failure. Conclusions: Poor seizure outcome is generally evident from the outset in the epileptic encephalopathies such as West, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. By contrast, the appearance of intractability may be delayed in cryptogenic/symptomatic partial epilepsy. Retrospective data1 suggest that with a median follow-up of 9 years, roughly a third to half the intractable cases that might occur in the cryptogenic/symptomatic partial epilepsy group have yet to declare themselves. Only continued prospective study in the current cohort, however, will reveal the eventual true burden of intractability and its time course. REFERENCE 1.?Berg AT, et al How long does it take for partial epilepsy to become intractable Neurology, 2003;60: 186?190. (Supported by NIH RO1-NS31146.) 1 Christina A. Palmese, 1 Marla J. Hamberger, 1 David Weintraub, 2 Nikolaos Scarmeas, 1 Hyunmi Choi, and 1 Lawrence J. Hirsch ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY ; and 2 Department of Neurology and Taub Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY ) Rationale: It is well established that individuals with epilepsy frequently report memory problems and show deficits on objective memory measures. In recent years, cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil have been shown to improve memory or delay memory decline in patients with other neurological disorders (e.g., dementia, multiple sclerosis). The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was to determine whether donepezil would improve memory or other cognitive functions in epilepsy patients. Methods: Twenty-three epilepsy patients with subjective memory complaints (9 simple partial, 14 complex partial or generalized; mean age: 41 SD = 9.25; 16 males, 7 females) were tested at baseline, after 3 months on donepezil, and after 3 months on placebo. Patients were randomized into two treatment groups receiving 3 months of donepezil followed by 3 months of a placebo, or vice versa. Donepezil was started at a dose of 5mg/day for 4 weeks and increased to 10mg/day for the remaining 8 weeks. Functions tested included verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Medical College of Georgia (?MCG?) story memory), visual memory (MCG Figure Memory Test), Attention (Continuous Attention Test, Stroop Test), visuomotor speed (Symbol Digit Coding), and fine motor speed and dexterity (Grooved Pegboard). Subjective memory complaints, quality of life and mood were assessed with the QOLIE-31 and Profile of Mood Scale (POMS). Change scores were calculated comparing baseline with both placebo and donepezil, and these difference scores were compared via paired sample t-tests. Results: While on donepezil, patients exhibited significantly stronger performance on MCG immediate story recall (donepezil mean change: 11.08 (SD = 11.69), placebo mean change: 6.78 (SD = 10.99), p = .04). However, they also showed poorer Stroop performance (p = .02), reported lower energy and ?vigor? (p = .01), and indicated poorer ?quality of life? (p = .01) on donepezil compared to placebo. Across donepezil and placebo treatment periods, there were no significant changes in subjective memory report or in number of side effects reported while patients were on donepezil versus placebo. There were also no significant differences in seizure frequency (p = .55). No patient reported any adverse event. Conclusions: Although patients exhibited improvement in immediate memory while on donepezil, they also exhibited worsening in attention, energy and quality of life. These results suggest that donepezil does not provide significant benefit for patients with epilepsy and subjective memory impairment, though this does not rule out possible benefit in individuals. There was no effect on seizure frequency in this study. (Supported by Pfizer Inc.) 1 Alison M. Pack, 2 Martha J. Morrell, 1 Alison Randall, 1 Silvia Done, 1 Edith Flaster, and 3 Elizabeth Shane ( 1 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Neurology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA ; and 3 Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: We previously reported significant bone loss at the femoral neck of the hip in women with epilepsy receiving phenytoin (PHT) when followed for 1 year longitudinally. It has been postulated that adverse effects on bone secondary to PHT treatment are a result of enzyme inducing increased metabolism of vitamin D. We hypothesized that concentrations of vitamin D metabolites after 1 year of treatment would be significantly lower in women treated with PHT than other AEDs including carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA), and lamotrigine (LTG). Methods: Women with epilepsy aged 18?40 receiving AED monotherapy were recruited. AEDs studied were PHT, CBZ, VPA and LTG. Subjects had baseline bone mineral density (BMD) studies as assessed by DXA and serologic measurements of calcium and vitamin D metabolites (25, hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D). Subjects were followed for 1 year and repeat studies were obtained. Correlation between change in BMD and calcium and vitamin D metabolites after 1 year of treatment was evaluated. Results: Data was obtained from 66 women. There were 7 women receiving PHT, 27 receiving CBZ, 13 receiving VPA, and 19 receiving LTG. Serum calcium levels did not change significantly after 1 year of treatment in all AED treated groups. As we previously reported, baseline calcium levels were significantly lower in women treated with PHT, CBZ, and VPA compared to those treated with LTG. Serum 25, hydroxyvitamin D concentrations also did not change significantly in any of the AED treated groups. As we previously reported, there was no significant difference among baseline levels of 25, hydroxyvitamin D among the AED treated groups. Serum 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significantly higher after 1 year of treatment in LTG treated women (32.80 ? 39.55 pg/ml; p = 0.0067). Although not significant, there was a reduction in 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in women treated with PHT (31.10 ? 24.70 pg/ml). BMD loss at the femoral neck of the hip did not correlate with changes in calcium or vitamin D metabolite concentrations. Conclusions: Calcium and 25, hydroxyvitamin D concentrations did not change significantly in women treated with PHT, CBZ, VPA, and LTG and followed longitudinally for 1 year. Serum 25, hydroxyvitamin D is the most commonly used index of vitamin D status. Although not significant, there was a reduction in 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in women treated with PHT for 1 year. BMD loss did not correlate with changes in either calcium or vitamin D metabolites. The lack of significance of these findings may in part be explained by the small sample size of the PHT treated group. However, they do suggest that previously reported bone loss in PHT treated women may not be secondary to effects on vitamin D metabolism. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline.) 1 Douglas R. Nordli, 2 Solomon L. Moshé, 3 L. Matthew Frank, 4 John M. Pellock, 5 Darrell V. Lewis, 4 Anthony Marmarou, 6 Dale C. Hesdorffer, 2 Shlomo Shinnar, and 1?5 FEBSTAT Study Team ( 1 Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL ; 2 Montefiore, Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; 3 Children's Hospital of The King's Daughter, Norfolk, VA ; 4 Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ; 5 Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC ; and 6 Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: To study the role of acute EEG studies in children with febrile status epilepticus in predicting acute MRI abnormalities and later development of epilepsy and, more specifically, of subsequent mesial temporal sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: As part of the multi-institutional FEBSTAT study, neurological examinations, MRIs with particualr attention to the hippocampus, and EEGs were performed within 72 hours of febrile status epilepticus in children five years of age or younger. EEGs are read by two independent readers, blinded to clinical histories, and a consensus is reached. The primary outcome measure of the ongoing FEBSTAT study is the development of MTS, clinical epilepsy, or both. The study also seeks to determine if initial imaging and EEG studies can predict outcome. Results: As of April, 2005, 75 subjects have been enrolled. Consensus readings have been performed on the first 46 EEGs. Of these, 11 (24%) showed one or more abnormality. Specific findings include the following. Nine EEGs demonstrated slowing or attenuation, which was localized to the temporal lobe in 8 cases (17%). In one circumstance the attenuation involved the entire hemisphere. Two other EEGs showed diffuse slowing only. Spikes were the exclusive abnormality in only two tracings (frontal in one, and posterior temporal in the other). Temporal lobe spikes were seen along with temporal lobe slowing in only two cases. Conclusions: Focal temporal slowing, attenuation, or both is seen in 17% of children with febrile status epilepticus indicating temporal lobe dysfunction in this group. Focal epileptiform discharges were half as common. Further analysis will determine whether the acute EEG abnormalities correlate with hippocampal T2 signal abnormalities that are being seen in a significant number of children in this cohort. Additionally, the design of the study will allow us to look at the evolution of the EEG in those children at high risk for the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. (Supported by NINDS NS43209: Consequences of Prolonged Febrile Seizures in Childhood.) 1 Stephan U. Schuele, 1 Adriana C. Bermeo, 1 Richard C. Burgess, 1 Dudley Dinner, and 1 Nancy Foldvary ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Ictal asystole with focal epilepsy is a rare but potentially life-threatening event and is a likely contributor to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Risk factors allowing early detection and intervention are unknown and ictal asystole remains an incidental finding in large monitoring populations. While there have been some inconsistent correlations (such as more frequent accompaniment to left temporal lobe seizures) semiologic characteristics associated with ictal asystole have not been described, and may be helpful in screening for high risk patients. Methods: Electronic database search of all patients undergoing longterm Video-EEG monitoring between 1994 and 2005 with episodes of aystole during simultaneous ECG acquisition. Patients with asystole during non-epileptic events (e.g. syncopal events) were excluded. Results: Ictal asystole was found in seven out of 5977 patients (0.12%) and occured in 12 out of 42 (29%) of their recorded events. Two of the patients were male and five female, mean age was 28 years (range 2 to 54 years). Asystole occured on average 41 seconds (s) after EEG onset (range 3?95 s) and was in all cases preceded by sinus bradycardia. Duration of asystole averaged 17 s (range 4?33 s). Sinus rhythm recurred spontaneously in all patients without requiring cardiac resusciation. Temporal lobe epilepsy was diagnosed in five patients, in three on the right, in one on the left and in one bilateral. Asystole in this group lasted between 4.5s and 33 s. In all five patients, episodes of sudden unresponsiveness associated with manual or oral automatism were reported as typical events. During the Video-EEG monitoring in four of these five patients, the habitual semiology was followed by a pronounced sudden loss of tone and body posture coinciding with the asystole. In the one patient without noticeable loss of tone, a generalized tonic seizure lasting more than 20s occured within five seconds after onset of the asystole. All five patients underwent pacemaker implantation. Two patients had extratemporal lobe epilepsy. One suffered from axial tonic seizures associated with a regional EEG seizure pattern over the vertex. The other one had episodes of unresponsiveness and staring associated with a left hemispheric focal epilepsy. Asystole lasted between 4s and 7s and no loss of tone was noted during Video-EEG monitoring. Conclusions: Ictal aystole is a rare but potentially life-threatening event. It is most commonly seen in patients with right or left temporal lobe epilepsy. Although a history of atonia and falls is often not obtained, loss of tone and posture can frequently be seen during Video-EEG-monitoring. Drop attacks at clinical onset have been reported in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, however a delayed sudden loss of tone is distinctly uncommon and may be revealed by a detailed history. Further cardiac monitoring in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and delayed atonia or drop attacks might be warranted. 1 Gregory D. Cascino, 1 Edward M. Manno, 2 Eric A. Pfeifer, 1 Katherine H. Noe, and 1 Eelco F.M. Wijdicks ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; and 2 Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: To evaluate the incidence and significance of cardiac contraction band necrosis (CBN) in patients who die during status epilepticus (SE). CBN has been observed in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and other life-threatening neurological emergencies. Massive catecholamine release may be the mechanism of CBN and cardiac arrhythmias that occur in these individuals. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 28 patients who were derived from 54 consecutive patients with SE who underwent an autopsy between January 1975 and December 2003. The medical and pathological records were reviewed in all patients. Twenty six individuals were excluded because of an inability to confirm the diagnosis of SE or unavailability of cardiac anatomical specimens for examination. The 28 patients were divided into two groups: Group I- Died during refractory SE (n = 11), Group II- Died remote from SE (n = 17). The cardiac pathology in the two groups was compared to 22 randomly selected individuals (control group) who died without a known history of seizures. Nonconvulsive SE was confirmed by EEG studies. One investigator (EP) blinded to the clinical history and previous pathology reports reviewed the cardiac pathology slides for CBN. Results: There were no significant differences in age, gender or history of heart disease between the three patient groups. Nine of the Group I patients had generalized convulsive SE and two patients had nonconvulsive SE. Eight of the 11 patients in Group I had CBN compared to 5 of 22 patients in the control group (p < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Three of 17 patients in Group II had CBN compared to 5 of 22 patients in the control group (p = 1.0, Fisher's exact test). CBN occurred more frequently in Group I patients than Group II patients (p < .01, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: Cardiac CBN was identified in most patients in this series who died during an episode of SE. This specific anatomical pathology was uncommon in patients with a remote history of SE or an age-matched control group. This study provides compelling evidence that cardiac CBN may be a potential pathophysiology for cardiac decompensation and death in individuals with SE or seizure activity.

Jirsch, 1 Francois Dubeau, 1 Elena Urrestarazu, 1 Pierre LeVan, and 1 Jean Gotman ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Seizures recorded with subdural grids have demonstrated high frequency activities up to 130Hz in contacts close to the seizure focus. We report localized changes in high frequency activity during seizures in patients with temporal and extra-temporal epilepsy implanted with depth macroelectrodes. Methods: Intracranial EEGs were obtained from stereotaxically-placed depth and epidural electrodes filtered at 500Hz and sampled at 2000Hz in 8 consecutive patients. The epileptic zone was well-localized in 6 patients with 4 having mesial temporal (MT) and 2 having frontal neocortical foci with dysplastic lesions, and was regional or poorly localized in 2 others. Characteristic EEG sections lasting 3?10 s were selected within the seizures of each patient to reflect ictal onset, propagation and termination. Distinct high frequency (>100 Hz) segments were identified visually in the background and in the seizure sections by analyzing the expanded record dually with 50Hz and 100 Hz high-pass filters. Focal changes in high frequency activity during the seizure were also identified using spectral analysis by comparing section band powers (i.e. slow (0?40Hz), high frequency (HF, 100?200Hz), very high frequency (VHF, 250?500Hz)) with the background. Results: 12 seizures were analyzed from the 4 patients with MT foci, 7 from the 2 patients with neocortical foci, and 4 from the 2 patients with no definitive epileptogenic zone. Discrete, focal VHF segments were visually identified at seizure onset in 4/4 MT patients, involving contacts in the epileptic zone. Increased HF activity compared to the background was distinguished both visually and with spectral analysis later in the seizures of 3/4 MT patients, involving contacts in the epileptic zone and, in one patient, areas of contralateral peri-hippocampal propagation. The 2 patients with neocortical foci had increased HF activity confined to the epileptic zone late in their seizures, identified by visual and spectral analysis. No discrete HF or VHF activity was present in the poorly-localized seizures. Conclusions: VHF segments (fast ripples?) were consistently present in the epileptic zone early in seizures of patients with MT epilepsy. In contrast, HF activity was seen more prominently later in seizures, involving the epileptogenic areas of MT and neocortical patients, as well as areas of mesial temporal propagation. Changes in high frequency activity (100 to 500Hz) were absent in patients whose seizures were poorly-localized.This study demonstrates that changes in high frequency activity occur in regions of primary epileptogenesis and secondary spread in anatomically different foci. These activities may reflect focal synchronization of neuronal ensembles that are important in initiating or maintaining ictal activity. Moreover, absent high frequency activity seems to indicate poor localization. (Supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.) 1 Heinrich Vogt, 1 Thomas Baisch, and 1 Ian W. Mothersill ( 1 Swiss Epilepsy Center, Swiss Epilepsy Center, Zuerich, Switzerland ) Rationale: The progressive myoclonus epilepsies comprise a heterogenous group of diseases wich are clinically characterised by myoclonus with variable localisation, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, progressive dementia of variable severity and neurological symptomes, usually cerebellar. It is generally accepted that the locomotory disablement is due to cerebellar ataxia. We observed that in the course of the disease negative myoclonias are one of the most striking symptom and hypothesised that they were the main reason for locomotor disability. Methods: Negative myoclonias are very difficult to recognise without ictal polygraphic recordings in freely moving patients.We performed ictal polygraphic video-EEG-recordings (16 channel EEG, 8 channel surface EMG) in 13 patients with EPM1 (Unverricht-Lundborg Disease), proven by mutation of the CSTB Gene, 1 MERFF with a mitochondrial point mutation and 2 EPM2 (Lafora disease), proven by skin biopsy. Results: All 16 patients presented with negative myoclonias of short duration either isolated or in combination with myoclonus. They were provoked by voluntary movement. The duration of the muscular atonia was between 100 and 300 ms. Except 3 patients with EPM1 all where wheelchair bound, mainly due to fear of falls, caused by the frequent muscle atonias. Conclusions: We have shown, using simultaneous EEG/EMG recordings in freely moving patients, that the locomotor disability is in fact mainly due to negative myoclonus in voluntary innervated muscles. 1 Florian Mormann, 1,2 Hannes Osterhage, 1 Ralph G.

Elger, and 1,2 Klaus Lehnertz ( 1 Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany ; and 2 Helmholtz-Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany ) Rationale: The localization of the epileptic focus from intracranial EEG recordings during the interictal period (i.e., without the necessity of observing any seizures) has been a focus of research in the past years. In addition to linear and nonlinear univariate measures, bivariate measures for synchronization have been shown to be capable of correctly lateralizing the focal hemisphere in the majority of cases. A more precise localization of the focal area, however, has not been achieved. Since the pathological neurons constituting the epileptic focus are assumed to drive the surrounding tissue, we used bivariate measures of directionality to investigate the driving influence of a focal area on the surrounding regions. Methods: We analyzed intracranial EEG recordings from the seizure-free intervals of 30 patients with medically intractable medial temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing invasive presurgical diagnostics. EEG signals were recorded via bilateral intrahippocampal depth electrodes, the total recording time comprised more than 83 hours. Side of focus was assessed by complete postoperative seizure control after selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy. Histopathological evaluation showed hippocampal sclerosis in all cases. A measure for directionality of phase coupling was calculated for all combinations of depth electrodes within each hemisphere using a moving window technique and then averaged over time. Results: In 26 out of 30 cases, we found a distinct region in the ipsilateral hippocampal formation that drove the surrounding regions both in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal formation. The spatial extent of this region was usually found to range between 5 and 20 mm. Conclusions: Even during the seizure-free interval, the focus appears to be driving its surrounding areas. Its influence can be seen not only on the ipsilateral, but also on the contralateral temporal lobe. Analysis using directionality measures may allow a functional delineation of the focal area during the presurgical evaluation as a prerequisite for super-selective resection in epilepsy surgery.

Tucker ( 1 Neurology, Regional Epilepsy Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; 2 Electrical Geodesic, INC., Eugene, OR ; 3 Psychology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR ; and 4 Neurología, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Lima, Peru ) Rationale: To determine the regions of cerebral cortex activated during the onset and propagation of electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform patterns in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods: Ten patients with the clinical diagnosis of JME were included; there were three women and seven men between 16 and 38 years of age. Standard EEG studies demonstrated generalized 4?6 Hz spike-wave or multiple spike-wave discharges. In all cases the MRI and neurological exams were normal. A dense-array, 256-channel scalp EEG recorded epileptiform discharges in each patient. Source analyses of discharges were performed in all subjects, using an equivalent dipole (BESA) and two linear inverse methods (LORETA and LAURA), with results co-registered to a standard MRI model. Results: The three methods of source analyses yielded generally convergent results. In all patients epileptiform discharges engaged orbital-frontal cortex and basal-mesial temporal regions, with the left side more often involved than the right. Activation of occipital cortex was also frequent, with occasional rapid spread to superior or mesial frontal, or parietal regions. Spike components preferentially activated orbital-frontal and temporal cortex, while slow wave elements had wider distributions over the same areas. Some variations were found in propagation patterns both within and between subjects. Conclusions: Epileptiform patterns in JME patients have both localized onsets and a restricted cortical network during propagation that consistently includes orbital-frontal and basal-mesial temporal areas, with less frequent activation of occipital cortex and other regions.
