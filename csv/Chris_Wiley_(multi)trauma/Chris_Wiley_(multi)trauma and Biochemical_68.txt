AB  - Abstract: Revolutionary advances in tissue engineering are redefining approaches to tissue repair and transplantation through the creation of replacement tissues that remain biointeractive after implantation, imparting physiologic functions as well as structure to the tissue or organ damaged by disease or trauma.1,2 Over the last decade this field has moved from ?science fiction? to ?science fact? with the research-oriented acceptance of its potential to regulatory approvals allowing commercial products to be available for use in many countries. The maintenance of tissue integrity, functionality, and viability from cell seeding through product manufacture, shipping, and end-use has been accomplished through innovations in design and scale-up of both tissue growth and preservation processes. These unique systems have enabled the delivery of tissue-engineered products that are uniform inter- and intra-lot, readily available as off-the-shelf products, easy to use, and efficacious. Skin replacement products are the most advanced, with several tissue-engineered wound care materials on the market in the U.S. and in several international communities.3-5 The potential impact of this field is far broader, offering novel solutions to the medical field for drug screening and development, genetic engineering, and total tissue and organ replacement.

AB  - A five-month-old female Jack Russell terrier was presented for investigation of acute lethargy, anorexia, coughing, respiratory distress and weakness. Examination findings included cyanosis, a grade 3 of 6 systolic heart murmur and prolonged capillary refill time. Radiography and echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure. Indirect measurement of the systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated pressures over 100 mmHg. Despite treatment the patient died. Post-mortem examination did not identify a congenital cardiovascular anomaly. Histopathology confirmed acute necrotising pulmonary arteritis and immunohistochemistry failed to identify any immune complex or complement deposition.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess if positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, without hemodynamic impairment in horses during anesthesia. Design Prospective, randomized study. Animals Thirteen isoflurane-anesthetized healthy horses. Methods After 60 minutes of anesthesia with spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation was initiated with an inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 10?20 mL kg?1 and respiratory rate adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Constant PEEP of 5 cmH2O was continued (control group; n = 6) or titrated (PEEP group; n = 7) by increasing and decreasing PEEP from 5 to 20 cmH2O at 15-minute intervals. The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow collection of blood for pH and blood gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output (CO) using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary assessment was recorded before PEEP titration and after 15 minutes at each PEEP value. Results In the PEEP group, static compliance (range) (Cst 278?463 mL cmH2O?1) was significantly higher and the shunt fraction ( 7?20%) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [P(A-a)O2 95?325 mmHg] were significantly lower than in the control group [Cst of 246?290 mL cmH2O?1, of 16?19%, P(A-a)O2 of 253?310 mmHg; p < 0.05]. CO (mean ± SEM) was lower in the PEEP group (23 ± 2 L minute?1) at 20 cmH2O PEEP than in the control group (26 ± 4 L minute?1, p < 0.05), with no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure or central venous pressure. Conclusions PEEP titration significantly improved gas exchange and lung compliance, with a small decrease in CO at the highest PEEP level. Clinical relevance Gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during inhalation anesthesia can be treated using PEEP titration from 5 to 20 cmH2O, without clinically important hemodynamic effects in healthy horses.

AB  - Background:? The human forearm biopsy model is employed by the Wound Healing Cooperative Group to evaluate the effect of novel agents on acute wounds. Bismuth Subgallate/Borneal (Suile) is a new product with FDA permission for the treatment of partial thickness wounds. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Suile may be effective in the treatment of full thickness wounds because of its antimicrobial, hemostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Methods:? In our randomized, investigator-blinded study, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent two 6?mm full-thickness skin biopsies on the flexor surface of each forearm (two wounds per subject). Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to control (daily bacitracin) or to the treatment arm (daily Suile). The wounds were examined, measured by digital planimetry, and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events and pain levels were monitored. Healing velocity and time-to-complete closure were determined. Results:? The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of wound healing outcomes achieved by the Suile regimen versus bacitracin alone. Subject compliance was excellent. The conduct of the study was further facilitated by the use of handheld electronic documentation. Conclusion:? The forearm biopsy model has several advantages: It allows for a direct comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion, studies can be conducted rapidly with good patient compliance and it allows investigators to gain firsthand experience with products prior to embarking on large clinical trials in chronic wounds.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage, synovitis, subchondral bone changes, and osteophyte formation. Currently there is no treatment for OA except temporary pain relief and end-stage joint replacement surgery. We performed a pilot study to determine the effect of kartogenin (KGN, a small molecule) on both cartilage and subchondral bone in a rat model of OA using multimodal imaging techniques. OA was induced in rats (OA and KGN treatment group) by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) surgery in the right knee joint. Sham surgery was performed on the right knee joint of control group rats. KGN group rats received weekly intra-articular injection of 125??M KGN 1 week after surgery until week 12. All rats underwent in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after surgery. Quantitative MR relaxation measures (T1? and T2) were determined to evaluate changes in articular cartilage. Cartilage and bone turnover markers (COMP and CTX-I) were determined at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 weeks. Animals were sacrificed at week 12 and the knee joints were removed for micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. KGN treatment significantly lowered the T1? and T2 relaxation times indicating decreased cartilage degradation. KGN treatment significantly decreased COMP and CTX-I levels indicating decreased cartilage and bone turnover rate. KGN treatment also prevented subchondral bone changes in the ACLT rat model of OA. Thus, kartogenin is a potential drug to prevent joint deterioration in post-traumatic OA. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 34:1780?1789, 2016.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Uterus transplantation has recently proved that infertility in women with uterine factor infertility can be cured. It is still an experimental procedure with numerous critical details remaining to be established, including tolerance to warm and cold ischemic insults. In preparation for human uterus transplantation trials, most teams use the sheep as a model system for research and team training, since the vasculature and the uterus is of similar size as in the human. We, therefore, aimed to develop an ex vivo sheep uterus reperfusion platform that mimics the reperfusion situation so that initial assessments and comparisons can be performed without the need for costly and labor-intensive in vivo transplantation experiments. Material and methods Isolated sheep uteri were perfused with the preservation solution IGL-1 and were then exposed to cold ischemia for either 4 (n = 6) or 48 hours (n = 7). Uteri were then reperfused for 48 hours under normothermic conditions with an oxygenated recirculating perfusate containing growth factors and synthetic oxygen carriers. Histological and biochemical analysis of the perfusate was conducted to assess reperfusion injury. Results Quantification of cell density indicated no significant edema in the myometrium or in the endometrium of uteri exposed to 4 hours cold ischemia and then a normothermic ex vivo reperfusion for 48 hours. Only the outer serosa layer and the inner columnar luminal epithelial cells were affected by the reperfusion. However, a much faster and severe reperfusion damage of all uterine layers were evident during the reperfusion experiment following 48 hours of cold ischemia. This was indicated by major accumulation of extracellular fluid, presence of apoptotic-labeled glandular epithelial layer and vascular endothelium. A significant accumulation of lactate was measured in the perfusate with a subsequent decrease in pH. Conclusions We developed a novel ex vivo sheep uterus model for prolonged perfusion. This model proved to be able to distinguish reperfusion injury-related differences associated to organ preservation. The experimental setup is a platform that can be used to conduct further studies on uterine ischemia- and reperfusion injury that may lead to improved human uterus transplantation protocols.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of neurological function and, depending upon the severity of injury, may lead to paralysis. Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for SCI. High-dose methylprednisolone is widely used, but this treatment is controversial. We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 ?g 17?-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).

AB  - A ureteral sarcoma was diagnosed in a nine-year-old Weimaraner dog with gross haematuria, severe unilateral hydronephrosis, and hydroureter. Treatment consisted of unilateral nephrectomy and ureterectomy. This case was compared with 14 other ureteral tumours reported in the veterinary literature. Only three previous reports concerned a malignant ureteral tumour. Urinary tract neoplasms mainly involve the bladder and the kidney, and more rarely the urethra. The purpose of this paper is to report a rare case of malignant ureteral tumour in a dog.

AB  - Background: Tocopherols and tocotrienols possess vitamin E activity and function as the major lipid-soluble antioxidants in the human body. Commercial lipid emulsions are composed of different oils and supply different amounts of vitamin E. The objective of this study was to measure all 8 vitamin E homologs within 4 different commercial lipid emulsions and evaluate their distribution in guinea pig tissues. Materials and Methods: The distribution of vitamin E homologs within plasma and guinea pig tissues was determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Lipid hydroperoxides in lipid emulsions were determined using a commercial kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI), and malondialdehyde tissue levels were determined using an HPLC system. Results: The lipid emulsions contained variable amounts of tocopherols, which were significantly different between emulsions. Tocotrienols were present at very low concentrations (≤0.3%). We found no correlation between the amount of vitamin E present in the lipid emulsions and lipid peroxidation. Hydroperoxides were the lowest with an olive oil?based emulsion and highest with a fish oil emulsion. The predominant vitamin E homolog in guinea pig tissues was α-tocopherol. No tissues had detectable levels of tocotrienols. Vitamin E levels (primarily α-tocopherol and ?-tocopherol) were highly variable among organ tissues. Plasma levels were a poor reflection of most tissue levels. Conclusion: Vitamin E levels within different lipid emulsions and plasma/tissues are highly variable, and no one tissue or plasma sample serves as a good proxy for levels in other tissues. All study emulsions were well tolerated and did not significantly increase systemic lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Abstract Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a chronic, complex process associated with low back pain; mechanisms of its occurrence have not yet been fully elucidated. Its process is not only accompanied by morphological changes, but also by systematic changes in its histological and biochemical properties. Many cellular and molecular mechanisms have been reported to be related with IDD and to reverse degenerative trends, abnormal conditions of the living cells and altered cell phenotypes would need to be restored. Promising biological therapeutic strategies still rely on injection of active substances, gene therapy and cell transplantation. With advanced study of tissue engineering protocols based on cell therapy, combined use of seeding cells, bio-active substances and bio-compatible materials, are promising for IDD regeneration. Recently reported progenitor cells within discs themselves also hold prospects for future IDD studies. This article describes the background of IDD, current understanding and implications of potential therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Inca imperial strategies of political and territorial expansion varied across conquered regions depending on local ecology and cultural resistance, and Chachapoya peoples in Peru's forested northeastern Andes were renowned for their rebellions against the invaders. The cliff tombs of Los Pinchudos (AD 1470?1535) present opportunities to use stable isotopes to: (1) explore dietary and mobility patterns from a mortuary community interred at a site attributed to the poorly-known Chachapoya culture during the period of Inca domination, and (2) explore the origins of the individuals as either local or foreign (Inca). Using biochemical tracers, we can help resolve the impact of foreign influence and changes in population and social structure during imperial occupation. Materials and Methods While it is difficult to reconstruct individual life histories from incomplete skeletons, stable isotopic analysis of multiple skeletal tissues provides a direct means of characterizing diet and residential mobility. Values of stable carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and oxygen isotope (δ18O) ratios were determined in bone and dentine collagen and bone and enamel carbonate from 28 samples (11 paired tissues) from males, females, and juveniles from Los Pinchudos. Results Dietary signatures are consistent with a mixed but more C3-based plant and protein-based diet with moderate proportions of terrestrial animals. Oxygen isotopic values demonstrate limited variation between paired tissues, with a few possible nonlocal individuals buried in one particular tomb at the site. Compared to other Andean areas that underwent imperial domination, these data do not demonstrate expected dietary shifts. Discussion These are the first isotopic data from a Chachapoya site and our research shows evidence for minimal non-local presence in this commingled burial assemblage. The regional diet reconstructed at Los Pinchudos (2850 masl) focused on resources of higher altitude tuber crops, beans, and grains (C3) and terrestrial protein rather than on lower elevation grasses such as maize (C4) as in other highland Andean regions under Inca control. During imperial domination, inhabitants of this region appropriated Inca materials goods but continued to construct tombs in the local manner even though a potentially diverse population was occupying them.

Future perspectives The stimuli for neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative disorders are multi-factorial and may include genetic predisposition, environmental factors, cellular stressors such as oxidative stress and free radical production, bioenergy failure, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, disruption of Ca2+-regulating systems, mitochondrial dysfunction and misfolded protein accumulation. Cellular stress disrupts functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a critical organelle for protein quality control, leading to induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress may contribute to neurodegeneration in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the molecular events occurring during ER stress and the unfolded protein response and it specifically evaluates the evidence suggesting the ER stress response plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - There are limited data on demographics, long-term follow-up, and iron/rHuEPO requirements of hemodialysis (HD) patients in Turkey. The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of the HD duration, primary illness, blood pressure, and age on serum albumin, CRP, blood pressure, iron/rHuEPO requirements, PTH, and HCV positivity of HD patients. 703 patients (280 women, 423 men, aged 47.8?±?15.5 years) from 4 HD units were included and grouped according to the duration on HD. The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data of the last 3 months for each patient were recorded retrospectively. When the groups were compared, patients with a longer HD duration were younger and percentage of diabetic patients decreased as the duration increased. Serum albumin and CRP levels were similar between the groups. When the groups were compared according to the blood pressure profiles, after the 5th year, a decline in the systolic blood pressures was observed. Diastolic blood pressures were similar across the years. There was no significant difference in need of antihypertensive medicines. Iron requirements showed a fall after the 5th year, and an increase in after the 10th year. There was a decline in the hematocrit levels by the duration on HD but there was no change in rHuEPO requirements over the years. Parathyroid hormone levels and HCV positivity tended to increase across the years. Our results revealed that during the first 10 years, age, etiology (diabetes, hypertension), and blood pressure control seemed to be important factors affecting survival. Whereas, after the 10th year, patients seemed to be more prone to the long-term complications of HD, such as HCV infection, anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the criteria for the insertion and correct placement of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in dogs. Study design? Prospective descriptive clinical study. Animals? Thirty healthy dogs (ASA I or II) of different breeds, age 0.33?7.0?years (2.8?±?2.1; mean?± SD), weight 2.2?59.0?kg (23.9?±?14.4), anaesthetized for elective surgery. Materials and methods? The dogs were sedated with intravenous (IV) medetomidine (10??g?kg?1) and butorphanol (0.2?mg?kg?1). If considered necessary, IV propofol (1?mg?kg?1 over 30?seconds) was administered until the LMA was inserted and positioned correctly. The position of the LMA was evaluated using predefined criteria for its insertion and inflation of the cuff, together with the ability to ventilate the dogs through the LMA. Results? The criteria for insertion, inflation and ventilation which indicated a clinically optimal position of the LMA and its seal around the larynx were met in 19 dogs (63.3%). The dogs could be manually ventilated with inspiratory peak pressures of 10?cm H2O without capnographic or audible evidence of leakage. In 11 dogs (36.7%), the LMA was positioned suboptimally with leakage during manual ventilation with inspiratory peak pressures not exceeding 10?cmH2O. There was no evidence of breed-related differences in LMA placement and position. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The technique for the insertion of the LMA using predefined criteria to evaluate a correct positioning and a seal led to a successful placement in dogs of both brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic breeds. The LMA, in most of the dogs, was easily placed, well tolerated and offered a useful less invasive means of securing the upper airway.

AB  - Two cases of dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy in 16-week-old male lurcher siblings are reported. The myopathies were characterised by regurgitation, progressive weakness and muscle wastage. The dogs had generalised weakness in all four limbs, with more pronounced weakness in the pelvic limbs. Reduced withdrawal in all limbs, muscle contracture and lingual hypertrophy were noted. Serum creatine kinase activities were markedly elevated. Electromyographic abnormalities included fibrillation potentials. Histopathological and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Clinical improvement was noted in one of the cases with l-carnitine supplementation and supportive therapy. Genetic transmission of the disease was postulated as the dogs were siblings.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the impact of acepromazine on the cardiovascular responses to three treatments for hypotension in dogs during deep isoflurane anesthesia. Study design? Prospective blinded randomized cross-over experimental design. Animals? Six adult (2.5?±?0.5?year old) healthy mixed breed dogs (24.2?±?7.6?kg). Methods? Anesthesia was induced with propofol (4?6?mg?kg?1, IV) and maintained with isoflurane. Each dog received six treatments separated by at least 5?days. Once instrumented, dogs randomly received acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) (Ace) or saline (equal volume) (Sal) IV and end-tidal isoflurane (E?Iso) was adjusted to achieve hypotension, defined as a mean blood pressure between 45 and 50?mmHg. Dogs randomly received dextran (D) (7?mL?kg?1) or lactated Ringer?s (LR) (20?mL?kg?1) over 14?minutes, or ephedrine (Eph) (0.1?mg?kg?1 followed by 10??g?kg?1?minute?1) throughout the study. Measurements were taken at baseline, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40?minutes. Data were analyzed with a Latin Square in two factors (Ace/Sal and treatment) for repeated measures, with further comparisons if appropriate (p?<?0.05). Results? E?Iso producing hypotension was significantly less following Ace (2.07?±?0.23%) than Sal (2.43?±?0.23%). No improvement in cardiac output (CO) was observed with D or LR. LR initially intensified hypotension with a significant reduction in SVR, while D caused a minor improvement in ABP. Eph produced a significant increase in ABP, CO, hemoglobin, oxygen content and delivery. Pre-treatment with Ace minimized ABP improvements with all treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1 IV) enhanced the hypotensive effect of isoflurane, although it maintained CO. Administration of LR significantly worsens ABP initially by further vasodilation. D caused minimal improvement in ABP. At the infusion studied, Eph effectively countered the cardiovascular depression produced by deep isoflurane anesthesia, but extremes in ABP associated with initial vasoconstriction prevent our recommendation at this dose.

AB  - Background:? The cytokine signals that regulate myofibroblast differentiation and the resulting reorganization of matrix are incompletely understood. We studied the response of fibroblasts to mediators known to affect matrix reorganization, TGF-? and TNF-α in a collagen matrix. Further, we sought to determine if any cell phenotype changes resulted in quantifiable alterations in the mechanical performance of the matrix. Methods:? Normal human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in collagen type I lattices for 1 and 5 days in DMEM with .5% FBS and TGF-?(1?ng/ml), TNF-α(10?ng/ml), or combinations TGF-?(1?ng/ml)?+?TNF-α(1,5, and 10?ng/ml). Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to determine α-SMA expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure α-SMA mRNA. An indentation mechanical method was used to measure Young?s modulus which represents matrix stiffness. Results:? TGF-? increases α-SMA, while TNF-α alone has no effect on basal α-SMA expression. When TGF-??+?TNF-α were both added, the expression of α-SMA returned to basal levels. Immunohistochemistry showed α-SMA is incorporated into prominent stress fibers only in the TGF-? group. Real-time PCR showed that TNF-α did not affect α-SMA mRNA, while TGF-? increased α-SMA mRNA 19-fold. Combination treatment reduced mRNA level by 16-fold, to 2.7-fold compared to control. Indentation testing showed that, in all treatment groups, lattices after 5 days in culture were stiffer. TNF-α appeared to reduce the stiffness of the lattices on both day 1 and 5 compared to control. Conclusion:? TNF-α decreases TGF-? induction of α-SMA expression at the transcriptional level and decreases lattice stiffness. The cellular responses to cytokines are reflected in both biochemical and mechanical behaviors. Understanding both will be necessary to understand how tissues remodel into functional tissue and scar.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The post operative response of the large colon wall after a surgically corrected large colon volvulus (LCV) has not been investigated. Objectives: To use transabdominal ultrasound to monitor the post operative change in large colon wall thickness following surgical correction of LCV. Hypothesis: A prolonged period to colon wall involution is correlated with an increased rate of post operative morbidity and mortality. Methods: A prospective clinical study including horses that presented to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for colic between September 2006 and March, 2008, had surgically diagnosed and corrected LCV (at least 360°) without resection and recovered from anaesthesia. Ultrasound of the ventral large colon was performed at the time of anaesthetic recovery and every 6?8?h until the colon wall returned to normal thickness (≤5?mm). Outcome was evaluated using a one-way ANOVA to compare average time to colon wall involution between: 1) survivors and nonsurvivors; and 2) horses that developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) during the post operative period and those that recovered without evidence of MODS. Results: Sixteen horses that recovered without evidence of MODS had a significantly shorter period to colon wall involution (≤5?mm) compared to those diagnosed with MODS (mean ± s.e. 19.6?h ± 2.5 and 39.7?h ± 6.7 respectively, P = 0.006). There was no significant difference in mean period to colon wall involution between survivors and nonsurvivors (26.2 ± 4.9 and 33.2 ± 7.8?h, respectively). Conclusions: A shorter time to colon wall involution was associated with decreased post operative morbidity in horses presented for surgical correction of large colon volvulus without resection. Potential relevance: Ultrasonographic monitoring of colon wall involution after surgical correction of LCV may aid in identifying those cases at risk of MODS. Further investigation of colon wall involution time using a larger number of horses is warranted.

AB  - Summary: The practice of epileptology at a molecular level, where gene products are identified by gene mapping, will soon be possible for a growing number of epilepsies. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is the first of such epilepsies to be mapped to a chromosome, namely chromosome 6p21.3. Family studies of 68 JME probands from California revealed 50% of all families reported seizures in first- or second-degree relatives. Twelve percent of all family members other than the proband had epileptic seizures. Eighty percent of symptomatic siblings and 6% of asymptomatic siblings had diffuse 4- to 6-Hz multi-spike-wave complexes. Twelve percent of asymptomatic parents had diffuse, nonspecific slow waves mixed with spikes or sharp waves. JME is tightly linked to the Bf-HLA loci in chromosome 6. No matter what mode of inheritance is assumed, linkage to the clinical manifestations of JME and its associated EEG traits is indicated by lod scores over 3.0, as long as ?EEG affected? but clinically asymptomatic family members are counted as affected during LIPED analysis. Studies are now being done to further localize the JME site. At the same time, further linkage studies should decide if JME is heterogeneous within itself and whether the same JME site in 6p21.3 underlies absence and grand mal epilepsies.
