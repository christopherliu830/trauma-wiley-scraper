AB  - Introduction Selecting the appropriate nutritional supplements for performance horses is difficult, due to significant gaps in the current scientific evidence. Our hypothesis was that nutritional supplements are chosen based on owner's perception of discipline specific health and performance problems. Methods A mixed methods (open and closed questions) online questionnaire was distributed through British Eventing and Dressage websites, to collect data on demographics of owners and their horses, supplements used, and their opinion on health and performance problems in their discipline, and in their own horses. Data was evaluated using descriptive analysis and Sign and Fisher's exact tests for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results 599 responses met the inclusion criteria, of which 441 were or had competed in dressage, and 158 in eventing (unaffiliated novice to affiliated advanced levels). Participants had been riding for 26.4 (3?60) (mean (range)) years, currently competed 1.2 (0?10) horses, and used 2 (0?12) supplements in their top horse. Participants ranked the most important health and performance issues as (1) Energy and behaviour, (2) Lameness, (3) Back and muscle problems for dressage, and (1) Lameness, (2) Energy and behaviour, (3) Stamina and fitness for eventing horses. The most common reason supplements were used in individual horses were (1) Joints and mobility, (2) Behavioural problems for dressage, and (1) Electrolytes, (2) Joints and mobility for eventing. Conclusions There was discrepancy between participants' opinions of the main health and performance problems within their discipline, and their reasons for using supplements.

AB  - Introduction The use of complementary therapies in both humans and animals has grown over the past decade. Equine back problems are more frequently reported as a contributing factor to poor performance, and back dysfunction affects limb kinematics. This study aimed to determine if (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment has an effect on the range of motion (ROM) of the carpus and tarsus. Methods Hemispherical 35?mm markers were applied to 7 anatomical landmarks of both forelimbs and hindlimbs of 10 sound, healthy horses from the same riding school with similar workload. The treatment group (n?=?5) received (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment for the neck, back, pelvis and front feet. Two digital video recorders set 5.5?m from subjects, filming both sides concurrently, collected 2-D kinematic data at walk and trot, 1 day before, and 2?hrs and 7 days after treatment. Data was analysed using Kinovea software, minimum and maximum joint angles were measured and ROM calculated. Statistical analyses included two-way ANOVA, Student's t-test and symmetry indices. Results A significant increase in right-side ROM for carpus at walk (+4.0?deg, p?=?0.04) and trot (+5.2?deg, p?=?0.02) was noted in the treated compared to the non-treated group. For the treatment group, there was a significant change in carpus ROM asymmetry from left towards neutral at walk (P?=?0.004) and trot (P?=?0.04). Tarsus ROM asymmetry change from left towards neutral was significant (P?=?0.02) at trot. No changes were observed in the control group. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment may improve the symmetry of tarsus and carpus ROM of horses. Further research is needed to assess the clinical relevance of these effects. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were reviewed by the McTimoney Chiropractic College Ethical Review Committee.

AB  - Introduction Racetrack surface type has been shown to affect horse injury rates, limb kinematics, and ground reaction forces. Understanding hoof-surface interactions may direct surface design to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal injury. Hoof accelerations have been recorded at the trot on different surfaces. This study extends these analyses to racing gallop with quantified surface properties. Methods Left fore-hoof accelerations (triaxial, ±?500?g, 1000?Hz) were collected during gallop (10?16?m/s, 5 Thoroughbred racehorses) on dirt and synthetic surfaces of known shear strengths (shear vane). Accelerometric vectors were filtered (5th order Butterworth, stance 85?Hz, swing 30?Hz). Peak accelerations and stance phase durations (limb preparation, hoof landing {heel-strike and slide}, support, and grab) were compared using a mixed model analysis of covariance with surface, lead, stride frequency, and interaction fixed effects, and horse random effect. Results Peak dorsopalmar accelerations were 40% greater during landing on the synthetic surface (P?=?0.06). Grab phase was 32% shorter on the synthetic surface (P?=?0.02), with 34% less dorsopalmar impulse/mass (P<0.01). Previously reported failure shear stress of the synthetic surface was 20% greater, compared to dirt (normal stress >400?kN/m2, equivalent to trotting racehorse). Conclusions Dorsopalmar hoof accelerations were greater on the surface with greater shear strength (synthetic). The finding that accelerations were greater on the synthetic surface compared to dirt is in contrast to that of trotting horses on all-weather waxed and crushed sand surfaces. This discrepancy may be due to differences in horse gait, but also large variability in surfaces. Consequently, it is important to quantify surface behaviors to understand the effect of surface design and maintenance on limb biomechanics and propensity for injury.

AB  - Introduction Weighted boots and unnaturally high and long hooves (SH) are used to improve the 4-beat rhythm of the tölt and enhance forelimb action. Methods The effect of these methods on loading and movement of the limbs was investigated in thirteen Icelandic horses at walk, tölt and trot on an instrumented treadmill. Vertical ground reaction forces and kinematic data of fore- and hindlimbs were measured. Four conditions were differentiated: SN (standard shoeing) and SH, without and with weighted boots of 240?g (WB240), respectively. Differences were tested using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, separately for each gait (P<0.05). Results At the tölt, in both shoeing styles, WB240 increased protraction height of the forelimbs by about 13%. The weight gain of 273?g at the distal limb induced by changing SN to SH had a similar and cumulative effect. Hoof length alone was also positively, but not significantly, associated with protraction height; the combination of SH and WB240 resulted in an increase of up to 35%. Lateral coupling (pace-like rhythm) in tölt was reduced only with a combination of SH and WB240. Stride impulse increased with a change of hoof conformation alone at tölt, and combined with weight at all three gaits. Shorter relative stance durations in the forelimbs particularly at faster speeds resulted only in a minor increase of peak forces (+1.4%) due to an impulse shift to the hindlimbs. Conclusions Weight, particularly in combination with SH, improved gait performance and marginally increased limb peak forces. However, enhanced inertial forces during swing might additionally stress internal distal limb structures.

AB  - Introduction Showjumping (SJ) horses are at increased risk of distal forelimb soft tissue injuries; generally attributed to limb loading on landing. This study investigated relationships between the back, trailing limb angles at take-off, in flight and at landing. Methods Eight showjumpers jumped a 140?cm vertical obstacle (part of a 15-fence course). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to measure limb and regional back kinematics in the dorsoventral plane from markers placed at predetermined locations. Pearson's correlation tests were used to determine associations between limb and back angles at take-off, in flight and upon landing. Results All markers were clearly visible throughout. Greater head-neck ventroflexion at take-off was associated with decreased hock flexion (r?=?-0.81, P?=?0.0141), and decreased neck-trunk angle on landing (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.03). Greater head-neck ventroflexion at landing, 50% and 75% flight was associated with decreased carpal extension on landing (r?=?0.81, 0.84, 0.73; P?=?0.02, 0.01, 0.04 respectively). Increased thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off was associated with decreased metatarsophalangeal joint extension upon landing (r?=?0.78, 0.75; P?=?0.03). Greater lumbosacral flexion at 50 and 75% flight (r?=?-0.73, ?0.77; P?=?0.04, 0.03 respectively) and greater thoracolumbar flexion at 25, 50 and 75% flight was associated with decreased elbow flexion on landing (r?=?-0.87, ?0.78, ?0.76; P?=?0.01, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). Conclusions Decreasing head-neck angle and increasing thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off and in flight appeared to alter peak joint flexion and extension on landing. This suggests that optimising jumping technique in training may be beneficial to reduce the strain placed on the limbs at landing, which could potentially be valuable given the risk of distal limb soft tissue injuries in SJ horses.

AB  - Introduction Water treadmill exercise is used for rehabilitating horses with back dysfunction, yet little is known about the effect of this type of exercise on back movement. Methods 8 horses walked in water level with the hoof, fetlock, hock and stifle. Reflective markers over the dorsal spinous processes of T6, T10, T13, T18, L3, L5 and S3 and left and right tuber coxae were used to measure flexion-extension range of movement (F-E ROM) around T10, T13, T18, L3 and L5, vertical displacement of the pelvis (Pelvic ROM) and vertical distance between T13 and L5 (lowest and highest point of the back). 3D coordinates were tracked using ProReflex cameras. 5?9 strides were analysed for each horse at each water height. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc tests were used to determine differences in measured variables between water heights (P < 0.05). Results Peak flexion of T10, T13, T18 and L3 occurred in hock height water. Peak extension of T18, L3 and L5 occurred in stifle height water without a significant difference in F-E ROM between water heights (P>0.05). Pelvic ROM was greatest in stifle height water, with no significant difference between water heights. The vertical distance between T13 and L5 was greatest in stifle height water (P<0.05 between hoof and hock height water) as a result of an elevation of L5 relative to T13. Conclusions As water height increases L5 is elevated relative to T13, increasing the tendency for extension of the thoracolumbar spine. To maximise thoracolumbar flexion and avoid extension, water at hock height is more beneficial then stifle height water.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to describe the response in heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, hematocrit and plasma lactate concentration in Icelandic horses performing the riding assessment in an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) in Iceland (April 2011). It was hypothesized that the riding assessment constituted high intensity exercise. Methods Data was collected from 15 of 28 horses shown at the BEFT. Horses were judged for riding abilities (all gaits) on a straight track. Respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein before the warm-up and within 5?min after the riding assessment. Hematocrit was analysed by centrifugation of capillary tubes and plasma lactate concentration using an enzymatic and spectrophotometric method. Velocity, distance and heart rate were recorded (Polar, Kempele, Finland) during the riding assessment. Anova (Proc GLM) was performed in SAS and data is presented as LSMean ±?SE (P<0.05). Results The distance covered was 2.7?±?0.1?km, the duration 9:13?±?0:21?min?:?sec and the average speed 17.5?±?0.3?km/h. The peak heart rate was 214?±?3?bpm. Post-exercise plasma lactate concentration was 18.6?±?1.7?mmol/L and there was an increase (P<0.001) in respiratory rate (40?±?6 to 118?±?6 breaths/min), rectal temperature (38.1?±?0.1 to 39.8?±?0.1°C) and hematocrit (35?±?2 to 47?±?2%) following the breed evaluation field test. Conclusions The physiological responses indicate that the riding assessment in BEFT is a demanding exercise, requiring some contribution of anaerobic metabolism.

AB  - Introduction The Accutrend? Lactate (formerly Accusport?) is a low cost point-of-care L-lactate analyser. The analyser is widely used in the training of horses and has been used for research studies and to assist the clinical management of critically ill horses. The analyser is reported to be linear from 0.8?22.0?mmol/L (blood) and 0.7?26.0?mmol/L (plasma); however, test performance at high L-lactate concentrations in equine blood and plasma has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer over a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in paired blood and plasma samples. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected from 8 trained Standardbreds before, during, and after a simulated race on a treadmill into 4?mL partially evacuated tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were measured using a colorimetric lactate-oxidase mediated reaction (BM-Lactate? test strips and Accutrend? Lactate) and the reference enzymatic method (L-lactic dehydrogenase spectrophotometry at 340?nm using samples deproteinized with 8% perchloric acid). Data was analysed using Deming regression and Bland-Altman plots adjusted for repeated measures (P<0.05). Results The reference method measured a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in 128 blood (0.2?23.8?mmol/L) and 127 plasma (0.3?41.1?mmol/L) samples. The Accutrend? Lactate analyzer provided an accurate method of L-lactate measurement, but only when blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were <12.5?mmol/L (79% of samples) and <15.0?mmol/L (64% of samples), respectively. Conclusions Blood L-lactate concentrations >12.5?mmol/L and plasma L-lactate concentrations >15.0?mmol/L measured by the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer underestimate the true value by a variable amount when compared with the enzymatic reference method.

AB  - Introduction During canter and gallop most horses maintain a locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC) ratio of one breath every stride. Occasional big respiratory cycles (BRC) are described when a single breath is taken over two strides. This is considered a transient but normal feature of ventilation. However, a change to a more persistent 2:1 LRC ratio is considered to be ?abnormal?. It has been suggested that upper respiratory tract (URT) disorders could result in a horse adopting an abnormal breathing pattern, although current information is limited. Methods Simultaneous audio and URT endoscopy recordings from 365 horses referred for treadmill evaluation were analysed. Breathing pattern at canter and gallop was categorised at each one minute speed step: Normal: 1:1 with <2 BRC Normal: 1:1 with 2 BRC Abnormal: breathing pattern disrupted by repetitive and frequent BRC's Abnormal: alternating between periods of 2:1 and 1:1 Abnormal: 2:1 throughout Data analysis was performed using PASW 18.0. A chi-square test was used to identify associations between breathing pattern and presence of URT obstructions. Results During the entire exercise test 30% of horses had an abnormal breathing pattern at canter or gallop, of which 23% had a 2:1 breathing pattern. The prevalence of abnormal breathing patterns was higher at low canter speeds than during strenuous exercise. There was a significant association between breathing pattern during strenuous exercise and the presence of an URT obstruction (P?=?0.008). Conclusions Loss of a 1:1 LRC ratio during canter and gallop is more common than previously realised and may be associated with dynamic URT obstructions.

AB  - Introduction Chuckwagon racing involves 4 Thoroughbred horses pulling a 600?kg wagon through a figure-8 pattern and running a 1000?m dash. Horses can race four days in a row and there are concerns regarding the contribution of cumulative racing to electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and sudden death, and its impact on recovery. The objective was to investigate the effects of cumulative racing on plasma electrolytes, lactate and prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias. Methods 148 horses (9.0?±?2.7 years) from 13 teams were monitored for heart rate and ECG activity on racing days 1 and 2. Differences in plasma electrolytes, pH and lactate (pre-vs. post-exercise and between days) were analysed (paired t-test). Associations between electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing and recovery (Pearson correlation) were examined. Results 377 ECGs (82 incomplete due to lost electrode) and 750 plasma samples (374 pre, 376 post) were analysed. 4235 arrhythmic events (21.6% warm-up, 37.6% racing, 20.4% recovery) were recorded and were not different between days 1 and 2. They mainly comprised supraventricular premature contractions during warm-up and racing (48% and 81.4% respectively) and ventricular premature contractions during recovery (29.2%). A significant association was found between post-exercise electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing (P<0.001, r?=?0.17). Consecutive racing significantly increased post-exercise lactate on day 2 (P<0.001). Pre-exercise pH and electrolytes were significantly different on day 2. Conclusions An association exists between post-exercise electrolytes and occurrence of arrhythmias during consecutive racing, however it is of little clinical significance. Ventricular arrhythmias are as prevalent in chuckwagon horses as in other disciplines. Overall, repetitive racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction There are no published studies that characterize the different myofiber types of Mangalarga (ML) horses and hybrids. This study aimed to characterize and compare muscle fibers of the gluteus medius of ML mares and young and inactive mules resulting from the breeding of these mares with a Brazilian donkey. Methods Percutaneous biopsies were performed in 11 mares and their foals (10 mules), at a depth of 60?mm. Fiber types were determined by comparing identical images using both the staining techniques of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR). Stains for mATPase were pre-incubated in acid medium followed by alkaline incubation. The frequency (F%) and relative total area (RTA%) of fiber types I, IIA and IIX were analysed. The cross-sectional area (CSA, ?m2) was quantified by the NADH-TR technique. The means were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results The frequency of type IIA fibers was greater than types I and IIX. Type IIX fibers had higher CSA than I and IIA. The RTA of type IIX fibers was greater than type IIA fibers followed by type I. The higher RTA value of IIX fibers resulted from higher CSA. There was no difference between the variables for mares compared to the mules. Conclusions ML mares and mules that resulted from breeding with the Brazilian donkey have a high prevalence of type IIA fibers in the gluteus medius. This fatigue-resistant fiber uses both metabolic pathways, glycolytic and oxidative, to obtain energy during muscle contraction, thus giving the ML mares and mules good performance in horseback riding, marching contests and endurance rides.

AB  - Objective To describe a reverse axial pattern flap based on the superficial branch of the dorsal penile artery and describe its use in preputial reconstruction. Materials and Methods Ten penises were harvested from canine cadavers; five were used to describe the dermatome supplied by the superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis and five to show perfusion of the skin flap. The superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis was identified fluoroscopically by injecting contrast material into the dorsal artery of the penis. This artery was then catheterised and injected with methylene blue to identify the perfused area. A skin flap was created by making a full thickness skin incision at the level of the fornix, along the circumference of the penis. The flap was developed by pulling the cut end toward the tip of the penis while undermining the skin. The flap was considered long enough when the cut end of the flap reached the level of the urethral opening. We also describe a case of preputial resection and reconstruction using this flap. Results Injection of methylene blue demonstrated the arterial supply to the skin flap. This flap was successful in treating the clinical case following resection of a mast cell tumour on the prepuce, although a small area of full thickness flap necrosis, which healed by second intention, developed postoperatively. Clinical Importance This technique may be useful for single step preputial reconstruction.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training can enhance antioxidant status, but it is unknown whether selenium supplementation can further improve antioxidant defenses. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At wk 14, all horses underwent a 2-hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Blood samples and biopsies of the gluteus medius were obtained before and after training and in response to the SET. Serum Se, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in whole blood and muscle, and plasma lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) were evaluated. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures. Results Serum Se was higher (P?=?0.02) at wk 14 in trained horses receiving 0.3 than 0.1?mg?Se/kg, but was unaffected by diet in untrained horses. Muscle GPx activity was unchanged after 14-weeks of Se and training, but in response to the SET, muscle GPx was higher (P?=?0.05) in trained than untrained horses. An effect of training*time (P?=?0.008) was noted for whole blood GPx, reflecting greater (P?=?0.01) activity in trained than untrained horses immediately after the SET. Plasma LPO was not influenced by dietary Se, but increased (P<0.0001) in untrained horses immediately after the SET while remaining unchanged in trained horses. Conclusions Training appears to mitigate oxidative damage in response to prolonged exercise in young horses. Although trained horses responded to a higher level of dietary Se, it showed no clear advantage for reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction Equine training often includes running on tracks with different uphill (UP) or downhill (DOWN) slopes and examination of lame horses on a slope can be used to investigate the origin of lameness. However little is known about the kinetics of horses in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare ground reaction force, acceleration and sliding of the hoof in the forelimb of horses trotting an uphill and downhill slope. Methods The right front hoof of 5 horses was equipped with a dynamometric horseshoe and an accelerometer allowing the measurement of 3D ground reaction force and hoof acceleration and displacement. The horses were trotted in hand (3.5?m/s) on a 7% inclined asphalt area successively uphill and downhill. Data were analysed using an ANOVA, accounting for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (P<0.01). Results Speed was not significantly different between UP and DOWN. The maximal longitudinal breaking force of the hoof, maximal vertical force, vertical impulse and longitudinal sliding of the hoof at impact were significantly increased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively +97.7%, +8.4%, +16.6% and +450%). Stride frequency and longitudinal propulsive force were significantly decreased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively ?5.1% and ?48.7%). Conclusions The results of this study (increased longitudinal breaking force and maximal vertical force on a downward slope) are consistent with previous measurements of superficial digital flexor tendon loading on the same area [1]. Conversely increased propulsive force on an uphill slope needs to be taken into account during rehabilitation of horses with deep digital flexor tendon injuries.

AB  - Introduction Poor hoof angle and hoof pastern alignment has been linked to lameness in mature horses. External characteristics, such as the hoof pastern axis and hoof angle, are commonly used to assess dorsopalmar conformation in the same manner in foals. The hoof wall integument and distal phalanx is parallel in healthy mature horses but not in foals: this is not understood. Methods The front feet of 22 Thoroughbred foals were radiographed and measured in June and again in November. Lateromedial radiographic images were measured (Osirix) for hoof integument angle and width, and proximal, middle and distal phalanx angles. The data were tabulated in Excel and analysed in Minitab. After assessment for normality (Anderson-Darling), potential relationships were assessed for differences between June and November using paired t-tests and regression analysis. Results The dorsal hoof angle became more acute with age, R2?=?0.3326, the mean of June, 59.05?±?3.662°, was significantly different from November, 53.64?±?2.7824°, P<0.0001. The hoof pastern axes were broken forward in June, 6.1?±?2.1°, in November 2.5?±?1.6°, whereas the phalangeal axes were broken back, June,-11.0?±?7.5°, November, ?8.3?±?4.4°. There was a significant relationship between age and hoof pastern axis alignment, R2?=?0.3746; P<0.0001. The phalangeal axis did not correlate with age. The relationship between age and parallelism of the integument was significant R2?=?0.4867; P<0.0001. Conclusions The cause of the non-alignment of the hoof pastern axis and phalangeal axis in Thoroughbred foals is widening of hoof integument proximodistally and circumferential bone thickening of the distal phalanx. Assumptions of phalangeal angles based on external characteristics cannot be made in foals.

AB  - Introduction Myofascial lines are chains of interconnected anatomical structures that functionally direct the basic motion patterns of the musculoskeletal system. They have previously been dissected in humans, where they describe the overall spinal motion of flexion, extension, lateral flexion and axial rotation. They are believed to play a role in functionality, connection, and balance of the body. The aim of this study was to investigate whether similar myofascial lines could be identified in the horse. Methods Five myofascial kinetic lines were dissected in 22 horses euthanized for unrelated reasons. The lines were the Superficial Dorsal Line (SDL), Superficial Ventral Line (SVL), Lateral Line (LL), Spiral Line (SL), and Functional Line (FL). Results SDL included hind limb flexors and the errector spinae group, which extend the hip and spine. SVL included hind limb extensors, abdominal muscles, and ventral neck muscles, which are structures with antagonistic functions to SDL. LL followed myofascial tissues along the side of the abdomen and produced latero-flexion of the spine. FL and SL formed helical lines concerned with spinal axial rotation. FL connected the front limb to the contralateral hind limb by crossing over the midline at the thoraco-lumbar level dorsal and ventral on the trunk. SL connected one side of the neck with the contralateral front limb and ipsilateral hind limb by a helical course around the body crossing over at the cervico-thoracic and lumbo-sacral junctions. Conclusions The SBL, SVL and LL complete a functional anatomical ring, which balances the dorsal, ventral and lateral motion patterns of the horse. The helical FL and SL determine the spinal axial rotation. With minor exceptions all lines mirrored the human lines.

AB  - Introduction Racing Quarter Horses (QH) typically compete at shorter distances and faster speeds than Thoroughbreds (Tbred). The two components of speed are stride rate and stride length. The hypothesis of this study is that racing QH have greater stride rates than Tbreds, and that stride rate decreases as distance increases, even within breed. Methods Five runnings of sprint and classic distance stakes races for both QH (Texas Twister Stakes, 100.6?m; Champion of Champions, 402.3?m) and Tbred (Breeders? Cup Sprint, 1,207.0?m; Breeders? Cup Classic, 2,011.7?m) contested from 2008 to 2012 were obtained and viewed by five individuals. Individuals watched each race three times (in slow motion when needed) and the average number of strides per second taken by the winning horse was calculated. Using the PROC Mixed Procedure of SAS, the averages from the five individuals were used to compare differences between breeds, and between distances within a breed. The stride rates were also used to determine average stride length by factoring in length of each race. Results The average stride rate was greater for QH than for Tbred (2.88 vs 2.34 strides/sec; P<0.0001). Additionally, stride rate decreased (P<0.0001) as distance increased (2.96, 2.81, 2.45, 2.23 strides/sec, respectively). Stride length was longest in the Tbred races and shortest in the 100.6?m QH race (P<0.0001). Conclusions The Tbred stride rates reported here, and associated respiratory rates, have been previously reported and are remarkable. However, QH rates are nearly 25% greater. The associated rapid acceleration and deacceleration of the lower limb and quick breathing rate may have implications for skeletal and respiratory soundness.

AB  - Introduction One week of reduced workload between 3 periods of 2 weeks of conditioning (CP) 5 times/fortnight at VLa10 for two bouts of 5 minutes allowed for a continuous increase of VLa4, but the extent was smaller than in another study with the same conditioning program but for the recovery week (VLa4, VLa10: horse's speed, which produced a blood lactate concentration of 4 and 10?mmol/l). Methods Six Purebred Arabians were submitted to the same conditioning protocol of the studies mentioned above except for increasing the duration of treadmill exercise in each CP by 2.5 minutes (2?x?10 minutes in the third CP). A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed at the beginning of CP to determine VLa4 and VLa10, and repeated after the week with reduced workload after each CP. Exercise speed was individually adapted to the new VLa10 for every CP. The effects of conditioning on VLa4 were examined using repeated measures analysis of variance. Significant results were analyzed further with Fisher's test. Results Mean VLa4 increased after the first CP (P<0.001), fell between first and second CP (P<0.001) and remained at this level after the third CP (P>0.05). Conclusions This conditioning program did not allow for VLa4 increases of the magnitude observed in other studies with the same exercise protocols but without the week with reduced workload and increases in exercise duration. It is possible that the decline of VLa4 of the horses after the first CP was due to overtraining (simultaneous increase of speed and duration of exercise). The effect of recovery from training needs further studies. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Bioethical Committee of the University of La Plata, Argentina.

AB  - Introduction The fixation of the bridle, particularly the noseband, is important in the horse-rider interaction. The goal of this study was to show the influence of noseband tightness on tensile forces elicited in side reins under traction to position the horse's head. Methods Ten Warmblood horses (2 mares, 8 geldings; mean age: 12.4?±?5.3 years) were assessed during walk and trot on a treadmill. Side reins were used to position the horse's head so that the nose was nearly vertical. Measurements were made with a correctly tightened noseband (two fingers space between the noseband and nasal bone?=?N1) and with a tight noseband (=?N2). Rein forces were measured with an electronic sensor based on a force sensing resistor (27?g, sample rate 120?Hz, Interlink Electronics corp.), synchronized with a kinematic system (10 cameras, 120?Hz, Motion Analysis corp.). The force sensors were calibrated with masses of 1?Kg (=9.81?N) and 4?Kg (=39.24?N). Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS. Normality of data was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test and data were analysed with repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results Side rein forces in N1 were significantly higher than in N2 during walk and trot. Maximum forces at walk were 8.6?±?0.9?N for N1 and 6.7?±?0.95?N for N2. At trot the forces (7.2?±?0.95?N for N1; 5.96?±?0.9?N N2) were significantly reduced compared to walk. There was no significant difference between left and right rein forces. Conclusions This study demonstrated that noseband tightness has an influence on rein tension. The rein forces that were exerted were lower than in ridden horses.
