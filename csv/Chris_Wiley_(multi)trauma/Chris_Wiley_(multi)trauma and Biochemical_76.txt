AB  - Abstract This review outlines some of the analytical challenges associated with the analysis of microdialysis (MD) samples, in particular, the minute complex sample volumes that are often encountered. In MD sampling many different low-molecular-weight molecules can be collected, but the research findings are often limited by the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the analytical technique that is coupled to the dialysis probe. Therefore it is critical that a lot of consideration is given in selecting the most suitable analytical method including the most appropriate detector. This review aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a range of commonly used analytical methods employed in MD. In Section 1, a brief overview of the MD technique is described, followed by a discussion on some of the advantages and drawbacks of this sampling technique. Sections 2 and 3 examine analytical and other technical considerations regarding analysis, with special emphasis on the factors that specifically influence analytical detection. Section 4 outlines the most commonly employed analytical techniques used in MD, including HPLC coupled with various detectors. Detail is given regarding the LOD and LOQ for many applications using each detector. As MS is of such high importance in MD, a special sub-section has been devoted to it. The importance of CE is also highlighted, with specific applications described. In addition, analytical techniques that do not appear to have found routine use in MD are discussed. Section 5 is concerned with recent innovations in chemical separation techniques, in particular MCE and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Specific applications of the coupling of these techniques with MD are highlighted, along with technical challenges associated with miniaturization. In the Section 6, the future outlook of MD is discussed. Techniques other than electrophoretic- and chromatographic based separation methods are outside the scope of this review.

AB  - As an Extracellular Matrix (ECM) component, Hyaluronic acid (HA) plays a multi-faceted role in cell migration, proliferation and differentiation at micro level and system level events such as tissue water homeostasis. Among its biological functions, it is known to interact with cytokines and contribute to their retention in ECM microenvironment. In addition to its biological functions, it has advantageous physical properties which result in the industrial endeavors in the synthesis and extraction of HA for variety of applications ranging from medical to cosmetic. Recently, HA and its derivatives have been the focus of active research for applications in biomedical device coatings, drug delivery systems and in the form of scaffolds or cell-laden hydrogels for tissue engineering. A specific reason for the increase in use of HA based structures is their immunomodulatory and regeneration inducing capacities. In this context, this article reviews recent literature on modulation of the implantable biomaterial microenvironment by systems based on HA and its derivatives, particularly hydrogels and microscale coatings that are able to deliver cytokines in order to reduce the adverse immune reactions and promote tissue healing.

AB  - Summary A 2-day-old filly foal presented with signs of depression, recumbency and inappetence. Blood analyses revealed hypoalbuminaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperkalaemia. The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Summary Carbohydrate (CHO) stored in the form of skeletal muscle glycogen is the main energy source for glycolytic and oxidative ATP production during vigorous exercise in mammals. In man, horse and dog both short-term high intensity and prolonged submaximal exercise deplete muscle glycogen. In horses, however, muscle glycogen synthesis is 2?3-fold slower than in man and rat, even when a diet high in soluble CHO is fed. There appear to be significant differences in CHO and glycogen metabolism between horses and other mammals, and it is becoming increasingly clear that many conclusions drawn from human exercise physiology do not apply to horses. This review aims to provide a comprehensive, comparative summary of the research on muscle glycogen synthesis in horse, man and rodent. Species differences in CHO uptake and utilisation are examined and the issues with feeding high soluble CHO diets to horses are discussed. Alternative feeding strategies, including protein and long and short chain fatty acid supplementation and the importance of rehydration, are explored.

AB  - Introduction: The study objective was to describe the underlying diseases, predisposing factors, clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with thromboembolic disease of non-cardiogenic origin in cats. Study Design: Necropsy-based retrospective study (1991?2002) Results: Forty-eight cats with thromboemboli that were not associated with significant structural heart disease were identified in a retrospective study using case records from the small animal necropsy service of the University of Pennsylvania, from 1991 to 2002. Thirty-five cats presented for non-specific signs such as lethargy and anorexia while others presented for signs such as paresis (10) or dyspnea (10) that were referable to the location of the thromboemboli. Thromboembolic disease was suspected clinically in 12 of 48 cats. In cases where a single predisposing factor could be identified, thromboemboli were associated with neoplastic (9), infectious (7) and inflammatory (3) disease. Thirteen cats had multiple predisposing factors and no obvious predisposing factor could be identified in 16 cats. The thromboemboli were found in the systemic arteries (12), systemic veins (9), both systemic arteries and veins (7), pulmonary vasculature (7) and in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation (13). Eleven cats either died at home, presented in respiratory or cardiac arrest, or arrested shortly after presentation to the emergency service. Two cats arrested later during hospitalization and the remainder were euthanized (35). No sex or breed disposition was found. There were no significant differences in serum biochemistries, coagulation profiles, lactate, Doppler blood pressure or rectal temperature when groups were compared by primary disorder. Cats with neoplasia as the underlying disorder were significantly older (median 13.5 years, p=0.04). Cats with infectious disease had statistically significant higher white blood cell counts (median 35,000/?l, p=0.03) and cats with inflammatory disease had significantly longer hospital stays (median 3 days, p=0.006). Conclusion: These results suggest that most cats with non-cardiac related thromboemboli often have multiple predisposing factors, non-specific signs and non-specific changes on laboratory parameters. More sensitive tests for hypercoagulability may aid in diagnosing thromboemboli in cats.

AB  - An 8-year-old Pêga breed donkey that presented with a history of persistent enlargement of the right leg was diagnosed with a rhabdomyosarcoma by surgical exploration and biopsy. The tumoral mass involved the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh. At presentation, the donkey was extremely painful and reluctant to walk. Initial physical examination showed a heart rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and a rectal temperature of 100.2°F. Venous blood was collected for a CBC and biochemistry. Postoperative care included antibiotic (potassium penicillin and gentamicin) and anti-inflammatory (phenylbutazone and dexamethasone). The donkey was very painful in the immediate postoperative period and developed dehiscence of the incision. It was unable to bear weight on the affected limb, very reluctant to walk, and lying down in sternal recumbency most of the time. Heart and respiratory rates ranged from 60 to 90 and 20 to 32, respectively. Because of the poor prognosis, euthanasia was indicated but the owner decided to keep the donkey alive to try semen collection. In order to improve life quality and making the semen collection possible, the anti-inflammatory therapy was stopped and an analgesic therapy with epidural opioids was selected. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was inserted in the first intercoccygeal space through an epidural Huber point needle. With the purpose of reaching the lumbosacral area, 20?cm of the catheter was advanced cranially from the needle tip. During 3 days, a combination of morphine (0.1?mg/kg) and tramadol (0.5?mg/kg) was administered daily with a total volume of 20?ml. During the first 24 hours after the first administration, heart rate ranged from 62 to 64 and respiratory rate from 20 to 24. It was not observed to have any adverse effect. The donkey improved during treatment standing most of the time and eating better. It was easier to hand walk, although it was not completely able to bear weight in the affected limb. Even during treatment, the donkey reacted intensely when the surgical area in the caudal aspect of the thigh was manipulated. On the forth day, it tried to copulate and semen was successfully collected by manipulation of the penis. As the semen was not classified as good enough to be frozen, the donkey was euthanatized. On post-mortem examination, the position of the catheter in the epidural canal was observed and 20?ml of methylene blue solution injected through the catheter before euthanasia. It was enough to totally stain the segment of epidural canal from the first intercoccygeal space to the lumbosacral joint. The opioid epidural analgesic therapy reported here was considered to be efficient to treat the painful condition of the donkey, but it was not able to completely abolish the pain.

AB  - Purpose:?? Patients with Gallstone Pancreatitis (GP) have a high risk of choledocholithiasis. MRCP has been recommended by some as the investigation of choice to diagnose choledocholithiasis. This study examines the diagnostic value of selective MRCP in GP. Methodology:?? Retrospective audit of all presentations of GP between Jan 2001?December 2007 at Middlemore Hospital. Demographic data, clinical presentation, biochemical, radiological findings and outcomes were reviewed. Data were analysed using univariate analysis and chi-squared test. Results:?? There were 339 cases of gallstone pancreatitis with 243 females and a mean age of 52?years. Overall, 95 cases of choledocholithiasis- as confirmed by ERCP/ Intra-Operative Cholangiogram (IOC) ? were diagnosed. The indications for MRCP in this study were heterogeneous. 117 patients underwent MRCP within a median of 4?days of admission with 15 (13.7%) showing choledocholithiasis. There was no significant difference in time to MRCP between positive and negative groups. ERCP/IOC confirmed 13/15 stones within a median of 2.5?days. MRCPs, however, missed 8 cases of choledocholithiasis subsequently demonstrated on ERCP/IOC where clinical suspicion remained after a negative MRCP. MRCP sensitivity was 62.0, specificity 97.9. The Positive Likelihood Ratio was 6.5, Negative Likelihood Ratio was 0.1. PPV was 86.7, NPV was 92.0. 222 patients followed different clinical pathways with 82 Common Bile Duct (CBD) stones diagnosed by ERCP/IOC. Conclusion:?? Choledocholithiasis is common in GP. Selective MRCP is highly specific in GP but may not be sensitive enough to exclude choledocholithiasis in this context.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: In order to evaluate its potential as an adjunct to inhalant anaesthesia in horses, the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl must first be determined. Objectives: To describe the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and its metabolite, N-[1-(2-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)maloanilinic acid (PMA), after i.v. administration of a single dose to horses that were awake in Treatment 1 and anaesthetised with isoflurane in Treatment 2. Methods: A balanced crossover design was used (n = 4/group). During Treatment 1, horses received a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) and during Treatment 2, they were anaesthetised with isoflurane and maintained at 1.2 ? minimum alveolar anaesthetic concentration. After a 30 min equilibration period, a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) was administered to each horse. Plasma fentanyl and PMA concentrations were measured at various time points using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Anaesthesia with isoflurane significantly decreased mean fentanyl clearance (P < 0.05). The fentanyl elimination half-life, in awake and anaesthetised horses, was 1 h and volume of distribution at steady state was 0.37 and 0.26 l/kg bwt, respectively. Anaesthesia with isoflurane also significantly decreased PMA apparent clearance and volume of distribution. The elimination half-life of PMA was 2 and 1.5 h in awake and anaesthetised horses, respectively. Conclusions and potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and PMA in horses were substantially altered in horses anaesthetised with isoflurane. These pharmacokinetic parameters provide information necessary for determination of suitable fentanyl loading and infusion doses in awake and isoflurane-anaesthetised horses.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown complement activation as a possible mechanism for trichloroethylene (TCE) sensitization, leading to multi-organ damage including the kidneys. In particular, excessive deposition of C5 and C5b-9-the membrane attack complex, which can generate significant tissue damage, was observed in the kidney tissue after TCE sensitization. The present study tested the hypothesis that anaphylatoxin C5a binding to its receptor C5aR mediates renal injury in TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were sensitized through skin challenge with TCE, with or without pretreatment by the C5aR antagonist W54011. Kidney histopathology and the renal functional test were performed to assess renal injury, and immunohistochemistry and fluorescent labeling were carried out to assess C5a and C5aR expressions. TCE sensitization up-regulated C5a and C5aR expressions in kidney tissue, generated inflammatory infiltration, renal tubule damage, glomerular hypercellularity and impaired renal function. Antagonist pretreatment blocked C5a binding to C5aR and attenuated TCE-induced tissue damage and renal dysfunction. TCE sensitization also caused the deposition of major pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? in the kidney tissue (P?<?0.05); this was accompanied by increased expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05). Pretreatment with the C5aR antagonist attenuated the increase of expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05) and also consistently reduced the TCE sensitization-induced increase of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? (P?<?0.05). These data identify C5a binding to C5aR, MAP kinase activation, and inflammatory cytokine release as a novel mechanism for complement-mediated renal injury by sensitization with TCE or other environmental chemicals.

AB  - Objective:? This observational study was undertaken to evaluate the frequency of acute complications occurring during dialysis sessions and their association with other clinical and biochemical parameters. Method:?Forty-six maintenance hemodialysis patients were selected and evaluated. Mean of the weekly evaluations of different parameters over a three-month period is presented here. Result:?Age of study subjects was 39?±?13 years and body mass index (BMI) 21?±?4?kg/m2. Duration of hemodialysis was 41?±?29 months. Most of the patients were hypertensive (98%), taking multiple anti-hypertensive drugs. Mean of the blood pressures before and at the end of dialysis sessions over the three month period were: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 159?±?18 vs. 163?±?22 (p?<?0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 92?±?13 vs. 87?±?7?mmHg (p?<?0.003). Frequency of acute complicating symptoms during dialysis sessions were: headache (75%), rise in blood pressure (73%), leg cramps (67%), vomiting (60%), palpitation (58%), sweating (52%), and hypotension (35%). Raised blood pressure showed a positive correlation with headache (r?=?0.50, p?<?0.01) and sweating (r?=?0.53, p?<?0.05). Vomiting and palpitation were more frequent at low post-dialysis blood pressure (vomiting vs. post-SBP-r?=??0.41, p?<?0.05 and palpitation vs. post-DBP-r?=??0.48, p?<?0.05), and these patients were likely to get inadequate dialysis (hypotension vs. Kt/V-r?=??0.63, p?<?0.01). Pre and post dialysis weight variation was 53?±?11 vs. 51?±?11?kg (p?<?0.001), average ultrafiltration during dialysis (UF)?2.39 (0.5?4) liter and single session Kt/V was 0.95?±?0.38. The rising tendency of post-dialysis blood pressure correlated positively with increasing UF (SBP vs. UF-r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and DBP vs. UF-r?=?0.25, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:?From this study it may be concluded that acute complications during dialysis sessions have a significant correlation with deranged blood pressure regulation, and optimum control of blood pressure could provide better dialysis.

AB  - Summary There is limited information on long-term follow-up and prognostic indicators for horses diagnosed with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF). The objectives of this study were to describe the signalment, clinicopathological data, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings, equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads, clinical outcomes, and pathologic lesions associated with EMPF. Medical records from 2008 to 2016 were reviewed for this retrospective case series of 14 horses diagnosed with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis on lung histopathology. Independent variables associated with survival to hospital discharge (short-term survival) were determined using Chi-square or Fisher?s exact test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated when applicable. Short-term survival was 57%, with only 14% of cases surviving longer than 6 months after discharge. The odds of short-term survival were higher in horses administered corticosteroids (OR = 0.029, 95% CI 0.002-0.615; P = 0.026). Severity of thoracic radiographic changes and equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads measured by quantitative PCR in the lung on presentation were not associated with survival time. Severity of thoracic radiographic changes was also not correlated to equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads in the lung ante-mortem. Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis has a poor prognosis for survival, with horses frequently displaying severe radiographic and histopathological changes at the time of diagnosis. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids reduced the odds of short-term mortality.

AB  - Introduction Body composition including percentage of fat, fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) is an important consideration for athletes. An evaluation of FFM in racehorses concluded that racing performance is positively correlated with FFM both pre- and post-training. Athletic performance is influenced by interactions among the environment and genes that influence anatomical, metabolic and physiological traits relevant to exercise. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of genetic variation in six candidate genes with functions in growth and metabolism (IL1RA, PTPN1, MC3R, IGF1, LEPR and MSTN) on FFM in Thoroughbreds. Methods FFM was calculated from rump fat thickness measured ultrasonographically in 110 two-year-old Thoroughbred horses-in-training in the same yard after two (T2) and eight (T8) months of training. Twenty-one SNPs in six genes were selected from the EquCab2.0 SNP database and were genotyped for all horses using custom Sequenom SNP genotyping assays. Quantitative tests of association were performed between SNPs and FFM at T2 and T8, and the FFM ratio between the two time points (T2?:?T8) using PLINK software. Results Two SNPs in both the IGF1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1) and PTPN1 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1) genes were significantly associated with FFM (T2) (P<0.05). The two IGF1?SNPs and two LEPR (Leptin Receptor) gene SNPs were significantly associated with FFM (T8) (P<0.05). One LEPR?SNP was significantly (P<0.005) associated with changes in FFM (T2?:?T8). Conclusions These results suggest a genetic contribution to FFM variation in Thoroughbreds. Further validation will determine whether these SNPs may be used to predict the effects of training on FFM.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the horse and rider partnership is a challenging and complex area. There is limited scientific research regarding the occurrence of misalignments in the horse and rider, and if there is any relationship between the two. This study investigated asymmetry of single horse and rider combinations focusing on pelvis asymmetry. Methods 14 single horse/rider combinations (minimum 6 month partnership) on the same daily routine were assessed. Horses and riders were assessed for misalignments of the pelvis, spine, and neck by a fully qualified human and animal (McTimoney) practitioner on the same day. Triplicate measurements of rider dorsal iliac crest (IC) distance (nearest 0.2?cm) and degree of tilt (0d.p) were recorded, sitting and standing, using a PALM palpation meter to calculate IC height discrepancy. Triplicate horse tuber coxae (TC) heights (nearest 0.5?cm) were measured using a plumb line. Difference between means indicated direction and value of asymmetry relative to symmetry of zero. Student's t-test and Pearson's Product Moment correlation examined asymmetry relationships. Results Mean rider IC height discrepancy, standing, was 0.89?±?0.64?cm and sitting, 1.00?±?0.66?cm. Mean TC height discrepancy was 1.3?±?1.6?cm. Asymmetry of the pelvis was a feature of 93% of horse/rider combinations, 85% occurring in the same direction. There was a significant positive correlation between horse TC and rider IC height discrepancies (r2?=?0.4, F?=?8.24, P?=?0.014). Conclusions This study provides positive evidence of a relationship between the direction of horse pelvic rotation and rider pelvic tilt and also between the degree of tilt and rotation. This has implications for physical therapy treatment of horse and rider. Further research of causal effect relationships of the asymmetries is recommended.

AB  - Introduction The simplest model of circular locomotion is a point mass moving uniformly on a circle. To produce circular motion, a centripetal force is generated. This study investigated contributions of individual limbs to the net centripetal force in horses trotting on a circle. Methods Six horses trotted on a 6?m diameter circle at their preferred speed. Optical motion capture (Motion Analysis Corp) recorded kinematics, while six force plates (AMTI) recorded ground reaction forces (GRF). Whole body center of mass (CoM) was computed using a 23-segment rigid body model. The GRF of each limb was expressed at the CoM in cylindrical coordinates centered at a best-fit circle of the ground path of the CoM. Average vertical, tangential and radial force components were computed for each limb over the whole stride duration. Forces were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Results The maximum ground-path deviation of the CoM from the best-fit circle among all trials was only 2.8% of the radius. The forelimbs contributed an average centripetal (radial) force of 0.49 ± 0.16?N/kg (mean ± SD, normalized to body mass), which was significantly greater (P<0.001) than the hind limb contribution of 0.36 ± 0.13?N/kg. There was no significant difference between inside and outside limbs. Conclusions The contribution of individual limbs to the centripetal force provided a direct indication of their role in circular locomotion. The forelimbs generated significantly more centripetal force, possibly in direct relation to their greater support of the body mass against gravity.

AB  - Introduction Direct measurement of peak vertical force in equine forelimbs and hindlimbs under training conditions has not been achieved to date. This measurement is possible using dynamometric horseshoes (DHSs). The objectives of this study were to investigate, on a firm surface, the effect of speed on stride parameters and on vertical loading in the forelimb (FL) compared to the hindlimb (HL). Methods Right front and hind hooves of 5 trotters were equipped with a DHS. A linear corridor was delimited on a firm sand training track. Each horse alternately repeated trials (harness trot) at 25, 35 and 40?km/h (4 to 6 times at each speed). For each trial, stride parameters and dynamic variables (peak vertical force and impulse, vertical loading rate) were analysed for 10 successive strides. Correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the association between speed and the studied variables; linear mixed-effects regression models were used to test the significance (P<0.05) of these associations. Results Stance and stride duration, and their ratio (duty factor) were linearly correlated with speed (r<-0.82), both in FL and HL. Peak vertical force was the only variable for which r was higher in HL (r?=?0.80 vs. 0.50 in FL). The relationship between vertical loading rate and speed had the highest r of all dynamic variables (r?=?0.87 and 0.83, respectively in FL and HL; r?=?-0.75 and ?0.60 for vertical impulse). Conclusions The linear relation between peak vertical force and speed demonstrated in the hindlimb differs from previous studies at lower speed. These results stress the necessity of performing biomechanical measurements under real training conditions.

AB  - Introduction Minimal research has examined the effect of draft loading on equine muscle activity. It is hypothesised that increases in draft load of 10 and 20% body mass (BM) will increase EMG intensity and duration of vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) during walk. Methods Data were collected from six Irish Cob geldings (11?±?4 years; height: 1.47?±?0.05?m; BM: 490?±?65?kg) all trained to draft-load. A modified lorry tyre was used as a loading platform. Surface EMG electrodes were positioned over VL and GL. An accelerometer placed on the left hind hoof collected kinematic data. EMG and accelerometer data at a draft load equivalent to 0 (zero load), 10 and 20% BM were recorded as the horses were led at walk in a 20?m straight line. A stopwatch determined mean speed over 20?m. Mean kinematic and EMG values were determined for 10 consecutive strides. EMG intensities were normalised to each horse. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test explored data normality. Friedman test (P<0.05) compared between conditions. A pair-wise Wilcoxon signed ranks test identified where the differences lay. Results Data for one horse was excluded because of poor accelerometer data. The remaining horses (n?=?5) maintained a constant velocity (1.10?±?0.02?m/s {SD}) between conditions (P>0.7). VL and GL increased their muscular activity in terms of EMG intensity and duration of contraction with increasing draft load from 0 to 10% and 10 to 20% BM (P?=?0.04; n?=?5). Conclusions Draft loading can be utilised for strength training following injury or to improve athletic performance.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred foals are born with fully developed hooves and stand within minutes. A ring in the horn occurs at birth and grows down the hoof wall, marking the fetal hoof (distal) and foal hoof (proximal). Birth rings in hoof horn have been noted in other species and used to estimate age. Hoof wall renewal in all ages of horse has been poorly reported; horn growth and complete hoof capsule renewal has not been measured in Thoroughbred foals. Partial hoof wall avulsions are relatively common. The objective was to measure the time taken for the fetal hoof of a newborn foal to grow out and be replaced by hoof grown since birth. Methods Thoroughbred foals (N?=?150) on four Newmarket stud farms were studied during June to September. The age of the foal and the day that routine hoof trimming removed the remnants of the fetal hoof of the front hooves was recorded. Foals that were on restricted exercise, ill or where the remnants of the fetal hoof still remained after trimming were excluded from the data. 45 foals fulfilled the criteria. The data were tabulated in Excel, analysed in Minitab and assessed for normality (Anderson-Darling). Results The mean age at which the fetal hoof grew out was 145?±?15 days (95% confidence interval, 141.77?147.16). Conclusions Thoroughbred foals replace the fetal hoof at twice the speed given for mature horses (270?365 days). Knowing the time of hoof renewal will allow accurate predictions of healing to be made in cases of partial hoof wall avulsion and other hoof lesions.

AB  - Introduction Rider preference appears to be a large factor determining the selection of an arena surface. The negative reaction of the competitors to the surface used for the Olympic test event in 2011 was sufficient to initiate a change in the surface composition used for the Olympic equestrian events in 2012. The aim of this study was to quantify surface characteristics that riders perceive to be the most favoured in a training and competition venue. Methods A survey was used to ask riders (n?=?342) to describe characteristics that they liked about their favourite venue across Northern England. The two most popular surfaces (both well-established wax, sand and fibre) were harrowed before being measured at several plots. An Orono Biomechanical Surface Tester and traction device were used to compare the functional properties of the two surfaces. The respondent's reasons for choosing their favourite venue were associated with specific surface measures including peak load, rebound timing and traction. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to establish differences between venues. Results The favourite venue was selected because the surface was not too deep or slippery and provided good support, spring and cushioning. The peak load (P?=?0.002) and traction (P>0.001) were significantly higher on the favourite surface compared to the second favourite (18.99?kN vs.17.29?kN and 20?Nm vs.19?Nm respectively). Conclusions Higher peak load values may be responsible for supporting a good performance and higher traction values could explain why riders felt that the surface was not ?slippery?, although this may have negative effects on the horse. The results suggest there is potential to quantify rider preferences.
