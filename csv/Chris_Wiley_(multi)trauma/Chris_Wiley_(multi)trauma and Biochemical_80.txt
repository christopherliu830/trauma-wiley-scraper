AB  - Abstract Background: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and has been shown to improve coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) during arrest. The effects of ET-1 on organ blood flow during arrest have not been extensively studied. Objective: To investigate the effects of ET-1 on myocardial and cerebral blood flow during cardiac arrest. Methods: Sixty immature swine were anesthetized and instrumented. The animals were randomized to receive one of three doses of ET-1 (50, 150, or 300 ?g) or placebo with/without standard-dose epinephrine (SDE) during cardiac arrest. After a 10-minute period of no-flow ventricular fibrillation (VF), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed for 3 minutes, followed by drug administration. Placebo or SDE was given every 3 minutes. Myocardial and cerebral blood flow was measured using a fluorescent microsphere technique. Results: Prearrest and CPR variables were not different between groups. Beginning 4 minutes after giving 300 ?g ET-1 with or without SDE, CPP was significantly increased compared with SDE alone. Total myocardial blood flow following ET-1 administration was no different than myocardial blood flow following SDE alone. Cerebral blood flow increased 3.5 minutes after administration of 300 ?g ET-1 with SDE and reached significance 9.5 minutes after drug administration when compared with SDE alone [92.5 (48.8-117.9) vs 15.6 (7.7-23) mL/min/100 g]. Conclusions: Three hundred ?g ET-1 with SDE increases CPP and improves cerebral blood flow but does not improve myocardial blood flow during cardiac arrest. The peripheral effects of ET-1 significantly improve CPP and cerebral blood flow, but myocardial blood flow is not increased due to coronary vasoconstriction.

AB  - Abstract Chaperone networks are dysregulated with aging, but whether compromised Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone function disturbs neuronal resilience is unknown. Stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STI1; STIP1; HOP) is a co-chaperone that simultaneously interacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90, but whose function in vivo remains poorly understood. We combined in-depth analysis of chaperone genes in human datasets, analysis of a neuronal cell line lacking STI1 and of a mouse line with a hypomorphic Stip1 allele to investigate the requirement for STI1 in aging. Our experiments revealed that dysfunctional STI1 activity compromised Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone network and neuronal resilience. The levels of a set of Hsp90 co-chaperones and client proteins were selectively affected by reduced levels of STI1, suggesting that their stability depends on functional Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery. Analysis of human databases revealed a subset of co-chaperones, including STI1, whose loss of function is incompatible with life in mammals, albeit they are not essential in yeast. Importantly, mice expressing a hypomorphic STI1 allele presented spontaneous age-dependent hippocampal neurodegeneration and reduced hippocampal volume, with consequent spatial memory deficit. We suggest that impaired STI1 function compromises Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone activity in mammals and can by itself cause age-dependent hippocampal neurodegeneration in mice.

APPENDIX 1:?USEFUL ADDRESSES AND WEBSITES ? APPENDIX 2:?SPECIALISED FEEDING Summary There is a nutritional component to most illnesses (whether poor nutrition leads to disease or disease adversely affects nutritional status) and their treatment, often involving all the health care professions. Undernutrition can adversely affect every system of the body such as the muscular system (resulting in fatigue, lethargy and decreased peripheral and respiratory muscle strength), the immune system (predisposing to and delaying recovery from infection) and psycho-social function (causing anxiety, depression and self-neglect). As a consequence, undernutrition consumes a disproportionate amount of health care resources. It is estimated that 70% of undernutrition in the UK goes unrecognised and untreated and that, in the community, 5% of the population have a body mass index (BMI) less than 20?kg/m2. In hospitals this figure rises to 20?25%. It is important to recognise that not all people with low BMI are undernourished; some may be perfectly healthy. There are difficulties in defining undernutrition because the anthropometric measurements used are neither age nor disease specific. Ranges and cut-off points to define normal or ideal have been based on healthy young individuals and are applied to the whole population. However, the three key elements that help define undernutrition or risk of undernutrition are: assessment of chronic protein-energy status, history of weight loss, and underlying risk factors including disease and disabilities. Patients may be malnourished on admission to hospital as a result of a variety of disease-related, social or psychological factors. Mental illnesses such as depression and dementia cause anorexia. Malignancy and acute or chronic physical disease reduce appetite and alter the taste, smell and preferences for different types of food. Infections and malignant disease may also increase nutritional requirements. Neurological and mechanical impairment of swallowing and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract affect nutritional intake. Factors such as social isolation and poverty can play an important role, and disability and immobility can interfere with food purchase and preparation. Taste appreciation also alters with ageing. It is reported that 40% of all patients admitted to hospitals are undernourished, half of them severely so. Nutritional status tends to worsen during hospital stay and is associated with a worse outcome of the disease and prolonged hospital stay. Studies have shown that 40% of hospital food is wasted, which results in patients receiving only 70% of their energy and protein requirements. Because many patients are discharged from hospital in a worse nutritional state than they entered, a further group of undernourished individuals are discharged into the community, setting up a vicious circle. This can largely be prevented or treated with appropriate screening and management. Weight loss often continues in many patients during their hospital stay for many reasons. These include surgical treatments and investigations that impair appetite or the ability to eat (while increasing nutritional requirements) or treatments and procedures that require a period of nil-by-mouth beforehand, which reduces intake. Frustratingly, sometimes a patient may be nil-by-mouth all morning only to have the treatment delayed or postponed to a later date. Often when the patient returns to the ward, no meal has been saved for them (due to lack of communication or lack of suitable facilities to store it if it was hot) and there may be no other food available to them. A major contributor to the worsening nutritional status during hospitalisation, however, is the inadequacy of current catering and feeding practices. Hospital catering is beset with all sorts of seemingly trivial problems that add up to one huge problem. For example, the wrong food may arrive for a patient because they were not able to choose it themselves or they have been given a meal chosen by somebody else occupying the bed before them. The meal that does come is difficult to eat, e.g. the provision of individual butter packs that are difficult for frail arthritic fingers to open. Although special techniques of enteral and parenteral nutrition support are indicated for a minority of patients with failure of swallowing or gastrointestinal function, the majority of patients are dependent on hospital food to sustain them during illness. In many hospitals the three meals provided may be of a reasonable standard, as the catering officers struggle on the tight budget they have, but the range and quality of the snacks (essential to meet increased requirements in many patients) let them down. In many cases, proprietary oral supplements or sip feeds may be of value, but they should not become a convenient substitute for adequate and appropriate food provision. Hospital menus and meals should provide sufficient choice to offer healthy, balanced, appetising nutrition for all patients. Menus should be designed to meet the needs of particular patient groups, e.g. elderly people, children and ethnic minorities. Adequate choice should be available to meet these needs. Special attention should be given to the requirements of sick and nutritionally vulnerable patients, and appropriate special therapeutic diets for those who need them should be provided. A range of meals specially fortified in energy and protein should also be available in every hospital, and snacks and nourishing drinks should be kept in the ward and routinely offered between meals. The timing of meals should be reviewed and made more relevant to patients? customary meal patterns. All methods of food preparation, e.g. in-house cook-serve or brought-in cook-chill (with ward regeneration) have proved successful, but each is highly dependent on the method of distribution and serving. With proper management, a bulk trolley bedside service serves patients? needs best. Nutritionally vulnerable patients should be placed in wards with kitchen areas, or near ward kitchens, so that special meals or snacks can be prepared for them or, when possible, patients can access the kitchen themselves. The primary responsibility of the nutritional care of in-patients rests with the nurses in charge of the ward; therefore, food should be served by nurses, supported where necessary by other grades of staff trained for this purpose, e.g. ward hostesses, diet technicians/helpers. Assistance with eating must be provided where necessary. Plate or tray collection should be supervised by nursing staff, to enable patients? food intake to be monitored. Many studies have shown the benefits of nutritional intervention. Therefore, the presence of disease, whether in hospital or the community, should be seen as an indication of the need for nutritional screening to identify those at particular risk and those who might benefit from some form of nutritional intervention. In which case, implementing measures such as improved staff training, nutritional screening and assessment, and monitoring, combined with better catering practices will result in most patients? nutritional requirements being met. Fortified meals, between-meal snacks and adequate ward staffing have all been shown to contribute to achieving this goal, which leads to better clinical outcome, less waste, a shorter hospital stay and a more cost-effective service. Recently, a number of schemes and initiatives have been set up to help prevent or combat malnutrition both in hospitals and the community. These include the launch of Better Hospital Food: a new menu for the National Health Service, and the establishment of the Malnutrition Advisory Group, a group of experts convened to raise awareness and understanding of issues of undernutrition. Community initiatives include the establishment of the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit for deprived neighbourhoods, Sure Start ? set up to operate local programmes for children and parents living in areas of high poverty, and Healthy Living Centres ? set up to run schemes such as luncheon clubs for older people.

AB  - Objectives: The purposes of this study were to determine the prevalence of intravenous catheter colonisation in a routine clinical setting, to identify pathogens involved and to explore factors associated with an increased risk of colonisation. Methods: A prospective study of 100 peripherally placed intravenous catheters from 13 cats and 78 dogs was conducted. The distal two-thirds were removed and submitted for bacterial and fungal cultures. Antimicrobial susceptibility of each isolate was determined. Results: Nineteen peripheral catheters were positive for microbiologic culture from 14 animals. Twenty organisms were isolated among which Staphylococcus species was the most common. Isolates displayed lower levels of resistance against the antimicrobial agents amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins and gentamicin than against other agents tested. Major risk factors predisposing to catheter-related colonisation included dextrose infusion, duration of catheter placement, local complications and immunosuppressive diseases or drugs. Clinical Significance: In a routine clinical setting, the prevalence of microbial colonisation of peripheral intravenous catheters is comparable to that found in an intensive care unit. However, consequences on morbidity and mortality rates differ.

AB  - Abstract Nicotine use remains highly prevalent with tobacco and e-cigarette products consumed worldwide. However, increasing evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance suggests that nicotine use may alter behavior and neurobiology in subsequent generations. We tested the effects of chronic paternal nicotine exposure in C57BL6/J mice on fear conditioning in F1 and F2 offspring, as well as conditioned fear extinction and spontaneous recovery, nicotine self-administration, hippocampal cholinergic functioning, RNA expression, and DNA methylation in F1 offspring. Paternal nicotine exposure was associated with enhanced contextual and cued fear conditioning and spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear memories. Further, nicotine reinforcement was reduced in nicotine-sired mice, as assessed in a self-administration paradigm. These behavioral phenotypes were coupled with altered response to nicotine, upregulated hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding, reduced evoked hippocampal cholinergic currents, and altered methylation and expression of hippocampal genes related to neural development and plasticity. Gene expression analysis suggests multigenerational effects on broader gene networks potentially involved in neuroplasticity and mental disorders. The changes in fear conditioning similarly suggest phenotypes analogous to anxiety disorders similar to post-traumatic stress.

AB  - Daily hemodialysis greatly improves clinical and biochemical parameters and patient quality of life compared to conventional thrice weekly dialysis. However, mortality statistics are lacking as most centers providing daily dialysis have treated only a small number of relatively selected patients for relatively short observation times. To study patient survival we pooled experience from three sources: 51 French and 128 U.S. patients selected for daily home hemodialysis and 42 U.S. patients selected for short daily center hemodialysis because of many medical complications and cardiovascular instability. Results were compared to age-matched patients from the USRDS 2003 data base. The age of the patients was 51?±?16 (18?89) years; 29% were female; they had 3.3?±?1.8 comorbidities (twice that of USRDS patients); 32% had diabetes or hypertension as cause of renal disease (USRDS patients 70%); blood access was 61% fistulae, 25% grafts, and 14% CV-catheters. Mean duration of ESRD treatment at start of short daily hemodialysis was 6?±?7 years. The observation period was 315 patient years. Patients had been on daily hemodialysis for a mean of 17?±?18 (0?92) months and 11 patients were observed for more than 5 years. 35 of the 221 patients died (16%); deaths were 111 per 1,000 patient years (53% of expected) and 5-year cumulative survival was 63% compared to 32% for USRDS patients. Five-year survival was 0% in patients with >3 comorbidities, 75% in patients with <3 comorbidities (p?<?0.0001), and in patients aged <53 years was 80% vs. 50% in patients aged >53 years (p?=?0.0007). On Cox stepwise hazards analysis, comorbidity alone predicted survival when used with age. Comorbidity >3 HR?=?6.00 (95% CI 2.2?16.3). Conclusions: It is difficult to do survival comparisons between patient groups. However, these daily dialysis patients were age-matched with patients from the USRDS database. There were fewer diabetic and hypertensive patients but the comorbidity index was twice that of USRDS patients. Survival, both deaths per 1,000 patient years and cumulative count was approximately twice that reported by the USRDS and strongly suggests superior survival with short daily hemodialysis compared to thrice weekly conventional dialysis.

AB  - Abstract Neonatal (P7) brain hypoxia?ischemia (HI) induces intracellular Bax protein shifts to the nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it triggers the activation of the respective cell death signaling cascades. When compared with HI-treated rat pups, 100% O2 resuscitation of HI-treated rat pups increases HI-induced ER Bax levels, ER-mediated cell death signaling, and resultant lesion volume and inflammation due to increased necrotic-like cell death. To better characterize the role of Bax intracellular shuttling ER cell death signaling and necrotic-like cell death, we used rotenone-treated P5 neuronal cortical cultures to increase ER Bax levels and subsequent cell death signaling. We treated P5 primary cortical neurons with 25 ?M and 100 ?M rotenone as an apoptotic or necrotic-like stimulus, respectively, and measured intracellular organelle Bax levels and the subsequent activation of ER/mitochondrial cell death signaling. The 25 ?M rotenone treatment promptly increased nuclear Bax levels followed by a later increase in mitochondrial Bax levels and caspase-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin. The 100 ?M rotenone treatment also resulted in an early increase in nuclear Bax levels followed by a subsequent increase in ER Bax levels and calpain-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin. After pretreatment with the immunosuppressive and neuroprotective FK506, there was a delay in Bax intracellular shifts and cell death signaling for both the 25 and 100 ?M rotenone treatments. These results suggest that the different outcomes of apoptotic-like vs. necrotic-like cell death resulting from the treatment of neuronal cultures with rotenone at 25 and 100?M rotenone reflect changes in the intracellular trafficking of Bax among different organelles. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - An eight-year-old, neutered male Burmese cat presented with five days vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Current labelling for the use of ceftiofur crystalline free acid (CCFA) in horses states that 2 i.m. doses must be administered 4 days apart to provide 10 days of therapeutic coverage. A 10 day treatment regimen is not sufficient for the long-term treatment of horses with severe lung consolidation or pleuropneumonia. There are currently no data to guide an appropriate dosing interval when a longer treatment regimen is warranted. Objectives To determine steady-state plasma and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA) after weekly i.m. administration of CCFA to adult horses. Study design Experimental study. Methods Seven adult horses received i.m. CCFA at a dose of 6.6?mg/kg bwt on Day?0, Day?4 and every 7 days thereafter for 3 additional doses. Concentrations of DCA in plasma and PELF were measured at various time intervals. Results After weekly i.m. administration, the mean (±?s.d.) steady-state peak DCA concentration in plasma (2.87 ± 1.50??g/ml) was significantly higher than that in PELF (0.84 ± 0.53??g/ml). Mean terminal half-lives in plasma (77.5 ± 17.5?h) and PELF (92.8 ± 59.0?h) were not significantly different. Concentrations of DCA in plasma and PELF remained in the therapeutic range for the entire dosing interval. Conclusions After the initial 2-dose regimen 4 days apart, weekly i.m. administration of CCFA was well tolerated and resulted in plasma and PELF DCA concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration that inhibits growth of at least 90% of common lower respiratory tract pathogens of horses. Potential relevance Weekly administration of CCFA would appear appropriate when a treatment regimen longer than 10 days is warranted based on clinical signs and disease severity.

AB  - Summary A technique comprising constant infusion and aspiration via nasogastric tube was used to quantify basal gastric secretion in 9 healthy foals aged 4?7 months and weighing 156 to 215 kg. Gastric fluid was collected continuously for 3 h from an in situ double lumen nasogastric tube attached to a constant suction device (5?10 mmHg). Phenol red (50 mg/litre), an inert marker, was infused continuously (250 ml/h) during the same period to determine loss of gastric fluid through the pylorus. Samples were collected every 15 mins and aspirated volume (VASP), pH, phenol red recovery (PRR) and hydrogen ion concentration (AO) were measured. Gastric secretory volume (VS) and acid concentration (ACD) were calculated. The mean (sd) VASP was 6.54 (1.31) ml/kg bodyweight (bwt)/h; pH was 1.76 (0.25), PRR was 77.7% (11.7), and AO was 0.43 (0.18) mmol/kg bwt/h. Mean (sd) ACD and VS were 59.17 (18.88) mmol/litre and 7.07 (1.73) ml/kg bwt/h, respectively. The AO, ACD, and VS were corrected for PRR. This technique is an alternative to invasive procedures and may be useful for evaluating basal and stimulated gastric secretion in foals and horses.

AB  - Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine pancreas in both dogs and cats. Ante-mortem diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis can be challenging. The clinical picture of dogs and cats with pancreatitis varies greatly (from very mild to severe or even fatal) and is characterised by non-specific findings. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis should always be performed in dogs and cats suspected of having pancreatitis, although findings are not-specific for pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase activities and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations have no or only limited clinical value for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in either dogs or cats. Conversely, serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration is currently considered to be the clinicopathological test of choice for the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis. Abdominal radiography is a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of other diseases that may cause similar clinical signs to those of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but this depends largely on the clinician's experience. Histopathological examination of the pancreas is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatitis, but it is not without limitations. In clinical practice, a combination of careful evaluation of the animal's history, serum PLI concentration and abdominal ultrasonography, together with pancreatic cytology or histopathology when indicated or possible, is considered to be the most practical and reliable means for an accurate diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatitis compared with other diagnostic modalities.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of 106 horses presenting with chronic colic examined over a 5 year period were reviewed. Chronic colic was defined as colic signs observed, daily for 3 days or longer, except when masked by analgesics. The diagnosed causes of chronic colic included colonic impaction (31%), peritonitis (16%), enteritis/colitis (7%), colonic displacement/torsion (6%) and lymphosarcoma (4%). A variety of other diseases were diagnosed in a small number of cases, including intestinal adhesions, ileal obstructions, grass sickness, liver disease, caecal impactions, thromboembolic disease, intussusceptions etc. No diagnosis was reached in 8% of cases. Diagnosis was relatively easily achieved in most cases of colonic impaction and peritonitis by results of transrectal palpation and evaluation of peritoneal fluid. Specific clinical features, transrectal palpation, abdominal paracentesis and laboratory evaluations of blood were helpful in the diagnosis of some of the other diseases, but exploratory laparotomy remained necessary in a few cases to achieve a diagnosis.

AB  - A case of idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in a six-month-old male Maremma shepherd dog is reported. The dog was referred with a four month history of progressive weakness and depression with loss of trained habits. Tendency to recumbency, disorientation, visual impairment, bilaterally decreased menace response and hindlimb conscious proprioception deficits were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse hypointense signal involving the cerebral grey matter with enlargement of the cerebral sulci on T1-weighted and fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences consistent with a diffuse necrosis or atrophy of the cortical grey matter. Histological examination revealed severe inflammatory infiltration mainly composed of eosinophils and macrophages in the subarachnoid space and in the superficial layer of the cerebral cortex where parenchymal rarefaction and necrosis of neurones were also evident. No parasites, cysts or fungi were detected, and an immunologically mediated disorder was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging may represent a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis from other inflammatory brain diseases of young dogs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the nature of multinucleated and mononuclear cells from peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 40 cases of PGCG were immunohistochemically stained for vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin, CD68, S-100 protein, lysozyme. leucocyte common antigen (LCA), factor VIII-retated antigen and muscle cell actin. Six cases of PGCG were also studied by transmission etectron microscopy. RESULTS: Vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin and CD68 were expressed in both the mononuclear and multinucleated giant cells. Dendritic mononuclear cells, positive for 5?100 protein, were noted in 67.5% of the lesions, whereas lysozyme and leucocyte common antigen were detected in occasional mononuclear cells. Ultrastructural examination showed mononuclear cells with signs of phagocytosis and sometimes interdigitations with similar cells. Others presented non-specific characteristics and the third type exhibited cytoplasmic processes and occasional Birbeck granules. Some multi-nucleated giant cells showed oval nuclei, abundant mitochondria and granular endoplasmic reticulum whereas others presented with irregular nuclei and a great number of cytoplasmic vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: lmmunohistochemical and ultrastructural results suggest that PGCGs of the jaws are composed mainly of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system and that Langerhans cells are present in two thirds of the lesions.

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to inhibit the expression of specific genes in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing an extremely useful tool for investigating gene function. Progress in the understanding of RNAi-based mechanisms has opened up new perspectives in therapeutics for the treatment of several diseases including ocular disorders. The eye is currently considered a good target for RNAi therapy mainly because it is a confined compartment and, therefore, enables local delivery of small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by topical instillation or direct injection. However, delivery strategies that protect the siRNAs from degradation and are suitable for long-term treatment would be help to improve the efficacy of RNAi-based therapies for ocular pathologies. siRNAs targeting critical molecules involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa and neovascular eye diseases (age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and corneal neovascularization) have been tested in experimental animal models, and clinical trials have been conducted with some of them. This review provides an update on the progress of RNAi in ocular therapeutics, discussing the advantages and drawbacks of RNAi-based therapeutics compared to previous treatments.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Normal radiographic anatomy of the juvenile donkey foot has not been reported previously. Objectives To provide a radiographic survey of the anatomical development of the donkey foot from 0 to 2 years of age. Study design Radiographic survey. Methods The right front foot of 9 donkey foals born in the spring of 2012, housed and fed in the same conditions, were radiographed every month for the first 6 months of age and every 3 months for the following 18 months. Latero-medial radiographs with and without barium markers at the coronary band and anterior-posterior radiographs of both front feet were obtained during weightbearing. Radiographs were obtained at 55?kV and 3?mAs with mobile x-ray equipment (Gierth RHF 200?ML, Examion DR810). Results The distal physis of the metacarpus (McIII) was closed at the mean age of 17.8 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The proximal physis of the proximal phalanx was closed at the mean age of 15.5 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The distal physis appeared as a clear radiolucent line at 2 weeks of age and was still visible subtly at 24 months. The proximal physis of the middle phalanx was closed at the mean age of 10.7 months (SD: 11.5, 19). The distal physis was visible at birth but closed at 4 days. Conclusions Based on our results, it seems that physes close at an older age in the donkey foal than in the horse. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium. (VUB/14-272-2). Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Source of funding:?The authors acknowledge Vtrade Belgium for the logistic assistance. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Hypoglycin A (HG) appears to cause atypical myopathy (AM), but to our knowledge, detection of HG in affected and unaffected horses and concurrently in plants that they were exposed to has not previously been reported. Objectives To investigate HG in samples from horses exposed to Acer pseudoplatanus (European sycamore maple) and in such plant material, at the time of clinical cases of AM in the herd. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Blood was collected from 2 horses with AM and 22 clinically healthy co-grazing horses in 2 Swedish farms within one week of onset of signs (May 2014) and one month later, after horses were moved to other pastures. Ten healthy control horses from unaffected farms were sampled once. Samaras, seedlings, flowers and leaves from Acer pseudoplatanus and from Acer platanoides L (Norway maple) were collected from affected pastures. Hypoglycin A was analysed using chemical derivatisation with dansyl chloride (DNS) and ultra high performance liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Hypoglycin A was detected as derivatised compound HG-DNS [M+H]+ with selected reaction monitoring. Results Hypoglycin A was detected in the horses affected with AM, and also in 20 out of 22 co-grazing horses. One month later, a surviving case horse and 9/20 co-grazing horses were still positive for HG. Controls from other farms were negative for HG. Hypoglycin A was detected in plant material from Acer pseudoplatanus, but not from Acer platanoides L. Conclusions Horses grazing in pastures with HG-containing Acer pseudoplatanus were positive for HG in blood, and some showed severe signs of myopathy. Ethical animal research:?Ethical consent for blood sampling was granted (C113/11) and horse owners gave their informed consent to inclusion of horses in the study. Source of funding:?National Veterinary Institute, Sweden. Competing interests:?None declared.
