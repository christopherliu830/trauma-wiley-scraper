AB  - Reasons for performing study Thyroid hormones (THs) decrease with age in healthy dogs and cats, although they tend to remain within established reference ranges. Thyrotropin (TSH) is increased in elderly people, with or without mild alterations in THs. Objectives To test the hypothesis that geriatric horses will have lower THs and/or higher TSH compared with younger horses. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Resting THs and TSH, and responses to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were compared between young and old horses. Data from 71 normal, healthy horses that had participated in prior research projects were examined, and found to contain 42 horses 3?10 years of age, 16 horses >15 years and 10 horses >20 years. All samples had been assayed in the same previously validated radioimmunoassays. Statistical analysis was performed with commercial software. Results Although lower, THs were not significantly different between young and old horses when compared with the Mann?Whitney rank sum test. However, TSH concentration was significantly higher in horses aged >20 (median 0.52?ng/ml) or >15 years (0.44?ng/ml) compared to younger horses (0.33?ng/ml). TRH stimulation tests were performed in 19 of the younger horses, 7 of the horses >20, and 11 of the horses >15. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA on ranks revealed no significant differences in TH responses to TRH. The TSH response to TRH appeared to be slightly greater in the older horses, but did not quite reach significance (P?=?0.06). Conclusion Similar to reports in elderly humans, aged horses have higher serum TSH concentrations than younger horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Respiratory disease is a common cause of morbidity in geriatric horses, with a high prevalence of respiratory clinical signs; increasing with increasing horse age. However, owners frequently do not attribute these signs to disease and may not seek veterinary attention. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in the British geriatric equine population using a risk-screening questionnaire (RSQ) and identify factors associated with RAO. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Owners of geriatric horses/ponies enrolled in a previous cohort study were sent a postal questionnaire, combining a validated RSQ with questions regarding management, preventive healthcare, and respiratory-specific clinical signs. An RSQ score of >0.87 was the positive cut-off for RAO. Factors associated with RAO were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The useable response rate was 43.1%, providing data for 285 horses/ponies (median age 23.3 years). Coughing within the preceding year (27.0%) was the most prevalent owner-reported clinical sign. Among the study population, the apparent prevalence of RAO using the RSQ was 20.7%. 10.5% of horses/ponies were reported to have veterinary-diagnosed RAO (median age at diagnosis 13 years), of which 33.3% had a positive RSQ score. Data from 273 animals were included in the multivariable model, and factors associated with increased risk of RAO were ridden exercise â‰¥4 days/week (odds ratio [OR] 3.64; P?=?0.005) compared to no exercise; residing on a farm (OR 4.99; P?=?0.04) compared to residing on the owner's home premises and having had a respiratory infection within the past 12 months (OR 4.87; P<0.001). Conclusions Risk-screening questionnaire score-determined RAO prevalence was considerably higher than the proportion of animals previously diagnosed with RAO. This suggests under-diagnosis of respiratory problems in geriatric horses, much of which may be unrecognised or undiagnosed RAO. Risk factors identified differ from those previously reported for the general equine population. Ethical animal research:?This study was granted institutional ethical approval from the University of Liverpool and the Animal Health Trust. Return of a completed postal questionnaire was taken as informed owner consent.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Bronchopneumonia caused by Rhodococcus equi is an important disease of young horses throughout the world. Although early diagnosis and treatment improves the prognosis, this also increases the amount of antimicrobial usage and therefore increases the likelihood of resistance developing. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the level of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents of 97 virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates. Study design Analysis of archived samples. Methods Virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates were collected between 1991 and 2014 from clinically affected horses and from air samples collected in the breathing zone of foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed using a disc diffusion assay with a panel of agents. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and neomycin using a novel resazurin-based microtitre assay. Results Resistance to rifampicin was detected in 3 of the isolates (2 collected in 2013 and one in 2014) by both methods. The MIC for these isolates was 64??g/ml (n?=?2) and 16??g/ml (n?=?1). All isolates collected prior to 2013 had MICs<0.125??g/ml, which was the limit of detection in this assay. Although no isolates were resistant to tetracycline, there was a general increase in MIC in isolates collected in recent years. No isolates were resistant to either neomycin or erythromycin, with MIC values ranging between 0.25 and 2??g/ml for neomycin and 0.125?1??g/ml for erythromycin. Conclusions The success of the macrolide-rifampicin combination relies on the synergistic action of these 2 agents. Resistance to rifampicin will reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. It is of serious concern that the resistant isolates were all recently collected. Hopefully, recent research will lead to fewer asymptomatic foals receiving antimicrobials which will in turn reduce the likelihood of ongoing development of resistance.

AB  - Summary This investigation examines the histological and ultrastructural lesions of the colonic mucosa during terminal experimental infarction and subsequent reperfusion. Four ponies were anaesthetised and subjected to surgical torsion of the colon. Biopsies were collected at hourly intervals for 3 h, at which point the torsions were corrected. Circulation was re-established for 2 h and the bowel was re-biopsied at hourly intervals. The ponies were killed while under anaesthesia. During the 3 h experimental infarction, the bowel became macroscopically thickened and dark purple. Histologically, the mucosa degenerated from Grade 0 to Grade 3. Ultrastructurally, there was progressive micro-vascular distension with erythrodiapedesis and damage to the interstitial cells. Spaces developed between the bases and sides of the columnar epithelial cells and sloughing followed subsequently. During the 2 h reperfusion interval, the mucosa continued to degenerate rapidly to a Grade 5, and was characterised by extensive interstitial damage, oedema, cellular swelling, necrosis and mitochondrial damage. The results showed that the experimentally infarcted colonic mucosa degenerated sequentially. Following circulatory reestablishment, continued rapid mucosal degeneration characteristic of reperfusion injury occurred. Reperfusion injury is probably responsible, at least in part, for the often poor outcome of infarcted bowel in horses following surgical correction.

AB  - ABSTRACT Damage to DNA and disruption of membrane integrity by lipid peroxidation processes are two of the proposed causes of UV-B-induced growth inhibition in plants. However, the relative significance of these different types of molecular damage has not been established in experiments carried out under realistic physiological conditions. Plants of Gunnera magellanica (a native herb from southern Patagonia) were exposed to a gradient of biologically effective UV-B doses (from 0 to 6.5?kJ?m?2?d?1 of UV-Bbe) in a greenhouse study. Leaf expansion was measured and sensitive techniques were used to detect damage to DNA (in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; CPDs) and lipid peroxidation (via electronic-paramagnetic resonance; EPR). Leaf expansion decreased and the CPD density increased with increasing UV-B doses, but the degree of lipid peroxidation remained unaffected. The highest UV-B dose induced a transient oxidative stress situation (as evaluated using the ratio of ascorbyl radical to ascorbate, AÂ·/AH?), which was rapidly controlled by an increase in the ascorbate pool. The present results suggest that under a range of UV-Bbe doses that overlaps the range of doses that G. magellanica plants experience in their natural environment, growth inhibition is better explained by DNA damage than by increased lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Abstract The lack of endogenous repair following spinal cord injury (SCI) accounts for the frequent permanent deficits for which effective treatments are absent. Previously, we demonstrated that low sulfated modified heparin mimetics (LS-mHeps) attenuate astrocytosis, suggesting they may represent a novel therapeutic approach. mHeps are glycomolecules with structural similarities to resident heparan sulfates (HS), which modulate cell signaling by both sequestering ligands, and acting as cofactors in the formation of ligand?receptor complexes. To explore whether mHeps can affect the myelination and neurite outgrowth necessary for repair after SCI, we created lesioned or demyelinated neural cell co-cultures and exposed them with a panel of mHeps with varying degrees and positions of their sulfate moieties. LS-mHep7 enhanced neurite outgrowth and myelination, whereas highly sulfated mHeps (HS-mHeps) had attenuating effects. LS-mHeps had no effects on myelination or neurite extension in developing, uninjured myelinating cultures, suggesting they might exert their proregenerating effects by modulating or sequestering inhibitory factors secreted after injury. To investigate this, we examined conditioned media from cultures using chemokine arrays and conducted an unbiased proteomics approach by applying TMT-LC/MS to mHep7 affinity purified conditioned media from these cultures. Multiple protein factors reported to play a role in damage or repair mechanisms were identified, including amyloid betaA4. Amyloid beta peptide (1?42) was validated as an important candidate by treating myelination cultures and shown to inhibit myelination. Thus, we propose that LS-mHeps exert multiple beneficial effects on mechanisms supporting enhanced repair, and represent novel candidates as therapeutics for CNS damage.

AB  - An 8-year-old male dog was presented with a peri-urethral intrapelvic mass with the characteristics of a sarcoma on computed tomography and cytology evaluation. A two-step procedure leading to a permanent urinary diversion was performed. During the same procedure, the caudal pelvic urethra and mass were resected and an extrapelvic anastomosis of the pelvic portion of the urethra to its penile portion was performed after passage of the pelvic urethra through the inguinal canal. The procedure successfully produced a tension-free end-to-end urethral anastomosis and no complications were observed during the postoperative period. Histologically, the lesion was reported as a narrowly excised liposarcoma. A 4-week course of curative intent of radiotherapy was initiated 2 weeks after surgery. Eight months later, the dog was free of clinical signs.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic remains a life-threatening condition in the horse. Ischaemia and reperfusion following correction of small intestinal strangulation may produce oxidative stress. The ability to withstand oxidative stress depends on antioxidant levels and may be linked to horse survival. Objectives To measure peripheral antioxidant levels in horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy with small intestinal strangulation. Study design Case?control study. Methods Blood and plasma were collected from horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for small intestinal strangulation and stored at ?80Â°C. Controls involved non-colic horses. Total plasma glutathione was measured spectrophotometrically at 412?nm using the 5,5?-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) reaction. Samples containing scavenger (to remove reduced glutathione, GSH) were used to measure oxidised glutathione (GSSG). Glutathione reductase (GR) activity (u/l) was measured as the rate of GSH production at 412?nm. Glutathione peroxidise (GPx) activity (u/l) was measured as the change in optical density (340?nm) following the consumption of NADPH after GSSG production. All assays were purchased from BioAssay Systems (Hayward, California). Clinical data including arterial blood gas analysis were collected on admission. Results Glutathione reductase activity in horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions was significantly reduced compared to control horses (12.2?Â±?1.1?u/l vs. 15.9?Â±?0.8?u/l, P?=?0.03, n?=?6) whereas GPx activity did not significantly differ between colic and control horses (155.7?Â±?48.7?u/l vs. 167.3?Â±?30.1?u/l, P?=?0.84, n?=?6). Total glutathione, reduced or oxidised glutathione did not differ significantly between control and colic horses. A positive correlation existed between GR activity and Ca2+ (r?=?0.93) and K+ (r?=?0.75) whereas a strong negative correlation was present between GR activity and HCO3? (r?=??0.92) and PaCO2 (r?=??0.96). Conclusions Reduced plasma glutathione reductase activity with small intestinal strangulation indicates oxidative stress and may be related to systemic electrolyte/bicarbonate abnormalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists such as prucalopride are used as human prokinetics, since activation of 5-HT4 receptors on intestinal cholinergic neurons facilitates acetylcholine release. 5-HT4 receptors, linked to adenylyl cyclase, act via generation of cAMP. None of the 4 in vitro studies on 5-HT in horses provided evidence for neuronal 5-HT4 receptors, but none used the protocol as described in human studies [1?4]. Objectives To investigate whether functional 5-HT4 receptors are present in the equine small intestine. Study design and methods In vitro organ bath set up, applying electrical field stimulation (EFS) in longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips. Results Results were similar in both muscle layers. In the presence of 0.3?mmol/l NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 0.3??mol/l apamine, excluding effects of the inhibitory transmitters NO and ATP, EFS induced voltage-dependent on-contractions; these were neurogenic as they were abolished by 3??mol/l tetrodotoxin. At a voltage inducing 50% of the maximal amplitude, the submaximal EFS-induced contractions were cholinergic as atropine (1??mol/l) abolished them. Prucalopride (0.3??mol/l) did not increase the amplitude of these submaximal EFS-induced contractions. Even in the presence of the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, previously shown to enhance the effect of neuronal 5-HT4 receptors by inhibiting breakdown of their 2nd messenger cAMP [5], prucalopride (3??mol/l) had no influence. Also 5-HT (10??mol/l), a full agonist at 5-HT4 receptors, tested in the presence of methysergide and granisetron to exclude interaction with other 5-HT receptor subtypes, did not enhance EFS-induced submaximal contractions. Conclusions There is no evidence for presence of 5-HT4 receptors on the cholinergic neurons of the equine small intestine. These results question the application of 5-HT4 prokinetic drugs in horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infrared imaging is becoming popular as an aid to traditional diagnostic tools, its repeatability under practically relevant conditions is still discussed. Objectives We hypothesise that time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity affect thermography readings, and that there is no difference between values from left and right side. Study design Repeated thermography in a convenience sample. Methods Fifteen sound horses were thermographically imaged at 3 time points in the same day (08.00, 12.00 and 16.00?h). Images were taken of the following regions: neck, carpus, distolateral thoracic limbs (cranial and tendon areas), thoracolumbar, pelvis, hock and pelvic limb tendons. Relative humidity and ambient temperature were recorded for each session. Results There was a significant difference between the temperature readings during the 3 imaging sessions in all areas (Friedman and Kruskal?Wallis; all P<0.014). Ambient temperature and relative humidity correlated with thermography readings in the caudal imaging areas (P<0.008 [temperature], P<0.032 [humidity]) of the horses, with an exception of one hock reading, but not in all cranial areas (P<0.365 [temperature], P<0.992 [humidity]) (Spearman's Rho). All but 2 regions (minimum values in the carpus and thoracic tendon areas in the morning session, (P?=?0.033, 0.034) did not show significant difference between left and right sides at the same time of day (all P>0.057). Conclusions Time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity must be considered when using infrared imaging. Variations between the left and right sides of the horse can occur and should be considered during the analysis of pathological asymmetry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an electrophysiological technique used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) to evaluate the functional integrity of the descending motor fibres in the spinal cord. Successful application of the technique was reported in horses with spinal cord compression. However, limited data are available on the correlation of TMS with histopathological changes. Objectives To determine sensitivity of TMS for assessing the integrity of the spinal cord in horses with compressive lesions of the spinal cord. Study design Case series. Methods The study was conducted on 6 horses with spinal ataxia grade III-V/V admitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. The horses underwent TMS, radiography of the cervical or thoracolumbar vertebral column, and myelography (4/6). All horses were subjected to euthanasia and the spinal cord examined histopathologically. Results In 5/6 horses MMEPs with abnormal onset latencies in both extensor carpi radialis muscles and cranial tibialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a cervical spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed cervical vertebral malformation (4/5) with cervical vertebral canal stenosis (3/5) and tumour/osteomyelitis (1/5). In 1/6 horse MMEPs with normal onset latencies in extensor carpi radialis muscles and prolonged onset latencies in tibialis cranialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed deformation of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae. Myelography showed reduction in dural diameter and dorsal contrast column (4/4). Histopathological examination of the spinal cord confirmed compressive type lesions in all 6 horses with degenerative changes in the white matter of all funiculi, ballooning of myelin sheets, swollen axons, loss of axons and astroglial activation. Conclusions In this case series abnormal function of descending motor pathways as registered by TMS showed 100% sensitivity with the histopathological characteristics of compressive lesions in the spinal cord, but the number of horses is limited and further research is warranted.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Limited information exists on distribution of local anaesthetic solution following palmar digital nerve blocks. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves using 2 different volumes of contrast medium and 2 different injection sites. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves were performed at the level of or 2?cm proximal to the proximal aspect of the ipsilateral ungular cartilage, using 1.5 or 2.5?ml radiodense contrast medium. In total 96 injections were performed. Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately after injections and 10 and 20?min later. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After distal injections, the contrast medium was more localised around the injection site; after proximal injections the contrast patch had greater proximal-distal length. The greatest proximal diffusion was to 31.7% of the length of the proximal phalanx (from distal) after distal injections and to 70% after proximal injections. The larger volume resulted in significantly greater proximal diffusion than the smaller volume at the distal, but not at the proximal injection site (P<0.01). There was significant proximal diffusion with time after proximal and distal injections (P<0.01). In most limbs numerous radiopaque lines of various thickness extended proximally from the contrast patches; subjectively, their number and thickness were greater at the distal injection site. Conclusions Palmar digital nerve blocks at the level of the ungular cartilage using â‰¤2.5?ml local anaesthetic solution may improve proximal interphalangeal joint and pastern region pain. If using a more proximal site, distal fetlock region pain may be improved. Due to diffusion into lymphatic vessels, too small a volume at the distal injection site may not provide sufficient analgesia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A quantifiable measure of muscle activity related to the cervical spine may provide further understanding and evidence based support for chiropractic techniques. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a noninvasive method of measuring muscle activity of the splenius muscle when the horse is at rest. Objectives To determine if there is a relationship between objective measurable muscle parameters and misalignments and muscle tension in the equine cervical spine. Study design Controlled paired randomised study. Methods Privately owned horses (n?=?14), of mixed sex, age and mean height 157.8?cm were selected and assigned a group by matching work, management regime, age, sex and breed. The treatment group (n?=?7) underwent manual chiropractic treatment following palpation. The control group underwent palpation only. A Delsys 4 sensor system was used for data collection. Probes were positioned on the muscle halfway between C1/C2 joint and the crest on the left and right sides, between the tendon insertion and the motor point to maximise signals. sEMG readings were taken at immediately before (0) and after palpation (PP) and 30?min later (30). Data were tested for normality and variance by one-way ANOVA and paired t test. Results Post treatment, there was a significant decrease (P<0.01) in sEMG activity for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There was a significant decrease (P<0.05) in sEMG for right side for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There were no such significant effects for the control group. The majority (83%) of horses had atlas rotation and tilt to the right. Conclusions This preliminary study supports use of sEMG as a means of assessing muscle activity of equines and suggests a statistically significant reduction in splenius muscle activity is observed following manual chiropractic treatment although the benefit to the horse is unknown. Ethical animal research:?The study protocol was reviewed by the College Research Ethics Committee before commencement of the study. Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Source of funding:?McTimoney College of Chiropractic assisted with the hiring of the equipment. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?â‰¥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?â‰¥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin â‰¥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype. Ethical animal research:?Ethical University Committee approved all the procedures and owner informed consent was obtained. Source of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Summary Priapism due to sickle cell disease is a common but less well characterized complication of the disorder. It represents a ?medical emergency? with the key determinant of outcome being the duration of penile ischaemia and time to detumescence of <4Â h associated with a successful treatment outcome. Management can be outpatient-based and consists of pre-emptive strategies for early stuttering attacks based on prior health education of the association between the 2 disorders, non pharmacological management, outpatient penile aspiration and irrigation with or without instillation of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists for acute episodes and secondary prophylaxis to prevent the high rates of recurrences. The evidence to recommend medical prophylaxis is sparse but based on a consensus of experts and small phase 2 or III clinical trials. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) involving normal and dysregulated erectile physiology, scavenger haemolysis and nitric oxide pathway paves way for the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in medical prophylaxis of stuttering attacks. These agents will need to be studied in multi-centre randomized phase III trials before they become standard of care. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to enhance ?sexual wellness? and prevent erectile dysfunction in this sexually vulnerable group.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used for treatment of musculoskeletal diseases in horses, but there is ongoing debate regarding the relative safety and efficacy of allogeneic MSCs, compared with autologous equine MSCs. This review summarises the currently available published data regarding the therapeutic use of autologous and allogeneic MSCs in horses. Arguments that have been advanced against the use of allogeneic MSCs include higher risk of immunological reactions and shorter cell survival times following injection. Arguments favouring the use of allogeneic MSCs include the ability to bank cells and reduce the time to treatment, to collect MSCs from younger donor animals and the ability to manipulate banked cells prior to administration. In vitro studies and a limited set of experimental in vivo studies have indicated that adverse immunological reactions may occur when allogeneic MSCs are administered to horses. However, newer studies lack evidence of inflammatory reactions or adverse clinical responses when allogeneic MSCs are administered and compared with autologous MSCs. Thus, while the relative merits of allogeneic vs autologous MSCs for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries in horses have not been fully established, accumulating evidence from studies in horses suggests that allogeneic MSCs maybe a safe alternative to autologous MSCs. Large, properly designed, randomised trials in addition to careful immunological evaluation of short-term and long-term, local and systemic immune responses are needed to more fully resolve the issue.
