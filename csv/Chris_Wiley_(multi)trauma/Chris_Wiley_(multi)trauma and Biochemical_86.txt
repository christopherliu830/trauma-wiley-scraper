AB  - Abstract Although a centrifugal bioreactor (CCBR) supports high-density mammalian suspension cell cultures by balancing drag, buoyancy, and centrifugal forces, to date anchorage-dependent cultures have not been tried. Also, steady or intermittent hydrostatic pressures of 8 to 500 kPa, and shears of 0.02 to 1.4 N/m2 can be simultaneously applied in the CCBR. This article demonstrates the use of a CCBR to stimulate chondrogenesis in a high-density culture. At 3 weeks, histological results show even distribution of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen, with 1,890 ± 270 cells/mm2 cell densities that exceed those of 1,470 ± 270 in pellet cultures. Analysis of collagen content reveals similar levels for all treatment groups; 6.8 ± 3.5 and 5.0 ± 0.4 ?g collagen/?g DNA for 0.07 and 0.26 MPa CCBR cultures, respectively, in contrast to 6.6 ± 1.9 values for control pellet cultures. GAG levels of 5.6 ± 1.5 and 4.1 ± 0.9 ?g GAG /?g DNA are present for cultures stressed at 0.07 and 0.26 MPa, respectively, in comparison to control pellet cultures at the 8.4 ± 0.9 level. Although results to date have not revealed mechanical stress combinations that stimulate chondrogenesis over unstressed controls, system advantages include continuous culture at cell densities above those in the pellet, precise medium control, the ability to independently vary multiple mechanical stresses over a broad range, and the flexibility for integration of scaffold features for future chondrogenesis stimulation studies. ? 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study looked to investigate a new quantitative metric, R2???R1? (1/T2???1/T1?), using magnetic resonance (MR) images and voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) for detecting early cartilage degeneration and explore the association with patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) in patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Sixty-four patients from three sites were bilaterally scanned on a 3T MR with a combined T1?/T2 protocol to calculate R1? (1/T1?) and R2 (1/T2) values at baseline and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Non-rigid registration was applied to align images onto a template, allowing VBR to determine VBR rate differences and explore cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between injured and uninjured knees, generating Statistical Parametric Maps (SPMs). Baseline R2???R1? differences were further correlated with change in PROMs from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) from baseline to 6 months. Cross-sectional results demonstrated low relaxation rate differences in the injured patella (baseline: 21%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 18%, p?=?0.02), lateral tibia (baseline: 25%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 24%, p?=?0.01), and weight-bearing regions of the tibia and femur. The uninjured patella showed significant longitudinal changes (17%, p?=?0.02). R2???R1? differences showed significant correlations with KOOS PROMs, particularly in the lateral tibia, patella, and trochlea. R2???R1? difference VBR analyses provide new and highly sensitive parameters for assessing early cartilage degeneration in patients after ACL injury by integrating findings from both T1? and T2, commonly used relaxation time parameters, into a single metric. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - A 12-month-old beagle presented for anorexia, pyrexia and vomiting. The dog had been treated intermittently with antibiotics and corticosteroids for inappetence and lethargy since five months of age. Previous laboratory abnormalities included macrocytosis and neutropenia. At presentation, the dog was lethargic, febrile and thin. Laboratory examination findings included anaemia, a left shift, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Multiple, small, hypoechoic, round hepatic lesions were observed on abdominal ultrasound. Cytological examination of hepatic fine needle aspirates revealed a fungal infection and associated pyogranulomatous inflammation. The dog's general condition deteriorated despite supportive measures and treatment with fluconazole, and owners opted for euthanasia before hypocobalaminaemia was identified. Subsequent genomic analysis revealed a CUBN:c.786delC mutation in a homozygous state, confirming hereditary cobalamin malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Similar to human infants, dogs with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome may rarely be presented for infectious diseases, distracting focus from the underlying primary disorder.

AB  - A 10-year-old, domestic shorthair cat was presented for acute lameness of the left forelimb accompanied by severe pain, swelling, skin necrosis, malodorous discharge and pyrexia. Following a presumptive diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis aggressive surgical debridement of the affected soft tissues of the antebrachium and negative pressure wound treatment of the open defect were performed. Surgical findings supported the tentative diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis and Streptococcus canis was isolated from the wound. A free skin graft was performed 29 days after admission, and augmented by 3 days of negative pressure wound therapy to facilitate graft incorporation. Healing was achieved without complications and no functional or aesthetic abnormalities remained.

AB  - This report describes a case of neutrophilic dermatosis in a dog, with a number of clinical and pathological similarities to human pyoderma gangrenosum. A seven-year-old, female German shepherd dog with a history of non-erosive idiopathic polyarthritis was presented with severe facial swelling, bilateral erosivoulcerative lesions on the muzzle and multiple, eroded, dermal-subcutaneous nodules on the cranial trunk. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a necrotising neutrophilic dermatitis. No infectious agents could be detected using specific stains, immunohistochemistry, serology and bacterial aerobic, anaerobic or fungal cultures. A sterile neutrophilic dermatosis resembling human pyoderma gangrenosum was presumptively diagnosed, and the patient showed an excellent response to treatment with prednisone and ciclosporin.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the respective effects of propofol and emulsified isoflurane administered alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine on the quality of induction of anesthesia, physiological variables and recovery in dogs. Study design Prospective, randomized, experimental trial. Animals Thirty-six adult mixed-breed dogs. Methods Animals were randomly assigned to one of four induction protocols: propofol alone (group P); emulsified isoflurane alone (group EI); both propofol and dexmedetomidine (group PD), or both emulsified isoflurane and dexmedetomidine (group EID). Pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR), non-invasive arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gases were measured at baseline, before induction, immediately after intubation (time 0), and at 5 minute intervals until the dog began to swallow and the trachea was extubated. The quality of induction and recovery, and degree of ataxia were scored by a single investigator unaware of group assignment. The durations of anesthesia and recovery, and the incidence of adverse events were recorded. Results There were no clinically significant differences among the groups in induction quality. Systolic arterial pressure was lower in EID compared with P at 5 minutes. PR and fR were lower in PD and EID compared with P after induction. The PaCO2 at 5 minutes was higher than at baseline in group P. Ataxia score was lower in EID than in P. Time from induction to extubation and time from extubation to sternal recumbency were lower in EID compared with PD. Conclusions and clinical relevance There were no clinically significant differences among the groups in induction quality. In PD and EID, but not in P, PR and fR were decreased after induction. The EID combination resulted in smooth and rapid induction and recovery and thus may be useful clinically for induction of anesthesia.

AB  - Summary A 16-year-old mare was presented as an emergency to the Equine Hospital of the Veterinary School of Lyon, with a 1-month history of respiratory distress. On admission the mare was in poor body condition, with severe inspiratory and expiratory dyspnoea associated with severe hypoxaemia and marked tachycardia. Wheezes were auscultated. A pulmonary biopsy revealed fibrosis of about 40% of the parenchyma. Following an episode of atrial fibrillation, an echocardiogram was carried out which revealed signs of pulmonary hypertension, consistent with cor pulmonale. Despite the lack of aetiologic explanation for the primary pulmonary disease, the general condition of the mare improved with the administration of high-dosed corticoids and antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - Summary The components and reactions of the fibrinolysis system are well understood. The pathway has fewer reactants and interactions than coagulation, but the generation of a complete quantitative model is complicated by the need to work at the solid-liquid interface of fibrin. Diagnostic tools to detect disease states due to malfunctions in the fibrinolysis pathway are also not so well developed as is the case with coagulation. However, there are clearly a number of inherited or acquired pathologies where hyperfibrinolysis is a serious, potentially life-threatening problem and a number of antifibrinolytc drugs are available to treat hyperfibrinolysis. These topics will be covered in the following review.

AB  - Summary Parenteral nutrition is advocated for sick foals and horses, although there is no report which has critically evaluated its benefits in this species. Therefore, the hypothesis that parenteral nutrition (PN) is beneficial for horses with severe gastrointestinal disease was investigated in a retrospective study. Records from 79 treatment courses in horses with gastrointestinal disease were reviewed for the years 1992?2000. The fatality rate (48.1%) was attributed to the severity of the primary disease. Complications due to PN were recorded and hyperglycaemia was the most common complication associated with PN. The number of laparatomies, proportion of horses that received lipid emulsion and the daily cost were higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors. The length of PN course was longer in survivors, although glucose peak was observed later in nonsurvivors after initiation of PN. The content of vitamins in PN solution and plasma protein at the beginning of PN were higher for survivors, while the volume of plasma administered was significantly larger in nonsurvivors. In horses with inflammatory diseases, the rate of glucose infusion and the amount of vitamins administered were higher than in horses with nonstrangulated obstruction. The proportion of horses that received lipid emulsion was higher among those with nonstrangulated and strangulated obstruction than in the group with inflammatory conditions. Because of the diverse group of diseases and the variability in the clinical signs, evaluating the effect of PN on disease outcome was not possible. A prospective study to compare horses with similar clinical conditions treated and not treated with PN is needed to evaluate fully the benefits of PN, and to establish guidelines for patients election for PN.

AB  - Abstract Evidence shows that women have lower tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels and lower incidences of heart dysfunction and sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. To identify the cardioprotective effects and precise cellular/molecular mechanisms behind estrogen and estrogen receptors (ERs), we investigated the effects of 17?-estradiol (E2) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) on LPS-induced apoptosis by analyzing the activation of survival and death signalling pathways in doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Tet-On/ERα H9c2 myocardial cells and ERα-transfected primary cardiomyocytes overexpressing ERα. We found that LPS challenge activated JNK1/2, and then induced I?B degradation, NF?B activation, TNF-α up-regulation and subsequent myocardial apoptotic responses. In addition, treatments involving E2, membrane-impermeable BSA-E2 and/or Dox, which induces ERα overexpression, significantly inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis by suppressing LPS-up-regulated JNK1/2 activity, I?B degradation, NF?B activation and pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. TNF-α, active caspases-8, t-Bid, Bax, released cytochrome c, active caspase-9, active caspase-3) in myocardial cells. However, the cardioprotective properties of E2, BSA-E2 and ERα overexpression to inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis and promote cell survival were attenuated by applying LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and PI3K siRNA. These findings suggest that E2, BSA-E2 and ERα expression exert their cardioprotective effects by inhibiting JNK1/2-mediated LPS-induced TNF-α expression and cardiomyocyte apoptosis through activation of Akt.

AB  - Two dogs were presented with hemifacial spasm. Computed tomography images of both the dogs revealed an intracranial mass. In the first dog, a lesion at the level of the medulla oblongata was thought to cause primary irritation of the facial nucleus, with consequently permanent contraction of the ipsilateral facial muscles. In the second dog, a mass seemingly arising from the middle cranial fossa presumably isolated the facial motor neurons from upper motor neuron control, which resulted in hemifacial spasm as a result of loss of inhibitory interneuronal activity.

AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.

AB  - This case report describes congestive heart failure with pleural effusion in two middle-aged, pet house rabbits. Both had a history of acute onset dyspnoea, weakness and weight loss. Bi-atrial enlargement was seen on echocardiography in both rabbits. One rabbit had atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature complexes identified on electrocardiography. There was a radiographically evident pleural effusion in both rabbits and thoracocentesis was undertaken in one rabbit. These findings were confirmed on post-mortem examination. The aetiology for the underlying heart disease was not found, but the potential types of cardiomyopathies are discussed.

AB  - Abstract In a transgenic mouse model we have targeted the expression of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) to the mammary gland yielding hPTH as a secretory, soluble peptide in milk. A 2.5 kb upstream regulatory sequence of the murine whey acidic protein (WAP) directed the expression of the hPTH cDNA in a fusion gene construct (WAPPTHSV2) containing the SV40 small t-antigen intron and polyadenylation site in the 3? end. Established lines of transgenic mice secreted hPTH to milk in concentrations up to 415 ng/ml. Recombinant hPTH recovered from the milk was purified by HPLC and shown to be identical to hPTH standard as analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Expression of the WAPPTHSV2 was limited to the mammary gland as analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot of reversed transcribed mRNA from different tissues. hPTH is an important bone anabolic hormone and may be a potentially important pharmaceutical for treatment of demineralization disorders such as osteoporosis. We present the transgenic animal as a possible production system for hPTH. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
