AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.

AB  - Abstract:? Multiple investigations in vivo have shown that melatonin (MEL) has a neuroprotective effect in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). This study investigates the role of MEL as an intervening agent for ameliorating Ca2+-mediated events, including activation of calpain, following its administration to rats sustaining experimental SCI. Calpain, a Ca2+-dependent neutral protease, is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of SCI. Rats were injured using a standard weight-drop method that induced a moderately severe injury (40?g.cm?force) at T10. Sham controls received laminectomy only. Injured animals were given either 45?mg/kg MEL or vehicle at 15?min post-injury by intraperitoneal injection. At 48?hr post-injury, spinal cord (SC) samples were collected. Immunofluorescent labelings were used to identify calpain expression in specific cell types, such as neurons, glia, or macrophages. Combination of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and double immunofluorescent labelings was used to identify apoptosis in specific cells in the SC. The effect of MEL on axonal damage was also investigated using antibody specific for dephosphorylated neurofilament protein (dNFP). Treatment of SCI animals with MEL attenuated calpain expression, inflammation, axonal damage (dNFP), and neuronal death, indicating that MEL provided neuroprotective effect in SCI. Further, expression and activity of calpain and caspse-3 were examined by Western blotting. The results indicated a significant decrease in expression and activity of calpain and caspse-3 in SCI animals after treatment with MEL. Taken together, this study strongly suggested that MEL could be an effective neuroprotective agent for treatment of SCI.

AB  - The eye is a highly specialized organ that is subject to a huge range of pathology. Both local and systemic disease may affect different anatomical regions of the eye. The least invasive routes for ocular drug administration are topical (e.g. eye drops) and systemic (e.g. tablets) formulations. Barriers that subserve as protection against pathogen entry also restrict drug permeation. Topically administered drugs often display limited bioavailability due to many physical and biochemical barriers including the pre-corneal tear film, the structure and biophysiological properties of the cornea, the limited volume that can be accommodated by the cul-de-sac, the lacrimal drainage system and reflex tearing. The tissue layers of the cornea and conjunctiva are further key factors that act to restrict drug delivery. Using carriers that enhance viscosity or bind to the ocular surface increases bioavailability. Matching the pH and polarity of drug molecules to the tissue layers allows greater penetration. Drug delivery to the posterior segment is a greater challenge and, currently, the standard route is via intravitreal injection, notwithstanding the risks of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment with frequent injections. Intraocular implants that allow sustained drug release are at different stages of development. Novel exciting therapeutic approaches include methods for promoting transscleral delivery, sustained release devices, nanotechnology and gene therapy.

AB  - Degenerative disease of the spine is one of the most common clinical entities and affects the intervertebral discs, including opposing vertebral endplates, the intervertebral posterior joints and the ligaments. The most severe primary spinal degenerative changes are found in the lower cervical and lumbar spine regions. The spine contains three different types of joints, each of which presents its own pattern of degenerative disease: cartilaginous joints, synovial joints, and fibrous joints. With regard to radicular pain, root compression alone does not fully account for root pain following disc-root conflict, but it is, nevertheless, considered to be the main cause of pain. The authors pointed out that the origin of pain is multi-factorial and that inflammation probably predominates over merely mechanical mechanisms. They also considered whether vertebral arthrosis can be construed as the body's decision to favor the spine's static function over its dynamic role when joint ?hypermobility? linked to chronic load in old age could cause severe structural damage to the bony vertebral structures.

AB  - Summary Background The use of commercial chromogenic agar plates for the rapid, easy and correct identification of equine endometritis-causing bacteria has been proposed. Preliminary tests in our lab revealed undescribed limitations. Therefore, we tested the ability of the Brilliance UTI agar, a commercially available chromogenic agar, to accurately identify bacteria causing equine endometritis. Objectives To 1) investigate whether bacteria present in the equine uterus are able to grow on this chromogenic agar plate, 2) determine whether these bacteria belong to the genera for which these agar plates were originally designed and 3) consider whether these bacterial genera can be correctly identified, based only on the colour appearance. Study design In vitro experiments. Methods Macroscopic growth and colour appearance on the Brilliance UTI agar of 58 bacterial isolates, from previously collected equine uterine samples, were evaluated. Isolates were tentatively identified at the genus level using the manufacturer's guidelines and results were compared with MALDI-TOF MS as a ?gold standard?. Results The study revealed that 1) 77% (N = 45/58) of the bacterial isolates grew well on this chromogenic agar, 2) 83% of the investigated isolates (N = 48/58) belonged to one of the genera for which guidelines for identification were provided by the manufacturer and 3) only 50% of the isolates (N = 29/58) were correctly identified at the genus level, based only on colour appearance. Main limitations The current study uses purified bacterial isolates to inoculate the chromogenic agar plates, instead of fresh uterine samples. Bacteria were identified to the genus level using MALDI-TOF MS. Conclusion This study shows that identification at the genus level based only on colour appearance, without additional tests or the simultaneous use of other media, is not reliable based on the existing identification guidelines.

AB  - Abstract This review focuses on the application of nanomaterials for neural interfacing. The junction between nanotechnology and neural tissues can be particularly worthy of scientific attention for several reasons: (i) Neural cells are electroactive, and the electronic properties of nanostructures can be tailored to match the charge transport requirements of electrical cellular interfacing. (ii) The unique mechanical and chemical properties of nanomaterials are critical for integration with neural tissue as long-term implants. (iii) Solutions to many critical problems in neural biology/medicine are limited by the availability of specialized materials. (iv) Neuronal stimulation is needed for a variety of common and severe health problems. This confluence of need, accumulated expertise, and potential impact on the well-being of people suggests the potential of nanomaterials to revolutionize the field of neural interfacing. In this review, we begin with foundational topics, such as the current status of neural electrode (NE) technology, the key challenges facing the practical utilization of NEs, and the potential advantages of nanostructures as components of chronic implants. After that the detailed account of toxicology and biocompatibility of nanomaterials in respect to neural tissues is given. Next, we cover a variety of specific applications of nanoengineered devices, including drug delivery, imaging, topographic patterning, electrode design, nanoscale transistors for high-resolution neural interfacing, and photoactivated interfaces. We also critically evaluate the specific properties of particular nanomaterials?including nanoparticles, nanowires, and carbon nanotubes?that can be taken advantage of in neuroprosthetic devices. The most promising future areas of research and practical device engineering are discussed as a conclusion to the review.

AB  - Objectives To retrospectively evaluate the clinical behaviour and immunophenotype of lymphoma of the rectum in dogs. Methods Eleven dogs diagnosed with lymphoma of the rectum on histopathology were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemistry with CD3 and CD79a antibodies was performed at diagnosis or retrospectively. Results Treatment protocol varied with six dogs undergoing surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, two received chemotherapy after only incisional biopsy, one had surgical resection only, one was treated symptomatically and one dog was not treated. Chemotherapy treatment consisted of either a -low-dose COP (cyclophosphamide - prednisolone - vincristine) protocol (four dogs) or a six-week CHOP-based (cyclophosphamide - vincristine - -prednisolone - anthracycline) protocol (four dogs). Dogs that received chemotherapy lived significantly longer than dogs that did not receive chemotherapy (2352 versus 70 days). Median survival time was not reached, and there was an overall mean survival time of 1697 days. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 10 of 11 samples, and was consistent with B-cell -lymphoma in all cases. Clinical Significance Canine lymphoma of the rectum is associated with a favourable prognosis. Immunohistochemical evaluation of these lesions was consistent with B-cell lymphoma in all cases in which it was examined.

AB  - Summary Bright green inclusions in neutrophils have been reported as a sign of impending patient death. Here we report a series of 20 patients in whom green inclusions were identified in neutrophils or monocytes. Thirteen (65%) of the patients died within days of the detection of the inclusions. A common feature to almost all patients was ischaemic or hypoxic hepatitis which, in fatal cases, was associated with lactic acidosis. Light and electron microscopy indicated that the inclusions were lipid-rich, probably derived from lipofuscin-like material released from necrotic liver parenchymal cells. The majority of patients were known to be seriously ill at the time of detection of neutrophil inclusions. We recommend that the detection of green inclusions, which we refer to as ?critical green inclusions?, is acknowledged and reported by laboratories and correlated with clinical findings.

AB  - Chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) is a functional substitute for mammalian IgG for antigen detection. Traditional IgY purification methods involve multi-step procedures resulting in low purity and recovery of IgY. In this study, we developed a simple IgY purification system using IgY-specific peptides identified by T7 phage display technology. From disulfide-constrained random peptide libraries constructed on a T7 phage, we identified three specific binding clones (Y4-4, Y5-14, and Y5-55) through repeated biopanning. The synthetic peptides showed high binding specificity to IgY-Fc and moderate affinity for IgY-Fc (Kd: Y4-4 = 7.3 ± 0.2 ?M and Y5-55 = 4.4 ± 0.1 ?M) by surface plasmon resonance analysis. To evaluate the ability to purify IgY, we performed immunoprecipitation and affinity high-performance liquid chromatography using IgY-binding peptides; the result indicated that these peptides can be used as affinity ligands for IgY purification. We then used a peptide-conjugated column to purify IgY from egg yolks pre-treated using an optimized delipidation technique. Here, we report the construction of a cost-effective, one-step IgY purification system, with high purity and recovery. ? 2017 The Authors.

Material  GCF and serum IL-6; salivary IL-17F, and salivary and serum IL-17A/F levels were higher in the IU group than the H group (p < 0.05). However, serum IL-10 and IL-17E levels were higher in the H group than the IU group (p < 0.05). A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, S. oralis, A. naeslundii, and V. dispar counts were higher in IU group compared to H group (p < 0.05). Conclusion Altered local and systemic cytokine profiles are associated with differences in the microbial plaque composition in IU. Anti-inflammatory cytokines; IL-10, IL-17E are reduced in patients with IU and Th-1 and Th-17 driven inflammatory responses in biofluids are altered.

AB  - This is the first annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Rather than publish only new references, the previous list has been totally revised. Approximately one quarter of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. In addition, the bibliography has been expanded to include a number of new topics, with over one hundred more references. In preparing this revised list, many good articles were, of necesssity, excluded. The number of publications pertinent to clinical geriatrics has grown quickly over the past year. Preference, as before, was given to recent publications, since they usually provide a list of the important earlier articles. Most of the references are less than five years old; the exceptions deal with specific issues not covered as well in the subsequent literature. An occasional review article is cited to cover gaps in the geriatric literature or merely to amplify aspects of common diseases that have been widely ignored outside of geriatric medicine. Most of the references selected deal specifically with an elderly patient population. Exceptions include those dealing with diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study from a geriatric viewpoint exists, e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. All studies in geriatrics are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, relative obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The first set of references (I) includes synopses on the causation of aging, the second (II) on the systems known to degenerate with advancing age. The next two topics (III, IV) are clinically related: one deals with the basic distinctions of the geriatric patient and the other with the ancillary services available. As geriatrics is basically a multidisciplinary field, the bulk of the references are cited by pertinent specialty.

AB  - Abstract The concept of integrating molecular and biochemical data from new technologies with more traditional endpoints to develop a more complete understanding of risks and benefits in drug development has gained wide acceptance as a reasonable way to advance human health. However, actual implementation of this systems approach is not straightforward. While technology keeps advancing, our ability to accurately interpret the complexity of human biology has not kept pace. Indeed, sometimes the case seems to be one of the deeper we investigate, the more we realize what we do not understand. Additionally, in developing ethical pharmaceuticals, a major issue is establishing the necessary level of confidence to extrapolate from a series of endpoint measurements to accurately predict beneficial and/or potentially adverse responses in the diverse population of patients. The evidentiary standard for acceptance of new models and biomarkers in clinical practice is necessarily high, although the concept of ?fit-for-purpose? may help expedite the application of new knowledge in specific clinical situations. This chapter will present a view of both the progress and hurdles to applying systems toxicology to drug development in a regulated environment.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the demographic information of dogs referred for investigation of fever, to determine the usefulness of various diagnostic investigations and to assess the effect of treatment before referral on the presence of fever at referral, the duration of the investigation and the ability to reach a final diagnosis. Methods: The clinical records of 66 dogs, in which fever was part of the clinical signs documented by the referring veterinary surgeon, were reviewed. The effects of treatment 24 hours before referral on temperature at initial consultation and on time to diagnosis were evaluated. The effect of body temperature at initial consultation on cost and on time to diagnosis was also determined. The effect of insurance on costs incurred was assessed. The utility of different diagnostic investigations was recorded, and cases were classified according to the final diagnosis. Results: Only 34·8 per cent of dogs were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease, with most frequent diagnoses being steroid-responsive meningitis and polyarthritis. Treatment 24 hours before referral significantly increased the time to diagnosis (P=0·004) and affected the presence of fever at referral (P=0·006). Insurance status did not significantly affect cost incurred by the owner. Clinical Significance: This study documents a high incidence of immune-mediated disease in dogs referred for investigation of fever. It also documents a higher incidence of inflammatory central nervous system disease in febrile dogs than that reported previously. Of the diagnostic modalities employed in the majority of cases, radiography, cytology and bacteriological and fungal cultures (fluids/tissues) were the most useful. It is suggested that treatment is withdrawn or withheld before commencing diagnostic investigation of fever.

AB  - ABSTRACT A six-week-old female borzoi puppy from a brother-sister mating developed a generalised illness characterised by anorexia, temporary intention tremor, episodic pyrexia, tachypnoea, conjunctivitis, otitis and neck pain. Haematological abnormalities included an inflammatory leukogram and regenerative anaemia. Blood cultures remained sterile; clinical chemistry values were unremarkable. The puppy had recurrent seizures and was euthanased when 18 weeks old. Post mortem examination revealed a multisystemic inflammatory disease involving thyroids, lymph nodes, spleen, pancreas, bladder and lung, but no lesions to account for the neurological signs. The cause of this generalised disease was not recognised. The histological features are unusual and resemble those described in other dogs of this breed.

AB  - Abstract Recent advancements in bioanalytical techniques have led to the development of novel and robust diagnostic approaches that hold promise for providing optimal patient treatment, guiding prevention programs and widening the scope of personalized medicine. However, these advanced diagnostic techniques are still complex, expensive and limited to centralized healthcare facilities or research laboratories. This significantly hinders the use of evidence-based diagnostics for resource-limited settings and the primary care, thus creating a gap between healthcare providers and patients, leaving these populations without access to precision and quality medicine. Smartphone-based imaging and sensing platforms are emerging as promising alternatives for bridging this gap and decentralizing diagnostic tests offering practical features such as portability, cost-effectiveness and connectivity. Moreover, towards simplifying and automating bioanalytical techniques, biosensors and lab-on-a-chip technologies have become essential to interface and integrate these assays, bringing together the high precision and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques with the connectivity and computational power of smartphones. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of clinical smartphone diagnostics and its contributing technologies, as well as their wide range of areas of application, which span from haematology to digital pathology and rapid infectious disease diagnostics.

AB  - Background Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), also known as glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in prostate cancer. PSMA/GCPII is also expressed in many healthy tissues, but its function has only been established in the brain and small intestine. Several research groups have attempted to produce PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice to study the physiological role of PSMA/GCPII in detail. The outcomes of these studies differ dramatically, ranging from embryonic lethality to production of viable PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice without any obvious phenotype. Methods We produced PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice (hereafter also referred as Folh1?/? mice) by TALEN-mediated mutagenesis on a C57BL/6NCrl background. Using Western blot and an enzyme activity assay, we confirmed the absence of PSMA/GCPII in our Folh1?/? mice. We performed anatomical and histopathological examination of selected tissues with a focus on urogenital system. We also examined the PSMA/GCPII expression profile within the mouse urogenital system using an enzyme activity assay and confirmed the presence of PSMA/GCPII in selected tissues by immunohistochemistry. Results Our Folh1?/? mice are viable, breed normally, and do not show any obvious phenotype. Nevertheless, aged Folh1?/? mice of 69-72 weeks exhibit seminal vesicle dilation, which is caused by accumulation of luminal fluid. This phenotype was also observed in Folh1+/? mice; the overall difference between our three cohorts (Folh1?/?, Folh1+/?, and Folh1+/+) was highly significant (P?<?0.002). Of all studied tissues of the mouse urogenital system, only the epididymis appeared to have a physiologically relevant level of PSMA/GCPII expression. Additional experiments demonstrated that PSMA/GCPII is also present in the human epididymis. Conclusions In this study, we provide the first evidence characterizing the reproductive tissue phenotype of PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice. These findings will help lay the groundwork for future studies to reveal PSMA/GCPII function in human reproduction.

AB  - Abstract Objective Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with the accumulation of wild-type human α-synuclein (SYN) in neurons and with prominent slowing of brain oscillations on electroencephalography (EEG). However, it remains uncertain whether the EEG abnormalities are actually caused by SYN. Methods To determine whether SYN can cause neural network abnormalities, we performed EEG recordings and analyzed the expression of neuronal activity-dependent gene products in SYN transgenic mice. We also carried out comparative analyses in humans with DLB. Results We demonstrate that neuronal expression of SYN in transgenic mice causes a left shift in spectral power that closely resembles the EEG slowing observed in DLB patients. Surprisingly, SYN mice also had seizures and showed molecular hippocampal alterations indicative of aberrant network excitability, including calbindin depletion in the dentate gyrus. In postmortem brain tissues from DLB patients, we found reduced levels of calbindin mRNA in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, nearly one quarter of DLB patients showed myoclonus, a clinical sign of aberrant network excitability that was associated with an earlier age of onset of cognitive impairments. In SYN mice, partial suppression of epileptiform activity did not alter their shift in spectral power. Furthermore, epileptiform activity in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice was not associated with a left shift in spectral power. Interpretation We conclude that neuronal accumulation of SYN slows brain oscillations and, in parallel, causes aberrant network excitability that can escalate into seizure activity. The potential role of aberrant network excitability in DLB merits further investigation.
