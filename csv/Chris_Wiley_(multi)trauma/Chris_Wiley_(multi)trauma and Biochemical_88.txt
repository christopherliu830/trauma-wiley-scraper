AB  - Summary: The pattern of severe acute renal failure has changed considerably over the past 2 decades. Severe acute renal failure is now most commonly seen in the intensive care unit and is just one of the manifestations of the multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. the pathogenesis of severe acute renal failure is complex involving decreased renal perfusion, humorally mediated renal vasoconstriction and local migration and activiation of inflammatory cells. the initial final common pathway to renal injury seems to be outer medullary ischaemia. Protection from renal dysfunction in critically ill patients must therefore be directed toward sufficient haemodynamic resucitation to avoid inadequate medullary perfusion. Such perfusion is highly dependent on the maintenance of optimal intravascular filling, adequate cardiac output and, importantly, adequate renal perfusion pressure. In these patients, such renal perfusion pressure can often only be maintained if vasopressor agents are used and titrated to keep the mean arterial pressure at the highest effective and safe level (mean arterial pressure of approximately 80?85 mmHg in most septic patients). If severe acute renal failure develops despite full medical support, renal replacement therapy becomes necesary. There is now a growing worldwide trend toward the use of continuous haemofiltration techniques as the preferred mode of renal replacement therapy. Such techniques provide important practical advantages and, in many cases, are the only form of renal replacement therapy that the patient is able to tolerate. Continous haemofiltration also appears to provide not only outstanding haemodynamic stability but also some membrane adsorption and removal of the humoral mediators of sepsis. This makes continuous haemofiltration a particularly attractive approach to renal support and is responsible for this treatment now being the leading form of acute renal replacement therapy in Australia. After a relatively static period, the area of acute renal failure management is rapidly evolving and offering some promise of a level of support able to match the illness severity associated with it.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are intrinsically heterogeneous and comprise subpopulations that differ in their proliferation, multi-potency, and functional properties, which are commonly demonstrated by culturing hMSCs at different plating densities. The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of different subpopulations of hMSC by testing the hypothesis that the clonogenic hMSC subpopulation, which is selectively enriched in clonal density (CD) and low density (LD) culture (10 and 100 cells per square centimeter, respectively), possesses a metabolic phenotype that differs from that of hMSC in medium- or high-density (MD: 1,000 and HD: 3,000 cells per square centimeter, respectively). Cells at CD and LD conditions exhibited elevated expression of CD146 and colony forming unit-fibroblast compared with cells at MD- or HD. Global metabolic profiles revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of cell extracts showed clear distinction between LD and HD cultures, and density-dependent differences in coupling of glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Metabolic inhibitors revealed density-dependent differences in glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP generation, in glutamine metabolism, in the dependence on the pentose phosphate pathway for maintaining cellular redox state, and sensitivity to exogenous reactive oxygen species. We also show that active OXPHOS is not required for proliferation in LD culture but that OXPHOS activity increases senescence in HD culture. Together, the results revealed heterogeneity in hMSC culture exists at the level of primary metabolism. The unique metabolic characteristics of the clonogenic subpopulation suggest a novel approach for optimizing in vitro expansion of hMSCs. Stem Cells 2015;33:3368?3381

AB  - Abstract:? To preserve the central nervous system (CNS) function after a traumatic injury, therapeutic agents must be administered to protect neurons as well as glial cells. Cell death in CNS injuries and diseases are attributed to many factors including glutamate toxicity and oxidative stress. We examined whether melatonin, a potent anti-oxidant and free radical scavenger, would attenuate apoptotic death of rat C6 astroglial cells under glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Exposure of C6 cells to 500??m l-glutamic acid (LGA) and 100??m hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 24?hr caused significant increases in apoptosis. Apoptosis was evaluated by Wright staining and ApopTag assay. Melatonin receptor 1 appeared to be involved in the protection of these cells from excitotoxic and oxidative damage. Cells undergoing excitotoxic and oxidative stress for 15?min were then treated with 150?nm melatonin, which prevented Ca2+influx and cell death. Western blot analyses showed alterations in Bax and Bcl-2 expression resulting in increased Bax:Bcl-2 ratio during apoptosis. Western blot analyses also showed increases in calpain and caspase-3 activities, which cleaved 270?kD α-spectrin at specific sites to generate 145?kD spectrin breakdown product (SBDP) and 120?kD SBDP, respectively. However, 15-min post-treatment of C6 cells with melatonin dramatically reduced Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and proteolytic activities, decreasing LGA or H2O2-induced apoptosis. Our data showed that melatonin prevented proteolysis and apoptosis in C6 astroglial cells. The results suggest that melatonin may be an effective cytoprotective agent against glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress in CNS injuries and diseases.

AB  - Congestive heart failure is a common presentation in small animal practice. Cardiac tumours are an unusual cause of congestive heart failure and, when they occur, usually cause clinical signs associated with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. This case report outlines the clinical and histological findings in two dogs presented with clinical signs of congestive heart failure caused by obstruction of blood flow by intracavitary cardiac tumours. Case 1 showed signs of left-sided heart failure caused by osteosarcoma within the left atrial lumen, and case 2 presented with clinical signs of right-sided heart failure due to haemangiosarcoma occupying the right atrial and ventricular lumens. This case report provides further evidence for the inclusion of intracardiac neoplasia in the differential diagnosis for dogs with clinical signs of congestive heart failure.

AB  - A six-month-old male entire Norfolk terrier was presented with a 3-month history of poor development, reluctance to exercise and progressive and diffuse muscle atrophy. Serum creatine kinase concentration was markedly elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging of the epaxial muscles revealed asymmetrical streaky signal changes aligned within the muscle fibres (hyperintense on T2-weighted images and short-tau inversion recovery with moderate contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images). Electromyography revealed pseudomyotonic discharges and fibrillation potentials localised at the level of the supraspinatus, epaxial muscles and tibial cranialis muscles. Muscle biopsy results were consistent with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. The dog remained stable 7 months after diagnosis with coenzyme Q10 and l-carnitine; however after that time, there was a marked deterioration and the owners elected euthanasia. This case report describes the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic and histopathological findings with immunohistochemical analysis in a Norfolk terrier with confirmed dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy, which has not been previously described in this breed.

AB  - Abstract Leukoencephalopathies are a broad class of common neurologic deterioration for which the etiology remains unsolved in many cases. In a Chinese Han family segregated with sensorineural hearing loss and leukoencephalopathy, candidate pathogenic variants were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing of 144 genes associated with deafness and 108 genes with leukoencephalopathy. Novel compound heterozygous mutations p.R477H and p.P505S were identified in KARS, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), as the only candidate causative variants. These two mutations were functionally characterized by enzymatic assays, immunofluorescence, circular dichroism analysis, and gel filtration chromatography. Despite no alteration in the dimer-tetramer oligomerization and cellular distribution by either mutation, the protein structure was notably influenced by the R477H mutation, which subsequently released the protein from the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC). Mutant LysRSs with the R477H and P505S mutations had decreased tRNALys aminoacylation and displayed a cumulative effect when introduced simultaneously. Our studies showed that mutations in KARS lead to a newly defined subtype of leukoencephalopathy associated with sensorineural hearing impairment. The combined effect of reduced aminoacylation and release of LysRS from the MSC likely underlies the pathogenesis of the KARS mutations identified in this study.

AB  - Abstract: In pancreatic B- and A-cells, metabolic stimuli regulate biochemical and electrical processes that culminate in Ca2+-influx and release of insulin or glucagon, respectively. Like in other (neuro)endocrine cells, Ca2+-influx triggers the rapid exocytosis of hormone-containing secretory granules. Only a small fraction of granules (<1% in insulin-secreting B-cells) can be released immediately, while the remainder requires translocation to the plasma membrane and further ?priming? for release by several ATP- and Ca2+-dependent reactions. Such functional organization may account for systemic features such as the biphasic time course of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Since this release pattern is altered in type-2 diabetes mellitus, it is conceivable that disturbances in the exocytotic machinery underlie the disease. Here I will review recent data from our laboratory relevant for the understanding of these processes in insulin-secreting B-cells and glucagon-secreting A-cells and for the identification of novel targets for antidiabetic drug action. Two aspects are discussed in detail: 1) The importance of a tight interaction between L-type Ca2+-channels and the exocytotic machinery for efficient secretion; and 2) the role of intragranular acidification for the priming of secretory granules and its regulation by a granular 65-kDa sulfonylurea-binding protein.

AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Intra-abdominal cryptococcosis was diagnosed in two young dogs. The first, an entire male border collie, was presented with vomiting. An abdominal mass detected during physical examination proved to be cryptococcal mesenteric lymphadenitis on exploratory laparotomy. The second dog, a female neutered giant schnauzer, was presented with neurological signs suggestive of encephalopathy. Intestinal cryptococcal granulomas were detected in an extensive diagnostic investigation which included abdominal ultrasonography. The gastrointestinal tract was considered the most likely portal of entry for cryptococcal organisms in both cases. Both dogs were treated using surgery and multiagent antifungal chemotherapy. The first case succumbed despite therapy, while the second dog was treated successfully as gauged by return to clinical normality and a substantial decline in the cryptococcal antigen titre which continued to fall after cessation of treatment.

AB  - Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), also known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) or folate hydrolase, is a metallopeptidase expressed predominantly in the human brain and prostate. GCPII expression is considerably increased in prostate carcinoma, and the enzyme also participates in glutamate excitotoxicity in the brain. Therefore, GCPII represents an important diagnostic marker of prostate cancer progression and a putative target for the treatment of both prostate cancer and neuronal disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity. For the development of novel therapeutics, mouse models are widely used. However, although mouse GCPII activity has been characterized, a detailed comparison of the enzymatic activity and tissue distribution of the mouse and human GCPII orthologs remains lacking. In this study, we prepared extracellular mouse GCPII and compared it with human GCPII. We found that mouse GCPII possesses lower catalytic efficiency but similar substrate specificity compared with the human protein. Using a panel of GCPII inhibitors, we discovered that inhibition constants are generally similar for mouse and human GCPII. Furthermore, we observed highest expression of GCPII protein in the mouse kidney, brain, and salivary glands. Importantly, we did not detect GCPII in the mouse prostate. Our data suggest that the differences in enzymatic activity and inhibition profile are rather small; therefore, mouse GCPII can approximate human GCPII in drug development and testing. On the other hand, significant differences in GCPII tissue expression must be taken into account when developing novel GCPII-based anticancer and therapeutic methods, including targeted anticancer drug delivery systems, and when using mice as a model organism.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder resulting from a self-destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells. The complete proteome of the human pancreas, where both the dysfunctional beta cells and their proximal environment co-exist, remains unknown. Here, we used TMT10-based isobaric labeling and multidimensional LC-MS/MS to quantitatively profile the differences between pancreatic head region tissues from T1D (N = 5) and healthy subjects (N = 5). Among the 5357 (1% false discovery rate) confidently identified proteins, 145 showed statistically significant dysregulation between T1D and healthy subjects. The differentially expressed pancreatic proteome supports the growing notion of a potential role for exocrine pancreas involvement in T1D. This study also demonstrates the utility for this approach to analyze dysregulated proteins as a means to investigate islet biology, pancreatic pathology and T1D pathogenesis.

AB  - A 24-week-old dog was presented with recurrent rectal prolapse because of colonic duplication. Colonic duplication is an extremely uncommon congenital abnormality, with only six cases reported in veterinary medicine, one diagnosed at necropsy and five after barium enema, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy either alone or in combination. In this case, these techniques failed to identify the abnormality and diagnosis was ultimately achieved via negative contrast computed tomography. The evaluation generated by the computed tomography images allowed a refined surgical approach. To the authors? knowledge, negative contrast computed tomography has not yet been reported in the veterinary literature to diagnose gastrointestinal pathologies. Colonic duplication in this case was treated by removal of the intercolonic septum via colotomy.
