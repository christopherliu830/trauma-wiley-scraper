AB  - A 24-week-old dog was presented with recurrent rectal prolapse because of colonic duplication. Colonic duplication is an extremely uncommon congenital abnormality, with only six cases reported in veterinary medicine, one diagnosed at necropsy and five after barium enema, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy either alone or in combination. In this case, these techniques failed to identify the abnormality and diagnosis was ultimately achieved via negative contrast computed tomography. The evaluation generated by the computed tomography images allowed a refined surgical approach. To the authors? knowledge, negative contrast computed tomography has not yet been reported in the veterinary literature to diagnose gastrointestinal pathologies. Colonic duplication in this case was treated by removal of the intercolonic septum via colotomy.

AB  - Summary Functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been associated with genetic, environmental, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial factors. The overall approach to FAP and IBS should be multi-;faceted and customized to address the patient's specific symptoms and underlying triggers. Cognitive behavioral therapy specifically targets the interplay between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and has been shown to be effective in reducing complaints of abdominal pain and helping patients cope with symptoms. Although the focus of many CBT sessions is on teaching the patient specific skills and strategies, parents are also frequently included in treatment to provide instruction in how to best assist and respond to the patient when he or she is experiencing pain. Continued research is necessary in order to better understand which aspects of CBT are most helpful. Additional studies are needed to confirm or dismiss the effectiveness of interventions such as school reintegration plans and parental/caregiver involvement in strategies such as gradual exposure to situations that may exacerbate pain, as well as re-involvement in previously enjoyed activities.

AB  - Abstract? ?A cystic bone condition occurring in the distal metaphyses of the radius and/or ulna is reported in 1 male and 2 female Dobermann Pinscher siblings. The radiological and pathological features of the condition in the dogs were considered to be similar to those which characterise polyostotic fibrous dysplasia in man. The affected bones also showed subperiosteal cortical defects. Treatment by curettage at 7 months of age was successful in 2 dogs. The other dog remained untreated for comparison. It is suggested that the disease could be heritable in the American Dobermann Pinscher. Résumé? ?II a été observé un état de perte de substance osseuse localisée dam la partie distale des métaphyses du radius et ou du cubitus chez un mâle et 2 femelles Dobermann Pinscher de la même fratrie. On considère que les caractéristiques radiologiques et pathologiques de la maladie chez le chien sont identiques à celle de la dysplasie fibreuse polyostotique chez l'homme. Les os atteints montrent aussi des défauts corticaux subpériostiques. Le traitement par curetage à 1'âge de 7 mois fut un succès chez 2 chiens. A titre de comparaison, I'autre chien n'a pas été traité. Il semble que la maladie soit héréditaire chez le Pinscher Dobermann Américain. Zusammenfassung? ?Ein cystischer Knochenzustand in den distalen Metaphysen des Radius und/oder der Ulna wurde bei 1 männlichem und 2 weiblichen Dobermann-Pinscher-Abkömmlingen beobachtet. Die radiologischen und pathologischen Einzelheiten dieser Erscheinung bei den Hunden gleichen denen, die für die polyostotische fibröse Dysplasie des Menschen charakteristisch sind. Die befallenen Knochen zeigten auch subperiosteale corticale Defekte. Die Behandlung durch Curettage im Alter von sieben Monaten war bei 2 Hunden erfolgreich. Der andere Hund blieb zu Vergleichszwecken unbehandeIt. Es ist zu vermuten, dass diese Krankheit beim amerikanischen Doberrnann-Pinscher vererblich ist.

AB  - Summary Seventeen Thoroughbred horses with moderate to severe gastric ulceration were purchased from a race track within 10 days of racing and were treated once daily with either omeprazole (9 horses) or vehicle (8 horses) and evaluated gastroscopically for ulcer healing. Horses were administered omeprazole (1.5 mg/kg bwt/day) or vehicle by nasogastric tube once daily. Gastroscopic examination was performed on Days 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 17, 21, 24 and 28, until lesions healed completely. Selected images of gastric lesions were captured by computer at each endoscopic examination, with a measuring caliper included in captured images. The area and perimeter of lesions were measured by computer and healing rates of specific lesions were determined by calculating the rate of linear advance of the margins toward the centre of the lesion. Additionally, the number of days to complete healing of the entire gastric squamous mucosa was compared between treatment groups. Gastric lesions healed at a significantly faster rate in horses receiving omeprazole than in vehicle-treated horses (P<0.001). Complete healing of the entire stomach occurred in 10?21 days in omeprazole-treated horses, and 14?28 days in 3 of 8 vehicle-treated horses, with the remaining vehicle-treated horses having unhealed lesions on Day 28. In addition, 5 vehicle-treated horses developed new lesions in the squamous epithelial mucosa during the trial; no new lesions were observed in the omeprazole-treated group.

AB  - Summary Coumarins, identified as plant secondary metabolites possess diverse biological activities including anti-angiogenic properties. Daphnetin (DAP), a plant derived dihydroxylated derivative of coumarin has shown significant pharmacological properties such as anticancer, anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory. The present study was performed to investigate the anti-angiogenic potential of DAP, focusing on the mechanism of action. The in vivo anti-angiogenic potential of DAP was evaluated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced rat aortic ring (RAR) assay and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. For in vitro evaluation, wounding migration, transwell invasion, tube formation and apoptosis assays were performed on VEGF (8 ng/mL)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The cellular mechanism of DAP was examined on TNFα (10 ng/mL) and VEGF-induced HUVECs by extracting the mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and western blotting. Our data demonstrated that DAP inhibited the in vivo angiogenesis in the RAR and CAM assay. DAP also inhibited the different steps of angiogenesis, such as migration, invasion, and tube formation in HUVECs. DAP inhibited nuclear factor-?B signalling together including TNF-α induced I?Bα degradation; phosphorylation of I?B kinase (IKKα/?) and translocation of the NF-?B-p65 protein. Furthermore, western blotting revealed that DAP significantly down-regulated the VEGF-induced signalling such as c-Src, FAK, ERK1/2 and the related phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and VEGFR2 expressions. DAP reduced the elevated mRNA expression of iNOS, MMP2 and also, induced apoptosis in VEGF-stimulated HUVECs by the caspase-3 dependent pathway. Taken together, this study reveals that DAP may have novel prospective as a new multi-targeted medication for the anti-angiogenesis and cancer therapy.

AB  - Contents Sheep and goat production is an important economic activity in Spain with an increasing interest in milk production. Multiovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) and In vitro Embryo Production (IVEP) are assisted reproductive technologies aimed at increasing the genetic diffusion of females. In vitro embryo production is a multi-step methodology comprising the following procedures: (i) In vitro Maturation (IVM) of oocytes recovered directly from the follicles, (ii) In vitro Fertilization (IVF) or co-incubation of capacitated spermatozoa with in vitro matured oocytes and (iii) In vitro culture (IVC) of zygotes up to the blastocyst stage. In vitro embryo production from oocytes recovered from prepubertal females is called JIVET (Juvenile in vitro Embryo Transfer) and allows shortened generation intervals and increased genetic gain. Embryo production together with embryo cryoconservation would allow large-scale embryo marketing, a pathogen-free genetic movement and easier and cheaper germplasm commercial transactions. Commercial Embryo activity in small ruminants is low compared to cows in the European Union (data from the European Embryo Transfer Association) and in the world (data from the International Embryo Transfer Association). There is less IVEP research in small ruminants compared to other livestock species. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current status of IVEP of small ruminant with an emphasis on (i) description of the main methodologies currently used for IVM, IVF and IVC of embryos (ii) comparing procedures and outputs from JIVET and IVEP of adult females and (iii) the future research perspectives of this technology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma in 1948, it has been investigated as a non-invasive screening tool for many diseases, especially solid tumours and foetal genetic abnormalities. However, to date our lack of knowledge regarding the origin and purpose of cfDNA in a physiological environment has limited its use to more obvious diagnostics, neglecting, for example, its potential utility in the identification of predisposition to disease, earlier detection of cancers, and lifestyle-induced epigenetic changes. Moreover, the concept or mechanism of cfDNA could also have potential therapeutic uses such as in immuno- or gene therapy. This review presents an extensive compilation of the putative origins of cfDNA and then contrasts the contributions of cellular breakdown processes with active mechanisms for the release of cfDNA into the extracellular environment. The involvement of cfDNA derived from both cellular breakdown and active release in lateral information transfer is also discussed. We hope to encourage researchers to adopt a more holistic view of cfDNA research, taking into account all the biological pathways in which cfDNA is involved, and to give serious consideration to the integration of in vitro and in vivo research. We also wish to encourage researchers not to limit their focus to the apoptotic or necrotic fraction of cfDNA, but to investigate the intercellular messaging capabilities of the actively released fraction of cfDNA and to study the role of cfDNA in pathogenesis.

AB  - Background Extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma has been described in veterinary medicine in association with neoplasia, intervertebral disk disease, and snake envenomation. There are rare reports of spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma formation with no known cause in human medicine. Multiple cases of spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma have not been described previously in veterinary medicine. Objectives To describe the signalment, clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and surgical outcomes in histopathologically confirmed extraparenchymal spinal cord hematomas in dogs with no identified underlying etiology. Animals Six dogs had MRI of the spinal cord, decompressive spinal surgery, and histopathologic confirmation of extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma not associated with an underlying cause. Methods Multi-institutional retrospective study. Results Six patients had spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma formation. MRI showed normal signal within the spinal cord parenchyma in all patients. All hematomas had T2-weighted hyperintensity and the majority (5/6) had no contrast enhancement. All dogs underwent surgical decompression and most patients (5/6) returned to normal or near normal neurologic function postoperatively. Follow-up of the patients (ranging between 921 and 1,446 days) showed no progression of neurologic clinical signs or any conditions associated with increased bleeding tendency. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Before surgery and histopathology confirming extraparenchymal hematoma, the primary differential in most cases was neoplasia, based on the MRI findings. This retrospective study reminds clinicians of the importance of the combination of advanced imaging combined with histopathologic diagnosis. The prognosis for spontaneous spinal cord extraparenchymal hematoma with surgical decompression appears to be favorable in most cases.

AB  - Abstract Keratin (K) intermediate filament proteins form cytoskeletal scaffolds in epithelia, the disruption of which leads to a large number of human disorders. KRT5 or KRT14 mutations cause epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). The considerable intra- and interfamilial variability in EBS suggests modifying loci, most of which are unknown. In many human disorders, chaperones and the ubiquitin?proteasome system have been found to modify disease severity, thereby providing novel therapy targets. Here, we demonstrate upregulation of stress-induced Hsp70 and Hsp90 in two EBS models, namely, in neonatal K5?/? mice and upon proteasome inhibition in cells that stably express the disease-causing mutation K14?p.Arg125Cys, both harboring keratin aggregates. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition caused nuclear translocation of pHSF-1 and an increase in K14?p.Arg125Cys-positive aggregates in cells. Overexpression of the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP/STUB1 strongly reduced keratin aggregates through increased degradation of mutant K14. Using CHIP?p.Met1_Ala142del (?TPR?CHIP), we demonstrated the involvement of Hsc70 and Hsp70 in mutant keratin degradation. Our data uncover common principles between EBS and other protein misfolding disorders, revealing that aggregation-prone keratins are targeted by components of the chaperone machinery. Thus, modulation of the chaperone machinery using small molecules may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for dominant EBS, allowing reformation of an intact keratin cytoskeleton.

AB  - Objectives: To study forms of congenital heart disease present in a family of beagle dogs with a strong prevalence of ventricular septal defect and to document the pathological findings associated with the ventricular septal defects and investigate the mode of transmission. Methods: The animals were investigated by physical examination, radiography, electrocardiography and ultrasonography to diagnose the presence of congenital heart disease. Some animals were diagnosed at post-mortem examination and the dead animals underwent post-mortem examination to verify the presence of ventricular septal defect. An analysis of pedigree was undertaken and two of the affected animals were mated to investigate the mode of transmission. Results: Among the 28 dogs evaluated clinically or by post-mortem examination, 14 cases of ventricular septal defect were identified. The post-mortem examination showed some abnormalities of the ventricular outflow region associated with malformation of conotruncal septum development. When two affected dogs were bred, congenital heart disease was present in all of the offspring. Clinical Significance: The congenital heart disease identified in this beagle family can be classified as conotruncal malformation, and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was suggested by pedigree analysis.

AB  - Abstract Background Skeletal muscle is central to locomotion and metabolic homeostasis. The laboratory worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been developed into a genomic model for assessing the genes and signals that regulate muscle development and protein degradation. Past work has identified a receptor tyrosine kinase signalling network that combinatorially controls autophagy, nerve signal to muscle to oppose proteasome-based degradation, and extracellular matrix-based signals that control calpain and caspase activation. The last two discoveries were enabled by following up results from a functional genomic screen of known regulators of muscle. Recently, a screen of the kinome requirement for muscle homeostasis identified roughly 40% of kinases as required for C. elegans muscle health; 80 have identified human orthologues and 53 are known to be expressed in skeletal muscle. To complement this kinome screen, here, we screen most of the phosphatases in C. elegans. Methods RNA interference was used to knockdown phosphatase-encoding genes. Knockdown was first conducted during development with positive results also knocked down only in fully developed adult muscle. Protein homeostasis, mitochondrial structure, and sarcomere structure were assessed using transgenic reporter proteins. Genes identified as being required to prevent protein degradation were also knocked down in conditions that blocked proteasome or autophagic degradation. Genes identified as being required to prevent autophagic degradation were also assessed for autophagic vesicle accumulation using another transgenic reporter. Lastly, bioinformatics were used to look for overlap between kinases and phosphatases required for muscle homeostasis, and the prediction that one phosphatase was required to prevent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was assessed by western blot. Results A little over half of all phosphatases are each required to prevent abnormal development or maintenance of muscle. Eighty-six of these phosphatases have known human orthologues, 57 of which are known to be expressed in human skeletal muscle. Of the phosphatases required to prevent abnormal muscle protein degradation, roughly half are required to prevent increased autophagy. Conclusions A significant portion of both the kinome and phosphatome are required for establishing and maintaining C. elegans muscle health. Autophagy appears to be the most commonly triggered form of protein degradation in response to disruption of phosphorylation-based signalling. The results from these screens provide measurable phenotypes for analysing the combined contribution of kinases and phosphatases in a multi-cellular organism and suggest new potential regulators of human skeletal muscle for further analysis.

AB  - Abstract Organs available for solid organ transplantation are mainly procured from brain dead donors. The inflammation associated with brain death may reduce organ quality and increase organ immunogenicity, thus leading to inferior recipient outcome. We hypothesized that the extensive surgical procedure performed during multiorgan procurement enhances the levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers. We measured the levels of 27 cytokines and the terminal complement complex (TCC) in plasma samples from brain dead organ donors (n = 34) drawn before and at three specific time points during procurement surgery. Baseline levels of G-CSF, interferon-?, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), regulated upon activation T cell expressed and secreted, and tumor necrosis factor-α were significantly elevated in brain dead donors compared with normal individuals (n = 14), but they were not associated with time on ventilator or any other registered clinical variable. Notably, the secretion of G-CSF, IL1-ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1?, PDGF, and TCC, the latter reflecting ongoing complement activation, increased significantly during surgery. None of the biomarker increases were correlated with operation duration. Multiorgan procurement surgery significantly adds to the inflammatory response revealed by both pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers associated with brain death. Future studies should determine whether this is associated with inferior recipient outcome.

AB  - Summary This chapter proposes a number of exercise-generated mechanisms to influence the iron status of an athlete including hemolysis, hematuria, sweating, gastrointestinal bleeding, and injuries. The need to supplement athletes with iron was first suggested by the evidence of changes in blood cell counts and iron-associated parameters during periods of intense training or, even more accentuated, at the start of the training. This condition is known as ?sports anemia? and is common in endurance athletes. The hematological changes that occur during intense training are paralleled by the fall in ferritin concentration, mirroring a depletion of the body iron stores, even though ferritin levels also depend upon a number of other factors such as liver disease, alcohol consumption, infections, cardiovascular disease, and aging. Other parameters that can be used to monitor the iron status include sTfR, red blood cells (RBC) protoporphyrin, and stainable bone marrow iron (hemosiderin).

AB  - Summary The vascular endothelial surface is coated by the glycocalyx, a ubiquitous gel-like layer composed of a membrane-binding domain that contains proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycan side-chains, and plasma proteins such as albumin and antithrombin. The endothelial glycocalyx plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, this component is highly vulnerable to damage and is also difficult to examine. Recent advances in analytical techniques have enabled biochemical, visual and computational investigation of this vascular component. The glycocalyx modulates leukocyte?endothelial interactions, thrombus formation and other processes that lead to microcirculatory dysfunction and critical organ injury in sepsis. It also acts as a regulator of vascular permeability and contains mechanosensors as well as receptors for growth factors and anticoagulants. During the initial onset of sepsis, the glycocalyx is damaged and circulating levels of glycocalyx components, including syndecans, heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid, can be measured and are reportedly useful as biomarkers for sepsis. Also, a new methodology using side-stream dark-field imaging is now clinically available for assessing the glycocalyx. Multiple factors including hypervolemia and hyperglycemia are toxic to the glycocalyx, and several agents have been proposed as therapeutic modalities, although no single treatment has been proven to be clinically effective. In this article, we review the derangement of the glycocalyx in sepsis. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the important roles of the glycocalyx, the relationship between derangement of the endothelial glycocalyx and severity of sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been adequately elucidated and further work is needed.

AB  - Summary Seven horses with headshaking are described. No physical abnormalities were detected in any of the cases. Six of these horses had onset of clinical signs in the spring. The role of light was assessed by application of a blindfold or dark grey lens to the eyes, covering the eyes with a face mask and observing the horse in total darkness outdoors. Cessation of headshaking was observed with blindfolding (5/5 horses), night darkness outdoors (4/4 horses) and use of grey lenses (2/3 horses). Outdoor behaviour suggested efforts to avoid light in 4/4 cases. The photic sneeze in man is suggested as a putative mechanism for equine headshaking. Five of 7 horses had improvement with cyproheptadine treatment (0.3 mg/kg bwt b.i.d.). Headshaking developed within 2 calendar weeks of the same date for 3 consecutive years in one horse. Neuropharmacological alterations associated with photoperiod mechanisms leading to optic trigeminal summation are suggested as possible reasons for spring onset of headshaking.

AB  - Abstract Lipotoxicity involves a series of pathological cellular responses after exposure to elevated levels of fatty acids. This process may be detrimental to normal cellular homeostasis and cell viability. The present study shows that nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (NGFDPC12) and rat cortical cells (RCC) exposed to high levels of palmitic acid (PA) exhibit significant lipotoxicity and death linked to an ?augmented state of cellular oxidative stress? (ASCOS). The ASCOS response includes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and increase in the mRNA levels of key cell death/survival regulatory genes. The observed cell death was apoptotic based on nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of lamin B and PARP. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements showed that cells undergoing lipotoxicity exhibited an increase in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the cell death-associated proteins BNIP3 and FAS receptor. Cotreatment of NGFDPC12 and RCC cells undergoing lipotoxicity with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly reduced cell death within the first 2 hr following the initial exposure to PA. The data suggest that lipotoxicity in NGFDPC12 and cortical neurons triggers a strong cell death apoptotic response. Results with NGFDPC12 cells suggest a linkage between induction of ASCOS and the apoptotic process and exhibit a temporal window that is sensitive to DHA and BSA interventions. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
