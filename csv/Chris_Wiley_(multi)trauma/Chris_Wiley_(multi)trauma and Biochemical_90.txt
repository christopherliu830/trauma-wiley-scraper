AB  - Abstract Biologics are playing an increasingly significant role in the practice of modern medicine and surgery in general and orthopedics in particular. Cell-based approaches are among the most important and widely used modalities in orthopedic biologics, with mesenchymal stem cells and other multi/pluripotent cells undergoing evaluation in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. On the other hand, fully differentiated endothelial cells (ECs) have been found to perform critical roles in homeostasis of visceral tissues through production of an adaptive panel of so-called ?angiocrine factors.? This newly discovered function of ECs renders them excellent candidates for novel approaches in cell-based biologics. Here, we present a review of the role of ECs and angiocrine factors in some visceral tissues, followed by an overview of current cell-based approaches and a discussion of the potential applications of ECs in soft tissue repair.

AB  - Abstract Lipotoxicity involves a series of pathological cellular responses after exposure to elevated levels of fatty acids. This process may be detrimental to normal cellular homeostasis and cell viability. The present study shows that nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (NGFDPC12) and rat cortical cells (RCC) exposed to high levels of palmitic acid (PA) exhibit significant lipotoxicity and death linked to an ?augmented state of cellular oxidative stress? (ASCOS). The ASCOS response includes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and increase in the mRNA levels of key cell death/survival regulatory genes. The observed cell death was apoptotic based on nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of lamin B and PARP. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements showed that cells undergoing lipotoxicity exhibited an increase in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the cell death-associated proteins BNIP3 and FAS receptor. Cotreatment of NGFDPC12 and RCC cells undergoing lipotoxicity with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly reduced cell death within the first 2 hr following the initial exposure to PA. The data suggest that lipotoxicity in NGFDPC12 and cortical neurons triggers a strong cell death apoptotic response. Results with NGFDPC12 cells suggest a linkage between induction of ASCOS and the apoptotic process and exhibit a temporal window that is sensitive to DHA and BSA interventions. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HOF) is a fibrotic enlargement of the gingiva. HGF gingiva contains large amounts of interstitial collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Increased proliferation and elevated production of the ECM molecules type I collagen and fibronectin (FN) could contribute to the clinical increased bulk of HGF gingiva. Fibroblast-strains from HGF gingiva and normal human gingival fibroblast strains (GN) were used in this in vitro study. Fibroblast proliferation was determined by ELISA which measured the incorporation of 5-bromo-2?-deoxyuridine into DNA. The results showed that HGF fibroblast strains proliferated more rapidly than GN fibroblasts (68% to 488% increase, depending on the strains) (P ≥ 0.01), the only exception being one HGF strain versus one normal strain. All HGF strains produced greater amounts of FN (measured by ELISA) than all of the normal fibroblast strains (23% to 49% increase, depending on the strain) (P ≤ 0.04). Similarly, all HGF strains made significantly greater (P ≤ 0.03) amounts of type I collagen (also measured by ELISA) than all of the normal strains (55% to 235% increase, depending on the strain). The results show that, in vitro, HGF fibroblasts display several phenotypic characteristics of activated fibroblasts: increased proliferative rates as well as increased production of FN and type I collagen, consistent with in vitro studies of fibroblasts derived from other types of fibrotic tissue. These results suggest that the increased proliferation of HGF fibroblasts and their increased production of extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen and FN may contribute to the clinical gingival enlargement characteristic of HGF.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - Objectives To perform a preliminary study to assess whether single-agent palliative or adjuvant chemotherapy has an impact on objectively measured physical activity in dogs. Methods Fifteen dogs with neoplasia (treatment group) wore ActiGraph? accelerometers for 5-day periods before, during and after receiving single-agent adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy. Mean 5-day total physical activity and time spent in three different intensities of activity (sedentary, light-moderate and vigorous) before, during and after receiving chemotherapy were compared to a group of 15 healthy dogs (control group). Results were also compared within the treatment group across time. Results Prior to chemotherapy, treated dogs tended to be less active than control dogs. Treatment group dogs were slightly more active at restaging than they were prior to treatment but had similar activity levels to control dogs. Marked effects of chemotherapy on physical activity were not detected. Physical activity was slightly lower in treated dogs during chemotherapy when compared to control dogs but there was a slight increase in physical activity of treated dogs during chemotherapy when compared with pretreatment recordings. There was little change in the mean 5-day total physical activity between treated dogs during chemotherapy and at restaging but a mild decrease in time spent sedentary and increase in time spent in light-moderate activity at this comparison of time points. Clinical Significance Single-agent adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy had minimal impact on physical activity levels in dogs with neoplasia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To estimate prevalence and risk factors for diagnosis with hyperadrenocorticism in dogs attending primary-care veterinary practices in the UK from 2009 to 2014. METHODS Cases were identified by searching the de-identified electronic patient records from UK primary-care veterinary practices participating in the VetCompass Programme. RESULTS The estimated prevalence for hyperadrenocorticism diagnosis in dogs was 0·28% (95% confidence interval: 0·25 to 0·31). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed four associated risk factors: breed, breed-relative bodyweight, age and insurance status. The bichon frise had 6·5 times the odds (95% CI: 3·5 to 12·1, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with crossbreds. Dogs weighing more than or equal to their breed mean had 1·7 times the odds (95% CI: 1·3 to 2·3, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with dogs weighing less than the breed mean. Dogs aged 12·0 years and above showed 5·7 times the odds (95% CI: 3·7 to 8·7, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with dogs aged 6·0 to 8·9 years. Insured dogs had 4·0 times the odds (95% CI: 2·8 to 5·6, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with non-insured dogs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This is the first epidemiological report of a non-referral hospital population of dogs diagnosed with hyperadrenocorticism in the UK and describes important breed, age and bodyweight associations with this disorder which may improve diagnosis and enhance understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the neurologic deficits associated with profound hyponatremia in 2 critically ill foals. Series summary: A 4-month-old Thoroughbred colt and an 11-day-old Paint filly presented for acute diarrhea and depression. Severe neurologic deficits including blindness and head pressing were noted upon initial examination along with marked hyponatremia observed on biochemistry profile. Aggressive intravenous sodium replacement increased the serum sodium concentration to subnormal values with concurrent resolution of neurologic deficits. Intensive monitoring and fluid therapy were continued; the Thoroughbred colt was euthanized due to lack of response to the primary disease while the Paint filly was discharged clinically healthy without further complications. New or unique information provided: Mild hyponatremia (122?132?mEq/L) is a common clinicopathologic finding in equine medicine associated with a variety of diseases. The vast majority of horses with mild hyponatremia do not demonstrate direct clinical manifestations as a result of low serum sodium concentration. However, when severe acute hyponatremia occurs (<122?mEq/L), such as with acute enterocolitis, subtle to profound neurologic deficits may be observed and immediate and rapid treatment as well as serial evaluations of serum sodium concentration are warranted. Significant, and potentially permanent, neurologic deficits can occur if water balance and tonicity are not properly addressed. The cases presented here describe additional cases of a previously published disease in foals, acute hyponatremia and associated neurologic deficits, and describe the microscopic examination of the central nervous system in one foal that did not survive.

AB  - Background It is now generally accepted that the response to a particular signal, such as the surgical trauma following implant placement, is not the result of a single linear signalling pathway, but rather reflects pathway integration, which can occur at multiple levels. Although it is well documented that both SLA and SLActive surfaces are able to promote bone formation and osseointegration, it is still unclear which are the key signalling pathways involved and how surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity might affect pathway integration. Objective To combine gene and protein data from in vivo studies applying titanium hydrophobic (Sandblasting, Large-grit, Acid-etching, SLA) and hydrophilic (SLActive) surfaces to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pro-osteogenic properties of these surfaces. Methods The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG?) pathway database and the Ingenuity? Pathway Analysis (IPA?) software were applied to the genomic and proteomic data of previous in vivo studies applying SLA and SLActive surfaces, with the specific aim to focus on bone formation-related signalling pathways. While gene data were derived from a human study on osseointegration, protein data originated from a preclinical study in rabbits. Data were available for the 4, 7 and 14 days of healing periods. Results Both genomic and proteomic data showed that the osteogenesis process takes place mainly at 7 and 14 days of healing on both SLA and SLActive surfaces. Surface hydrophilicity enhances bone formation at multiple levels, by directly promoting an earlier expression of pathways involved in cell proliferation and osteoblast precursor differentiation (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide-3 kinase-AKT, Wnt, Notch, transforming growth factor-?), but also by positively regulating angiogenesis, bone mineralization and bone remodelling. Conclusion This study combined, for the first time, different ?omics? outputs to get new insights on the molecular mechanisms behind the influence of surface hydrophilicity on osseointegration/bone formation. Specific signalling pathways, such as Wnt, vascular endothelial growth factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase, were identified as differentially modulated by titanium surface hydrophilicity both at a genomic and proteomic level. These findings may be used in the future to monitor/predict the bone formation/osseointegration process, or as a screening tool towards the manufacture of new pro-osteogenic implant surfaces. In order to take into account the full complexity and interplay of cell signalling during bone formation, powerful bioinformatics tools integrating different ?omics? data and predicting signalling pathways trends should be applied by future studies.

AB  - Abstract The experiences in the production and application of polymethacrylate-based monolithic supports, since their development almost thirty years ago, are presented. The main driving force for the development of new chromatographic supports was the necessity for the isolation and separation of physiologically active biopolymers and their use for therapeutic purposes. For this sake, a development of a method for fast separation, preventing denaturation and preserving their biological activity was necessary. Development of polysaccharide-based supports, followed by the introduction of polymer-based chromatographic media, is shortly described. This development was followed by the advances in monolithic media that are now used for both large- and small-scale separation of biopolymers and nanoparticles. Finally, a short overview is given about the applications of monoliths for sample displacement chromatography, resulting in isolation of physiologically active biomolecules, such as proteins, protein complexes, and nucleic acid, as well as high-throughput sample preparation for proteomic investigations.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Equine grass sickness (EGS) remains a frequently fatal disease of equids in Great Britain (GB). The first nationwide surveillance scheme for EGS was developed to obtain information on the occurrence of EGS and to help facilitate future proposed intervention studies, such as vaccine trials. Objectives: To collect both retrospective and prospective data on cases of EGS occurring in GB since 2000 and to assess potential risk factors for categories of EGS and survival after chronic EGS. Methods: Prospective data were collected using a nationwide surveillance scheme for EGS that was developed and initiated in 2007. Data were collected by means of postal and online questionnaires documenting both retrospective premises-level and prospective case-level information. Data on outcomes of EGS category and survival after chronic grass sickness (CGS) were analysed using univariable logistic regression. Results: Descriptive data for 1410 EGS cases occurring in GB in the decade between the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2009 are presented. Univariable logistic regression analyses identified that CGS cases in Scotland were significantly more likely to survive than those occurring elsewhere in GB. There was no relationship between case details and the category of EGS or the outcome among CGS cases. Conclusions: EGS affected equids throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Although an overall average of 141 cases were reported to the nationwide surveillance scheme annually, this number of cases was not consistent between years. Around 50% of CGS cases survived, although regional differences in survival rates existed, probably due to variation in expertise of care and/or disease severity. Potential relevance: This study provides information on the spatiotemporal occurrence of EGS in GB during the last decade. Data from the nationwide surveillance scheme can be used in developing protocols for future intervention studies such as Clostridium botulinum vaccine trials.

AB  - Aim To describe prospective application of an implementation framework to guide and evaluate a quality improvement (QI) project to improve adherence to evidence-based postoperative diet guidelines (consistent with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, ERAS) in older surgical patients. Methods A hybrid mixed methods study guided by the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework was used. A pre-implementation audit identified gaps in nutrition-related care practices against ERAS guidelines for older surgical patients. Qualitative interviews explored barriers to practice change, informing development of the facilitated implementation strategy. Iterative facilitation interventions were identified by field notes and classified using i-PARIHS facilitator's tool-kit. Post-implementation audit measured implementation outcomes, and clinical processes and outcomes using controlled before?after comparative study. Results Implementation involved 17 discrete facilitation activities. Early postoperative diet upgrade was acceptable, well adopted (79%) and appropriate for 89% of patients. Fidelity (i.e. protocol delivered as intended) was 59%, with loss of fidelity primarily because of incorrect diet codes. Clinical processes and outcome evaluation (n?=?155) compared data pre-implementation (intervention: n?=?45, control: n?=?27; mean age 73 (SD 6) years, 60% male) and post-implementation (intervention: n?=?47, control: n?=?36; mean age 74 (SD 6) years, 57% male). Patients on the intervention ward had higher odds of receiving early nutrition post-implementation (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI]: 6.5 [1.9?22.4], P?=?0.01). Conclusions Prospective application of an implementation framework supported planning and successful implementation in this QI project. Multi-level evaluation of facilitation strategies, implementation outcomes, and clinical processes and outcomes helps to understand areas of success and continuing challenges.

AB  - Abstract We report a case of a profoundly hypothermic newborn with a core temperature of 25°C with a successful recovery and normal neurological outcome at 3 and 6 months. This term male infant had been exposed to a temperature of ?3°C for approximately 30 min. Slow re-warming, using external modalities was used in addition to volume expansion, heparinization, antibiotics and sedation. There is limited information available concerning the safest and most effective method of re-warming hypothermic newborns. Slow re-warming has been advocated as it replicates the normal physiological process in a neonate, which minimizes a negative therapy impact. Conclusion: The most significant decision regarding treatment is the identification of the most appropriate method and speed of re-warming. This report supports recommendations for gradual re-warming of a severely hypothermic newborn. Physiological cardiovascular mechanisms seemed to be intact during slow re-warming; this might be applicable to the treatment of profound hypothermia of the newborn.

AB  - SUMMARY Electron microscopy reveals that the multicellular hairs, in the Anabaena-containing leaf cavities of Azolla, produce labyrinthine wall ingrowths, and have dense cytoplasm with numerous mitochondria and abundant endoplasmic reticulum. Development of transfer cell morphology, in this location, might be an adaptation facilitating interchange of metabolites between Azolla and its algal partner. Equally prominent wall ingrowths are also found in the absence of Anabaena. It is suggested that they may be either a constitutive feature of Azolla or may be induced as a response to the presence of combined nitrogen sources in the axenic culture medium. The occurrence of plasmalemmasomes, in the developing hair-cells of Azolla, is compared with their presence in lichens, mycorrhiza and at host-parasite interfaces.

AB  - Abstract Metabolite control of glutamine synthetase expression (by glutamine) was studied in L6 skeletal muscle cells. Depletion of glutamine from the culture medium for 24 hours resulted in a 3?4-fold increase in glutamine synthetase activity. This effect was blocked by cycloheximide but not by actinomycin D. Addition of glutamine to L6 cells maintained in glutamine-free medium caused a rapid return of glutamine synthetase activity to the control level. As reported, dexamethasone caused a striking increase in the glutamine synthetase mRNA level. In contrast, neither depletion nor addition of glutamine caused a change in the glutamine synthetase mRNA level. Therefore, regulation of glutamine synthetase by glutamine is exerted at a post-transcriptional level.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate the chemopreventive efficacy and anti-lipid peroxidative potential of Jasminum grandiflorum Linn. on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary carcinogenesis. Mammary tumors were developed by a single subcutaneous injection of 25?mg DMBA in 1?mL emulsion of sunflower oil and physiological saline. The tumor incidence and tumor volume that formed in the breast were determined. Oral administration of ethanolic extract of J. grandiflorum flowers (JgEt) at a dose of 300?mg/kg body weight for 14?weeks to DMBA-injected animals completely prevented the formation of tumors in the pre-initiation period. JgEt also exerted significant anti-lipid peroxidative effect and improved the antioxidant defense system in DMBA-treated rats. The results of this study clearly indicate that JgEt has potent chemopreventive efficacy in experimental mammary carcinogenesis and further studies are warranted to isolate and characterize the bioactive principle from JgEt.

AB  - Abstract? The association of pancreatic disorders with fat necrosis in domestic animals is rare. This report concerns a case of cutaneous/subcutaneous necrotizing panniculitis and steatitis associated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an 11-year-old male Siamese cat. Clinical investigation revealed variably sized nodules on the trunk, limbs and abdomen. Some of them were ulcerated; others showed a shiny yellow necrotic background featuring irregular sinus tracts. The cat was euthanized at the owner's request before a diagnosis could be made. At necropsy, abundant oily material resembling mustard replaced the subcutaneous tissue and small yellow nodules were disseminated in the omentum, mesentery and serosa of the abdomen. A multilobulated mass arising from the anterior pancreatic head was found along with liver and lymph node metastasis. Histopathology showed wide fistulous tracts draining necrotic fat from the subcutis toward the surface and multifocal areas of necrotic adipocytes replacing the panniculus. Duct-like structures and tubules lined by neoplastic epithelial cells were observed in the primary pancreatic tumour and in the metastatic sites. The aetiology of the fat necrosis was possibly the result of systemic release of lipolytic pancreatic enzymes.

AB  - Various factors are associated with foot ulceration, including delayed reporting of ulcers, poor glycemic control, and severity of neuropathy. Several studies have looked at the role of nitric oxide in wound healing. However, no studies have examined its role in the occurrence and recurrence of diabetic foot ulceration. In a cross-sectional study we examined the role of neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and plasma nitric oxide (estimated from plasma nitrite and nitrate) levels in diabetic patients with recurrent and non-recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers. Patients with recurrent foot ulcers had higher vibration perception threshold values compared to patients with non-recurrent foot ulcers (47.4 ± 5.7 volts versus 39.5 ± 10.3 volts respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, subjects with recurrent foot ulcers had significantly higher plasma nitric oxide compared to subjects with non-recurrent foot ulcers (46.9 ± 6.3 ?m/L versus 30.2 ± 2.4 ?m/L respectively, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, presence of retinopathy and nephropathy, vibration perception threshold, plasma creatinine, and total nitric oxide, indicated that only vibration perception threshold was independently associated with the presence of an ulcer [odds ratio: 1.26 (1.10-1.46); P <0.001)] and the recurrence of foot ulcers [odds ratio: 1.13 (1.01-1.27); P=0.04)]. This study has shown that although plasma nitric oxide is higher in patients with recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers, severity of neuropathy was the most important factor associated with the development and recurrence of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.

AB  - Abstract This study is an analysis of psychiatrists' (N = 339) attitudes with regard to the etiology of schizophrenia. A random sample of members of the American Psychiatric Association reveals a strong endorsement of a combined biogenic/environmental perspective. Attitudes are analyzed further with regard to variation by school of thought, years in practice, and treatment setting. Findings are compared with an earlier study to plot shifts in opinions among psychiatrists over time.

AB  - Personalized medicine is rapidly becoming a reality in today's physical medicine. However, as yet this is largely an aspirational goal in psychiatry, despite significant advances in our understanding of the biochemical, genetic and neurobiological processes underlying major mental disorders. Preventive medicine relies on the availability of predictive tools; in psychiatry we still largely lack these. Furthermore, our current diagnostic systems, with their focus on well-established, largely chronic illness, do not support a pre-emptive, let alone a preventive, approach, since it is during the early stages of a disorder that interventions have the potential to offer the greatest benefit. Here, we present a clinical staging model for severe mental disorders and discuss examples of biological markers that have already undergone some systematic evaluation and that could be integrated into such a framework. The advantage of this model is that it explicitly considers the evolution of psychopathology during the development of a mental illness and emphasizes that progression of illness is by no means inevitable, but can be altered by providing appropriate interventions that target individual modifiable risk and protective factors. The specific goals of therapeutic intervention are therefore broadened to include the prevention of illness onset or progression, and to minimize the risk of harm associated with more complex treatment regimens. The staging model also facilitates the integration of new data on the biological, social and environmental factors that influence mental illness into our clinical and diagnostic infrastructure, which will provide a major step forward in the development of a truly pre-emptive psychiatry.
