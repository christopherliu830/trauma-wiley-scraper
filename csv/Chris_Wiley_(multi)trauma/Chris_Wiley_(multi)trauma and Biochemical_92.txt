AB  - Background: The neuroendocrine response following major surgery has not been previously influenced by either regional anaesthetic techniques or opioid analgesia probably due to insufficient intraoperative afferent neural blockade. In this study we attempted to determine whether significant inhibition of these pathways could be achieved by combining preoperative high spinal anaesthesia with postoperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia. In theory too, there may be additional benefits over perioperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia on pain and pulmonary dysfunction. Methods: 20 ASA 1?3 patients undergoing elective colonic surgery were studied. Gp 1 (n=10) received a high spinal intraoperative block to T4 using 6mls of 0.5% bupivacaine plus continuous epidural 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. Gp 2 (n=10) patients received epidural 0.5% bupivacaine block to T4 plus continuous epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. We measured a) plasma glucose and Cortisol at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 h; b) forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and peak flow rate (PFR) preoperatively, at 8 and 24 h; c) visual analogue pain scores (VAS 0?10) at rest, cough and mobilisation at 8 and 24 h; d) block height every hour for 12 hours then 3 hourly; e) 24-hour urine volumes for dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline f) 24-hour PCA morphine requirements. Results: The two groups did not differ in age, sex, height, weight, duration of surgery, blood loss or serum albumin. Pain relief was excellent and similar in both groups. The average 24 hour morphine consumption was 10 mg in both groups with no differences in the block height. All the patients had a 30?50% reduction in FEV1, FVC and PFR (P>0.05). Metabolically, there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups except a higher rise in glucose in Gpl at 2 and 3 h (P=0.0312 and 0.014). 24-hour catecholamine studies showed no differences for noradrenaline (P=0.8), adrenaline (P=0.47) and dopamine (P=0.36). Conclusions: Thoracic epidural bupivacaine/diamorphine infusion provided excellent postoperative analgesia following colonic surgery. An intraoperative combined spinal/epidural technique conferred no additional benefit on analgesia, pulmonary function and the neuroendocrine response.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the causes of cardiac tamponade in children undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Method Patients who presented with other complaints but were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade based on clinical and echocardiographic findings between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Electrocardiography, telecardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Pericardiocentesis was performed percutaneously under continuous blood pressure and rhythm monitoring with echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Pericardial fluid was analyzed on hemography and biochemistry. Results Fourteen patients (six boys, eight girls; median age, 7 years) underwent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. At presentation, 78% had dyspnea, 56% chest pain, and 49% fever. All had cardiomegaly, and their cardiothoracic index was 0.56?0.72. Also, all patients had sinus tachycardia; 78%, low QRS voltage; 70%, ST-T changes; and 50% QRS alternans. On echocardiography the widest diameter of pericardial effusion was between 12?mm and 36?mm depth around the heart. The pericardial fluid was purulent in one, serohemorrhagic in seven, serofibrinous in two, and serous in four cases. Pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful in two patients, who underwent open surgical drainage, with no complications. Based on pericardial fluid characteristics and additional tests, cardiac tamponade was caused by an infection in five patients, hypothyroidism in two, familial Mediterranean fever in two, malignancy in one, acute rheumatic fever in one, collagen tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) in one, catheter placement-associated damage in one, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in one patient. Conclusion Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in children have varied causes, and early treatment is life saving.

AB  - Objectives ?? Endovascular reperfusion therapy in acute ischaemic stroke comprises a number of pharmacological and mechanical procedures. Mechanical embolectomy offers the promise of efficacious treatment for patients in whom pharmacological thrombolysis is contraindicated or might be ineffective. The purpose of this review is to outline endovascular reperfusion therapy in acute ischaemic stroke with focus on mechanical embolectomy. Materials & methods ?? Data on endovascular reperfusion therapy were acquired through searches in MEDLINE 1990?2006 by cross referencing relevant key words. Results ?? Mechanical embolectomy works well on large-volume proximal occlusions for which there was previously no effective treatment. Early safety trials are promising, efficacy in terms of recanalisation is substantial, and both safety and efficacy is expected to improve with further advances in technology. Conclusions ?? Intravenous thrombolysis with tPA revolutionised acute stroke treatment a decade ago. Endovascular reperfusion therapy now offers the promise of a second revolution, expanding the number of patients eligible and the time window open for specific stroke treatment.

Conclusions and outlook?670 ?Acknowledgements?671 ?References?671 Summary Insects select their hosts, but trees cannot select which herbivores will feed upon them. Thus, as long-lived stationary organisms, conifers must resist the onslaught of varying and multiple attackers over their lifetime. Arguably, the greatest threats to conifers are herbivorous insects and their associated pathogens. Insects such as bark beetles, stem- and wood-boring insects, shoot-feeding weevils, and foliage-feeding budworms and sawflies are among the most devastating pests of conifer forests. Conifer trees produce a great diversity of compounds, such as an enormous array of terpenoids and phenolics, that may impart resistance to a variety of herbivores and microorganisms. Insects have evolved to specialize in resistance to these chemicals ? choosing, feeding upon, and colonizing hosts they perceive to be best suited to reproduction. This review focuses on the plant?insect interactions mediated by conifer-produced terpenoids. To understand the role of terpenoids in conifer?insect interactions, we must understand how conifers produce the wide diversity of terpenoids, as well as understand how these specific compounds affect insect behaviour and physiology. This review examines what chemicals are produced, the genes and proteins involved in their biosynthesis, how they work, and how they are regulated. It also examines how insects and their associated pathogens interact with, elicit, and are affected by conifer-produced terpenoids.

AB  - Abstract Background A fragmented research field exists on the prevalence of anxiety disorders. Here, we present the results of a systematic review of reviews on this topic. We included the highest quality studies to inform practice and policy on this issue. Method Using PRISMA methodology, extensive electronic and manual citation searches were performed to identify relevant reviews. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by two reviewers. Inclusion criteria consisted of systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the prevalence of anxiety disorders that fulfilled at least half of the AMSTAR quality criteria. Results We identified a total of 48 reviews and described the prevalence of anxiety across population subgroups and settings, as reported by these studies. Despite the high heterogeneity of prevalence estimates across primary studies, there was emerging and compelling evidence of substantial prevalence of anxiety disorders generally (3.8?25%), and particularly in women (5.2?8.7%); young adults (2.5?9.1%); people with chronic diseases (1.4?70%); and individuals from Euro/Anglo cultures (3.8?10.4%) versus individuals from Indo/Asian (2.8%), African (4.4%), Central/Eastern European (3.2%), North African/Middle Eastern (4.9%), and Ibero/Latin cultures (6.2%). Conclusions The prevalence of anxiety disorders is high in population subgroups across the globe. Recent research has expanded its focus to Asian countries, an increasingly greater number of physical and psychiatric conditions, and traumatic events associated with anxiety. Further research on illness trajectories and anxiety levels pre- and post-treatment is needed. Few studies have been conducted in developing and under-developed parts of the world and have little representation in the global literature.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

Kalaria (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 94?113?Molecular genetics and pathology of hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of several monogenic conditions involving small vessels predisposing to ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and diffuse white matter disease. With emphasis on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we review the molecular pathogenesis of recently characterized disorders including cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) and the Collagen type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1)-related disorders. CADASIL remains the most common hereditary small vessel disease (SVD) caused by >190 different mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a cell-signalling receptor. Mutant NOTCH3 instigates degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles leading to recurrent lacunar infarcts. Mutations in the serine protease HTRA1 gene are associated with CARASIL. Aberrant HTRA1 activity results in increased transforming growth factor-? signalling provoking multiple actions including vascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix synthesis. The RVCL disorders characterized by profound retinopathy are associated with mutations in TREX1, which encodes an abundant 3??5? DNA-specific exonuclease. TREX1 mutations lead to detrimental gain-of-function or insufficient quantities of enzyme. The COL4A1-related disorders are highly variable comprising four major phenotypes with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including SVD with cerebral haemorrhages in children and adults. Mutant COL4A1 likely disrupts the extracellular matrix resulting in fragile vessel walls. The hereditary SVDs albeit with variable phenotypes demonstrate how effects of different defective genes converge to produce the characteristic arteriopathy and microvascular disintegration leading to vascular cognitive impairment.

Abstract ATP is a widespread and multipurpose signalling molecule copiously released in the extracellular environment of the whole nervous system upon cell activation, stress, or damage. Extracellular ATP is also a multidirectional information molecule, given the concurrent presence at the plasma membrane of various targets for ATP. These include ectonucleotidases (metabolizing ATP down to adenosine), ATP/adenosine transporters, P2 receptors for purine/pyrimidine nucleotides (ligand-gated ion channels P2X receptors and G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors), in addition to metabotropic P1 receptors for nucleosides. All these targets rarely operate as single units, rather they associate with each other at the plasma membrane as multi-protein complexes. Altogether, they control the duration, magnitude and/or direction of the signals triggered and propagated by purine/pyrimidine ligands, and the impact that each single ligand has on a variety of short- and long-term functions. A strict control system allows assorted, even divergent, biological outcomes. Among these, we enumerate cell-to-cell communication, tropic, trophic, but also noxious actions causing the insurgence/progression of pathological conditions. Here, we show that purinergic signalling in the nervous system can be instrumental for instance to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the recent human and veterinary literature on current adrenergic receptor physiology/pathophysiology and potential applications in veterinary critical care. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical studies, reviews, texts, and recent research in receptor molecular biology. Human data synthesis: Recent development of molecular cloning and other biological research techniques has advanced the field of adrenergic physiology. The past decade of research has made available new knowledge of adrenergic receptor subtypes as well as their locations and functions. Many of the diagnostic compounds used in biochemical research to distinguish between α- and ?-receptor subtypes may emerge as important additions to the arsenal of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals. Veterinary data synthesis: Veterinary adrenoceptor research is typically directed at investigating the effects of commercially available medications. Such studies demonstrate important species differences in addition to potential side effects and new indications for therapy. Many of the human molecular biology studies are performed on animal species, which can have direct application to veterinary medicine. Conclusions: Proper cardiovascular responses are essential to maintaining tissue perfusion and cellular homeostasis. α- and ?-adrenergic receptors play a vital role not only in the pathophysiology but also in the therapy of diseases involving the cardiovascular system. For adrenergic pharmacotherapy to be successfully used, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying adrenoceptor physiology is necessary. Recent research has illuminated various subsets within the α- and ?-receptor classifications. Awareness of currently available and emerging adrenoceptor subtype-specific treatment options allows precise pharmacologic targeting of disease processes in critical illness.

AB  - Abstract Apoptosis is the genetically mediated process whereby individual cells determine their deletion from normal and diseased tissues. Deregulation of apoptosis occurs to a greater or lesser extent in malignant tumours and in certain skin diseases, and also largely accounts for the progressive depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes in HIV infection. Greater understanding of apoptosis modulation by oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes such as c-myc. Fas, p53, bcl-2, and abl will facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer and other diseases.

Methods Patients were identified from four large US claims databases using broad (all T2DM patients) and narrow (intended to exclude patients with type 1 diabetes or secondary diabetes misclassified as T2DM) definitions of T2DM. New users of SGLT2i and seven groups of comparator AHAs were matched (1:1) on exposure propensity scores to adjust for imbalances in baseline covariates. Cox proportional hazards regression models, conditioned on propensity score-matched pairs, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of DKA for new users of SGLT2i versus other AHAs. When I2 <40%, a combined HR across the four databases was estimated. Results Using the broad definition of T2DM, new users of SGLT2i had an increased risk of DKA versus sulfonylureas (HR [95% CI]: 1.53 [1.31-1.79]), DPP-4i (1.28 [1.11-1.47]), GLP-1 receptor agonists (1.34 [1.12-1.60]), metformin (1.31 [1.11-1.54]), and insulinotropic AHAs (1.38 [1.15-1.66]). Using the narrow definition of T2DM, new users of SGLT2i had an increased risk of DKA versus sulfonylureas (1.43 [1.01-2.01]). New users of SGLT2i had a lower risk of DKA versus insulin and a similar risk as thiazolidinediones, regardless of T2DM definition. Conclusions Increased risk of DKA was observed for new users of SGLT2i versus several non-SGLT2i AHAs when T2DM was defined broadly. When T2DM was defined narrowly to exclude possible misclassified patients, an increased risk of DKA with SGLT2i was observed compared with sulfonylureas.

AB  - The specification of embryonic cells to produce the retina begins at early embryonic stages as a multi-step process that gradually restricts fate potentials. First, a subset of embryonic cells becomes competent to form retina by their lack of expression of endo-mesoderm-specifying genes. From these cells, a more restricted subset is biased to form retina by virtue of their close proximity to sources of bone morphogenetic protein antagonists during neural induction. During gastrulation, the definitive RSCs (retinal stem cells) are specified as the eye field by interactions with underlying mesoderm and the expression of a network of retina-specifying genes. As the eye field is transformed into the optic vesicle and optic cup, a heterogeneous population of RPCs (retinal progenitor cells) forms to give rise to the different domains of the retina: the optic stalk, retinal pigmented epithelium and neural retina. Further diversity of RPCs appears to occur under the influences of cell?cell interactions, cytokines and combinations of regulatory genes, leading to the differentiation of a multitude of different retinal cell types. This review examines what is known about each sequential step in retinal specification during normal vertebrate development, and how that knowledge will be important to understand how RSCs might be manipulated for regenerative therapies to treat retinal diseases.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This study was designed to investigate the role of apoptosis on liver IR injury and to determine the effects of roscovitine on this process. Materials and methods: Rat livers pretreated with roscovitine received 60?min right lobe ischemia followed by 4?h (n=8) and 24?h (n=8) reperfusion. Tissue injury was evaluated by serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, tissue malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase measurements and histological examination. Dead (apoptotic and necrotic) hepatocytes were determined by trypan blue dye and apoptosis was evaluated with M30 monoclonal antibody. Results: Administration of roscovitine significantly decreased both apoptotic and dead hepatocyte counts compared to controls (P<0.01). Liver transaminase levels were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-pretreated groups (P<0.05). In the groups evaluated 24?h after reperfusion, MPO levels (P<0.02) and leukocyte infiltration on histologic sections were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-administered group compared to its control. Conclusions: This study indicates that hepatocyte apoptosis may play a role in the development of IR injury of the liver. Administration of roscovitine may be beneficial in preventing this injury.

AB  - SUMMARY The best-known protein components of the plant cell wall have highly repetitive, proline-rich sequences. The use of recombinant DNA approaches has enabled complete sequences of these proteins to be determined and features of the expression of the corresponding genes to be examined. These results, coupled with the use of immunological techniques, have shown that proline-rich proteins are interesting probes to study developmental and defence processes in plants. In this review, the sequence and expression of different groups of proline-rich proteins in plants are presented. These groups include hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP) or extensins, proline-rich proteins (PRP) and glycine-rich proteins (GRP). The specific features of each group and the possible functions of these proteins are discussed, as well as the data available on the mechanisms controlling the expression of their corresponding genes.

AB  - Abstract Bradykinin (BK) represents a pro-inflammatory mediator that partakes in many inflammatory diseases. The mechanism of action of BK is thought to be primarily mediated by specific cell surface membrane B2 receptors (B2Rs). Some evidence has suggested, however, the existence of an intracellular/nuclear B2R population. Whether these receptors are functional and contribute to BK signaling remains to be determined. In this study, by mean of Western blotting, 3D-confocal microscopy, receptor autoradiography and radioligand binding analysis, we showed that plasma membrane and highly purified nuclei from isolated rat hepatocytes contain specific B2R that bind BK. The results depicting B2R nuclear expression in isolated nuclear organelles were reproduced in situ on hepatic sections by immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Functional tests on single nuclei, by means of confocal microscopy and the calcium-sensitive probe fluo-4AM, showed that BK induces concentration-dependent transitory mobilization of nucleoplasmic calcium; these responses were blocked by B2R antagonist HOE 140, not by the B1R antagonist R954 and, were also found in wild-type C57/Bl6 mice, but not in B2R-KO mice. In isolated nuclei, BK elicited activation/phosphorylation of Akt, acetylation of histone H3 and ensuing pro-inflammatory iNOS gene induction as determined by Western blot and RT-PCR. ChIP assay confirmed binding of acetylated-histone H3 complexes, but not B2R, to promoter region of iNOS gene suggesting that B2R-mediated gene expression is bridged with accessory downstream effectors. This study discloses a previously undescribed mechanism in BK-induced transcriptional events, via intracrine B2R-mediated signaling, occurring in rat autologous hepatic cells. J. Cell.

AB  - SUMMARY Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery (MOS) whereas hematinic deficiency can delay the recovery from postoperative anemia. Both conditions can, however, be corrected before elective procedures are undertaken. We therefore evaluated the prevalence of anemia and hematinic deficiencies in MOS patients. Demographic and laboratory data were gathered from all MOS patients from a single institution between January 2001 and December 2002. A total of 715 patients (483 women/232 men) entered the study. According to WHO criteria, the prevalence of anemia was 10.5% and increased with age, without gender-related differences. Preoperative hemoglobin was <?13?g/dL in 19.4% of patients, and the prevalence of hematinic deficiencies was 33% for iron, 12.3% for vitamin B12 and 3% for folate. In anemic patients, there were 30.8% with hematinic deficiency anemia (20% with iron-deficiency anemia), 30.8% with anemia of chronic disease and 38.4% with anemia of mixed or indeterminate cause. The prevalence of anemia, as well as of hematinic deficiencies, is high in MOS patients. Therefore, whenever possible, patients undergoing MOS should be assessed early enough to allow for proper investigation and treatment prior to the scheduled procedure.
