AB  - Abstract Bradykinin (BK) represents a pro-inflammatory mediator that partakes in many inflammatory diseases. The mechanism of action of BK is thought to be primarily mediated by specific cell surface membrane B2 receptors (B2Rs). Some evidence has suggested, however, the existence of an intracellular/nuclear B2R population. Whether these receptors are functional and contribute to BK signaling remains to be determined. In this study, by mean of Western blotting, 3D-confocal microscopy, receptor autoradiography and radioligand binding analysis, we showed that plasma membrane and highly purified nuclei from isolated rat hepatocytes contain specific B2R that bind BK. The results depicting B2R nuclear expression in isolated nuclear organelles were reproduced in situ on hepatic sections by immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Functional tests on single nuclei, by means of confocal microscopy and the calcium-sensitive probe fluo-4AM, showed that BK induces concentration-dependent transitory mobilization of nucleoplasmic calcium; these responses were blocked by B2R antagonist HOE 140, not by the B1R antagonist R954 and, were also found in wild-type C57/Bl6 mice, but not in B2R-KO mice. In isolated nuclei, BK elicited activation/phosphorylation of Akt, acetylation of histone H3 and ensuing pro-inflammatory iNOS gene induction as determined by Western blot and RT-PCR. ChIP assay confirmed binding of acetylated-histone H3 complexes, but not B2R, to promoter region of iNOS gene suggesting that B2R-mediated gene expression is bridged with accessory downstream effectors. This study discloses a previously undescribed mechanism in BK-induced transcriptional events, via intracrine B2R-mediated signaling, occurring in rat autologous hepatic cells. J. Cell.

AB  - Objective Cognitive enhancement resulting from nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation may be evidenced by increased efficiency of the auditory-frontal cortex network of auditory discrimination, which is impaired in schizophrenia, a cognitive disorder associated with excessive tobacco use. Investigating automatic (preattentive) detection of acoustic change with the mismatch negativity (MMN) brain event-related potential in response to nicotine in individuals with varying baseline levels of auditory discrimination may provide useful insight into the cholinergic regulation of this neural network and its potential amelioration with novel nicotinic agents. Methods Sixty healthy, non-smoking male volunteers were presented with an ?optimal? multi-feature MMN paradigm in a randomized, placebo controlled double-blind design with 6?mg of nicotine gum. Results Participants with low, medium, and high baseline amplitudes responded differently to nicotine (vs. placebo), and nicotine response was feature specific. Whereas MMN in individuals with high amplitudes was diminished by nicotine, MMN increased in those with low amplitudes. Nicotine effects were not shown in medium amplitude participants. Conclusions These findings provide preliminary support for the role of nicotinic neurotransmission in sensory memory processing of auditory change and suggest that nicotinic receptor modulation can both enhance and diminish change detection, depending on baseline MMN and its eliciting stimulus feature.

AB  - Abstract Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in mammalian cells through enzymic and non-enzymic mechanisms. Although some ROS production pathways are needed for specific physiological functions, excessive production is detrimental and is regarded as the basis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Among enzymes producing superoxide anions, NADPH oxidase is widespread in mammalian cells and is an important source of ROS in mediating physiological and pathological processes in the cardiovascular and the CNS. ROS production is linked to the alteration of intracellular calcium homeostasis, activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes, alteration of cytoskeletal proteins, and degradation of membrane glycerophospholipids. There is evolving evidence that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase regulate neuronal functions and degrade membrane phospholipids through activation of phospholipases A2 (PLA2). This review is intended to cover recent studies describing ROS generation from NADPH oxidase in the CNS and its downstream activation of PLA2, namely, the group IV cytosolic cPLA2 and the group II secretory sPLA2. A major focus is to elaborate the dual role of NADPH oxidase and PLA2 in mediating the oxidative and inflammatory responses in neurodegenerative diseases, including cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer?s disease. Elucidation of the signaling pathways linking NADPH oxidase with the multiple forms of PLA2 will be important in understanding the oxidative and degradative mechanisms that underline neuronal damage and glial activation and will facilitate development of therapeutic intervention for prevention and treatment of these and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the effects of intermittent hydrostatic pressure (IHP) on the chondrogenic differentiation of cartilage progenitor cells (CPCs) cultivated in alginate beads. CPCs were isolated from the knee joint cartilage of rabbits, and infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (FPSCs) and chondrocytes (CCs) were included as the control cell types. Cells embedded in alginate beads were treated with IHP at 5 Mpa and 0.5 Hz for 4 h/day for 1, 2, or 4 weeks. The cells' migratory and proliferative capacities were evaluated using the scratch and Live/Dead assays, respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, safranin O staining, and immunohistochemical staining were performed to determine the effects of IHP on the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to measure the expression of genes related to chondrogenesis. The scratch and Live/Dead assays revealed that IHP significantly promoted the migration and proliferation of FPSCs and CPCs to different extents. The staining experiments showed greater production of cartilage ECM components (glycosaminoglycans and collagen II) by cells exposed to IHP, and the gene expression analysis demonstrated that IHP stimulated the expression of chondrocyte-related genes. Importantly, these effects of IHP were more prominent in CPCs than in FPSCs and CCs. Considering all of our experimental results combined, we conclude that CPCs demonstrated a stronger chondrogenic differentiation capacity than the FPSCs and CCs under stimulation with IHP. Thus, the use of CPCs, combined with mechanical stimulation, may represent a valuable strategy for cartilage tissue engineering.

AB  - Summary This chapter illustrates the metabolic processes involved in the overall metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein including the catabolic processes to produce energy and urea and anabolic processes to form tissue protein and energy stores, glycogen and lipids. It considers the following amino acid disorders: phenylketonuria (PKU) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiencies, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), homocystinuria (HCU) and tyrosinaemia. For each condition, the prevalence, biochemistry, genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome and non dietetic treatment is described separately. All these amino acid conditions share the same principles of dietary management. Therefore, the dietary management for all conditions is considered in the chapter. A low protein diet is an essential part of the management of organic acidaemias (OAA), e.g. isovaleric acidaemia (IVA), glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1); and the urea cycle disorders (UCD). The chapter describes the provision of a low protein diet and acute management, common to these disorders.

AB  - Effect of pretreatment with intrathecal excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists on the development of pain behavior caused by plantar incision. (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) Anesthesiology 2000;93:489?496. This study examined the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluRs) on the development of pain behavior after plantar incision. Rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were anesthetized with halothane. Fifteen minutes before an incision was made, drug [40 nmol MK-801; 20 nmol NBQX; or 200 nmol [(+)-MCPG] or vehicle was injected intrathecally followed by an infusion of the same drug for 75 min. Withdrawal thresholds to calibrated von Frey filaments applied adjacent to the wound and response frequencies to a blunt mechanical stimulus applied directly to the wound were measured before incision and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after incision and then once daily for 6 days. Preincision treatments with antagonists against the NMDA (MK-801) and Group I and II metabotropic receptors [(+)-MCPG] did not inhibit the development of mechanical hyperalgesia caused by incision. Preincision treatment with the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX increased withdrawal thresholds at 1 and 2 h and on postoperative day 1 compared with the vehicle group; response frequencies were reduced 1 and 2 h after incision and on postoperative day 2 (P < 0.05). In an additional group, postincision treatment with NBQX was similar to preincision treatment. Conclude spinal NMDA and MGluR antagonists may not be useful for preventing postsurgical pain. Spinal non-NMDA receptor antagonists reduced pain behaviors, but a preventive effect using preincision treatment was not apparent. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The incisional model using rats was developed by Dr. Brennan and colleagues for the study of acute surgical pain. In a previous study, they showed that blockade of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors, but not blockade of NMDA receptors nor mGluR receptors reduces postincisional pain if administered after the incision is made. This study shows the same is true if the receptor antagonists are administered before the incision is made. However, the effect is not particularly marked and; therefore, pursuit of non-MNDA excitatory amino transmitter receptor blockers for the prevention of postincisional pain would not likely be fruitful. The results of the study do require us to rethink how postincisional pain differs from other experimental pains and the phenomena of ?wind-up? attributed to activation of the NMDA receptor. Worth keeping in mind is that incisional pain does not equal surgical pain, which may involve traumatic injury to nerves and produce a neuropath pain, which strongly indicates involvement of NMDA receptors.

Emerging instrument platforms based on lab-on-a-chip technology can confer perfomance advantages successfully exploited in electrophoresis and electrochromatography to affinity-based electrokinetic separations. This review surveys lab-on-a-chip diagnostic developments in affinity-based electokinetic separations for quantitation of proteins, integration of preparatory functions needed for subsequent analysis of diverse biological samples, and initial forays into multiplexed analyses. The technologies detailed here underpin new clinical and point-of-care diagnostic strategies. The techniques and devices promise to advance translation of until now laborabory-based sample preparation and analytical assays to near-patient settings.

AB  - Abstract The infrapatellar pad, a fibro-adipose tissue with peculiar microscopic and mechanical features, is gaining wide attention in the field of rheumatological research. The purpose of this descriptive review is to summarize the most recent published evidence on the anatomic, physiologic and biomechanical inter-relationship between the infrapatellar fat pad and the knee synovial membrane. As an extrasynovial tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad does not directly interact with the articular cartilage; based on its location in close contact with the synovial membrane, and due to the metabolic properties of adipose tissue, it may influence the behavior of the synovial membrane. In fact, considering evidence of macroscopic and microscopic anatomy, the infrapatellar fat pad is the site of insertion of the infrapatellar and medial synovial plicae. Also biochemically, there is much evidence highlighting the interaction among these two structures; in the case of inflammation, the mutual interplay is ascribable to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators stimulating the proliferation of inflammatory cells and promoting tissue modifications in both. All these assumptions could support the emerging idea that the infrapatellar fat pad and the synovial membrane may be considered a morpho-functional unit.

Eighty-six patients were randomised into study (47 patients) and control (39 patients) groups. No significant differences in demographics or pre-treatment ulcer data were calculated. Complete healing and mean healing time were 69·6% and 5·7?weeks, respectively, for the study group and 46·2% and 6·8 weeks, respectively, for the control group. The proportion of healed ulcers between the groups was statistically significant (P?=?0·0289), with odds of healing in the study group 2·7 times higher than in the control group. Kaplan?Meier survivorship analysis for time to complete healing at 12?weeks showed a significantly higher non healing rate (P?=?0·015) for the control group (53·9%) compared with the study group (30·4%). After adjusting for ulcer size at presentation, which was a statistically significant covariate (P?=?0·0194), a statistically significant difference in non healing rate between groups was calculated (P?=?0·0233), with odds of healing 2·0 times higher in the study versus control group. This study supports the use of single-application AM therapy as an effective treatment of diabetic, neuropathic ulcers.

AB  - Abstract As an endogenous neuroprotectant agent, adenosine is extensively distributed and is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS). Under physiological conditions, the concentration of adenosine is low intra- and extracellularly, but increases significantly in response to stress. The majority of adenosine functions are receptor-mediated, and primarily include the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R). Adenosine is currently widely used in the treatment of diseases of the CNS and the cardiovascular systems, and the mechanisms are related to the disease types, disease locations, and the adenosine receptors distribution in the CNS. For example, the main infarction sites of cerebral ischemia are cortex and striatum, which have high levels of A1 and A2A receptors. Cerebral ischemia is manifested with A1R decrease and A2AR increase, as well as reduction in the A1R-mediated inhibitory processes and enhancement of the A2AR-mediated excitatory process. Adenosine receptor dysfunction is also involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and epilepsy. Thus, the adenosine receptor balance theory is important for brain disease treatment. The concentration of adenosine can be increased by endogenous or exogenous pathways due to its short half-life and high inactivation properties. Therefore, we will discuss the function of adenosine and its receptors, adenosine formation, and metabolism, and its role for the treatment of CNS diseases (such as cerebral ischemia, AD, depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and sleep disorders). This article will provide a scientific basis for the development of novel adenosine derivatives through adenosine structure modification, which will lead to experimental applications.

AB  - Abstract Highly purified tonoplast and plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from microsomes of Arabidopsis thaliana by preparative free-flow electrophoresis. The most electronegative fractions were identified as tonoplast using nitrate-inhibited Mg2+-ATPase as enzyme marker. The least electronegative fractions were identified as plasma membrane using glucan-synthase II, UDPG: sterolglucosyl-transferase, and vanadate-inhibited Mg2+-ATPase as enzyme markers. Other membrane markers, latent inosine-5?-diphosphatase (Golgi), NADPH-cytochrome-c reductase (endoplasmic reticulum) and cytochrome-c oxidase (mitochondria) were recovered in the fractions intermediate between tonoplast and plasma membrane. Immunoblot analysis of membrane fractions by antibodies directed against tonoplast and plasma membrane proteins confirmed the nature and the purity of the isolated membranes. The cytoskeletal protein actin, which was also identified by immunoblotting, was found to be specifically attached to the plasma membrane vesicles. The structural and functional integrity of the isolated membranes from Arabidopsis thaliana is discussed in the light of results obtained for the location of receptors and enzymes, or for the determination of ligand binding activity.

AB  - Summary Some plant terpenes such as sterols and carotenes are part of primary metabolism and found essentially in all plants. However, the majority of the terpenes found in plants are classified as ?secondary? compounds, those chemicals whose synthesis has evolved in plants as a result of selection for increased fitness via better adaptation to the local ecological niche of each species. Thousands of such terpenes have been found in the plant kingdom, but each species is capable of synthesizing only a small fraction of this total. In plants, a family of terpene synthases (TPSs) is responsible for the synthesis of the various terpene molecules from two isomeric 5-carbon precursor ?building blocks?, leading to 5-carbon isoprene, 10-carbon monoterpenes, 15-carbon sesquiterpenes and 20-carbon diterpenes. The bryophyte Physcomitrella patens has a single TPS gene, copalyl synthase/kaurene synthase (CPS/KS), encoding a bifunctional enzyme producing ent-kaurene, which is a precursor of gibberellins. The genome of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii contains 18 TPS genes, and the genomes of some model angiosperms and gymnosperms contain 40?152 TPS genes, not all of them functional and most of the functional ones having lost activity in either the CPS- or KS-type domains. TPS genes are generally divided into seven clades, with some plant lineages having a majority of their TPS genes in one or two clades, indicating lineage-specific expansion of specific types of genes. Evolutionary plasticity is evident in the TPS family, with closely related enzymes differing in their product profiles, subcellular localization, or the in planta substrates they use.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - Abstract It is difficult to convey the accelerating rate and growing importance of mass spectrometry applications to human blood proteins and peptides. Mass spectrometry can rapidly detect and identify the ionizable peptides from the proteins in a simple mixture and reveal many of their post-translational modifications. However, blood is a complex mixture that may contain many proteins first expressed in cells and tissues. The complete analysis of blood proteins is a daunting task that will rely on a wide range of disciplines from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, electromagnetic instrumentation, mathematics and computation. Therefore the comprehensive discovery and analysis of blood proteins will rank among the great technical challenges and require the cumulative sum of many of mankind's scientific achievements together. A variety of methods have been used to fractionate, analyze and identify proteins from blood, each yielding a small piece of the whole and throwing the great size of the task into sharp relief. The approaches attempted to date clearly indicate that enumerating the proteins and peptides of blood can be accomplished. There is no doubt that the mass spectrometry of blood will be crucial to the discovery and analysis of proteins, enzyme activities, and post-translational processes that underlay the mechanisms of disease. At present both discovery and quantification of proteins from blood are commonly reaching sensitivities of ?1?ng/mL. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:685?732, 2011

AB  - Summary.? Muscle haematoma represents 10?25% of bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia. There is limited consensus on diagnostic or treatment strategies and little knowledge about the natural history of muscle haematoma and optimal treatment goals. The aim of this review was to perform a systematic description of the natural history of muscle haematoma in healthy athletes, focusing on diagnosis, classification and treatment options. Publications and educational textbooks on management of sports injuries were used as data source. Muscle haematomas occur following contusion, strain, or laceration and can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. Muscle haematoma may be inter- or intramuscular. In healthy athletes, the healing process takes 20?40?days. Optimal diagnosis includes history, physical examination (inspection, palpation, active and passive range of motion (ROM) test, muscle length test, isometric strength test, biomechanical examination, full spinal examination, peripheral nerve test and slump test), ultrasound, MRI or CT. Treatment is conducted based on: (i) super-acute stage, control of the bleeding and minimizing the size of the haematoma; (ii) acute stage, restoration of pain-free ROM; (iii) subacute stage, functional rehabilitation; and (iv) gradual return to normal activity. Treatment and preventive strategies include RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation), protected mobilization, stretching and strengthening exercises, manual therapy (articular, neural and soft tissue mobilization and massage), correction of movement dysfunction, functional rehabilitation and electro-therapeutic interventions. The study reviews the natural history of muscle haematoma and state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment in healthy athletes. Results may be useful to optimize diagnosis and treatment of muscle haematoma in patients with haemophilia.
