Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and p38 ?? Concluding remarks Post-natal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle is highly dependent on a population of resident myogenic precursors known as satellite cells. Transcription factors from the Pax gene family, Pax3 and Pax7, are critical for satellite cell biogenesis, survival and potentially self-renewal; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unsolved. This is particularly true in the case of Pax7, which appears to regulate myogenesis at multiple levels. Accordingly, recent data have highlighted the importance of a functional relationship between Pax7 and the MyoD family of muscle regulatory transcription factors during normal muscle formation and disease. Here we will critically review key findings suggesting that Pax7 may play a dual role by promoting resident muscle progenitors to commit to the skeletal muscle lineage while preventing terminal differentiation, thus keeping muscle progenitors poised to differentiate upon environmental cues. In addition, potential regulatory mechanisms for the control of Pax7 activity will be proposed.

AB  - While neurovascular diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the leading causes of disability in the world, the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained remarkably limited. There is a dire need to develop new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic options. The study of proteomics is particularly enticing for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, which most likely involve multiple gene interactions resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Currently, rapidly progressing neuroproteomic techniques have been employed in clinical and translational research to help identify biologically relevant pathways, to understand cerebrovascular pathophysiology, and to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Future integration of proteomic with genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies will add new perspectives to better understand the complexities of neurovascular injury. Here, we review cerebrovascular proteomics research in both preclinical (animal, cell culture) and clinical (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialyates, tissue) studies. We will also discuss the rewards, challenges, and future directions for the application of proteomics technology to the study of various disease phenotypes. To capture the dynamic range of cerebrovascular injury and repair with a translational targeted and discovery approach, we emphasize the importance of complementing innovative proteomic technology with existing molecular biology models in preclinical studies, and the need to advance pharmacoproteomics to directly probe clinical physiology and gauge therapeutic efficacy at the bedside.

AB  - Summary Background Patients undergoing major cardiothoracic surgery are subjected to dilution, owing to massive fluid infusion and blood component transfusion. These patients may experience bleeding perioperatively, and are frequently treated with the endothelium-activating agent desmopressin. Objectives To investigate the effect of desmopressin administration on von Willebrand factor (VWF)-dependent coagulant and platelet functions under flow conditions. Patients/methods Blood from 16 patients with postoperative bleeding was obtained before and after desmopressin treatment (0.3 ?g kg?1 body weight), and assessed for coagulant properties and platelet function. Furthermore, VWF antigen levels and multimer composition were determined in both samples. Results Desmopressin treatment did not change thrombin generation in plasma or whole blood thromboelasticity. Also coagulation factor levels (other than factor VIII) and coagulation times were unchanged, suggesting that desmopressin treatment did not have a major effect on the coagulant activity. On the other hand, desmopressin treatment raised the already high plasma levels of VWF from a median of 116 IU mL?1 (interquartile range [IQR] 102?154 IU mL?1) to a median of 160 IU mL?1 (IQR 126?187 IU mL?1) (P = 0.007), owing to accumulation of the high molecular weight VWF multimers. Furthermore, desmopressin treatment caused an increase in collagen-dependent thrombus formation and platelet phosphatidylserine exposure. Markers of thrombus formation correlated with the plasma levels of VWF. In vitro control experiments confirmed a major contribution of VWF to thrombus formation and procoagulant activity under conditions of blood dilution. Conclusions Desmopressin treatment of patients with bleeding complications after cardiothoracic surgery induces the release of high molecular weight VWF multimers, which enhance platelet activation and thrombus formation under flow conditions.

AB  - Abstract Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles surrounded by a lipid membrane, which tend to be secreted toward extra-cellular environments. Despite being defined as vesicles involved in excretion of molecular wastes by Rose Johnstone in the 1970s, further studies revealed them to be effective in various biological processes such as cancer development, regulation of the immune system, intercellular communication, stem cell biology, and tissue/organ regeneration. Although many studies dealing with the role of exosomes in stem cell differentiation and the use of exosomes isolated from stem cells for the treatment of several diseases have been published, the involved mechanisms remain largely unknown. Further understanding of these mechanisms, which include the involved cellular pathways, may improve the use of exosomes in diagnostic and treatment methods, especially for those involving stem cells. Here, we describe some recent data describing the action mechanism of stem cell-derived exosomes focusing on the implicated cellular pathways, hoping to provide novel information that will be useful for cell biology scientists working in this field.

AB  - A 40-year-old smoker complained of pain, deep and burning in character, constant, and persistent, associated with paresthesias in his feet for a period of two years. Furthermore, he developed aching non-traumatic foot ulcers. There was no history of diabetes and systemic illness. Neurological examination revealed loss of all modalities of sensation and hyperhidrosis in the limbs with a prominent distal-to-proximal gradient. The following laboratory tests were normal: blood count; test for liver, kidney, and thyroid function; cryoglobulins; anti-HCV antibodies and HIV. Neurophysiological investigation revealed an axonal neuropathy with a distal-to-proximal distribution in the limbs. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe chronic axonal neuropathy. Prominent thickening of endoneurial microvessel endothelial cells was present with narrowing of lumen. Congo Red staining was negative. He initiated treatment with alprostadil alfa-ciclodestrina and stopped smoking. The patient reported prompt improvement of neurologic symptoms as well as skin abnormalities few months after the begin of therapy. Ischemic neuropathy in which nerve damage occurs in the more distal portion of the limbs has been reported. In our patient, clinical presentation, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of a Lower Extremity Ischemic Neuropathy probably triggered by smoke.

AB  - Summary Objectives Head-down-tilt (HDT) sleeping with periodic fluid redistribution (PFR) assumes a significant importance by the possibility of regulating bone remodelling. We hypothesized that HDT sleeping with chronic PFR which expands fluid volume would contribute to and/or increase bone formation. Therefore, we studied the potential benefits of osteogenesis with HDT sleeping of chronic PFR during diminished muscular activity (hypokinesia; HK). Methods Studies were conducted on 40 male healthy volunteers. They were divided into four groups: head-down-tilt sleeping control subjects (HDTSCS), head-down-tilt sleeping hypokinetic subjects (HDTSHS), active control subjects (ACS) and hypokinetic subjects (HKS). The iliac crest cancellous bone and trabecular bone volume and cortical thickness were measured during pre-experimental period of 390 days and experimental period of 360 days. Results Iliac crest cancellous bone and trabecular bone volume and cortical thickness were increased (P<0·05) in the HDTSHS group compared to the HKS group. Iliac crest cancellous bone volume, cortical thickness and trabecular bone volume were reduced (P<0·05) in the HKS group compared to their pre-experimental values and the level in the other groups. In the HDTSCS group, iliac crest cancellous bone volume, cortical thickness and trabecular bone volume were increased much less than in the HDTSHS group. Bone mineral density was not affected in the ACS group compared to their pre-experimental values. Conclusion The current study shows the impact of chronic HDT sleeping with PFR on increases formation of bone demonstrating osteogenesis of bone during diminished muscular activity.

Lipids are highly complex and diverse owing to the various combinations of polar headgroups, fatty acyl chains, and backbone structures. This structural diversity continues to pose a challenge for lipid analysis. Here we review the current state of the art in lipidomics research and discuss the challenges facing this field. The latest technological developments in mass spectrometry, the role of bioinformatics, and the applications of lipidomics in lipid metabolism and cellular physiology and pathology are also discussed. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Cataract, the opacification of the eye lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide?it accounts for approximately 42% of all cases. The lens fibers have the highest protein content within the body, more than 35% of their wet weight. Given the eye lens pure composition of highly abundant structural proteins crystallins (up to 90%), it seems to be an ideal proteomic entity to study and might be also hypothesized to model the other protein conformational diseases. Crystallins are extremely long-lived, and there is virtually no protein turnover. This provides great opportunities for post-translational modifications (PTM) to occur and to predispose lens to the cataract formation. Despite recent progress in proteomics, the human lens proteome remains largely unknown. Mass spectrometry hold great promise to determine which crystallin modifications lead to a cataract. Quantitative analysis of PTMs at the peptide level with proteomics is a powerful bioanalytical tool for lens-tissue samples, and provides more comprehensive results. New mass spectrometry-based approaches that are being applied to lens research will be highlighted. Finally, the future directions of proteomics cataract research will be outlined. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1173?1184, 2011

AB  - ABSTRACT Some aspects of an obese body habitus may protect against fracture risk (higher bone mineral density [BMD] and greater tissue padding), while others may augment that risk (greater impact forces during a fall). To examine these competing pathways, we analyzed data from a multisite, multiethnic cohort of 1924 women, premenopausal or early perimenopausal at baseline. Obesity was defined as baseline body mass index (BMI)?>?30?kg/m2. Composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces were constructed from DXA-derived bone size, BMD and body size. Incident fractures were ascertained annually during a median follow-up of 9 years. In multivariable linear regression adjusted for covariates, higher BMI was associated with higher BMD but with lower composite strength indices, suggesting that although BMD increases with greater skeletal loading, the increase is not sufficient to compensate for the increase in fall impact forces. During the follow-up, 201 women had fractures. In Cox proportional hazard analyses, obesity was associated with increased fracture hazard adjusted for BMD, consistent with greater fall impact forces in obese individuals. Adjusted for composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces, obesity was associated with decreased fracture hazard, consistent with a protective effect of soft tissue padding. Further adjustment for hip circumference, a surrogate marker of soft tissue padding, attenuated the obesity?fracture association. Our findings support that there are at least three major mechanisms by which obesity influences fracture risk: increased BMD in response to greater skeletal loading, increased impact forces, and greater absorption of impact forces by soft tissue padding. ? 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Focal cerebral ischemia induces cellular responses that may result in secondary tissue damage. We recently demonstrated multi-facetted spatial and temporal patterns of neuroinflammation by multimodal imaging. In the present study, we especially focus on the separation of vital and necrotic tissue, which enabled us to define a demarcation zone. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced via macrosphere embolization of the middle cerebral artery in Wistar rats. Subsequent cellular processes were investigated immunohistochemically from 3 to 56 days after onset of ischemia. We detected several infarct subareas: a necrotic infarct core and its margin adjacent to a nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)+ zone delineating it from a vital peri-infarct zone. Initially transition from necrotic to vital tissue was gradual; later on necrosis was precisely separated from vital tissue by a narrow NG2+ belt that was devoid of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or neurons. Within this demarcation zone NG2+ cells associate with ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) but not with GFAP, neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) or 2?, 3?-cyclic nucleotide 3?-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). During further infarct maturation NG2 seemed to be positioned in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the demarcation zone, whereas Iba1+ cells invaded the necrotic infarct core and GFAP+ cells built a gliotic containing belt between the lesion and NeuN+ unaffected tissue. Overall, our data suggested that NG2 proteoglycan expression and secretion hallmarked demarcation as a process that actively separated necrosis from vital tissue and therefore decisively impacts secondary neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract Even mildly hypothermic body or limb temperatures can retard healing processes in mammals. Despite this, we observed that hibernating American black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780) elicit profound abilities in mounting inflammatory responses to infection and/or foreign bodies. In addition, they resolve injuries during hibernation while maintaining mildly hypothermic states (30?35 °C) and without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating. We describe experimental studies on free-ranging bears that document their abilities to completely resolve cutaneous cuts and punctures incurred during or prior to hibernation. We induced small, full-thickness cutaneous wounds (biopsies or incisions) during early denning, and re-biopsied sites 2?3 months later (near the end of denning). Routine histological methods were used to characterize these skin samples. All biopsied sites with respect to secondary intention (open circular biopsies) and primary intention (sutured sites) healed, with evidence of initial eschar (scab) formation, completeness of healed epidermis and dermal layers, dyskeratosis (inclusion cysts), and abilities to produce hair follicles. These healing abilities of hibernating black bears are a clear survival advantage to animals injured before or during denning. Bears are known to have elevated levels of hibernation induction trigger (delta-opioid receptor agonist) and ursodeoxycholic acid (major bile acid within plasma, mostly conjugated with taurine) during hibernation, which may relate to these wound-healing abilities. Further research as to the underlying mechanisms of wound healing during hibernation could have applications in human medicine. Unique approaches may be found to improve healing for malnourished, hypothermic, diabetic and elderly patients or to reduce scarring associated with burns and traumatic injuries.

AB  - Abstract Martin, James R.; Godel, T.; Hunkeler, W.; Jenck, F.; Moreau, J-L.; Sleight, A. J.; and Widmer, U. (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.). A number of important advances have occurred in the understanding and the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system including mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, insomnia, substance use disorders, and dementias. The plethora of novel drugs act by means of diverse neurobiological mechanisms and represent a great diversity of chemical structures. Along with improvements in the therapeutic index of anxiolytics, sedative?hypnotics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, some progress has also been made in the search for drugs effective in the treatment of substance use disorders, as well as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Nonetheless, such improvements in symptomatic therapy have not been accompanied by the discovery of effective etiological and pathophysiological interventions. It is from here that the successful psychopharmacological agents of the future must come.

AB  - Summary Cytopathology, a branch of diagnostic pathology provides an alternative to histopathological examination and has several advantages. Specimen collection is relatively simple and quick, is much less invasive (does not require surgery) and processing is much faster that of the paraffin wax embedding method employed in routine histopathology. This chapter introduces the reader to the techniques employed in the Cytopathology laboratory from specimen collection and preparation to diagnosis. The fundamentals of cytomorphology and cytodiagnosis are described in brief. The history of the cervical screening programme is covered, from its introduction, through the limitations of specimen collection, the Papnicolaou (Pap) smear, via the pivotal role played by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in the progression to cervical cancer, to the introduction of Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) and the new HPV vaccine reaching market.

AB  - Summary: We studied recurrence risks and predictive factors of relapse after antiepileptic drug (AED) discontinuation in a prospective analysis of 425 children with epilepsy who had not had a seizure for at least 2 years (follow-up after withdrawal 1.6?12 years, mean 8 years). Factors closely related by multivariate analysis to relapse were neurologic abnormalities, mental retardation, seizure type (infantile spasms, absence seizures), and appearance or persistence of EEG abnormalities during the course of the illness and before discontinuation. When multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate outcome of patients with a first relapse (isolated vs. multiple relapses), the variables closely related to a poor prognosis were etiologic factors, first relapse characterized by more than one seizure in a 24-h period, seizure-free period <4 years, unchanged seizure type at first relapse, more than one AED for seizure control, and abnormal EEG before the first relapse. In itself, resumption of therapy did not influence outcome. At the study cutoff point, 88% of patients with relapse were again seizure-free. We conclude that AEDs can safely be discontinued if predictive factors are considered to individualize the risk of relapse for each patient. RÉSUMÉ Les auteurs ont étudié les risques de récidive et les facteurs de prédiction d'une rechute après arrêt du traitement antiépilep-tique; il s'agit d'une analyse prospective de 425 dossiers d'en-fants épileptiques, qui n'avaient plus présenté de crises pendant au moins 2 ans, et qui ont ete suivis après l'arrêt pendant une moyenne de 8 ans (extrêmes 1.6?12 ans). l'analyse par multi-variante a montré que les facteurs liés à la rechute étaient les suivants: présence d'anomalies neurologiques, d'un retard mental, type des crises (spasmes infantiles, absences), apparition ou persistance d'anomalies EEG pendant l'évolution de la maladie et avant l'arrêt du traitement. Lorsque l'analyse multivariante a été pratiquée dans le but d'évaluer l'évolution de patients ayant présenté une première rechute (comparaison des rechutes isolées et des rechutes multiples), les variables liées à un mauvais pro-nostic étaient: les facteurs étiologiques, une rechute caractérisée par la survenue de plus d'une crise en moins de 24 h, une période sans crise inférieure à 4 ans, la survenue du même type de crises lors de la première rechute, la nécessité d'une polythérapie pour le contrôle des crises, et al persistance d'anomalies EEG avant la première rechute. La reprise d'un traitement n'a pas par elle-même influenceé l'évolution. Au terme de cette étude, 88% des patients ayant rechutéétaient à nouveau en rémission. Les auteurs concluent que les médicaments antiépileptiques peuvent être arrêtés sans grand risque, dans la mesure où les facteurs prédictifs sont pris en compte pour individualiser le risque de rechute chez chaque patient. RESUMEN En un análisis prospectivo de 425 niños con epilepsía que no habían tenido ataques por lo menos durante dos años (seguimiento de 1.6?12 años con un promedio de 8 años), bemos estudiado la reaparición de factores de riesgo y de predicción de recurrencia de ataques después de la interrupción de la medica-ción anti-epiléptica. Los factores estrechamente relacionados (utilizando análisis multivariado) con recurrencias fueron: anom-alfas neurológicas, retraso mental, tipo de ataques (espasmos infantiles, ataques de ausencia), aparición o persistencia de anomalías en el EEG durante el curso de la enfermedad y antes de la interrupción de la enfermedad. Cuando se realizaron análisis multivariados para valorar las consecuencias en pa-cientes con una primera recurrencia (recurrencia aislada versus múltiple), las variables estrechamente relacionadas con un pro-nóstico pobre fueron: factores etiológicos, primera recurrencia con más de un ataque en 24 horas, periodo libre de ataques menor de 4 años, tipo de ataques sin modificación hasta la primera recurrencia, más de una medicatión antiepiléptica para el control de los ataques y EEG anormal antes de la primera recurrencia. La restauración de la medication no modificó el curso posterior. En el momento de la intermpción de este estudio el 88% de los pacientes sin recurrencias permanecían sin ataques. Concluimos que la medicación anti-epiléptica puede ser inter-rumpida sin peligro si los factores de predictión se tienen en cuenta para determinar los riesgos de recurrencia en cada pa-ciente.

AB  - Abstract The brain is unquestionably the most fascinating organ, and the hippocampus is crucial in memory storage and retrieval and plays an important role in stress response. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the seizure origin typically involves the hippocampal formation. Despite tremendous progress, current knowledge falls short of being able to explain its function. An emerging approach toward an improved understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms that underlie functions of the brain and hippocampus is neuroproteomics. Mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze biological samples, and has evolved into an indispensable tool for proteomics research. In this review, we present a general overview of the application of mass spectrometry in proteomics, summarize neuroproteomics and systems biology-based discovery of protein biomarkers for epilepsy, discuss the methodology needed to explore the epileptic hippocampus proteome, and also focus on applications of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) in disease research. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in epilepsy that can be applied for immediate epileptic biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of the protein regulatory networks. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of epilepsy on society. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 29:197?246, 2010

AB  - Abstract Aim: To investigate: 1) the occurrence of hypoxic hepatitis in full-term infants after birth asphyxia, 2) the temporal enzyme pattern in asphyxiated newborn infants, and 3) whether the degree of hypoxic hepatitis, as reflected by the rise in aminotransferase, correlates with the severity of the asphyxia and CNS symptomatology. Methods: Serum aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total and conjugated bilirubin, cholinesterase activity, albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), and nucleated red blood cell count were prospectively measured in full-term asphyxiated newborn infants (n=26). Samples were collected three times during the first 72 h and once between days 6 and 12 after birth. Samples from healthy newborns (n=56), collected 24?172 h after birth, served as controls. Results: In 12 of the 26 asphyxiated infants, a serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALAT) pattern compatible with hypoxic hepatitis was found. Five infants showed increased S-ALAT activity but with a different pattern. Similar patterns were seen in serum aspartate aminotransferase (S-ASAT). S-ALAT and -ASAT concentrations 0?72 h after birth correlated significantly with severity of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Conclusion: Birth asphyxia can induce an enzyme pattern in serum compatible to hypoxic hepatitis. There seems to be a correlation between aminotransferases in serum and the extent of CNS injury.

AB  - SUMMARY The decision of whether a cell should live or die is fundamental for the wellbeing of all organisms. Despite intense investigation into cell growth and proliferation, only recently has the essential and equally important idea that cells control/programme their own demise for proper maintenance of cellular homeostasis gained recognition. Furthermore, even though research into programmed cell death (PCD) has been an extremely active area of research there are significant gaps in our understanding of the process in plants. In this review, we discuss PCD during plant development and pathogenesis, and compare/contrast this with mammalian apoptosis.
