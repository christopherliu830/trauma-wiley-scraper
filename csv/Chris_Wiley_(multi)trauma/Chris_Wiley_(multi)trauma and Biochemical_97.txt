AB  - ABSTRACT In the present study, an attempt has been made to improve cell supportive property of chitosan/nano beta tri-calcium phosphate (?-TCP) composite scaffolds by modification of scaffold surface with fibrin using ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide (EDC) as crosslinking agent. The developed fibrin conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP composite scaffolds possess desired pore size and porosity in the range of 45?151 µm and 81.4?±?4.1%, respectively. No significant change in compressive strength of scaffolds was observed before and after fibrin conjugation. The calculated compressive strength of fibrin conjugated and non-conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP scaffolds are 2.71?±?0.14 MPa and 2.67?±?0.11 MPa, respectively. Results of cell culture study have further shown an enhanced cell attachment, cell number, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization on fibrin conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP scaffold. The uniform cell distribution over the scaffold surface and cell infiltration into the scaffold pores were assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, higher expression of osteogenic specific genes such as bone sialo protein, osteonectin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin (OC) on fibrin conjugated scaffolds was observed when compared to scaffolds without fibrin. Altogether, results indicate the potentiality of developed fibrin conjugated composite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB  - Abstract:? Cutaneous ageing, as visualized at the exposed areas of skin, reflects dramatic alterations in the structure and function of the extracellular matrix of connective tissues. Among them, the elastic fibre network, which is responsible for the physiological elasticity and resilience of normal skin, undergoes degradative changes leading to loss of functional elastic fibres. A potential strategy to counteract these degenerative changes entails topical application of a compound that may lead to regeneration of the elastic fibre network. In this study, we have evaluated the effects of a bi-metal, 0.1% copper?zinc malonate-containing cream that has been shown to efface wrinkles in clinical trials. An effect on elastin biosynthesis and elastic tissue accumulation in skin biopsies was observed in 21 female patients with photoaged facial skin, as measured at baseline and at 6?weeks of treatment. Histopathological evaluation revealed evidence of elastic fibre regeneration, including those extending perpendicularly towards the dermo-epidermal junction within the papillary dermis. Elastin biosynthesis, measured by semi-quantitative immunofluorescence with an antibody recognizing only the newly synthesized, uncrosslinked tropoelastin molecules, suggested statistically significant enhancement of elastin biosynthesis by the bi-metal compound when applied twice daily. Accumulation of elastic fibres was confirmed by assay of desmosine, an elastin-specific crosslink compound. These results suggest that the bi-metal, 0.1% copper?zinc malonate-containing cream has the propensity to increase elastin synthesis in human skin in vivo, and that regeneration of elastic fibres may contribute to wrinkle effacement in female patients with photoaged facial skin.

AB  - Summary: A patient with partial complex seizures evaluated for surgery with chronic depth electrode recordings demonstrated falsely localizing ictal onsets during anticonvulsant drug withdrawal. When phenytoin was being reduced, more seizures appeared to originate from the left temporal lobe than from the right. Right anterior temporal lobectomy, performed on the basis of other findings, revealed a small unsuspected tumor in the resected specimen, and the patient has remained seizure free for 3 years. The seizures that originated from the left temporal lobe were different from the patient's habitual attacks and appeared to be the result of anticonvulsant withdrawal and, perhaps, electrode irritation. Four other patients who received anterior temporal lobectomies at UCLA between 1977 and 1980 had at least one stereotaxic EEG (SEEG)-recorded contralateral seizure onset, and all have benefited from surgery. Although multifocal SEEG-recorded ictal onsets should be considered a poor prognostic sign, distant sites that give rise to atypical seizures during drug withdrawal may not generate spontaneous seizures postoperatively. Consequently, this finding should not be used as a sole criterion against the recommendation of surgical therapy. RESUMEN Un paciente con ataques parciales complejos que fueron evaluados para posible cirugía con registros mediante electrodos profundos demostraron comienzos ictales de falsa localizacidn durante la retirada de la medicación anticonvulsiva. Cuando se reduceía la fenitoina, más ataques parecían originarse en el lóbulo temporal izquierdo que en el derecho. La lobectomía temporal anterior del lado derecho, realizada en base a otros hallazgos, reveló, insospechadamente, un tumor en el fragmento resecado y el enfermo ha permanecido sin ataques durante tres años. Los ataques que se originaban en el lóbulo temporal izquierdo eran distintos de los ataques habituates y parecían ser el resultado de la retirada de los anticonvulsivantes y, quizás, de la irritación de los electrodos. Cuatro de las pacientes sometidos a una lobectomía en UCLA entre 1.977 y 1.980 tuvieron, por lo menos, un ataque de comienzo contralateral registrado en el SEEG y todos se beneficiaron de la cirugía. A pesar de que los comienzos multifocals segün el SEEG deberían considerarse como signo de pobre pronóstico, lugares distantes que producen ataques atípicos durante la retirada de las drogas pueden no generar. post-operativamente, ataques espontáneos. Por consiguiente este hallazgo no debe usarse como criterio único contra la recomendación de terapía quirúrgica. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ein Patient mit komplexen Partialanfällen, bei dem wegen eines chirurgischen Eingriffs über chronisch implantierte Tiefenelektroden abgeleitet wurde, zeigte eine falsche Lokalisation des Anfallsbeginns während des Entzugs der Antikonvulsiva. Als das Phenytoin reduziert wurde, schienen mehr Anfälle ihren Ursprung vom linken Temporallappen zu nehmen als vom rechten. Eine rechtsseitige vordere temporale Lobek-tomie, die aufgrund anderer Befunde durchgeführt wurde, zeigte einen kleinen unerwarteten Tumor im resezierten Gewebe und der Patient blieb 3 Jahre lang anfallsfrei. Die Anfälle, die ihren Ursprung im linken Temporallappen hatten, unterschieden sich von den üblichen Attacken des Patienten und schienen das Ergebnis des Entzugs der Antikonvulsiva zu sein und vielleicht auf einer Irritation durch die Elektrode zu beruhen. Vierandere Patienten, die zwischen 1977 und 1980 in der UCLA am vorderen Temporallappen lo-bektomiert wurden, hatten wenigstens ein SEEG mit kontralateralem Anfallsbeginn und alien wurde durch den chirurgischen Eingriff geholfen. Obwohl multi-fokale SEEG-Aufzeichnungen des Anfallsbeginns als schwacher prognostischer Hinweis betrachtet werden sollten, kann angenommen werden, daß entfernte Herde. die Anlass für atypische Anfälle während Entzugs der Medikamente bilden könnten, nicht Anlass für spontane Anfälle postoperativ geben müssen. Damit sollte ein solcher Befund nicht als einziges Kriterium gegen die Empfehlung der chirurgischen Therapie benutzt werden.

AB  - ABSTRACT Progressive knee joint degeneration occurs following removal of a torn meniscus. However, there is significant variability in the rate of development of post-meniscectomy osteoarthritis (OA). While there is no current consensus on the risk factors for development of knee OA in patients with meniscus tears, it is likely that both biological and biomechanical factors play critical roles. In this perspective paper, we review the mechanical and the biological predictors of the response of the knee to partial meniscectomy. We review the role of patient-based studies, in vivo animal models, cadaveric models, bioreactor systems, and statistically augmented computational models for the study of meniscus function and post-meniscectomy OA, providing insight into the important interplay between biomechanical and biologic factors. We then discuss the clinical translation of these concepts for ?biologic augmentation? of meniscus healing and meniscus replacement. Ultimately, collaborative studies between engineers, biologists, and clinicians is the optimal way to improve our understanding of meniscus pathology and response to injury and/or disease, and to facilitate effective translation of laboratory findings to improved treatments for our patients. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Economic Aspects Blood is a multifunctional transport medium of vital importance for the body of higher organisms. Its composition is very complex and includes various cell systems with peculiar functions, proteins, electrolytes, metabolites, and highly sophisticated mediator systems. Both cells and plasma, which can be separated by centrifugation, can be used as and further processed into medicines. Serum is the fluid remaining after coagulation of the blood. In this review, blood cell systems and plasma proteins are referred to and medicinal aspects including blood and plasma collection and processing are described. The medicines derived from blood and plasma, as well as basic research and clinical trials should keep an important place because of the medicine as a whole benefits extremely from transfusions and, in particular, hemophiliacs gain an enormous improvement of life quality and life expectancy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? The vaginal orgasm seems to be evocated by the stimulation of the G-spot: a highly sensitive area on the anterior wall of the human vagina. However, the existence of such a spot is controversial. Aim.? To evaluate, by the use of three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasonography, the anatomic structures of the urethrovaginal space both in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients and eumenorrheic non-hirsute controls. Methods.? Twenty-three (Group I) PCOS patients and 25 eumenorrheic young women (Group II) were submitted to two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D ultrasonography and color Doppler analysis of the urethrovaginal space and of the clitoris. Main Outcome Measures.? 2-D ultrasonographic evaluation of the ovaries and of the urethrovaginal space; color Doppler evaluation of the ovarian stromal arteries, urethrovaginal main feeding artery, and dorsal clitoral arteries; 3-D volume calculation of the urethrovaginal space, and 3-D power Doppler analysis of the vascularization index; flow index; and vascularization flow index; hormonal evaluation. Results.? The vaginal orgasm was present in 13/23 (56%) patients in PCOS Group and in 13/25 (52%) in the controls. The 3-D reconstruction of the urethrovaginal space demonstrated a gland-like aspect with small feeding vessels: ?female prostate.? The 3-D mean volume of the ?female prostate? was significantly higher in Group I (0.48?±?0.21?mL) than in Group II (0.39?±?0.19?mL; P?=?0.044). The Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLys (VOCAL) built mean volume of the ?female prostate? was positively correlated with the time since intercourse (r?=?0.486; P?=?0.032), with the total length of the urethrovaginal space (r?=?0.616; P?=?0.025) and with the testosterone (r?=?0.424; P?=?0.048) circulating values. Conclusions.? The presence of the G-spot and its role in vaginal orgasm remains controversial. In Italians, and normal weight PCOS patients the hyperandrogenism seems to result in ovarian stromal and ?female prostate? hyperplasia.

AB  - Abstract Progressively sophisticated understanding of cellular and molecular processes that contribute to age-related physical deterioration is being gained from ongoing research into cancer, chronic inflammatory syndromes and other serious disorders that increase with age. Particularly valuable insight has resulted from characterization of how senescent cells affect the tissues in which they form in ways that decrease an organism's overall viability. Increasingly, the underlying pathophysiology of ageing is recognized as a consequence of oxidative damage. This leads to hyperactivity of cell growth pathways, prominently including mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), that contribute to a build-up in cells of toxic aggregates such as progerin (a mutant nuclear cytoskeletal protein), lipofuscin and other cellular debris, triggering formation of senescent cellular phenotypes, which interact destructively with surrounding tissue. Indeed, senescent cell ablation dramatically inhibits physical deterioration in progeroid (age-accelerated) mice. This review explores ways in which oxidative stress creates ageing-associated cellular damage and triggers induction of the cell death/survival programs? apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and ?necroapoptophagy?. The concept of ?necroapoptophagy? is presented here as a strategy for varying tissue oxidative stress intensity in ways that induce differential activation of death versus survival programs, resulting in enhanced and sustained representation of healthy functional cells. These strategies are discussed in the context of specialized mesenchymal stromal cells with the potential to synergize with telocytes in stabilizing engrafted progenitor cells, thereby extending periods of healthy life. Information and concepts are summarized in a hypothetical approach to suppressing whole-organism senescence, with methods drawn from emerging understandings of ageing, gained from Cnidarians (jellyfish, corals and anemones) that undergo a unique form of cellular regeneration, potentially conferring open-ended lifespans.

AB  - ABSTRACT Cartilage T2 relaxation time in isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) without concomitant meniscal pathology and their changes over time remain unclear. The purpose of this exploratory study was to: (i) compare cartilage T2 relaxation time (T2 values) in people with isolated ACLR at 2?3 years post-surgery (baseline) and matched healthy controls and; (ii) evaluate the subsequent 2-year change in T2 values in people with ACLR. Twenty-eight participants with isolated ACLR and nine healthy volunteers underwent knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline; 16 ACLR participants were re-imaged 2 years later. Cartilage T2 values in full thickness, superficial layers, and deep layers were quantified in the tibia, femur, trochlear, and patella. Between-group comparisons at baseline were performed using analysis of covariance adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Changes over time in the ACLR group were evaluated using paired sample t-tests. ACLR participants showed significantly higher (p?=?0.03) T2 values in the deep layer of medial femoral condyle at baseline compared to controls (mean difference 4.4?ms [13%], 95%CI 0.4, 8.3?ms). Over 2 years, ACLR participants showed a significant reduction (p?=?0.04) in T2 value in the deep layer of lateral tibia (mean change 1.4?ms [?7%], 95%CI 0.04, 2.8?ms). The decrease in T2 values suggests improvement in cartilage composition in the lateral tibia (deep layer) of ACLR participants. Further research with larger ACLR cohorts divided according to meniscal status and matched healthy cohorts are needed to further understand cartilage changes post-ACLR. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants (BTFIs) have been in routine clinical use to facilitate healing for nearly five decades. Amongst the variety of biomaterials used, silk-based biomaterials (SBBs) have been widely used clinically viz. sutures for centuries and are being increasingly recognized as a prospective material for biomedical textiles. The ease of processing, controllable degradability, remarkable mechanical properties and biocompatibility have prompted the use of SBBs for various BTFIs for extracorporeal implants, soft tissue repair, healthcare/hygiene products and related needs. The present Review focuses on BTFIs from the perspective of types and physical and biological properties, and this discussion is followed with an examination of the advantages and limitations of BTFIs from SBBs. The Review covers progress in surface coatings, physical and chemical modifications of SBBs for BTFIs and identifies future needs and opportunities for the further development for BTFIs using SBBs.

AB  - Abstract Much attention has been drawn to the pro-inflammatory condition that accompanies aging. This study compared parameters from non-stimulated neutrophils, obtained from young (18?30?years old [y.o.]) and elderly (65?80?y.o.) human volunteers. Measured as an inflammatory marker, plasmatic concentration of hs-CRP was found higher in elderly individuals. Non-stimulated neutrophil production of ROS and NO was, respectively, 38 and 29% higher for the aged group. From the adhesion molecules evaluated, only CD11b expression was elevated in neutrophils from the aged group, whereas no differences were found for CD11a, CD18, or CD62. A 69% higher non-stimulated in vitro neutrophil/endothelial cell adhesion was observed for neutrophils isolated from elderly donors. Our results suggest that with aging, neutrophils may be constitutively producing more reactive species in closer proximity to endothelial cells of vessel walls, which may both contribute to vascular damage and reflect a neutrophil intracellular disrupted redox balance, altering neutrophil function in aging.

AB  - Summary Cosmetics based on traditional herbal medicine are formulated not only with herbal extracts but also using advanced bioprocessing and delivery method. This chapter explains the characteristics of Korean herbal cosmetics through examples of concepts, history, and traditions within the Korean traditional medicine industry. With the advancements in biotechnology, studies are now being conducted on the dermatological effects and processing methods of traditional medicinal ingredients, including ginseng. The enzymatic and microbial bioprocessing is used to produce novel natural compounds. Camelliaside A and B and three oxyisoflavones were isolated from the green tea seed and soybean. Using these compounds, a commercially and biologically useful new polyphenol, kaempferol, and 7,3?,4?-trihydroxyisoflavone were produced by enzymatic and microbial bioconversion.

AB  - Peripheral root cap cells can be isolated by gentle agitation of the root in water for less than 60 sec. Filtration of the detached cells through a 30-?m mesh screen results in a suspension of single cells. Yields of peripheral root cap cells from 28 species in 10 families ranged from fewer than 10 per root from tobacco to more than 5,000 per root from pine. The viability of freshly isolated cells from most species, including legumes and cereals, was 85% to 95%. Cultured cells from pea and soybean exhibited cytoplasmic streaming for more than a month. When incubated at an initial density of 105 cells per ml of liquid B5(P) medium, 6% to 8% of isolated pea root cap cells divided and grew into callus.

AB  - Abstract Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is one of the main inherited coagulation disorders. It is caused by a deficiency and/or a dysfunction of the von Willebrand factor (VWF), a fundamental multimeric glycoprotein involved in the hemostasis process. Correct detection of the disease is not an easy task because the disease manifests itself in many variants and a high intra-subject variability is observed. For these reasons, the diagnostic clinical trials typically rely on a 24-h sampling protocol, which makes the overall test long, stressful, and costly. Using a new pharmacokinetic model derived from Galvanin et al.'s 2014 study, this study aims at i) assessing the theoretical possibility to perform a shorter clinical test and ii) proposing a set of model-based diagnostic methods as a support for the clinical team. A preliminary information analysis is performed in order to understand which sampling instants are more informative for model identification. This allowed us to propose a novel, 8-h diagnostic protocol, which is still able to ensure model identifiability. Three alternative diagnostic methods are then proposed based on this short-length clinical protocol. One of them directly uses the pharmacokinetic model, whereas the other two are based on the use of three indices (two pharmacokinetic indices, namely clearance, total VWF released, and as third index the basal multimer ratio) to formulate the diagnosis problem as a classification one. The classification problem is then solved using K-nearest neighbours and linear discriminant analysis. Results show the theoretical feasibility of a VWD diagnosis based on a shorter protocol.

AB  - Proteoglycans are diverse, complex extracellular/cell surface macromolecules composed of a central core protein with covalently linked glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains; both of these components contribute to the growing list of important bio-active functions attributed to proteoglycans. Increasingly, attention has been paid to the roles of proteoglycans in nervous tissue development due to their highly regulated spatio/temporal expression patterns, whereby they promote/inhibit neurite outgrowth, participate in specification and maturation of various precursor cell types, and regulate cell behaviors like migration, axonal pathfinding, synaptogenesis and plasticity. These functions emanate from both the environments proteoglycans create around cells by retaining ions and water or serving as scaffolds for cell shaping or motility, and from dynamic interactions that modulate signaling fields for cytokines, growth factors and morphogens, which may bind to either the protein or GAG portions. Also, genetic abnormalities impacting proteoglycan synthesis during critical steps of brain development and response to environmental insults and injuries, as well as changes in microenvironment interactions leading to tumors in the central nervous system, all suggest roles for proteoglycans in behavioral and intellectual disorders and malignancies.

AB  - Abstract Tendon disorders, which are commonly presented in the clinical setting, disrupt the patients? normal work and life routines, and they damage the careers of athletes. However, there is still no effective treatment for tendon disorders. In the field of tissue engineering, the potential of the therapeutic application of exogenous stem cells to treat tendon pathology has been demonstrated to be promising. With the development of stem cell biology and chemical biology, strategies that use inductive tenogenic factors to program stem cell fate in situ are the most easily and readily translatable to clinical applications. In this review, we focus on bioactive molecules that can potentially induce tenogenesis in adult stem cells, and we summarize the various differentiation factors found in comparative studies. Moreover, we discuss the molecular regulatory mechanisms of tenogenesis, and we examine the various challenges in developing standardized protocols for achieving efficient and reproducible tenogenesis. Finally, we discuss and predict future directions for tendon regeneration. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:404?414
