AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most misdiagnosed and underreported types of head trauma. The potential long-term impact of undiagnosed or incorrectly identified concussions and other head injuries are potentially devastating, as evidenced by the increasing societal burden exhibited by soldiers returning from combat and athletes in contact sports. Concussions and TBI are notoriously difficult to correctly diagnose and prognosis for these injuries is poorly understood. In order to increase the likelihood of successful diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of outcomes, a definitive differential diagnosis will need to be established. The establishment of a ?trauma?specific profile? or a panel of known trauma markers will significantly aid in this goal. Small membrane vesicles called exosomes have been shown to contain proteins and injury-specific biomarkers. In the future it is possible that they could become an important tool, utilized for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) trauma often occurs in combination with injury to the articular cartilage of the knee, this can result in earlier radiographic evidence of post traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee compared to the contralateral, ACL intact knee; however, the biomechanical and biological mechanisms associated with the onset and progression of this disease are not understood. We sought to gain insight into the mechanisms by determining the relationship between articular cartilage injury associated with ACL trauma and the expression of synovial fluid biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism, and to evaluate the relationship between these biomarkers and the patient's perspective of the outcomes. Synovial fluid samples were acquired from 39 ACL injured subjects at an average of 10 weeks after injury, and 32 control subjects with normal knees (documented with clinical exam and MRI assessment). Subjects in the ACL-injured group were classified as low-risk for future OA if they displayed an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Grade 2 articular cartilage lesion or less and high-risk for future OA if they had an ICRS Grade 3A articular cartilage lesion. The patient's perspective of the injury was evaluated with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS). There were no significant differences in mean concentrations of the markers of type II collagen metabolism (CPII, C2C, and C1,2C) or the aggrecan breakdown Alanine?Arginine?Glycine?Serine (ARGS) -fragment between control subjects and the subjects in the low- and high-risk groups (p-value range: 0.80?0.43). Associations between ARGS-aggrecan concentration and KOOS subscales of symptoms and pain were significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.03 and p?=?0.01, respectively). Likewise, there was strong evidence in support of an association between the markers of type II collagen metabolism (C1,2C and CPII concentrations) and the KOOS subscale of pain between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.051 and 0.077, correspondingly). In ACL injured subjects with concomitant Grade 3A articular cartilage injuries, concentrations of synovial fluid ARGS-aggrecan were directly associated with improvements in KOOS symptoms and pain. These findings suggest the possible involvement of ARGS-aggrecan in a localized tissue repair response involving an increase in aggrecan turnover following severe knee trauma. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Abstract Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significantly hampered by the lack of easily accessible biomarkers that can detect disease presence and predict disease risk reliably. Fluid biomarkers of AD currently provide indications of disease stage; however, they are not robust predictors of disease progression or treatment response, and most are measured in cerebrospinal fluid, which limits their applicability. With these aspects in mind, the aim of this article is to underscore the concerted efforts of the Blood-Based Biomarker Interest Group, an international working group of experts in the field. The points addressed include: (1) the major challenges in the development of blood-based biomarkers of AD, including patient heterogeneity, inclusion of the ?right? control population, and the blood?brain barrier; (2) the need for a clear definition of the purpose of the individual markers (e.g., prognostic, diagnostic, or monitoring therapeutic efficacy); (3) a critical evaluation of the ongoing biomarker approaches; and (4) highlighting the need for standardization of preanalytical variables and analytical methodologies used by the field.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children in the United States. Despite steady improvement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of acquired brain injuries, there has been remarkably little improvement in brain injury therapies and/or pharmacologic treatments over the past decade. One of the reasons may be the inability to properly stratify subjects for clinical trials and/or to have real-time assessment of the effectiveness of a given intervention. It has been recognized for several decades that serum biomarkers may allow for more objective subject stratification as well as act as surrogate markers of treatment efficacy. Despite numerous studies, however, biomarkers are not currently part of clinical practice in either acquired brain injury or other neurologic or musculoskeletal disorders. The goals of this review article, therefore, are to use traumatic brain injury as a example to discuss the use of biomarkers in clinical and randomized controlled trials; to briefly discuss the field of neuroproteomics and its interface with neurologic interventions; and to provide an overview of the collaborative pathway between academia and industry, which needs to be an integral part of the translation of biomarkers from the bench to the bedside in any clinical population. Introduction of the concept of rehabilomics and implications of biomarker use for the physical medicine and rehabilitation physician also are discussed.

AB  - Trauma remains a major cause of death throughout the world, especially for patients younger than 45 years. Due to rapid advances in clinical management, both in the acute and prehospital settings, trauma patients survive devastating injuries at unprecedented rates. However, these patients can often face life threatening complications that stem from the robust innate immune response induced by severe hemorrhage, leading to further tissue injury rather than repair. The complement and coagulation cascades are key mediators in this disordered reaction, which includes the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy. There is increasing evidence that cross-talk between these two pathways allows rapid amplification of their otherwise targeted responses and contributes to overwhelming and prolonged systemic inflammation. In this article, we summarize the initial steps of innate immune response to trauma and review the complex complement and coagulation cascades, as well as how they interact with each other. Despite progress in understanding these cascades, effective therapeutic targets have yet to be found and further research is needed both to improve survival rates as well as decrease associated morbidity.

Successfully translating a biomarker from discovery to clinical application demands high-quality discovery research and high-quality clinical studies for biomarker validation; however, there are additional challenges that face biomarker research in pediatrics. There are also additional characteristics of pediatric medicine that make biomarker research especially needed. This review focuses on the fundamentals of biomarkers, the additional considerations needed for applying biomarker research to children, and recommendations for advancing pediatric biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract Background We have explored the potential prefrontal hemodynamic biomarkers to characterize subjects with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) by employing the multivariate machine learning approach and introducing a novel task-related hemodynamic response detection followed by a heuristic search for optimum set of hemodynamic features. To achieve this goal, the hemodynamic response from a group of 31 healthy controls and 30 chronic TBI subjects were recorded as they performed a complexity task. Methods To determine the optimum hemodynamic features, we considered 11 features and their combinations in characterizing TBI subjects. We investigated the significance of the features by utilizing a machine learning classification algorithm to score all the possible combinations of features according to their predictive power. Results and Conclusions The identified optimum feature elements resulted in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 85%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. Classification improvement was achieved for TBI subject classification through feature combination. It signified the major advantage of the multivariate analysis over the commonly used univariate analysis suggesting that the features that are individually irrelevant in characterizing the data may become relevant when used in combination. We also conducted a spatio-temporal classification to identify regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that contribute in distinguishing between TBI and healthy subjects. As expected, Brodmann areas (BA) 10 within the PFC were isolated as the region that healthy subjects (unlike subjects with TBI), showed major hemodynamic activity in response to the High Complexity task. Overall, our results indicate that identified temporal and spatio-temporal features from PFC's hemodynamic activity are promising biomarkers in classifying subjects with TBI.

AB  - Abstract Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health problem, with approximately 2 million incidents occurring annually in the United States, no therapeutic agents to treat TBI have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration despite several clinical trials. It is estimated that 3.5 million Americans now have a lifelong condition that might be termed ?chronic traumatic brain injury disease.? Some health care providers categorize TBI as an ?event? for which patients require brief periods of rehabilitation with no further treatment. On the contrary, TBI should be seen as a chronic disease process that fits the World Health Organization definition as being a non-reversible pathologic condition requiring special rehabilitation training. Among the major obstacles that contribute to this type of misconception is the absence of brain injury?specific diagnostic biomarker(s) that can indicate and monitor the long-term health status of patients with TBI after use of conventional therapeutics and a rehabilitation process. It is of interest that recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology have enabled us to use these high throughput?based approaches in developing biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the area of TBI. One aim of this article is to provide an overview that evaluates the current status of TBI biomarker discovery using neuroproteomics/systems biology techniques, along with their clinical utilization. In addition, we discuss the need for strengthening the role of biomarker-based neuroproteomics/systems biology and its potential utility in the field of rehabilitation, which would lead to the establishment of rehabilomics studies, where biomarkers would indicate and predict the long-term efficacy and health status of patients with chronic TBI conditions.

AB  - Abstract Electrochemical immunosensors (EIs) for the determination of disease biomarkers has attracted a wide interest due to its high sensitivity, low cost, and possible integration in compact analytical devices. The use of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to develop EIs contributes to the great potential they have in point of care (POC) test, since SPEs show good electrical properties and allow the reduction of the electrochemical instrumentation down to small pocket-size devices. Moreover, during the last years, SPEs have gone through significant improvements related to both their design and printing materials. Since cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the major threats of global health, there is a growing demand for the development of portable, rapid, simple and inexpensive devices for the detection of these diseases. This article presents an overview about the main biomarkers of cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the EIs based on SPEs for the detection of these biomarkers.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Abstract Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort. Results indicate a genome-wide significant association between total AUDIT score and rs1433375 [N = 1036, P = 2.61 ? 10?8 (dominant model), P = 7.76 ? 10?8 (additive model)], an intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism located 323 kb upstream of the sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) at 4q28. rs1433375 was also significant in a meta-analysis of two similar, but independent, cohorts (N = 1394, P = 0.0004), the Marine Resiliency Study and Systems Biology PTSD Biomarkers Consortium. Functional analysis indicated that rs1433375 was associated with SCLT1 gene expression and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Together, findings suggest a role for sodium channel regulation and cerebellar functioning in alcohol use behavior. Identifying mechanisms underlying risk for problematic alcohol use in trauma-exposed populations is critical for future treatment and prevention efforts.

AB  - Abstract Many diseases caused by inflammatory processes can progress to a chronic state causing deterioration in the quality of life and a poor prognosis for long-term survival. To address inflammatory diseases effectively, early detection and novel therapeutics are required. However, this can be challenging, in part because of the lack of early predictive biomarkers and the limited availability of adequate technologies capable of the identification/characterization of key predictive biomarkers present in biological materials, especially those found at picomolar concentrations and below. This review highlights the need for state-of-the art methodologies, with high-sensitivity and high-throughput capabilities, for determination of multiple biomarkers. Although many new biomarkers have been discovered recently, existing technology has failed to successfully bring this advancement to the patient's bedside. We present an overview of the various advances available today to extend the discovery of predictive biomarkers of inflammatory diseases; in particular, we review the technology of immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE), which combines the use of antibodies as highly selective capture agents with the high resolving power of capillary electrophoresis. This two-dimensional hybrid technology permits the quantification and characterization of several protein biomarkers simultaneously, including subtle structural changes such as variants, isoforms, peptide fragments, and post-translational modifications. Furthermore, the results are rapid, sensitive, can be performed at a relatively low cost, without the introduction of false positive or false negative data. The IACE instrumentation can have relevance to medical, pharmaceutical, environmental, military, cultural heritage (authenticity of art work), forensic science, industrial and research fields, and in particular as a point-of-care biomarker analyzer in translational medicine.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine in vivo high-resolution morphological and biochemical gender related differences in cartilage repair tissue (MACT). Forty patients were examined clinically and by MR scans at 3T-MRI (coronal 3D True-FISP sequence for morphologic assessment and multi-echo spin-echo T2-mapping for biochemical assessment of healthy cartilage and MACT cartilage). Mean T2 values in repair tissue in the deep zone showed significantly shorter T2 times in females (p?=?0.009, female 43.5?±?9.8 vs. male 48.2?±?7.7?ms). The superficial zone showed higher T2 values than the deep zone in both the groups (female 48.5?±?9.8, males 52.6?±?11.0?ms) without significant difference between female and male patients. Native control cartilage showed no statistically significant differences for T2 between females and males. The subdivisions ?structure of the repair tissue? and ?subchondral bone? of the MOCART score showed statistically significant differences between females and males (p?=?0.026 and p?=?0.007) as well as the Lysholm score (p?=?0.03). Our investigations revealed differences between female and male patients after MACT of the knee in clinical outcome and advanced morphological and biochemical MRI. The presented imaging biomarkers can depict subtle changes after cartilage regeneration procedures and might help to understand gender related differences after cartilage repair procedures. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract An exponential increase in the prevalence of neurological disorders requires substantial steps to be taken for their prevention and treatment. Neurodiagnostic biomarkers are gaining momentum presently in order to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of neurodegenerative disorders, to precisely assess their advancement and to monitor the efficiency of therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the primary focus of the present review is the recent development in this field of neurodiagnostic biomarkers, and the current state of biomarker exploration in the context of various neurodegenerative diseases. This review encompasses an updated and detailed account of specific (?-Amyloid, Tau and Phospho-tau 181, Tar-DNA binding protein-43, Progranulin, a-synuclein, Clusterin, etc) and non-specific (genetic, synaptic, inflammatory and coagulation) neurodiagnostic biomarkers and the recent advances in this growing field. This comprehensive review also suggests the utilization of neurodiagnostic markers in network approaches and personalized medication that will eventually improvise the existing diagnostic and therapeutic complexities of neurodiagnostic biomarkers.
