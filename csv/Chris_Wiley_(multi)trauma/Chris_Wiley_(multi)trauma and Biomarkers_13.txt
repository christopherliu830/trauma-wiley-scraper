AB  - Summary Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is a major chronic medical condition associated with back pain. To better understand the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration, we performed comparative and quantitative proteomic analyses of normal and degenerated human annulus fibrosus (AF) cells and identified proteins that are differentially expressed between them. Annulus fibrosus cells were isolated and cultured from patients with lumbar disc herniation (the experimental group, degenerated AF cells) and scoliosis patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery (the control group, normal AF cells). Comparative proteomic analyses of normal and degenerated cultured AF cells were carried out using 2-D electrophoresis, mass spectrometric analyses, and database searching. Quantitative analyses of silver-stained 2-D electrophoresis gels of normal and degenerated cultured AF cells identified 10 protein spots that showed the most altered differential expression levels between the two groups. Among these, three proteins were decreased, including heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein, glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, and protocadherin-23, whereas seven proteins were increased, including guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit α-2, superoxide dismutase, transmembrane protein 51, adenosine receptor A3, 26S protease regulatory subunit 8, lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein, and fatty acyl-crotonic acid reductase 1. These differentially expressed proteins might be involved in the pathophysiological process of IVD degeneration and have potential values as biomarkers of the degeneration of IVD.

AB  - Abstract Seven large European Union (EU)?funded epilepsy-related research projects joined forces in May 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, in a unique community building event?the epiXchange conference. During this conference, 170 investigators from the projects DESIRE, EpimiRNA, EPISTOP, EpiTarget, EpiXchange, and EpiPGX as well as the European Reference Network EpiCARE, met up with key stakeholders including representatives of the European Commission, patient organizations, commercial partners, and other European and International groups. The epiXchange conference focused on sharing and reviewing the advances made by each project in the previous 5 years; describing the infrastructures generated; and discussing the innovations and commercial applications across five thematic areas: biomarkers, genetics, therapeutics, comorbidities, and biobanks and resources. These projects have, in fact, generated major breakthroughs including the discovery of biofluid-based molecules for diagnosis, elucidating new genetic causes of epilepsy, creating advanced new models of epilepsy, and the pre-clinical development of novel compounds. Workshop-style discussions focused on how to overcome scientific and clinical challenges for accelerating translation of research outcomes and how to increase synergies between the projects and stakeholders at a European level. The resulting advances would lead toward a measurable impact of epilepsy research through better diagnostics, treatments, and quality-of-life for persons with epilepsy. In addition, epiXchange provided a unique forum for examining how the different projects could build momentum for future novel groundbreaking epilepsy research in Europe and beyond. This report includes the main recommendations that resulted from these discussions.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The demands in the Standardbred trotters industry require young, still growing horses, to be trained well above light exercise level. During that period, the risk of occurrence of energy imbalance and maladaptation to training is high. In man, the lack of energy homeostasis is considered as the basic problem in the development of chronic fatigue. Objective: To find objective biomarkers of early maladaptation to training in young racehorses under field conditions. Materials and methods: Sixty-five 2-year-old Standardbreds were followed during their first 3 months of training in 5 different training centres. Monthly measurement of morphological variables (weight, height at withers, body condition score, body composition), basic haemato-biochemical variables and endocrine levels (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones, leptin, IGF1, prolactin) were undertaken. Feeding levels and training programmes were also evaluated. At the end of the 3 month period, on the basis of an abnormal weight loss, 14 young horses were suspected of maladaptation to training (MT group). Morphological, haemato-biochemical, endocrine changes were compared between MT group (n = 14) and control group (C group, n = 40). Analysis of variance was calculated to study the effects of time and maladaptation to training. Results: Compared to C group, MT group showed a significant higher weight loss in relation to a higher loss of fat mass and body condition score (P<0.05). MT group presented higher GGT and white cell counts and lower red cell counts (P<0.05). Finally, MT group showed significant lower levels of T4 (P = 0.03) than C group. Conclusion: Some young horses presented signs of energy imbalance which were also associated with haematobiochemical and endocrine changes. Those markers might be useful for identification of maladaptation to training.

AB  - Introduction Heart rate (HR) and blood lactate (LAC) are biomarkers whose responses to exercise are related to physical fitness. This study evaluated the cost of transport (CT) by assessing the cardiovascular and metabolic efficiency of jumping horses using an incremental jumping test. Methods Sixteen Brazilian Sport horses of two fitness levels were used: high-level jumpers (HL, n?=?8) and low-level jumpers (LL, n?=?8). Tests were performed in a sandy jumping arena at a mean velocity of 18?km/h; the tests were distributed into three steps of 4?laps of 74?m, each with 10 obstacles. Each stage consisted of simple obstacles that were 0.40, 0.60 and 0.80?m high. The costs of transport were determined as (HRstep-HRrest/speed) and (LACstep-LACrest/speed). During intervals between each stage, blood samples were drawn to determine LAC (mmol/L). Student's t-test was used for the unpaired samples (P<0.05). Results There was no difference in the stage 0.40?m for HR. There were differences in the HL and LL groups, respectively, in the HR related to the effort in the obstacle series 0.60?m [1.7?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) and 2.0?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) (P?=?0.02)]; 0.80?m [1.5?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) and 1.7?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h); (P?=?0.04)], and in the LAC for the 0.40?m obstacle [0.05?±?0.04?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.10?±?0.03?mmol/L/(km/h); P?=?0.04]; 0.60?m [0.07?±?0.06?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.14?±?0.03?mmol/L/(km/h); (P?=?0.006)] and 0.80?m [0.11?±?0.04?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.19?±?0.05?mmol/L/(km/h); P?=?0.009]. Conclusions The CT differentiated horses of high and low level jumping fitness. The HR method (rather than LAC) is particularly useful because it is simple, inexpensive and accessible to trainers and veterinarians.

AB  - Summary This chapter overviews the advances in digital biosensors operating in the binary (YES/NO) mode, mostly emphasizing biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. The attractive performance of the new enzyme logic biosensors holds considerable promise for diverse practical and important future applications, including novel forensic and security applications. The chapter describes how the biomedical analysis can benefit from the use of biomolecular information processing (biocomputing) systems. Forensic analysis of biofluids can benefit from novel bioanalytical/biosensing methods, including those based on the biocomputing approach. The chapter also overviews the application of binary biosensing methods based on the enzyme logic gates to various types of injury biomarkers, particularly concentrating on battlefield injuries. It shows that the simplest logic processing based mostly on logic AND/OR gates, applied to biochemical input signals.

AB  - Overview Melanoma comprises a wide variety of malignant cell types arising from the skin, the mucous membranes, and the pigmented cells of the eye. While these tumors are all classified as melanoma and share a common molecular biology of pigmentation and biological resemblance to cells of neural crest origin, important distinctions in other molecular characteristics and patterns of exposure to ultraviolet light as a carcinogen determine their clinical natural history, including the response to therapeutic interventions. While the majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early stage and curable with minimal surgery, melanoma has the potential for early and widespread dissemination via lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy for primary, regional, and many cases of single- or oligo-metastatic disease, but systemic therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis for metastatic melanoma, particularly immunotherapies that enhance existing cellular immunity. The rapid discovery of new molecular targets, immunotherapy combinations (including the use of radiotherapy), and understanding of the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance are likely to lead to even greater improvements in the prognosis for patients with melanoma in the near future.

AB  - Anticoagulant therapy, combined with platelet-directed inhibitors, represents a standard-of-care in the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome, particularly those who require percutaneous coronary interventions. While a vast clinical experience, coupled with large clinical trials have collectively provided guidance, an optimal anticoagulant drug and applied strategy, defined as one that reduces thrombotic and hemorrhagic events consistently, with minimal off-target effects and active control of systemic anticoagulation according to patient and clinical-setting specific need, remains at large. An advancing knowledge of coagulation, hemostasis, and thrombosis suggests that factor IXa, a protease that governs thrombin generation in common thrombotic disorders may represent a prime target for pharmacologic inhibition.

AB  - Abstract Deoxynivalenol (DON, also known as vomitoxin) is a common mycotoxin found worldwide, especially in contaminated food. DON is toxic to a variety of cells and tissues in humans. Three kinds of conjugated products (DON-3-glucuronide, DON-15-glucuronide and DON-7-glucuronide) can be found as major metabolites in human urine. Females and males show different patterns of exposure levels, and human exposure to DON also shows some geographical differences because of different DON levels in cereal-based foods, food intake habits and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression. Specifically, the C12, 13-deepoxy metabolite was found predominantly in French adults but was rarely detected in UK adults. However, a cohort of Spanish individuals demonstrated even lower DON levels than the levels in the UK populations, whereas a very high DON exposure level was detected in South Africa and Linxian, China. Recent publications have further indicated that DON could be detected in the urine of pregnant women from different countries, which suggests that there is a potential risk to both mothers and foetuses. Additionally, phytochemicals have been shown to be less toxic to cells and laboratory animals in research studies and may also be used as food additives for reducing the toxic effects of DON. In this review, we provide global information on DON metabolism, human exposure and gender differences in humans. Also, control strategies for this mycotoxin are discussed.

AB  - Abstract The objectives of this study were to evaluate temporal changes in lubricin, hyaluronan (HA), and HA molecular weight (MW) distributions in three distinct models of equine joint injury affecting the carpal (wrist), tarsal (ankle), and femoropatellar (knee) joints. To establish ranges for lubricin, HA, and HA MW distributions across multiple joints, we first evaluated clinically healthy, high-motion equine joints. Synovial fluid was collected from high-motion joints in horses without clinical signs of joint disease (n?=?11 horses, 102 joints) and from research horses undergoing carpal osteochondral fragmentation (n?=?8), talar cartilage impact injury (n?=?7), and femoral trochlear ridge full-thickness cartilage injury (n?=?22) prior to and following arthroscopically induced joint injury. Lubricin and HA concentrations were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and gel electrophoresis was performed to evaluate HA MW distributions. Synovial fluid parameters were analyzed via linear regression models, revealing that lubricin and HA concentrations were conserved across healthy, high-motion joints. Lubricin concentrations increased post-injury in all osteoarthritis models (carpal fragmentation P?=?.001; talar impact P?<?.001; femoral trochlear ridge cartilage defect P?=?.03). Sustained loss of HA was noted post-arthroscopy following carpal osteochondral fragmentation (P?<?.0001) and talar impact injury (P?<?.001). Lubricin may be elevated to compensate for the loss of HA and to protect cartilage post-injury. Further investigation into the mechanisms regulating lubricin and HA following joint injury and their effects on joint homeostasis is warranted, including whether lubricin has value as a biomarker for post-traumatic osteoarthritis.

AB  - Nucleosomes, complexes of DNA and histone proteins, are released during cell death into the blood circulation. Elevated serum and plasma levels have been found in various forms of cancer, but also in autoimmune diseases and acute situations such as stroke, trauma, and during sepsis. Here, the clinical relevance of circulating nucleosomes for diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of cancer is reviewed. Several studies have shown that levels of nucleosomes are significantly higher in serum and plasma of cancer patients in comparison to healthy controls. However, because of elevations of nucleosome levels in patients with benign diseases relevant for differential diagnosis, they are not suitable for cancer diagnosis. Concerning tumor staging, nucleosome levels correlate with tumor stage and presence of metastases in gastrointestinal cancer, but not in other tumor types. Prognostic value of circulating nucleosomes is found in lung cancer in univariate analyses, but not in multivariate analyses. Circulating nucleosomes are most informative for the monitoring of cytotoxic therapy. Strongly decreasing levels are mainly found in patients with remission of disease, whereas constantly high or increasing values are associated with progressive disease during chemo- and radiotherapy. In addition, therapy outcome is already indicated by the nucleosomal course during the first week of chemo- and radiotherapy in patients with lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer as well as in hematologic malignancies. Despite their non-tumor-specificity, kinetics of nucleosomes are valuable markers for the early estimation of therapeutic efficacy and may be helpful to adapting early cancer therapy in the future.

AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an increasingly common problem. We hypothesized that VTE occurs most commonly in tertiary care settings and that the pattern of associated illnesses may have changed from earlier reports. Methods The Kids' Inpatient Database 2006 was utilized to identify children ≤18 years old with in-hospital VTE. Children were identified by the presence of thrombosis specific ICD-9-CM diagnosis or procedure codes. Remaining ICD-9-CM codes were utilized to categorize patients by acute or chronic illness. The incidence of in-hospital VTE by hospital type, age, gender, race, and disposition were estimated. Results Over 4,500 children met the inclusion criteria (188/100,000 discharges). Most VTE discharges (67.5%) were from children's hospitals (RR 5.09; 95% CI 4.76; 5.44). Underlying chronic illnesses were associated with most VTE (76.2%), most commonly: cardiovascular (18.4%), malignancy (15.7%), and neuromuscular disease (9.9%). VTE not associated with chronic illness were most often idiopathic (12.6%), followed by infections (9.5%), and trauma (9.1%). The greatest proportions of children with VTE were infants (23.1%) and adolescents (37.8%). However, when standardized against the entire database of discharges, infants were least likely to develop VTE (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.43; 0.52), while adolescents were at highest risk (RR 1.89; 95% CI 1.73; 2.07). Hospitalizations ending with death were more likely to include VTE (RR 6.16; 95% CI 5.32; 7.13). Conclusions Pediatric VTE is most commonly seen in tertiary care. Adolescents are at greatest risk to develop in-hospital VTE. Patients whose hospitalization ended with death are at much greater risk to develop VTE.

AB  - Purpose Myelin water imaging (MWI) using multi-echo T2 relaxation is a quantitative MRI technique that can be used as an in vivo biomarker for myelin in the central nervous system. MWI using a multi-echo spin echo sequence currently takes more than 20?min to acquire eight axial slices (5?mm thickness) in the cervical spinal cord, making spinal cord MWI impractical for implementation in clinical studies. Methods In this study, an accelerated gradient and spin echo sequence (GRASE), previously validated for brain MWI, was adapted for spinal cord MWI. Ten healthy volunteers were scanned with the GRASE sequence (acquisition time 8.5?min) and compared with the multi-echo spin echo sequence (acquisition time 23.5?min). Results Using region of interest analysis, myelin estimates obtained from the two sequences were found to be in good agreement (mean difference?=??0.0092, 95% confidence interval?=? 0.0092?±?0.061; regression slope?=?1.01, ??=?0.9). MWI using GRASE was shown to be highly reproducible with an average coefficient of variation of 6.1%. Conclusion The results from this study show that MWI can be performed in the cervical spinal cord in less than 10?min, allowing for practical implementation in multimodal clinical studies.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is challenging for the lack of a specific diagnostic test. Recent researches in quantitative proteomics, however, offer new opportunities for biomarker discovery and the study of disease pathogenesis. To find more potential protein biomarkers, we used two technologies, 2-dimensional fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromato-graph coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS), to quantitatively analyse differential proteomic expression in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between patients with MS (the experiment group) and patients with other neurological diseases (ONDs; the control group). Analysis by the former technology identified more than 43 different protein spots (39 proteins), of which 17 spots (13 proteins) showed more than 1.5-fold difference in abundance as analysed by DeCyder software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway. NJ, USA) between the MS and the ONDs groups. The expression of five protein spots was elevated and the expression of 12 protein spots was decreased in the MS group. Meanwhile, the latter method, UPLC/Q-TOF MS showed 68 different proteins. There were 45 proteins with a difference of more than 1.5 folds between the two groups, in which the expression of 20 proteins was elevated and the expression of 25 proteins was decreased in the MS group. Data provided by the two methods indicated that the proteins overlapped ratio was 27% in the 26 significant proteins that had the same regulation tendency. The differential CSF proteins were analysed further by biological network and it revealed interaction of them. The subsequent ELISA measuring the concentration of cystatin C (P < 0.01), which was one of the proteins discovered simultaneously with the two technologies, confirmed the results of the two quantitative proteomic analysis. The combination of the two quantitative proteomic technologies was helpful in discovering differentially expressed proteins that may have a connection with MS disease physiology and serve as useful biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of MS diseases.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, lymphangiogenesis, the process of lymphatic vessel formation from existing lymph vessels, has been demonstrated to have a significant role in diverse pathologies, including cancer metastasis, organ graft rejection, and lymphedema. Our understanding of the mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis has advanced on the heels of studies demonstrating vascular endothelial growth factor C as a central pro-lymphangiogenic regulator and others identifying multiple lymphatic endothelial biomarkers. Despite these breakthroughs and a growing appreciation of the signaling events that govern the lymphangiogenic process, there are no FDA-approved drugs that target lymphangiogenesis. In this review, we reflect on the lessons available from the development of antiangiogenic therapies (26 FDA-approved drugs to date), review current lymphangiogenesis research including nanotechnology in therapeutic drug delivery and imaging, and discuss molecules in the lymphangiogenic pathway that are promising therapeutic targets.
