AB  - Abstract Like virtually all age-related chronic diseases, late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops over an extended preclinical period and is associated with modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors. We hypothesize that multimodal interventions that address many risk factors simultaneously and are individually tailored to patients may help reduce AD risk. We describe a novel clinical methodology used to evaluate and treat patients at two Alzheimer's Prevention Clinics. The framework applies evidence-based principles of clinical precision medicine to tailor individualized recommendations, follow patients longitudinally to continually refine the interventions, and evaluate N-of-1 effectiveness (trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03687710). Prior preliminary results suggest that the clinical practice of AD risk reduction is feasible, with measurable improvements in cognition and biomarkers of AD risk. We propose using these early findings as a foundation to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of personalized risk management within an international network of clinician researchers in a cohort study possibly leading to a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Inherent and acquired resistance of cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a significant impediment to effective radiation cancer treatment. As important intracellular factors, aberrant tumor transmembrane signal transduction pathways, which include the prosurvival cascades (PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT) and the proapoptosis pathways (Wnt, p53 and TNF-α/NF-?B), have been proved to be crucial determinants of the probability of cell sensitivity to radiation in malignant lesions. There is increasing evidence that targeting the abnormal pathways that can regulate the activity of the DNA damage response and further influence the response of tumor cells to radiation may be suitable for improving radiation sensitization. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that agents targeting aberrant tumor signals can effectively improve the therapeutic effect of ionizing radiation. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the intricate interplay between tumor responses to radiation with the aberrant signal pathways, and the potential druggable targets within the pathways to sensitize tumors without significant collateral damage to normal tissues. The application of novel targeting compounds to manipulate the aberrant signal of tumor cells in clinical treatments is also addressed.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common among people with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and accelerate the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis caused by HCV. Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) beta-receptor agonist, differs from medications for AUDs currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as it is metabolized primarily through the kidneys. The primary outcome of this study was to compare baclofen with a placebo in the percentage of days abstinent from alcohol. Design A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. Setting Hepatology clinics in four separate US Veteran Affairs Medical Centers in the United States. Participants One hundred and eighty Veteran men and women older than 18 years with chronic HCV, a comorbid AUD and current alcohol use. Intervention and Comparator Oral baclofen was given at dosages of 0 (placebo) or 30 mg/day over 12 weeks with concomitant manual-guided counseling. Measurements The primary measurement was percentage of days abstinent during the 12-week study period between the baclofen and placebo groups [measured by time-line follow-back (TLFB)]. Secondary measurements were the percentage of Veterans who achieved complete abstinence, the percentage of Veterans who achieved no heavy drinking between weeks 4 and 12 of the study, alcohol craving, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Findings Primary outcome: compared with placebo, baclofen did not improve the percentage of days abstinent. For all subjects there were significant reductions from baseline to 12 weeks in percentage of days abstinent from 37.0% [standard error (SE) = 2.7] to 68.6% (SE = 2.8, F(1151.1) = 66.1, P < 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between groups for change in percentage of days abstinent over the 12-week study period [absolute difference 1.3% (?9.1 to 1.7%), F(1152.6) = 0.005, P = 0.95]. Secondary outcomes: Of subjects who completed the first 4 weeks of the study, 8.9% (15 of 168) achieved complete abstinence; 10.1% (nine of 89) in the placebo group and 7.6% (six of 79) in the baclofen group [?2(1) = 0.33, odds ratio (OR) = 0.73 (0.24?2.15)]. The percentage of no heavy drinking for all subjects between weeks 4 and 12 was 20.2% (34 of 168), but no statistically significant differences were found between placebo 15.7% (14 of 89) and baclofen 25.3% (20 of 79) [?2(1) = 2.38, OR = 1.82 (0.85?3.90)]. There were significant reductions for all subjects in all other secondary variables over the course of the study, but no differences between groups. Measures of various biomarkers of alcohol use did not change significantly throughout the course of the study for either the baclofen or placebo groups. Conclusions Baclofen administered at 30 mg/day does not appear to be superior to placebo in increasing abstinence or in reducing alcohol use, cravings for alcohol or anxiety among people with alcohol use disorder.

AB  - Abstract Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex condition with multiple factors contributing to its aetiology and pathophysiology. Aetiologically these include genetics, life-time events and environment, and physiologically, changes in motility, central processing, visceral sensitivity, immunity, epithelial permeability and gastrointestinal microflora. Such complexity means there is currently no specific reliable biomarker for IBS, and thus IBS continues to be diagnosed and classified according to symptom based criteria, the Rome Criteria. Carefully phenotyping and characterisation of a ?large? pool of IBS patients across Europe and even the world however, might help identify sub-populations with accuracy and consistency. This will not only aid future research but improve tailoring of treatment and health care of IBS patients. Purpose The aim of this position paper is to discuss the requirements necessary to standardize the process of selecting and phenotyping IBS patients and how to organise the collection and storage of patient information/samples in such a large multi-centre pan European/global study. We include information on general demographics, gastrointestinal symptom assessment, psychological factors, quality of life, physiological evaluation, genetic/epigenetic and microbiota analysis, biopsy/blood sampling, together with discussion on the organisational, ethical and language issues associated with implementing such a study. The proposed approach and documents selected to be used in such a study was the result of a thoughtful and thorough four-year dialogue amongst experts associated with the European COST action BM1106 GENIEUR (www.GENIEUR.eu).

AB  - Summary Tuberculosis remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases. In 2014, tuberculosis developed in an estimated 9.6 million people, and 1.5 million died of the disease (1). The principal causative organism is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an obligate pathogen that is a member of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC), a group of closely related organisms that primarily infect different animal hosts. Tuberculosis may involve every organ in the body, but the most common clinical presentation is pulmonary disease, in which transmission is via infectious aerosols released from the lungs of an infected person. In the alveolus of the lung, inhaled tubercle bacilli are ingested by macrophages and are normally contained by the host immune response. This leads to granuloma formation and eventually to calcified lesions. Swallowing infected sputum can cause intestinal tuberculosis. Transmission can occur via direct contact in cases of scrofula (skin tuberculosis). In addition, ingestion of milk or food from an infected animal can cause human infection with Mycobacterium bovis or other members of the MTBC. However, subsequent transmission of these animal MTBC lineages from person to person is rare. M. tuberculosis can survive and grow within macrophages, so that it is able to evade the host immune system. An active cell-mediated immune response is required to contain and kill the tubercle bacilli, so any underlying conditions that reduce its efficiency increase susceptibility to tuberculosis. One-third of the global population is estimated to have latent tuberculosis infection. These individuals do not have active disease but may develop it in the near or remote future, a process called tuberculosis reactivation. The lifetime risk for reactivation is estimated to be 5% to 10%, with tuberculosis developing in the majority of cases within the first 5 years after initial infection. However, the risk is considerably higher in the presence of predisposing factors (2).

AB  - Abstract Compared to the other classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), that is, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, heparin/heparan sulfate and hyaluronan, keratan sulfate (KS), have the least known of its interactive properties. In the human body, the cornea and the brain are the two most abundant tissue sources of KS. Embryonic KS is synthesized as a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain of d-galactose-GlcNAc repeat disaccharides which become progressively sulfated with development, sulfation of GlcNAc is more predominant than galactose. KS contains multi-sulfated high-charge density, monosulfated and non-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine regions and thus is a heterogeneous molecule in terms of chain length and charge distribution. A recent proteomics study on corneal KS demonstrated its interactivity with members of the Slit-Robbo and Ephrin-Ephrin receptor families and proteins which regulate Rho GTPase signaling and actin polymerization/depolymerization in neural development and differentiation. KS decorates a number of peripheral nervous system/CNS proteoglycan (PG) core proteins. The astrocyte KS-PG abakan defines functional margins of the brain and is up-regulated following trauma. The chondroitin sulfate/KS PG aggrecan forms perineuronal nets which are dynamic neuroprotective structures with anti-oxidant properties and roles in neural differentiation, development and synaptic plasticity. Brain phosphacan a chondroitin sulfate, KS, HNK-1 PG have roles in neural development and repair. The intracellular microtubule and synaptic vesicle KS-PGs MAP1B and SV2 have roles in metabolite transport, storage, and export of neurotransmitters and cytoskeletal assembly. MAP1B has binding sites for tubulin and actin through which it promotes cytoskeletal development in growth cones and is highly expressed during neurite extension. The interactive capability of KS with neuroregulatory ligands indicate varied roles for KS-PGs in development and regenerative neural processes.

AB  - Allostatic load (AL) is a complex clinical construct, providing a unique window into the cumulative impact of stress. However, due to its inherent complexity, AL presents two major measurement challenges to conventional statistical modeling (the field's dominant methodology): it is comprised of a complex causal network of bioallostatic systems, represented by an even larger set of dynamic biomarkers; and, it is situated within a web of antecedent socioecological systems, linking AL to differences in health outcomes and disparities. To address these challenges, we employed case-based computational modeling (CBM), which allowed us to make four advances: (1) we developed a multisystem, 7-factor (20 biomarker) model of AL's network of allostatic systems; (2) used it to create a catalog of nine different clinical AL profiles (causal pathways); (3) linked each clinical profile to a typology of 23 health outcomes; and (4) explored our results (post hoc) as a function of gender, a key socioecological factor. In terms of highlights, (a) the Healthy clinical profile had few health risks; (b) the pro-inflammatory profile linked to high blood pressure and diabetes; (c) Low Stress Hormones linked to heart disease, TIA/Stroke, diabetes, and circulation problems; and (d) high stress hormones linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Post hoc analyses also found that males were overrepresented on the High Blood Pressure (61.2%), Metabolic Syndrome (63.2%), High Stress Hormones (66.4%), and High Blood Sugar (57.1%); while females were overrepresented on the Healthy (81.9%), Low Stress Hormones (66.3%), and Low Stress Antagonists (stress buffers) (95.4%) profiles. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Environmental factors are poorly understood in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The importance of environmental factors in gene environment interactions (GxE) is suggested by wide individual differences in cognitive loss, even for carriers of AD-risk genetic variants. Results and Discussion We propose the ?AD exposome? to comprehensively assess the modifiable environmental factors relevant to genetic underpinnings of cognitive aging and AD. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous environmental factors requires multi-generational consideration of these interactions over age and time (GxExT). New computational approaches to the multi-level complexities may identify accessible interventions for individual brain aging. International collaborations on diverse populations are needed to identify the most relevant exposures over the life course for GxE interactions.

AB  - Abstract Background Cardiopulmonary arrest in paediatric patients often results in death or survival with severe brain injury. Therapeutic hypothermia, lowering of the core body temperature to 32 °C to 34 °C, may reduce injury to the brain in the period after the circulation has been restored. This therapy has been effective in neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and adults after witnessed ventricular fibrillation cardiopulmonary arrest. The effect of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiopulmonary arrest in paediatric patients is unknown. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia after paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11); Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to December 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to December 2011); Ovid CINAHL (1982 to December 2011); Ovid BIOSIS (1923 to December 2011); and Web of Science (1945 to December 2011). We searched the trials registry databases for ongoing trials. We also contacted international experts in therapeutic hypothermia and paediatric critical care to locate further published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing therapeutic hypothermia with normothermia or standard care in children, aged 24 hours to 18 years, after paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. Main results We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found four on-going randomized controlled trials which may be available for analysis in the future. We excluded 18 non-randomized studies. Of these 18 non-randomized studies, three compared therapeutic hypothermia with standard therapy and demonstrated no difference in mortality or the proportion of children with a good neurological outcome; a narrative report was presented.   Authors' conclusions Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are needed and the results of on-going trials will be assessed when available. Plain Language Summary Therapeutic hypothermia as a neuroprotective therapy after cardiopulmonary arrest in children Cardiopulmonary arrest in children is uncommon however the numbers of children who survive are very low. Resulting brain injury in the survivors can be devastating for the child and family. Cooling the patient to a temperature of 32 °C to 34 °C, which is 3 °C to 4 °C below normal (therapeutic hypothermia), has previously been found to improve survival and reduce brain injury in newborn infants who were deprived of oxygen during birth, and also in adults following cardiopulmonary arrest. The causes of cardiopulmonary arrest are different in children than in adults, and asphyxia at birth is also different, so the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the proportion of children who survive or who have brain injury is unclear. We therefore conducted a Cochrane systematic review of the literature, searching medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) until December 2011 and contacting international experts for high quality published and unpublished evidence. Our searches failed to find any randomized controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria. However, we found four on-going trials which, when completed, may contribute to our review. At present there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute the use of therapeutic hypothermia within a few hours after return of spontaneous blood flow following cardiopulmonary arrest in children. International resuscitation guidelines currently recommend that doctors consider using the therapy in infants and children although more research is needed to be sure this is the correct recommendation with the lack of treatment options other than supportive care in an intensive care unit that are available.

AB  - Summary Chest pain and dyspnoea are among the most common complaints seen in the emergency department, accounting for nearly 20% of all visits. This chapter focuses on acute coronary syndrome, non-ischaemia-related chest pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition to ischemic heart disease, causes of chest pain may include pulmonary embolus, disorders of the pericardium, pleura and the chest wall, as well as oesophageal and spinal. A combination of focused cardiac and lung ultrasound can elucidate multiple causes of chest pain. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium, especially pericardial effusion. In addition to heart failure, a number of disorders can cause dyspnoea, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, deconditioning, metabolic acidosis, anxiety and many others. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been used for many years for distinguishing dyspnoea of pulmonary origin from that of cardiac origin.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - Summary Correct pulpal diagnosis is the key to all endodontic treatments. It is paramount to have established a clinical diagnosis of the pulp and the periapical tissue prior cutting access into the pulp chamber or to do any other treatment to a tooth. Clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests in addition to a comprehensive knowledge of the reaction of the pulp to caries, operative manipulations, trauma, and periodontal disease, enable us to establish an empirical pulp diagnosis only. The history of symptoms for the diagnosis of reversible pulpitis will mainly reveal provoked pain or sensation, and the tooth will only bother the patient when the tooth is exposed to a hot and/or cold or other excitatory stimuli. Like pulpal inflammation, the periapical inflammation can be symptom-free and only diagnosed in a chronic phase on a periapical radiograph. Determining the endodontic diagnosis prior to any invasive endodontic, or even any dental, procedure is paramount.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is one of the common malignant tumours of female reproductive organs. Due to early diagnosis difficulties and lack of effective treatment in the late stage, ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate in female reproductive system malignancies. Therefore, finding reliable early diagnosis indicators and new therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer is an urgent problem to be solved. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) is a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family, which has been found to possess multi-effects in tumourigenesis and development. Here, we reported that CXCL14 was preferentially expressed in ovarian cancer. By analysing the TCGA database, we found that CXCL14 was highly expressed in advanced ovarian cancer patients and correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, the abnormal high CXCL14 levels were observed in serum and ovarian tissue of ovarian cancer patients by qRT-PCR and ELISA. In vitro and in vivo experiments both confirmed that overexpression of CXCL14 promoted the ovarian cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, transfection of CXCL14 increased the phosphorylation level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and administration of STAT3 inhibitor III inhibited the tumour-promoting effects of CXCL14. Therefore, our study suggests that CXCL14 could be utilised as a novel adjunct biomarker for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer and provides new targets and ideas for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Significance paragraph CXCL14 could be utilised as a novel adjunct biomarker for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer and provides new targets and ideas for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
