AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Abstract Functional chronic visceral pain (FCVP) is one of the most common causes of morbidity in the general population. Pain perceived within the abdomen may occur due to a range of different mechanisms according to the organ and their afferent pathways. Advances in our understanding of the complexities of FCVP could lead to the exploitation of contemporary research in order to develop and utilize our understanding of neurobiological and psychobiological visceral mechanisms in a clinical setting. This progression, together with increasing amounts of epidemiological and gender based information concerning specific abdominal pain syndromes can allow us to develop assessment tools that go beyond disease only analysis and move toward a more comprehensive assessment model so that patients may have access to expert or multidisciplinary management sooner, rather than later. Based on current evidence, one must consider the main contributors to pain, whether it is nociceptive, neuropathic or psychosocial or as is common with FCVP, a combination of all three. Aim.? This comprehensive assessment model should encompass not only systematic evaluation for reliable communication, but should also progress toward idiographic diagnosis relating to the uniqueness of the patient. This model should be practical in a multidisciplinary setting, taking into account the multi-faceted nature of this presentation.

AB  - Abstract Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a condition that can develop in about half of the patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of lower limbs. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in the early phases of DVT and their correlation with the onset of PTS. Patients were enrolled after the first episode of DVT and were followed up for 1, 4, 8, 12 and 18 months. At each visit, blood sample was collected to evaluate plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1,-2,-3,-7,-8 and -9 MMP inhibitors, TIMP-1,-2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Analysis included 201 patients [86 males (42·79%) and 115 females (57·21%); average age 56 ± 7 years]. Of the 201 patients, 47 (23·38%; 21 males, 26 females) developed PTS during the follow-up period. The control group was made up of 60 individuals without DVT (22 males and 38 females). High plasma levels of MMPs, NGAL and cytokines were recorded during the acute phase after DVT. Moreover, patients with PTS showed higher levels of MMP-1 and MMP-8 with respect to patients without PTS. There is a close relationship between DVT, the individual risk of PTS and specific biomarkers such as MMPs and other related molecules, which may help guide prevention and therapy based on the patient's individual risk profile, and has to be studied in future.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - Inflammation is a hallmark of virtually all liver diseases, such as liver cancer, fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cholangiopathies. Liver macrophages have been thoroughly studied in human disease and mouse models, unravelling that the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system is more versatile and complex than previously believed. Liver macrophages mainly consist of liver-resident phagocytes, or Kupffer cells (KCs), and bone marrow-derived recruited monocytes. Although both cell populations in the liver demonstrate principal functions of macrophages, such as phagocytosis, danger signal recognition, cytokine release, antigen processing, and the ability to orchestrate immune responses, KCs and recruited monocytes retain characteristic ontogeny markers and remain remarkably distinct on several functional aspects. While KCs dominate the hepatic macrophage pool in homeostasis (?sentinel function?), monocyte-derived macrophages prevail in acute or chronic injury (?emergency response team?), making them an interesting target for novel therapeutic approaches in liver disease. In addition, recent data acquired by unbiased large-scale techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, unraveled a previously unrecognized complexity of human and murine macrophage polarization abilities, far beyond the old dogma of inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Despite tremendous progress, numerous challenges remain in deciphering the full spectrum of macrophage activation and its implication in either promoting liver disease progression or repairing injured liver tissue. Being aware of such heterogeneity in cell origin and function is of crucial importance when studying liver diseases, developing novel therapeutic interventions, defining macrophage-based prognostic biomarkers, or designing clinical trials. Growing knowledge in gene expression modulation and emerging technologies in drug delivery may soon allow shaping macrophage populations toward orchestrating beneficial rather than detrimental inflammatory responses.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether proinflammatory biomarkers are associated with frailty assessed according to functional status, mobility, mental health, and falls over 24 months. Design Secondary analysis of a 2-year double-blind clinical trial for osteoporosis. Setting Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Participants Women aged 65 and older with osteoporosis in long-term care (LTC) (N = 178). Measurements Baseline serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and soluble receptors (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its two receptors (TNFα-R1 and TNFα-R2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), IL-10), functional status assessed according to activities of daily living, the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test, gait speed, cognitive status, mental health, and falls. Results At baseline, older age was moderately associated with higher serum concentrations of hs-CRP (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.22), TNFα-R1 (r = 0.36), TNFα-R2 (r = 0.34), and IL-10 (r = 0.16) (all P < .05). Frail participants had significantly higher hs-CRP, TNFα-R1, TNFα-R2, IL-6, and IL-6-sR levels (all P < .05) than those nonfrail participants. Higher baseline hs-CRP and IL-6 levels were associated with worse physical performance and gait speed at 12 months independent of age, zoledronic acid use, and comorbidity (|r| = 0.25?0.30; all P < .05). Inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with incident falls. Conclusions Higher proinflammatory biomarker levels are associated with frailty and poorer function and mobility in older women residing in LTC facilities.

AB  - ABSTRACT In an effort to develop quantitative biomarkers for degenerative joint disease and fill the void that exists for diagnosing, monitoring, and assessing the extent of whole joint degeneration, the past decade has been marked by a greatly increased role of noninvasive imaging. This coupled with recent advances in image processing and deep learning opens new possibilities for promising quantitative techniques. The clinical translation of quantitative imaging was previously hampered by tedious non-scalable and subjective image analysis. Osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis using X-rays can be automated by the use of deep learning models and pilot studies showed feasibility of using similar techniques to reliably segment multiple musculoskeletal tissues and detect and stage the severity of morphological abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Automation and more advanced feature extraction techniques have applications on larger more heterogeneous samples. Analyses based on voxel based relaxometry have shown local patterns in relaxation time elevations and local correlations with outcome variables. Bone cartilage interactions are also enhanced by the analysis of three-dimensional bone morphology and the potential for the assessment of metabolic activity with simultaneous Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/MR systems. Novel techniques in image processing and deep learning are augmenting imaging to be a source of quantitative and reliable data and new multidimensional analytics allow us to exploit the interactions of data from various sources. In this review, we aim to summarize recent advances in quantitative imaging, the application of image processing and deep learning techniques to study knee and hip OA. ?2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? This article is aimed to review the novel actions of progesterone, which otherwise is considered as a female reproductive hormone. The article focuses on its important physiological actions in males too and gives an overview of its novel perspectives in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system. Key findings? Progesterone may have a potential benefit in treatment of traumatic brain injury, various neurological disorders and male related diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer and osteoporosis. Norethisterone (NETA), a progesterone derivative, decreases bone mineral loss in male castrated mice suggesting its role in osteoporosis. In the future, progesterone may find use as a male contraceptive too, but still needs confirmatory trials for safety, tolerability and acceptability. Megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative is preferred in prostatic cancer. Further, it may find utility in nicotine addiction, traumatic brain injury (recently entered Phase III trial) and Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathy and crush injuries. Studies also suggest role of progesterone in stroke, for which further clinical trials are needed. The non genomic actions of progesterone may be in part responsible for these novel actions. Summary? Although progesterone has shown promising role in various non-hormonal benefits, further clinical studies are needed to prove its usefulness in conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuropathy and crush injury. In male related illnesses like BPH and prostatic Ca, it may prove a boon in near future. New era of hormonal male contraception may be initiated by use of progesterone along with testosterone.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the key inflammatory pathways that are activated in the peripheral and CNS compartments at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Methods A cross-sectional study of patients with clinical and biomarker characteristics consistent with MCI-AD in a discovery cohort, with replication in the Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Inflammatory analytes were measured in the CSF and plasma with the same validated multiplex analyte platform in both cohorts and correlated with AD biomarkers (CSF A?42, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) to identify key inflammatory pathway activations. The pathways were additionally validated by evaluating genes related to all analytes in coexpression networks of brain tissue transcriptome from an autopsy confirmed AD cohort to interrogate if the same pathway activations were conserved in the brain tissue gene modules. Results Analytes of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (KEGG ID:4668) in the CSF and plasma best correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau levels, and analytes of the complement and coagulation pathway (KEGG ID:4610) best correlated with CSF A?42 levels. The top inflammatory signaling pathways of significance were conserved in the peripheral and the CNS compartments. They were also confirmed to be enriched in AD brain transcriptome gene clusters. Interpretation A cell-protective rather than a proinflammatory analyte profile predominates in the CSF in relation to neurodegeneration markers among MCI-AD patients. Analytes from the TNF signaling and the complement and coagulation pathways are relevant in evaluating disease severity at the MCI stage of AD.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of human suffering and disability for which disease-modifying treatments are lacking. OA occurs through complex and dynamic interplays between diverse factors over long periods of time. The traditional research and clinical focus on OA, the end stage disease, obscured understanding pathogenesis prior to reaching a common pathway defined by pain and functional deficits, joint deformity, and radiographic changes. To emphasize disease modification and prevention, we describe a multi-disciplinary systems-based approach encompassing biology, mechanics, and structure to define pre-osteoarthritic disease processes. Central to application of this model is the concept of ?pre-osteoarthritis,? conditions where clinical OA has not yet developed. Rather, joint homeostasis has been compromised and there are potentially reversible markers for heightened OA risk. Key messages from this perspective are (i) to focus research onto defining pre-OA through identifying and validating biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of OA risk, (ii) to emphasize multi-disciplinary approaches, and (iii) to propose that developing personalized interventions to address reversible markers of OA risk in healthy joints may be the key to prevention. Ultimately, a systems-based analysis of OA pathogenesis shows potential to transform clinical practice by facilitating development and testing of new strategies to prevent or delay the onset of osteoarthritis. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.
