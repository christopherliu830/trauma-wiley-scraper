AB  - Abstract Yamanaka and colleagues revolutionized stem cell biology and regenerative medicine by observing that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells. Evidence indicates that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells retain epigenetic memories that bias their spontaneous differentiation into the originating somatic cell type, therefore epigenetic memory may be exploited to improve tissue specific regeneration. We recently showed that iPS cells reprogrammed from ovarian granulosa cells using mouse and human tissue overwhelmingly differentiate homotypically into ovarian steroidogenic and primordial germ cells. Herein we detail a protocol for the culture of human ovarian granulosa cells. We review approaches for reprogramming human ovarian granulosa cells into iPS cells. Standard methods to induce pluripotency are outlined, concentrating on integrative retroviruses. Additionally, alternative protocols for lentivirus and Sendai virus are provided. Each approach has inherent limitations, such as reprogramming efficiency, insertional mutagenesis, and partial reprogramming. Major advances continue to be made in somatic cell reprogramming to identify an optimal approach and utilization in cell-based therapies. ? 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, chromosomal alterations have been extensively investigated for their pathophysiological relevance in haematological malignancies. In particular, epigenetic modifications of intra-nuclear histones are now known as key regulators of healthy cell cycles that have also evolved into novel therapeutic targets for certain blood cancers. Thus, for most haematologists, histones are DNA-chained proteins that are buried deep within chromatin. However, the plot has deepened with recent revelations on the function of histones when unchained and released extracellularly upon cell death or from activated neutrophils as part of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Extracellular histones and NETs are increasingly recognized for profound cytotoxicity and pro-coagulant effects. This article highlights the importance of recognizing this new paradigm of extracellular histones as a key player in host defence through its damage-associated molecular patterns, which could translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in various haematological and critical disorders.

AB  - Abstract Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, levels of increased CSF tau protein and decreased levels of ?-amyloid 1?42 (A?42) have been shown to correlate with brain plaque formation and tangle pathology. Intracellular Lewy inclusions containing aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) represent a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In most ? but not all ? studies published to date total CSF α-syn concentrations have been found to be decreased in disorders related to α-syn pathology, that is, PD, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. However, these reports show extensive signal overlap among tested individuals, thereby diminishing its potential for routine use in clinical practice. To investigate potential biological (i.e., non-technical) confounders of reported CSF levels for α-syn, A?42, and tau in PD and related disorders, we carried out a methodical review of known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. We discuss several biological factors, such as neuropathology, demographics, clinical phenotype, progression and duration of disease, concomitant illnesses and, last but not least, pharmacotherapy, which in isolation or combination can substantially alter values for CSF proteins of interest. Enhanced implementation of standardized clinical protocols, streamlined operating procedures, and further progress in the development of validated assays for CSF proteins have the potential to (i) inform us as to the pathogenesis of disease, (ii) support the laboratory-based diagnosis for symptomatic subjects in the future, and (iii) facilitate breakthrough therapies to alter the course of neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD and Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate potential biological confounders of reported CSF levels for α-synuclein (α-Syn), amyloid-? 1-42(A?42) and tau protein in Parkinson's disease and related disorders, we reviewed the current literature for known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite the potentially life-saving effects of stem cell transplant (SCT), many transplant patients experience traumatic stress reactions due to mortality threat, interpersonal isolation, financial and occupational loss, and invasive medical procedures. Emerging evidence suggests that trauma-related stress symptoms (TSS) predict significant health complications following SCT. The aim of the current prospective study was to examine TSS in the acute aftermath of SCT as a predictor of neutrophil recovery following SCT, a crucial component of immune defense against infection. Methods Fifty-one autologous SCT recipients were assessed for TSS 7 days after SCT. Patients' absolute neutrophil counts were collected from medical charts for the first 30 days following SCT. Hierarchical linear growth modeling was used to test the hypothesis that TSS at day 7 would be associated with delayed recovery of neutrophil counts from days 9 to 30 post SCT, that is, when neutrophil counts began to recover. Results As hypothesized, TSS measured 7 days after SCT was significantly associated with slower neutrophil recovery even after pre-existing TSS, depression, distress related to physical symptoms, and potential medical confounds were statistically controlled. Exploratory analyses showed that of the TSS symptom clusters, re-experiencing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms predicted neutrophil recovery, whereas avoidance symptoms did not. Conclusion Though traumatic stress symptoms may be a normative response to SCT, our findings suggest that TSS following SCT may interfere with neutrophil recovery and overall health. These results provide further insight as to potential mechanisms by which traumatic stress translates to poor medical outcomes for SCT patients. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - BackgroundSampling the dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) allows the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dermatological drugs to be studied directly at their site of action. Dermal open-flow microperfusion (dOFM) is a recently developed technique that can provide minimally invasive, continuous, membrane-free (thus unfiltered) access to the dermal ISF. Herein, we evaluate the clinical applicability and reliability of novel wearable dOFM devices in a clinical setting. Methods Physicians inserted 141 membrane-free dOFM probes into the dermis of 17 healthy and psoriatic volunteers and sampled dermal ISF for 25 h by using wearable push-pull pumps. The tolerability, applicability, reproducibility, and reliability of multiple insertions and 25 h continuous sampling was assessed by pain scoring, physician feedback, ultrasound probe depth measurements, and 25 h-drift and variability of the sodium relative recovery. Results Insertion pain was moderate and decreased with each additional probe. Probe insertion was precise, although slightly deeper in lesional skin. The wearable push-pull pump enabled uninterrupted ISF sampling over 25 h with low variability. The relative recovery was drift-free and highly reproducible. Conclusion dOFM sampling devices are tolerable and reliable for prolonged continuous dermal sampling in a multiprobe clinical setting. These devices should enable the study of a wide range of drugs and their biomarkers in the skin.

AB  - Abstract Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a range of diagnoses, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite decades of advancements in understanding the neurobiology of individual diseases, this class has few disease-modifying therapeutics and a paucity of biomarkers for diagnosis or progression. However, tau protein aggregation has emerged as a potential unifying factor across several neurodegenerative diseases, which has prompted a rapid growth in tau-related funding. In spite of this growth, research funding in this area is not in line with the immense magnitude of disease burden, and drug discovery and clinical research remain underfunded. Coordinated, collaborative efforts are key to making an impact, which can and should be led by the major funding bodies within the tau space. Here we describe the development and analysis of a tau-focused neurodegeneration funding database, which captures data from 2040 grants from 2006 to 2016. This database was developed as a public resource to allow funders, researchers, and policy makers to better understand tau funding patterns and to identify key funders and potential collaborations. This database can be used in conjunction with other neurodegenerative disease databases, such as the International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio to gain specific insight into tau-research funding. Over the study period, overall tau funding rose dramatically; however, changes in capital distribution also changed. Specifically, the field experienced a strong bias toward funding tau in the context of Alzheimer's disease, while at the same time generally decreasing the overall proportion of funding for basic research, treatment development, and evaluation. As funding organizations look forward, this resource can both inform future funding strategies and priority areas and identify potential collaborative efforts with complementary funding organizations.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Abstract Aims To evaluate a deep oropharyngeal suction intervention (NO-ASPIRATE) in intubated patients on microaspiration, ventilator-associated events and clinical outcomes. Design Prospective, two-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Methods The study was conducted between 2014 - 2017 in 513 participants enroled within 24 hr of intubation and randomized into NO-ASPIRATE or usual care groups. Standard oral care was provided to all participants every 4 hr and deep oropharyngeal suctioning was added to the NO-ASPIRATE group. Oral and tracheal specimens were obtained to quantify α-amylase as an aspiration biomarker. Results Data were analysed for 410 study completers enrolled at least 36 hr: NO-ASPIRATE (N = 206) and usual care (N = 204). Percent of tracheal specimens positive for α-amylase, mean tracheal α-amylase levels over time and ventilator-associated events were not different between groups. The NO-ASPIRATE group had a shorter hospital length of stay and a subgroup with moderate aspiration at baseline had significantly lower α-amylase levels across time. Conclusion Hospital length of stay was shorter in the NO-ASPIRATE group and a subgroup of intervention participants had lower α-amylase across time. Delivery of standardized oral care to all participants may have been an intervention itself and possibly associated with the lack of significant findings for most outcomes. Impact This trial compared usual care to oral care with a deep suctioning intervention on microaspiration and ventilator-associated events, as this has not been systematically studied. Further research on the usefulness of α-amylase as an aspiration biomarker and the role of oral suctioning, especially for certain populations, is indicated. Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02284178.
