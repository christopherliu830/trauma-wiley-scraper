AB  - Summary Background Opioid use is epidemic in cirrhosis, which could precipitate hepatic encephalopathy (HE) potentially through gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Aim To define the effect of opioids on readmissions and on gut microbiota composition and functionality. Methods Cohort 1 had 200 cirrhotic in-patients (with/without opioid use) followed prospectively through the index hospitalisation and 6 months post discharge. Readmissions (HE-related/unrelated) were compared between patients discharged on opioids compared to the rest, including using a multi-variable analysis. Cohort 2 consisted of 72 cirrhotics on chronic opioids who were age/model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and prior HE-balanced with 72 cirrhotics not on opioids. Stool microbiota composition (multi-tagged sequencing), predicted functionality (PiCRUST), endotoxemia and systemic inflammation (IL-6, IL-17) were compared. Results Cohort 1: Chronic opioid use was statistically similar between those admitted with/without HE, and was judged to be an HE precipitant in <5% of cases during the index hospitalisation. Of the 144 patients alive at 6 months, 82 were readmitted. The opioid users had a significantly higher all cause (69% vs. 48%, P = 0.008), but not HE-related readmissions (30% vs. 41%, P = 0.30). On regression, opioid therapy and female gender were predictive of readmission independent of MELD score and previous HE. Cohort 2: Significant dysbiosis was noted in the opioid cohort, especially in HE+opioid patients with lower autochthonous taxa and Bacteroidaceae relative abundance. PiCRUST showed highest aromatic amino acid and endotoxin production in opioid users. Opioid users also had higher endotoxemia and IL-6 but not IL-17. Conclusion Chronic opioid use in cirrhosis is associated with increased endotoxemia, dysbiosis and all-cause readmissions.

AB  - Summary Sketches provides, in more technical language, outlines of the various imaging modalities, and illustrates their roles in medical care with many clinical examples. After examining film-radiography and conventional fluoroscopy, in which images arise from differential attenuation of an X-ray beam by various tissues, it moves on to their twenty-first century computer-based descendants: computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), culminating in three-dimensional mapping of tissues with spiral, multi-slice CT. It then addresses nuclear medicine (NM), including single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), where contrast comes from the differential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by tissues. With diagnostic ultrasound (US), echoes are created at tissue interfaces where differences in tissue elasticity and density occur. The chapter concludes with an appendix on the selection of optimal imaging modalities for representative clinical problems.

AB  - Abstract Depression like many diseases is pleiotropic but unlike cancer and Alzheimer's disease for example, is still largely stigmatized and falls into the dark shadows of human illness. The failure of depression to be in the spotlight for successful treatment options is inherent in the complexity of the disease(s), flawed clinical diagnosis, overgeneralization of the illness, inadequate and biased clinical trial design, restrictive and biased inclusion/exclusion criteria, lack of approved/robust biomarkers, expensive imaging technology along with few advances in neurobiological hypotheses in decades. Clinical trial studies summitted to the regulatory agencies (FDA/EMA) for approval, have continually failed to show significant differences between active and placebo. For decades, we have acknowledged this failure, despite vigorous debated by all stakeholders to provide adequate answers to this escalating problem, with only a few new antidepressants approved in the last 20 years with equivocal efficacy, little improvement in side effects or onset of efficacy. It is also clear that funding and initiatives for mental illness lags far behind other life-treating diseases. Thus, it is no surprise we have not achieved much success in the last 50 years in treating depression, but we are accountable for the many failures and suboptimal treatment. This review will therefore critically address where we have failed and how future advances in medical science offers a glimmer of light for the patient and aid our future understanding of the neurobiology and pathophysiology of the disease, enabling transformative therapies for the treatment of depressive disorders.

AB  - Abstract To understand links between early experience and biomarkers of peripheral physiology in adulthood, this study examined associations between quality of early caregiving and markers of sympathetic activation and chronic inflammation in a sample of 52 low-income mothers and their preschool-aged children. Mothers reported on levels of positive caregiving experienced during childhood using the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior-Intrex. Mother and child sympathetic activation was indexed via pre-ejection period (PEP) at rest, during a dyadic social engagement task, and for children, while interacting with an unfamiliar adult. C-reactive protein (CRP) was collected using whole blood spots to assess levels of low-grade chronic inflammation. Results showed that mothers who reported experiencing more warm guidance and support for autonomy in early childhood displayed lower resting sympathetic nervous system activation (i.e., longer PEP) and lower chronic inflammation (i.e., CRP levels). Further, lower maternal chronic inflammation levels were associated with lower sympathetic activation (i.e., longer PEP) in their children at rest, and during social interactions with mother and a female stranger.

Design A cross-sectional survey. Setting Nine MMT clinics, three each from three Chinese provinces (Yunnan, Anhui and Jiangsu) between October 2008 and February 2009. Participants A total of 1301 MMT clients. Measurements A questionnaire, including the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and on-site urine drug testing. Findings The prevalence of depression (SDS score?≥?53) and anxiety (SAS score?≥?50) in our sample was 38.3% [95% confidence interval (CI)?=?35.7, 40.9] and 18.4% (95% CI?=?16.3, 20.5), respectively, with 14.2% (95% CI?=?12.3, 16.1) displaying symptoms of both. Sample prevalence rates for depression [mean?=?49.69, standard deviation (SD)?=?10.34] and anxiety (mean?=?40.98, SD?=?10.66) were higher than the national average for each (t(0.05/2, 1300)?=?19.2, P?<?0.001 and t(0.05/2, 1300)?=?8.0, P?<?0.001, respectively). Employing multi-level modelling techniques, gender (P?=?0.03) and employment status (P?<?0.001) were found to be associated significantly with depression in a single-level model; however, in a multi-level mixed model, only employment status (P?<?0.001) was associated with depression. Gender (P?=?0.03), education level (P?=?0.02), marital status (P?=?0.04), employment status (P?<?0.001), positive urine drug test results (P?=?0.02) and daily methadone dose (P?<?0.001) were found to be associated significantly with anxiety in a single-level model, while only employment status (P?<?0.01) and positive results for the urine drug test (P?=?0.04) were associated with anxiety in a multi-level mixed model. Conclusions A considerable proportion of methadone maintenance treatment clients in China have experienced depression and anxiety during treatment. There is a need to provide tailored mental health interventions for this high-risk population.

AB  - Summary.? Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of liver disease in haemophilia. Few data exist on the proportion with liver fibrosis in this group after long-term HCV and HIV co-infection. We conducted a cross-sectional multi-centre study to determine the impact of HIV on the prevalence and risk factors for fibrosis in haemophilic men with chronic hepatitis C. Biopsies were independently scored by Ishak, Metavir and Knodell systems. Variables were tested for associations with fibrosis using logistic regression and receiver operating curves (ROC). Of 220 biopsied HCV(+) men, 23.6% had Metavir ≥F3 fibrosis, with higher mean Metavir fibrosis scores among HIV/HCV co-infected than HCV mono-infected, 1.6 vs. 1.3 (P?=?0.044). Variables significantly associated with fibrosis included AST, ALT, APRI score (AST/ULN ??100/platelet???109/L), alpha-fetoprotein (all P <?0.0001), platelets (P?= 0.0003) and ferritin (P?=?0.0008). In multiple logistic regression of serum markers, alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ALT were significantly associated with ≥F3 fibrosis [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.86)]. Alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ferritin were significant in HIV(?) [AUROC?=?0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92)], and alpha-fetoprotein and platelets in HIV(+) [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 0.88]. In a multivariable model of demographic and clinical variables, transformed (natural logarithm) of alpha-fetoprotein (P?=?0.0003), age (P?=?0.006) and HCV treatment (P?=?0.027) were significantly associated with fibrosis. Nearly one-fourth of haemophilic men have Metavir ≥3 fibrosis. The odds for developing fibrosis are increased in those with elevated alpha-fetoprotein, increasing age and past HCV treatment.

AB  - Summary Acute-on chronic liver failure (ACLF), a clinical syndrome associated with a dismal prognosis, occurs acutely in patients with chronic liver disease. An important feature of this syndrome is the potential for reversibility if it is recognized early and supportive measures are instituted before multi-organ failure ensues. There have therefore been recent efforts to better define and understand the pathophysiologic basis of the condition so as to aid early diagnosis and management. In this chapter, we aim to review the most recent data on the definition, pathophysiology, clinical features and management of ACLF.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Although individual immunosuppression regimens vary, most patients are maintained on multi-drug regimens. As anticipated, metabolic, infectious, oncologic, and psychosocial complications have been reported in VCA recipients. The relatively few number of cases performed to date and the absence of uniformity in the reporting of results hinder the establishment of the long-term outcomes of VCAs. This chapter aims to review the reported outcomes and highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities available in this emerging field of transplantation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Delirium is highly prevalent within critical care and is linked to adverse clinical outcomes, increased mortality and impaired quality of life. Development of delirium is thought to be caused by multiple risk factors, including disruption of the circadian rhythm. Chronotherapeutic interventions, such as light therapy, music and use of eye shades, have been suggested as an option to improve circadian rhythm within intensive care units. Aim This review aims to answer the question: Can chronotherapy reduce the prevalence of delirium in adult patients in critical care? Design This study is a systematic review of quantitative studies. Research Method Six major electronic databases were searched, and a hand search was undertaken using selected key search terms. Research quality was assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme tools. The studies were critically appraised by both authors independently, and data were extracted. Four themes addressing the research question were identified and critically evaluated. Findings Six primary research articles that investigated different methods of chronotherapy were identified, and the results suggest that multi-component non-pharmacological interventions are the most effective for reducing the prevalence of delirium in critical care. The melatonergic agonist Ramelteon demonstrated statistically significant reductions in delirium; however, the reliability of the results in answering the review question was limited by the research design. The use of bright light therapy (BLT) and dynamic light application had mixed results, with issues with the research design and outcomes measured limiting the validity of the findings. Conclusion Multi-component non-pharmacological interventions, such as noise and light control, can reduce delirium in critical care, whereas other interventions, such as BLT, have mixed outcomes. Melatonin, as a drug, may be a useful alternative to sedative-hypnotics. Relevance to Clinical Practice Chronotherapy can reduce the incidence of delirium within critical care, although further research is warranted. Staff education is essential in the implementation of chronotherapy.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol dependence is associated with poor sleep quality, which has both been implicated with thalamocortical circuits function. To identify the possible roles of these circuits in the alcohol-sleep association, we investigated the volume of both left and right thalamus and corresponding resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) differences between 15 alcohol-dependent patients (AD) and 15 healthy controls (HC) male participants. The neuroimaging findings were then correlated with clinical variables, that is, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additionally, mediation analysis was carried out to test whether the thalamocortical RSFC mediates the relationship between drinking behavior and sleep impairments in AD when applicable. We observed a significant positive correlation between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. Compared with HC, AD showed reduced RSFC between the left thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right caudate. We also observed a negative correlation between RSFC of the left thalamus?mPFC and PSQI score in AD. More importantly, the left thalamus?mPFC RSFC strength mediated the relationship between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. No significant difference was detected in the normalized volume of both left and right thalamus, and volumes were not significantly correlated with clinical variables. Our results demonstrate that AD show abnormal interactions within thalamocortical circuits in association with drinking behaviors and sleep impairments. It is hoped that our study focusing on thalamocortical circuits could provide new information on potential novel therapeutic targets for treatment of sleep impairment in alcohol-dependent patients.

AB  - Abstract Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a congenital gastrointestinal disorder, is one of the most common causes of neonatal bowel obstruction. Without an early screening and diagnosis, some patients develop serious complications, such as toxic megacolon or acute enterocolitis. We sought to identify specific serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that can serve as novel early, non-invasive screening signature and then to test their specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease. We obtained serum samples from 95 HSCR cases and 104 matched controls. An initial screening of miRNA expression was performed through TaqMan Low Density Array. The candidate miRNAs were validated by individual reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR arranged in the training and a two-stage validation set. Additional double-blind testing was performed in 23 patients with clinically suspected HSCR to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of the serum miRNA profile in predicting HSCR. Following a multi-stage evaluation approach, five miRNAs were significantly increased in HSCR cases compared with controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this five-serum miRNA signature were 0.895, 0.893 and 0.925 in training set and two validation sets, respectively. The accuracy rate of the five-miRNA profile as HSCR signature was 82.6%, which, in the double-blind testing set, was markedly higher than that of contrast enema (70%), the most commonly used test performed to diagnose HSCR. Our results indicate that a five-serum miRNA signature may be linked to HSCR, representing a potential, novel, non-invasive diagnostic approach for early screening of HSCR.

AB  - Abstract There is great interest in developing physiological-based biomarkers such as diffusion tensor imaging to aid in the management of concussion, which is currently entirely dependent on clinical judgment. However, the time course for recovery of white matter abnormalities following sports-related concussion (SRC) is unknown. We collected diffusion tensor imaging and behavioral data in forty concussed collegiate athletes on average 1.64 days (T1; n?=?33), 8.33 days (T2; n?=?30), and 32.15 days post-concussion (T3; n?=?26), with healthy collegiate contact-sport athletes (HA) serving as controls (n?=?46). We hypothesized that fractional anisotropy (FA) would be increased acutely and partially recovered by one month post-concussion. Mood symptoms were assessed using structured interviews. FA differences were assessed using both traditional and subject-specific analyses. An exploratory analysis of tau plasma levels was conducted in a subset of participants. Results indicated that mood symptoms improved over time post-concussion, but remained elevated at T3 relative to HA. Across both group and subject-specific analyses, concussed athletes exhibited increased FA in several white matter tracts at each visit post-concussion with no longitudinal evidence of recovery. Increased FA at T1 and T3 was significantly associated with an independent, real-world outcome measure for return-to-play. Finally, we observed a nonsignificant trend for reduced tau in plasma of concussed athletes at T1 relative to HA, with tau significantly increasing by T2. These results suggest white matter abnormalities following SRC may persist beyond one month and have potential as an objective biomarker for concussion outcome.

AB  - Purpose To propose a susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) method by combining a magnitude image with a quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) -based weighting factor thereby providing an alternative contrast compared with magnitude image, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and QSM. Methods A three-dimensional multi-echo gradient echo sequence is used to obtain the data. The QSM was transformed to a susceptibility mask that varies in amplitude between zero and unity. This mask was multiplied several times with the original magnitude image to create alternative contrasts between tissues with different susceptibilities. A temporal domain denoising method to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio was further applied. Optimal reconstruction processes of the SMWI were determined from simulations. Results Temporal domain denoising enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio, especially at late echoes without spatial artifacts. From phantom simulations, the optimal number of multiplication and threshold values was chosen. Reconstructed SMWI created different contrasts based on its weighting factors made from paramagnetic or diamagnetic susceptibility tissue and provided an excellent delineation of microhemorrhage without blooming artifacts typically caused by the nonlocal property of phase. Conclusion SMWI presents an alternative contrast for susceptibility-based imaging. The validity of this method was demonstrated using in vivo data. This proposed method together with denoising allows high-quality reconstruction of susceptibility-weighted image of human brain in vivo.
