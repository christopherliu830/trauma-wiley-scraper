AB  - Abstract There is great interest in developing physiological-based biomarkers such as diffusion tensor imaging to aid in the management of concussion, which is currently entirely dependent on clinical judgment. However, the time course for recovery of white matter abnormalities following sports-related concussion (SRC) is unknown. We collected diffusion tensor imaging and behavioral data in forty concussed collegiate athletes on average 1.64 days (T1; n?=?33), 8.33 days (T2; n?=?30), and 32.15 days post-concussion (T3; n?=?26), with healthy collegiate contact-sport athletes (HA) serving as controls (n?=?46). We hypothesized that fractional anisotropy (FA) would be increased acutely and partially recovered by one month post-concussion. Mood symptoms were assessed using structured interviews. FA differences were assessed using both traditional and subject-specific analyses. An exploratory analysis of tau plasma levels was conducted in a subset of participants. Results indicated that mood symptoms improved over time post-concussion, but remained elevated at T3 relative to HA. Across both group and subject-specific analyses, concussed athletes exhibited increased FA in several white matter tracts at each visit post-concussion with no longitudinal evidence of recovery. Increased FA at T1 and T3 was significantly associated with an independent, real-world outcome measure for return-to-play. Finally, we observed a nonsignificant trend for reduced tau in plasma of concussed athletes at T1 relative to HA, with tau significantly increasing by T2. These results suggest white matter abnormalities following SRC may persist beyond one month and have potential as an objective biomarker for concussion outcome.

AB  - Abstract Tendon/ligament injuries are very common in sports and other rigorous activities. Tendons regenerate and repair slowly and inefficiently in vivo after injury. The limited ability of tendon to self-repair and the general inefficiencies of current treatment regimes have hastened the motivation to develop tissue-engineering strategies for tissue repair. Of particular interest in recent years has been the use of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to regenerate functional tendons and ligaments. Different sources of MSCs have been studied for their effects on tendon repair. However, ectopic bone and tumour formation has been reported in some special circumstances after transplantation of MSCs. The induction of MSCs to differentiate into tendon-forming cells in vitro prior to transplantation is a possible approach to avoid ectopic bone and tumour formation while promoting tendon repair. While there are reports about the factors that might promote tenogenic differentiation, the study of tenogenic differentiation is hampered by the lack of definitive biomarkers for tendons. This review aims to summarize the cell sources currently used for tendon repair as well as their advantages and limitations. Factors affecting tenogenic differentiation were summarized. Molecular markers currently used for assessing tenogenic differentiation or neotendon formation are summarized and their advantages and limitations are commented upon. Finally, further directions for promoting and assessing tenogenic differentiation of stem cells for tendon repair are discussed. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose To propose a susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) method by combining a magnitude image with a quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) -based weighting factor thereby providing an alternative contrast compared with magnitude image, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and QSM. Methods A three-dimensional multi-echo gradient echo sequence is used to obtain the data. The QSM was transformed to a susceptibility mask that varies in amplitude between zero and unity. This mask was multiplied several times with the original magnitude image to create alternative contrasts between tissues with different susceptibilities. A temporal domain denoising method to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio was further applied. Optimal reconstruction processes of the SMWI were determined from simulations. Results Temporal domain denoising enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio, especially at late echoes without spatial artifacts. From phantom simulations, the optimal number of multiplication and threshold values was chosen. Reconstructed SMWI created different contrasts based on its weighting factors made from paramagnetic or diamagnetic susceptibility tissue and provided an excellent delineation of microhemorrhage without blooming artifacts typically caused by the nonlocal property of phase. Conclusion SMWI presents an alternative contrast for susceptibility-based imaging. The validity of this method was demonstrated using in vivo data. This proposed method together with denoising allows high-quality reconstruction of susceptibility-weighted image of human brain in vivo.

AB  - Abstract There is an increasing need for novel biomarkers that enable better diagnostic and prognostic stratification of patients with suspected infection. A proprotein convertase enzyme FURIN is upregulated upon immune cell activation, and it promotes infectivity by cleaving and activating pathogens. In this study, we determined FURIN levels in plasma using ELISA from 537 patients that were admitted to emergency room with suspected infection. Patients were sorted to high- and low-level FURIN groups with a cut-off level of 370 pg/ml. The study cohort included five diagnostic groups: Group 1, no systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS, n = 59 patients); Group 2, bacterial infection without SIRS (n = 67); Group 3, SIRS, but no bacterial infection (n = 308); Group 4, sepsis without organ failure (n = 308); and Group 5, severe sepsis (n = 49). Statistically significant associations were not found between the plasma level of FURIN and the prevalence of sepsis (P = 0.957), diagnostic group of a patient (P = 0.737) or the bacteria in blood culture (P = 0.499). Additionally, the concentration of FURIN did not predict the severity or case fatality of the infectious disease. However, statistically significant associations were found between high plasma level of FURIN and diagnosed rheumatic disease (P < 0.001) as well as with the prevalence of non-smokers (P = 0.034). Thus, albeit the plasma level of FURIN does not predict the severity of infectious disease, it may be of use in the diagnostics of autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Abstract Background Non-invasive fibrosis markers can distinguish between liver fibrosis stages in lieu of liver biopsy or imaging elastography. Aims To develop a sensitive, non-invasive, freely-available algorithm that differentiates between individual liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Methods Chronic HCV patients (n = 355) at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt, with liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage (METAVIR), were tested for preselected fibrosis markers. A novel multistage stepwise fibrosis classification algorithm (FibroSteps) was developed using random forest analysis for biomarker selection, and logistic regression for modelling. FibroSteps predicted fibrosis stage using four steps: Step 1 distinguished no(F0)/mild fibrosis(F1) vs. moderate(F2)/severe fibrosis(F3)/cirrhosis(F4); Step 2a distinguished F0 vs. F1; Step 2b distinguished F2 vs. F3/F4; and Step 3 distinguished F3 vs. F4. FibroSteps was developed using a randomly-selected training set (n = 234) and evaluated using the remaining patients (n = 118) as a validation set. Results Hyaluronic Acid, TGF-?1, α2-macroglobulin, MMP-2, Apolipoprotein-A1, Urea, MMP-1, alpha-fetoprotein, haptoglobin, RBCs, haemoglobin and TIMP-1 were selected into the models, which had areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.973, 0.923 (Step 1); 0.943, 0.872 (Step 2a); 0.916, 0.883 (Step 2b) and 0.944, 0.946 (Step 3), in the training and validation sets respectively. The final classification had accuracies of 94.9% (95% CI: 91.3?97.4%) and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.9?94.6%) for the training and validation sets respectively. Conclusions FibroSteps, a freely available, non-invasive liver fibrosis classification, is accurate and can assist clinicians in making prognostic and therapeutic decisions. The statistical code for FibroSteps using R software is provided in the supplementary materials.

AB  - Summary ICD-10 contains diagnostic criteria which exist in two versions: diagnostic guidelines for routine clinical use and criteria for research. Mental disorders in the elderly are not a separate category of morbidity, and psychiatric disturbances in the elderly can be classified in any clinically relevant section. The dementias are embedded in the section on organic and symptomatic mental disorders (?organic? meaning that the disorder can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or systemic disease). Entry points at the level of clinical syndrome are: dementia; amnesic syndrome; delirium; organic quasi-functional disorder; and personality disorder. Once dementia is established, the diagnostic process branches off into the clinical forms of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and dementia in diseases classified elsewhere. Multi-axial coding can be achieved by using extra codes from other ICD-10 chapters for physical disorders; or by using the multi-axial system now available, with axes for clinical diagnosis, disablements and contextual factors.

AB  - Abstract A class of bioactive, stimuli-responsive co-joined interpenetrating networks of inherently conductive polymers and highly hydrated hydrogels are being developed for implantable biodevice interfaces and for electric field induced release of elutable drugs. A novel microfabricated multidisc electrode array biotransducer intended for trauma management has been coated with poly(HEMA)-polypyrrole and characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry using ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) as a probe molecule. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole (700?mV vs. Ag/AgCl) to 100 mC/cm2 onto the hydrogel coated microdisc electrode array resulted in large and unstable background currents relative to uncoated electrodes. Overoxidation of polypyrrole (0?1.2?V vs. Ag/AgCl, 20 cylces, 100?mV/s) eliminates background current. Dose-response curves with FcCOOH showed that the transducer has good reproducibility with molecules of facile electrochemical properties. Polypyrrole provides interference screening of endogenous interferents in biosensor applications with a 12:1 rejection ratio. GOx was immobilized via electropolymerization of polypyrrole into hydrogel coated MDEA 5037s to yield biotransducers with sensitivity of 0.045?µA?mM?1 cm?2. Changes to improve biotransducer sensitivity are proposed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To provide a current review of the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcomes in critically ill patients presenting to the ED with acute pancreatitis and subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre in Australia. Methods A retrospective single-centre study of adult patients admitted with pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis defined by Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score ≥2. Results Eighty-seven patients fulfilled criteria for inclusion during the study period, representing 0.9% of all ICU admissions. The median age of patients was 54. Survival was independent of patients? age, sex, aetiology and comorbidities. Mortality was 30.8% for both inpatient referrals to the ICU and for direct referrals via the ED. Higher mortality was identified among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (74.2 vs 24.6% in survivors; P?<?0.0001), vasopressor support (85.7 vs 33.8% in survivors; P?<?0.0001) or renal replacement therapy (60 vs 16.9% in survivors; P?<?0.002). BISAP score surpasses Ranson's and Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II scores in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors among unselected patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to ICU, whereas APACHE II discriminates better in the cohort admitted from ED. Conclusion Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Aetiology and comorbidity did not predict adverse outcomes in this population. BISAP score is non-inferior to APACHE II score as a prognostic tool in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used to triage admission. Evidence of persistent organ dysfunction and requirements for organ support reliably identify patients at high-risk of death.

AB  - Abstract Study of cell-biomaterial interaction is a crucial aspect of bone tissue engineering to find a state-of-the-art functional substitute. In present study, the Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) behavior on three-dimensional biomimetic nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan/gelatin (nHA/CS/Gel) scaffolds was investigated. The outcome was assessed by histological, biochemical and morphological tests. Results indicated that hWJ-MSCs attached onto the scaffold surface through membrane filopodia, uniformly spread throughout the contacting surface. It only took 3 days for the seeded cells to appear deep inside the scaffold, reflecting proper hWJ-MSCs adhesion and migration, evidenced by both scanning electron microscope and hematoxilin and eosin assessments. Additionally, the present fabricated nHA/CS/Gel scaffold proved to be non-toxic as it supported cell proliferation measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, 3-week culture of hWJ-MSCs on scaffolds, immersed in osteogenic medium, rendered the microenvironment in favor of hWJ-MSCs differentiation into osteoblast cells and extracellular matrix secretion. Finally, osteoblasts were immunologically positive for various osteogenic markers including osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and alkaline phosphatase. Present findings indicate that nHA/CS/Gel scaffold appropriately harbored hWJ-MSCs, stimulating their growth, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. hWJ-MSCs-loaded nHA/CS/gel substitute may therefore be considered as a suitable platform for the rising demand in in vivo bone repair studies. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
