AB  - Diffusion MRI is extensively used to study brain microarchitecture and pathologies, and water diffusion appears highly anisotropic in the white matter (WM) of the spinal cord (SC). Despite these facts, the use of diffusion MRI to study the SC, which has increased in recent years, is much less common than that in the brain. In the present review, after a brief outline of early studies of diffusion MRI (DWI) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the SC, we provide a short survey on DTI and on diffusion MRI methods beyond the tensor that have been used to study SC microstructure and pathologies. After introducing the porous view of WM and describing the q-space approach and q-space diffusion MRI (QSI), we describe other methodologies that can be applied to study the SC. Selected applications of the use of DTI, QSI, and other more advanced diffusion MRI methods to study SC microstructure and pathologies are presented, with some emphasis on the use of less conventional diffusion methodologies. Because of length constraints, we concentrate on structural studies and on a few selected pathologies. Examples of the use of diffusion MRI to study dysmyelination, demyelination as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic SC injury are presented. We conclude with a brief summary and a discussion of challenges and future directions for diffusion MRI of the SC. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Background Irisin is a new adipo-myokine, encoded by the FNDC5 gene. Currently, there is a discussion regarding the relation between thyroid function and irisin concentration. This prospective study assesses the influence of thyrometabolic changes on serum irisin concentration in association with altered muscle metabolism. This is performed on a large cohort of patients affected by severe hypo- or hyperthyroidism, as well as by the expression of the FNDC5 gene in thyroid tissue affected by different pathologies. Methods The study group comprised 119 patients with newly diagnosed severe hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, and a control group of 45 healthy subjects. Body composition, serum irisin concentrations, and thyroid-related hormones, creatine kinase, dystrophin and titin concentrations were evaluated. FNDC5 expression was also analysed in tissue samples from 80 patients with nontoxic multinodular goitre, toxic goitre, Graves? disease and papillary thyroid cancer. Results Irisin concentration was lower in patients with prolonged hypothyroidism. There was a tendency towards lower dystrophin and titin concentrations in patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Restoration of euthyroidism in patients with hypothyroidism resulted in a decreased muscle mass with an increase in irisin concentrations, while the hyperthyroid group showed an increase in fat mass. Statistically significant overexpression of FNDC5 gene was found in patients with toxic goitre as compared to Graves? disease, papillary thyroid cancer and controls. Conclusions The presented data support the theory that irisin concentration changes are associated with prolonged hypothyroidism and might primarily constitute the result of prolonged myopathy. These changes are most likely not related to the expression of the FNDC5 gene in the thyroid gland.

AB  - Background:? Alcohol use disorders in adolescents are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, there has been a burgeoning of research on adolescent alcohol use disorders. Methods:? A summary of the alcohol assessment tools is provided, and randomized studies reviewed and synthesized to provide an overview of state of the art knowledge of treatment of adolescent alcohol use disorders. Animal models of addiction are also briefly reviewed, and the value of translational research approaches, using findings from basic studies to guide the design of clinical investigations, is also highlighted. Results:? Comorbidity is the rule, not the exception in adolescent alcohol use disorders. Comprehensive assessment of psychiatric and other substance use disorders, trauma experiences, and suicidality is indicated in this population to optimize selection of appropriate clinical interventions. In terms of available investigated treatments for adolescents with alcohol use disorders, Multidimensional Family Therapy and group administered Cognitive Behavioral Therapies have received the most empirical support to date. There is a paucity of research on pharmacological interventions in this patient population, and no firm treatment recommendations can be made in this area. Conclusions:? Given the high rate of relapse after treatment, evaluation of combined psychosocial and pharmacological interventions, and the development of novel intervention strategies are indicated.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common sports-related knee injuries that increase the risk of developing post-traumatic osteoarthritis. ACL tears are rarely an isolated injury but are often associated with traumatic bone marrow lesions (BMLs). While early loss of bone mass following the ACL injury has been previously described, to date, microarchitectural information has not been reported due to the limited resolution of clinical imaging systems. In this study, we provide the first evidence of detailed bone mass and microarchitectural changes in the first 10 months following an acute ACL tear, and localized to traumatic BMLs. Fifteen participants with an acute unilateral ACL tear were assessed at four-time points using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and traumatic BMLs were identified with magnetic resonance imaging. Loss of bone mass was localized to the injured knee (?4.6% to ?15.8%, depending on bone and depth) and was accelerated immediately following the injury before suggesting a recovery phase. This loss of bone was accelerated even greater in traumatic BMLs (?18.2% to ?20.6%, depending on bone). Bone loss was accompanied by microstructural degeneration of trabecular bone. For example, in the lateral femur of the injured knee, the subchondral bone plate decreased in thickness (?9.0%). This study confirmed loss of bone mass in the months following ACL tears and described the underlying bone microstructural changes. The presented bone changes were accelerated in regions of traumatic BMLs. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 37:2325?2336, 2019

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the background, challenges, strategic mapping, high-risk markers, high-risk predictors and investigations, smart testing and management for cardiovascular problems in elderly patients. Coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), valvular heart disease, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), arrhythmia and most cardiovascular (CV) pathophysiologic processes become endemic among older populations as a function of aging physiology, especially in relation to CV risk factors over a lifetime. In older patients, the symptoms can be subtle or even misleading because of the presence of multi-morbidity. The baseline electrocardiography (ECG) in older adults is more likely to have baseline waveform abnormalities that may confound assessment of ischemia. Management choices entail a constant balance between rationale for aggressive therapy vs. rationale for reduced therapy. Medication reconciliation is an essential part of comprehensive care, and should be repeated at every transition (at home, admission into the hospital, transfer within the hospital, and at discharge).

AB  - Abstract Chromium is an essential nutrient required for the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in humans and many animal species. We evaluated whether feeding laying hens with high levels of different chemical forms of trivalent chromium may affect hepatic metabolizing cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-linked enzymes. Modulation of CYP-dependent monooxygenases (which play a pivotal role in the endogenous metabolism) by Cr(III) was tested using either specific substrates as probes of different CYPs or testosterone as a multi-bioprobe. The CYP-supported oxidases were studied in liver microsomes from laying hens fed with diet supplemented with either 25 or 50 ppm chromium chloride as a yeast or as aminoniacinate. Although at 25 ppm no appreciable effects were observed, at 50 ppm a general inactivation of the recorded monooxygenases (ranging from 34% loss for ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase with chromium chloride to 85% loss for O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin with either chromium yeast or aminoniacinate) were achieved in the supplemented groups vs controls. The only exception was the O-dealkylation of pentoxyresorufin, which was significantly boosted by both chromium yeast (up to 65% increase) and chromium aminoniacinate (up to 141%). Measurements of the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of testosterone used as a multi-bioprobe corroborated the inactivating properties of Cr(III) at the higher dose. Taken as a whole, these findings seem to indicate that high levels of Cr(III) supplementation can substantially impair CYP-catalysed drug metabolism in laying hens.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissue. Current diagnostics have low sensitivity or specificity to incremental progression of mineralization, especially at early time points. Without accurate and reliable early diagnosis and intervention, HO progression often results in incapacitating conditions of limited range of motion, nerve entrapment, and pain. We hypothesized that non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging can detect HO at early time points and monitor heterotopic bone turnover longitudinally. C57BL6 mice received an Achilles tenotomy on their left hind limb in combination with a dorsal burn or sham procedure. A calcium-chelating tetracycline derivative (IRDye 680RD BoneTag) was injected bi-weekly and imaged via NIR to measure accumulative fluorescence for 11?wk and compared to in vivo microCT images. Percent retention of fluorescence was calculated longitudinally to assess temporal bone resorption. NIR detected HO as early as five days and revealed a temporal response in HO formation and turnover. MicroCT could not detect HO until 5?wk. Confocal microscopy confirmed fluorophore localization to areas of HO. These findings demonstrate the ability of a near-infrared optical imaging strategy to accurately and reliably detect and monitor HO in a murine model. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Hemolysis is a potential limitation of percutaneously delivered left-sided mechanical circulatory support pumps, including trans valvular micro-axial flow pumps (TVP). Hemolytic biomarkers among durable left ventricular assist devices include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and plasma-free hemoglobin (pf-Hb) >20 mg/dL. We examined the predictive value of these markers among patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) receiving a TVP. We retrospectively studied records of 116 consecutive patients receiving an Impella TVP at our institution between 2012 and 2017 for CS. Twenty-three met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and had sufficient pf-Hb data for analysis. Area under receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve for diagnosing hemolysis were calculated. Mean age was 62 ± 14 years and ejection fraction was 15 ± 5%. Mean duration of support was 5.4 ± 3.5 days. Pre-device LDH levels were >2.5x ULN in 71% (n = 5/7) of 5.0 and 29% of CP patients, while pre-device pf-Hb levels were >20 mg/dL in 14% (n = 1/7) of 5.0 and 25% (n = 4/16) of CP patients. Given elevated baseline LDH and pf-Hb levels, we defined hemolysis as a pf-Hb level >40 mg/dL within 72 h post-implant plus clinical evidence of device-related hemolysis. We identified that 30% (n = 7/23) had device-related hemolysis. Using ROC curve-derived cut-points, an increase in delta pf-Hb by >27mg/dL, not delta LDH, within 24 h after TVP implant (delta pf-Hb: C-statistic?=?0.79, sensitivity: 57%, specificity: 93%, p <0.05) was highly predictive of hemolysis. In conclusion, we identified a change in pf-Hb, not LDH, levels is highly sensitive and specific for hemolysis in patients treated with a TVP for CS.

It is also to protect them from sexual abuse, being taken advantage of, and getting appropriate support. Chronological age can be estimated by determining physiological age, which is the age at which a developing system or organ reaches a specific stage. The human dentition develops over nearly a third of the average human life, with easily detected and predictable stages. Dental development can be divided into two main phases: tooth formation and tooth eruption. Good-quality radiographs should be attained for dental age assessment based on one of the following methods: pulp ratio and biomarkers. The International Organization for Forensic Odonto-Stomatology (IOFOS) gave recommendations for quality assurance in age estimation, and these are summarised in the chapter.

AB  - Abstract Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) refers to alterations in bone turnover, mineralisation, mass and microarchitecture in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and represents the skeletal component of ?CKD?mineral and bone disorder?. Changes in bone structure lead to impaired bone quality, compromised bone strength and increased susceptibility to fractures with associated significant morbidity, mortality and financial cost. Diagnosis and management of ROD is hindered by the inadequacy of currently available diagnostic methods to interpret the complex pathophysiology. Bone biopsy, the perceived gold standard test to assess ROD, is invasive and suboptimal for disease screening and management in routine clinical practice. High-resolution imaging, such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging provide accurate non-invasive quantification of bone microarchitecture and facilitate assessment of mechanical competence of bone, correlating with skeletal fragility. We discuss the potential for these imaging techniques in patients with CKD to provide quantification and assessment of bone structure and strength. When used in conjunction with serum biomarkers, these investigative tools may provide a non-invasive diagnostic virtual bone biopsy.

AB  - Abstract We analyze key proteomic issues and cutting-edge technologies that will spearhead inroads into functional interpretations of human diseases and their therapeutic rectification, following the availability of the predicted human proteome. We contrast the distinctions between high quality data that are low throughput, (e.g., 3-D proteomic reconstructions in embryogenic and nervous system contexts, and multigenerational transgenic studies), versus automated data harvesting that is more distant from human disease phenotypes and currently fulfills a diagnostic role, (e.g., molecular portraits of human diseases via transcriptomic analyses). We examine the extent to which these approaches impinge upon a realistic understanding of human diseases, namely how close they come to revealing the causal events involved in the initiation of disease. While tissue sources from human embryogenesis, foetal development and the brain remain the absolute priority, the pragmatic approaches utilize judicious data integration from selected proteomic studies of model organisms. The role of genome-wide disease-related screens, ?humanized? transgenic analyses, multigenerational gene interference methods, and analyses of post-translational modifications in epigenetic contexts from Drosophila will be crucial, since these avenues are far too slow and transgenically cumbersome in mammals. Finally, the implementation of multi compartment electrolyzers (MCE) and multi photon detection (MPD) systems will be pivotal for the proteomic profiling of human tissue samples.

AB  - Abstract MicroRNA are small non-coding RNA that mediate mRNA translation repression or mRNA degradation, and thereby refine protein expression levels. More than 30?60% of all genes are regulated by microRNA. Exploring disease-related microRNA signatures is an emerging tool in biomarker discovery, and silencing has already been used in a clinical phase 2a trial. As microRNA regulate translation of more than 100 genes, they could also provide a focused insight into important pathways, and offer a better understanding of diseases with heterogeneous pathogenesis. The number of studies investigating microRNA related to multiple sclerosis has increased significantly in recent years. Differentially expressed microRNA have been identified in the whole blood, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, blood-derived cell subsets and brain lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis. Most studies applied a non-candidate approach of screening by microarray and validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction or next generation sequencing; others used a candidate-driven approach. Despite a relatively high number of multiple sclerosis-associated microRNA, just a few could be repeatedly found, even if similar biological materials were examined. Only part of the identified microRNA has been extensively studied, and the biological function has not been explored in the majority. Some of the microRNA related to multiple sclerosis are also differentially expressed in other autoimmune diseases or autoimmune models. In the present review, we discuss microRNA related to disease compartments, activity and phenotype. We also focus on several microRNA with well-defined functions, or because of particular interest due to either validation by several independent studies or in-depth exploration of function.

AB  - Abstract The last two decades have seen a tremendous increase in efforts to identify and understand the pathways that underlie disparities in disease and health among minority populations in the US. In a similar span of time there has been a proliferation of research examining the role of the parasympathetic nervous system and in particular its regulation of the heart in relation to numerous mental and physical health outcomes. Despite these developments, it has only been relatively recently that researchers have begun to consider the relationship of cultural factors to parasympathetic autonomic control. In this chapter we provide an overview of heart rate variability (HRV), one of the primary biomarkers, or indicators, of parasympathetic activity. We also describe a regulatory model linking HRV to health and disease, and review the extant literature exploring associations among HRV, ethnicity, and discrimination. Last, we discuss some of the considerations suggested by this research that may be useful in guiding future thinking on the relationship between cultural factors and parasympathetic activity.

AB  - The complexity of neurodevelopment, the rapidity of early neurogenesis, and over 100 years of research identifying environmental influences on neurodevelopment serve as backdrop to understanding factors that influence risk and severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This Keynote Lecture, delivered at the May 2016 annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, describes concepts of causation, outlines the trajectory of research on nongenetic factors beginning in the 1960s, and briefly reviews the current state of this science. Causal concepts are introduced, including root causes; pitfalls in interpreting time trends as clues to etiologic factors; susceptible time windows for exposure; and implications of a multi-factorial model of ASD. An historical background presents early research into the origins of ASD. The epidemiologic literature from the last fifteen years is briefly but critically reviewed for potential roles of, for example, air pollution, pesticides, plastics, prenatal vitamins, lifestyle and family factors, and maternal obstetric and metabolic conditions during her pregnancy. Three examples from the case-control CHildhood Autism Risks from Genes and the Environment Study are probed to illustrate methodological approaches to central challenges in observational studies: capturing environmental exposure; causal inference when a randomized controlled clinical trial is either unethical or infeasible; and the integration of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences on development. We conclude with reflections on future directions, including exposomics, new technologies, the microbiome, gene-by-environment interaction in the era of ?omics, and epigenetics as the interface of those two. As the environment is malleable, this research advances the goal of a productive and fulfilling life for all children, teen-agers and adults.

Lay Summary This Keynote Lecture, delivered at the 2016 meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, discusses evidence from human epidemiologic studies of prenatal factors contributing to autism, such as pesticides, maternal nutrition and her health. There is no single cause for autism. Examples highlight the features of a high-quality epidemiology study, and what comprises a compelling case for causation. Emergent research directions hold promise for identifying potential interventions to reduce disabilities, enhance giftedness, and improve lives of those with ASD.

AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.
