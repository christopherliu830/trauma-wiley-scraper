AB  - Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EV) are a heterogeneous collection of membrane-surrounded structures released from all studied cells, under both physiological and pathological conditions. These nano-size vesicles carry complex cargoes including different classes of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and are known to act as a communication and signalling vesicles in various cellular process. In addition to their role in development and progression of pathological disorders which make them potentially great biomarkers, EV have beneficial effects, as they take part in homeostasis. In this review we have analysed the evidence for the role of microvesicles and exosomes secreted from other cells on microvascular endothelium (EV uptake) as well as the role of endothelial-derived vesicles on their neighbouring and distant cells (EV release).

AB  - Abstract As coaching becomes an established learning and development tool, it expands to new work contexts and relevant populations. Exploring coaching outcomes in insolvent entrepreneurs is a new and promising field. Business failure is a devastating experience for entrepreneurs, associated with negative emotions and adverse psychological and physiological reactions. Our study is the first to examine if coaching can help improve the coping resources, health, and cognitive performance of insolvent entrepreneurs. The results of our pre-post-test-within-subject analyses based on 19 participants show a positive improvement in psychological well-being, vital exhaustion, and vigilance. By contrast, no improvements were found with regard to coping resources and biomarkers such as stress hormones concentrations in hair. Unexpectedly, the working alliance between client and coach did not increase the improvements following coaching. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the effects of coaching, however, our results should be interpreted cautiously as unfortunately we had no opportunity to include a control group in our research design.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) has been used to study tumor response to treatment for many years. In this study, the modified full width at half-maximum (mFWHM), calculated from the wash-in slope histogram, is proposed as a parameter for the evaluation of changes in tumor heterogeneity which respond to radiotherapy. Twenty-five patients with brain tumors were evaluated and divided into the nonresponder group (n?=?11) and the responder group (n?=?14) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All selected tumors were evaluated by mFWHM ratios of post- to pre-therapy (the ratio was defined as the therapeutic mFWHM ratio, TMR). The changes in kurtosis of the histograms and the averaged Ktrans within a tumor were also calculated for comparison. The receiver operating characteristic analysis and Kaplan?Meier curves were used to examine the diagnosis ability. The TMR values were significantly higher in nonresponders than in responders (p?<?0.001). When compared with the other two parameters, the proposed method also demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity. When adopting the TMR for the estimation of prognosis after therapy, there was a significant difference between the population survival curves. In conclusion, the derived mFWHM reflects tumor heterogeneity, and the ability to depict patient survival probability from TMR corresponds well with that from RECIST. The results reveal that, in brain tumors, progression may be exhibited not only by tumor size, but also by tumor heterogeneity. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses unstable angina (UA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). In 2007?2008 in Australia, there were 95?000 hospitalisations for ACS. There is limited data about the level of agreement between the ED and hospital discharge diagnosis. The objective of the present study is to describe the proportion of ED patients with a concordant ACS hospital discharge diagnosis and determine factors associated with this. Methods The present study was a retrospective case series of consecutive presentations of patients with ACS to the EDs of Southern Health, Victoria, Australia, during a 6 month period between August 2011 and January 2012. Results One thousand and twenty-eight patients diagnosed with ACS in the ED were identified. Hospital discharge diagnosis was recorded for 704 cases. The mean age was 63 years (SD 14.5) and 69% were male. One hundred and nineteen patients (16.9%) were diagnosed with a STEMI, 322 (45.7%) with a NSTEMI and 263 (37.4%) with UA. There were 68.3% who had a concordant discharge diagnosis of ACS. An ED diagnosis of STEMI (87.4), English as the primary language (OR 1.81 [1.13?2.89]) and chest pain as the presenting complaint (OR 2.70 [1.72?4.23]) were associated with a concordant diagnosis of ACS. Conclusion Almost one-third of patients who are admitted to the hospital with ACS have a different hospital discharge diagnosis. English as a primary language and presenting with chest pain are associated with a more concordant diagnosis. More research needs to be performed to better understand these findings.

AB  - Summary Comprehensive preclinical safety testing in vitro and in animal models is mandatory when developing a potential new pharmaceutical compound. The primary objectives of such studies are to demonstrate that, under the conditions of human volunteer profiling and in therapy, the potential new drug is safe or its side effects can be monitored and managed. Hence, regulatory agencies need to be assured that the benefits of a new medicine outweigh the risks of therapy. Toxicologists have to assist clinicians in determining the likely range of safe exposures to the new pharmaceutical in appropriate animal and in vitro models and the possible consequences if these doses are exceeded. Early response surrogate biomarkers for toxicity can indicate when safety limits have been breached, but before significant damage has occurred. The chapter on preclinical safety describes the necessary experiments, their design and conduct versus the background of regulatory guideline expectations. The chapter also comprises expectations for animal safety testing of biologics, juvenile toxicity and describes new challenges for non-clinical safety studies such as the use of pluripotent stem cells.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Summary Primary care guidelines provide a reference point to guide clinicians based on a systematic review of the literature, contextualised by expert clinical opinion. These guidelines develop a modification of the GRADE framework for assessment of research evidence (vetGRADE) and applied this to a range of clinical scenarios regarding use of analgesic agents. Key guidelines produced by the panel included recommendations that horses undergoing routine castration should receive intratesticular local anaesthesia irrespective of methods adopted and that horses should receive NSAIDs prior to surgery (overall certainty levels high). Butorphanol and buprenorphine should not be considered appropriate as sole analgesic for such procedures (high certainty). The panel recommend the continuation of analgesia for 3 days following castration (moderate certainty) and conclude that phenylbutazone provided superior analgesia to meloxicam and firocoxib for hoof pain/laminitis (moderate certainty), but that enhanced efficacy has not been demonstrated for joint pain. In horses with colic, flunixin and firocoxib are considered to provide more effective analgesia than meloxicam or phenylbutazone (moderate certainty). Given the risk of adverse events of all classes of analgesic, these agents should be used only under the control of a veterinary surgeon who has fully evaluated a horse and developed a therapeutic, analgesic plan that includes ongoing monitoring for such adverse events such as the development of right dorsal colitis with all classes of NSAID and spontaneous locomotor activity and potentially ileus with opiates. Finally, the panel call for the development of a single properly validated composite pain score for horses to allow accurate comparisons between medications in a robust manner.

AB  - Abstract Maternal emotion dysregulation (ED) plays a crucial role in the development of psychopathology in children. The current study aimed to investigate parenting stress as a mediator of the relationship between maternal emotion dysregulation and child startle potentiation, with child sex as a moderator. Mothers were interviewed to obtain self-report of maternal ED and parenting stress and child's dark-enhanced startle (DES) response was measured using electromyographic recordings of the eye-blink muscle during the delivery of acoustic probes. We found that maternal ED was positively correlated with both her parenting stress and her child's DES. A bootstrap analysis yielded a full mediation of the association between ED and child DES via parenting stress. Child sex was not a significant moderator of these relationships. These results suggest that maternal ED has important consequences for the intergenerational transmission of risk and also highlight the interaction of behavioral and biological mechanisms of risk.

AB  - Summary Preclinical evidence supports targeting the C5a receptor (C5aR) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To support ongoing clinical development of an anti-C5aR monoclonal antibody, we have investigated for the first time the mechanism of action and the pharmacodynamics of a blocking anti-murine C5aR (anti-mC5aR) surrogate antibody in mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). First, efficacy was demonstrated in a multiple-dose treatment study. Almost complete inhibition of clinical disease progression was obtained, including reduced bone and cartilage destruction in anti-mC5aR-treated mice. Then, the mechanism of action was examined by looking for early effects of anti-mC5aR treatment in single-dose treatment studies. We found that 48?h after single-dose treatment with anti-mC5aR, the neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the paws was already reduced. In addition, several inflammatory markers, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17A were reduced locally in the paws, indicating reduction of local inflammation. Furthermore, dose-setting experiments supported a beneficial clinical effect of dosing above the C5aR saturation level. In conclusion, these preclinical data demonstrated rapid onset effects of antibody blockade of C5aR. The data have translational value in supporting the Novo Nordisk clinical trials of an anti-C5aR antibody in rheumatoid arthritis patients, by identifying potential biomarkers of treatment effects as well as by providing information on pharmacodynamics and novel insights into the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibody blockade of C5aR.

AB  - Summary The vascular endothelial surface is coated by the glycocalyx, a ubiquitous gel-like layer composed of a membrane-binding domain that contains proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycan side-chains, and plasma proteins such as albumin and antithrombin. The endothelial glycocalyx plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, this component is highly vulnerable to damage and is also difficult to examine. Recent advances in analytical techniques have enabled biochemical, visual and computational investigation of this vascular component. The glycocalyx modulates leukocyte?endothelial interactions, thrombus formation and other processes that lead to microcirculatory dysfunction and critical organ injury in sepsis. It also acts as a regulator of vascular permeability and contains mechanosensors as well as receptors for growth factors and anticoagulants. During the initial onset of sepsis, the glycocalyx is damaged and circulating levels of glycocalyx components, including syndecans, heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid, can be measured and are reportedly useful as biomarkers for sepsis. Also, a new methodology using side-stream dark-field imaging is now clinically available for assessing the glycocalyx. Multiple factors including hypervolemia and hyperglycemia are toxic to the glycocalyx, and several agents have been proposed as therapeutic modalities, although no single treatment has been proven to be clinically effective. In this article, we review the derangement of the glycocalyx in sepsis. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the important roles of the glycocalyx, the relationship between derangement of the endothelial glycocalyx and severity of sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been adequately elucidated and further work is needed.

AB  - We aim to investigate the pathological background of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The most recent 545 cases from the Brain Bank for Aging Research (BBAR) were studied, with a mean age of 80.7?years and male?:?female ratio of 324?:?221. Cases with clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) 0.5 were retrieved as the best substitute of MCI. CDR was retrospectively determined from clinical charts. Pathological examinations followed the BBAR protocol (JNEN 2004). Post mortem assessment of CDR was possible for 486 cases, and was 0 in 201 cases, 0.5 in 57 cases and 1?3 in 228 cases. CDR 0.5 group was clinicopathologically classified into 33 cases with degenerative changes, nine cases with vascular changes, four cases with combined degenerative and vascular changes, two with hippocampal sclerosis, two with trauma, one with metabolic disease and six with unremarkable changes. The degenerative group was further subclassified into groups with pure and combined pathology. The former consisted of six cases each with Alzheimer change (AC), argyrophilic grain change (AGC) and neurofibrillary tangle predominant change (NFTC), three each with Lewy body disease change without parkinsonism (DLBC) or Parkinson's disease (PDMCI) and one case with progressive supranuclear palsy. The latter consisted of three cases with AC plus AGC, two with AGC plus NFTC and one each with AC plus DLBC, DLBC plus amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and AGC plus DLBC. The pathological backgrounds of patients of class CDR 0.5 were varied and not restricted to AC.

AB  - Abstract The clinical utility of sentinel node biopsy for melanoma has led multiple investigators to apply this approach to other cutaneous malignancies as well as to early cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. Data are most extensive for oral cancer. A multi-institutional pathologic validation trial for selected oral cancers provided negative predictive values of 96%. Subsequent trials should document clinical follow-up. This technique may ultimately play a wider role in the management of mucosal cancers. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;97:683?690. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
