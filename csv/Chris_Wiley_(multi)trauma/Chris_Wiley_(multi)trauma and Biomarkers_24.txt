AB  - Abstract Dementia is a common condition of the elderly characterised by multiple cognitive deficits resulting in a decline from previous level of function. In the older person, multiple pathologies contribute, including changes commonly seen in Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies in addition to vascular changes. Comorbid factors, such as depression, delirium and polypharmacy can contribute to cognitive decline. Novel biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques may assist in the near future to improve accuracy of diagnosis. To date, pharmacological therapies have been largely unsuccessful and provide symptomatic relief only. The timely diagnosis of dementia can facilitate important discussions regarding personal and financial planning and introduce education and supports to the person with dementia and their carers. The person with dementia commonly experiences behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia that may cause much distress, including to families and carers. Clinical guidelines indicate non-pharmacological approaches as first line measures, including attention to pain, nutrition and the environment. Dementia is recognised as a National Health Priority in Australia, and efforts to target risk factors as preventative measures to delay onset of dementia require further urgent consideration.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive focus on 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) as candidate molecule in a variety of pathophysiological conditions occurring in humans is here provided. Despite an active, now well characterized, metabolism in most cells and tissues, HNE can be easily detected and quantified by means of several methods, although with different sensitivity. Measurements of HNE and/or stable metabolites in biological fluids are already applied as lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress markers in a huge number of human disease processes, often sustained by inflammatory reactions. A primary involvement of this aldehydic product of membrane lipid oxidation in inflammation-related events, as well as in regulation of cell proliferation and growth, in necrotic or apoptotic cell death, appears supported by its marked ability to modulate several major pathways of cell signaling and, consequently, gene expression. The actual knowledge of HNE reactivity, metabolism, signaling and modulatory effect in the various human organs should provide a solid background to the investigation of the aldehyde's contribution to the pathogenesis of human major chronic diseases and would likely promote advanced and oriented applications not only in diagnosis and prevention but also in molecular treatment of human diseases. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A concept for a new generation of an integrated multi-functional biosensor/actuator system is developed, which is based on biomolecular logic principles. Such a system is expected to be able to detect multiple biochemical input signals simultaneously and in real-time and convert them into electrical output signals with logical operations such as OR, AND, etc. The system can be designed as a closed-loop drug release device triggered by an enzyme logic gate, while the release of the drug induced by the actuator at the required dosage and timing will be controlled by an additional drug sensor. Thus, the system could help to make an accurate and specific diagnosis. The presented concept is exemplarily demonstrated by using an enzyme logic gate based on a glucose/glucose oxidase system, a temperature-responsive hydrogel mimicking the actuator function and an insulin (drug) sensor. In this work, the results of functional testing of individual amperometric glucose and insulin sensors as well as an impedimetric sensor for the detection of the hydrogel swelling/shrinking are presented.

AB  - Summary Child maltreatment is a worldwide phenomenon that is still often under-recognised. This Chapter primarily covers physical and emotional maltreatment, and neglect; sexual abuse is specifically addressed in a separate chapter. Such abuse experiences are usually associated with marked distress, impairments in mental health, social and academic functioning. There are also physical changes including alterations in brain structure and an impact of chronic stress on inflammatory responses associated with physical health impairments. Awareness of such physical effects further adds to the importance of prompt recognition of maltreatment, effective treatment of its sequelae, and above all primary prevention. There are modest but encouraging findings emerging at each of these levels of intervention.

AB  - Summary Nowadays there is a continuous interest in addressing challenges related to the achievement of accurate and reliable monitoring of disease-related biomarkers relevant in the diagnostic process. In this context, biosensors have been developed as analytical tools capable to detect and quantify several analytes, bringing numerous advantages than other conventional techniques. Contrasting to conventional lab tests, which typically take hours or days to provide results to healthcare providers, sensors and biosensors can deliver accurate results in seconds, making them promising analytical devices ideal for medical applications. In the elaboration of biosensors, numerous materials have been studied and applied either as a biorecognition element or as the transducer surface modifier. The excellent electrical conductivity of graphene, besides their chemical, optical, mechanical and structural properties make them as valuable material for use in electrochemical sensors, electronic and optical sensors. The two-dimensional graphene sheets have captured the interest and imagination of physicist and chemists for different functionalization and combinations which can be applied in various biosensors architecture allowing detection with good sensitivity and stability. There are many research groups around the world creating their own unique graphene biosensors schemes and biosensing protocols customized for specific applications. This chapter outlines some fundamentals about structure and properties of graphene and recent literature on sensors and biosensors based on graphene proving practical applications on human fluid samples for medical diagnostics. The functionalization of graphene is comparatively discussed in view of (bio)sensor development.

AB  - Abstract Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) has emerged as a concerning global pathogen. hvKp is more virulent than classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and capable of causing community-acquired infections, often in healthy individuals. hvKp is carried in the gastrointestinal tract, which contributes to its spread in the community and healthcare settings. First recognized in Asia, hvKp arose as a leading cause of pyogenic liver abscesses. In the decades since, hvKp has spread globally and causes a variety of infections. In addition to liver abscesses, hvKp is distinct from cKp in its ability to metastasize to distant sites, including most commonly the eye, lung and central nervous system (CNS). hvKp has also been implicated in primary extrahepatic infections including bacteremia, pneumonia and soft tissue infections. The genetic determinants of hypervirulence are often found on large virulence plasmids as well as chromosomal mobile genetic elements which can be used as biomarkers to distinguish hvKp from cKp clinical isolates. These distinct virulence determinants of hvKp include up to four siderophore systems for iron acquisition, increased capsule production, K1 and K2 capsule types, and the colibactin toxin. Additionally, hvKp strains demonstrate hypermucoviscosity, a phenotypic description of hvKp in laboratory conditions that has become a distinguishing feature of many hypervirulent isolates. Alarmingly, multidrug-resistant hypervirulent strains have emerged, creating a new challenge in combating this already dangerous pathogen.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article reviews a body of work performed by the investigators over 9 years that has addressed the significance of cam morphology in the development of hip osteoarthritis (OA). Early hip joint degeneration is a common clinical presentation and preexisting abnormal joint morphology is a risk factor for its development. Interrogating Hill's criteria, we tested whether cam-type femoroacetabular impingement leads to hip OA. Strength of association was identified between cam morphology, reduced range-of-movement, hip pain, and cartilage degeneration. By studying a pediatric population, we were able to characterize the temporality between cam morphology (occurring 1st) and joint degeneration. Using in silico (finite element) and in vivo (imaging biomarkers) studies, we demonstrated the biological plausibility of how a cam deformity can lead to joint degeneration. Furthermore, we were able to show a biological gradient between degree of cam deformity and extent of articular damage. However, not all patients develop joint degeneration and we were able to characterize which factors contribute to this (specificity). Lastly, we were able to show that by removing the cam morphology, one could positively influence the degenerative process (experiment). The findings of this body of work show consistency and coherence with the literature. Furthermore, they illustrate how cam morphology can lead to early joint degeneration analogous to SCFE, dysplasia, and joint mal-reduction post-injury. The findings of this study open new avenues on the association between cam morphology and OA including recommendations for the study, screening, follow-up, and assessment (patient-specific) of individuals with cam morphology in order to prevent early joint degeneration. Statement of significance: By satisfying Hill's criteria, one can deduct that in some individuals, cam morphology is a cause of OA. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives: Low count of total and T helper lymphocytes predicts a poor prognosis in cancer patients and surgical trauma can worsen cancer-related immunodeficiency. Aim of this phase IB study is to verify toxicity and biological effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) at 9 million IU/day subcutaneously (sc.) administered one, two or three preoperative days in patients with gastric cancer undergoing radical surgery. Methods: Absolute value of total and T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes were measured at baseline and at 7th, 14th, and 50th postoperative days in 12 gastric cancer patients, who preoperatively received IL-2 at 9 million IU/day sc. as follows: group A (4 pts) 1-day; group B (4 pts) 2-days; group C (4 pts) 3-days administration. T and total lymphocytes count were recorded and retrospectively analyzed in a historical control-group of 22 consecutive patients, age and stage-matched. Results: Toxicity consisted of fever grade I. In group A (1 day) T helper lymphocytes count decreased at 7th and at 14th postoperative day; in group B (2 days) and group C (3 days) no decrease of neither total nor T helper lymphocyte count occurred postoperatively, whereas in the historical group these parameters decreased significantly postoperatively and recovered only at 50th day. Conclusions: Two- and three-day schedules of sc. IL-2 preoperative administration at 9 million IU/daily prevented postoperative lymphocytopenia, whereas one-day administration did not. Since the IL-2 dose was so tolerable, that it could be given safely as outpatient, based on the previous results on survival observed in colorectal cancer patients with 3-days schedule we suggest that a 3-day schedule of Interleukin-2 as outpatient preoperative treatment seems advisable for further studies in gastric cancer patients.

AB  - Abstract Aging is characterized by accumulation of structural and metabolic changes in the brain. Recent studies suggest transmodal brain networks are especially sensitive to aging, which, we hypothesize, may be due to their apical position in the cortical hierarchy. Studying an open-access healthy cohort (n = 102, age range = 30?89?years) with MRI and A? PET data, we estimated age-related cortical thinning, hippocampal atrophy and A? deposition. In addition to carrying out surface-based morphological and metabolic mapping experiments, we stratified effects along neocortical and hippocampal resting-state functional connectome gradients derived from independent datasets. The cortical gradient depicts an axis of functional differentiation from sensory-motor regions to transmodal regions, whereas the hippocampal gradient recapitulates its long-axis. While age-related thinning and increased A? deposition occurred across the entire cortical topography, increased A? deposition was especially pronounced toward higher-order transmodal regions. Age-related atrophy was greater toward the posterior end of the hippocampal long-axis. No significant effect of age on A? deposition in the hippocampus was observed. Imaging markers correlated with behavioral measures of fluid intelligence and episodic memory in a topography-specific manner, confirmed using both univariate as well as multivariate analyses. Our results strengthen existing evidence of structural and metabolic change in the aging brain and support the use of connectivity gradients as a compact framework to analyze and conceptualize brain-based biomarkers of aging.

AB  - Abstract Hybridization of nanoscale metals and carbon nanotubes into composite nanomaterials has produced some of the best-performing sensors to date. The challenge remains to develop scalable nanofabrication methods that are amenable to the development of sensors with broad sensing ranges. A scalable nanostructured biosensor based on multilayered graphene petal nanosheets (MGPNs), Pt nanoparticles, and a biorecognition element (glucose oxidase) is presented. The combination of zero-dimensional nanoparticles on a two-dimensional support that is arrayed in the third dimension creates a sensor platform with exceptional characteristics. The versatility of the biosensor platform is demonstrated by altering biosensor performance (i.e., sensitivity, detection limit, and linear sensing range) through changing the size, density, and morphology of electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles on the MGPNs. This work enables a robust sensor design that demonstrates exceptional performance with enhanced glucose sensitivity (0.3 µM detection limit, 0.01?50 mM linear sensing range), a long stable shelf-life (>1 month), and a high selectivity over electroactive, interfering species commonly found in human serum samples.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The present pilot study aimed to assess the practicality, safety and accuracy of performing CT coronary angiography (CT-CA) in the evaluation of acute chest pain of patients with low thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk scores. Methods:? The present prospective observational study was undertaken in a university teaching hospital between November 2004 and December 2005. Participants were a convenience sample of patients admitted to hospital for investigation of chest pain with TIMI risk scores <3. Consenting patients underwent CT-CA within 48?h of presentation. Outcomes of interest were practicality (proportion of diagnostic quality scans obtained and preparation time for CT-CA), rate of serious adverse events, and accuracy at the patient level using selective coronary angiography as the reference standard. Results:? Thirty-four patients were recruited. Diagnostic quality scans were obtained in 26/34 or 76% of patients (four failed CT-CA and four non-diagnostic scans). The median CT preparation time was 1.9?h (range 0.17?4.0). No serious adverse events were found. Fourteen of those 26 patients with diagnostic CT-CA subsequently had selective coronary angiography, of which nine were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of CT-CA in identifying patients with significant coronary artery disease were 9/9 (100%; 95% confidence interval 72?100%) and 4/5 (80%; 95% confidence interval 28?100%), respectively. Conclusions:? The majority of acute chest pain patients with low TIMI risk scores were successfully scanned with a 16-slice CT to produce CT-CA studies with good diagnostic quality and accuracy. No major adverse events were found. The place of CT-CA in diagnostic workup for chest pain remains to be defined.

AB  - Clinicians who manage delirium must do so without key information required for evidence-based practice, not least lack of any clearly effective treatment for established delirium. Both the nature of delirium and the methods used to research it contribute to difficulties. Delirium is heterogeneous, with respect to motor subtype, aetiology, setting and the co-existence of dementia, and may be almost inevitable towards the end of life. Elements of assessment are subjective, so diagnosis can be uncertain or unreliable. Defining objectives of care and outcomes is sometimes unclear. Better identification and case definition, including seeking biomarkers, stratification by type, or aetiology, and application of more complex models of causation may help. This will likely require further observational epidemiology, imaging and laboratory-based research before further rounds of large-scale randomised controlled trials. Application of trial methodologies designed for drug treatments of better-defined conditions may have failed to take account of the complexities both of diagnosis and complex intervention in delirium. Both drug and complex intervention trials need sufficient preliminary work to ensure that the right dose, duration or intensity of treatment is delivered and a range of ?intermediate? and ?distal? outcome measures assessed. Re-purposing of established drugs may provide a source of investigational products. Greater use of alternative research methodologies (qualitative and realist), or adjuvants to trials (process evaluation), will help answer questions about focus, generalisability and why interventions succeed or fail. Delirium research will have to embrace both a ?back to basics? approach with increased breadth of methodologies to make progress.

AB  - Abstract Objective Risk scores and accelerated diagnostic protocols can identify chest pain patients with low risk of major adverse cardiac event who could be discharged early from the ED, saving time and costs. We aimed to derive and validate a chest pain score and accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP) that could safely increase the proportion of patients suitable for early discharge. Methods Logistic regression identified statistical predictors for major adverse cardiac events in a derivation cohort. Statistical coefficients were converted to whole numbers to create a score. Clinician feedback was used to improve the clinical plausibility and the usability of the final score (Emergency Department Assessment of Chest pain Score [EDACS]). EDACS was combined with electrocardiogram results and troponin results at 0 and 2?h to develop an ADP (EDACS-ADP). The score and EDACS-ADP were validated and tested for reproducibility in separate cohorts of patients. Results In the derivation (n = 1974) and validation (n = 608) cohorts, the EDACS-ADP classified 42.2% (sensitivity 99.0%, specificity 49.9%) and 51.3% (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 59.0%) as low risk of major adverse cardiac events, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient for categorisation of patients as low risk was 0.87. Conclusion The EDACS-ADP identified approximately half of the patients presenting to the ED with possible cardiac chest pain as having low risk of short-term major adverse cardiac events, with high sensitivity. This is a significant improvement on similar, previously reported protocols. The EDACS-ADP is reproducible and has the potential to make considerable cost reductions to health systems.
