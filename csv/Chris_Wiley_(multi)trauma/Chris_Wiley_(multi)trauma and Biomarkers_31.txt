AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective Prealbumin levels have been proven to correlate with hospital length of stay, wound healing, infection rates, and mortality in adults hospitalized for medical or surgical purposes, or those who have chronic illnesses. Little is known about the utility of prealbumin evaluation in adults with severe anorexia nervosa (AN). Method We retrospectively evaluated prealbumin levels, along with numerous other clinical parameters relevant to illness acuity and early refeeding outcomes, in 132 adults with AN admitted for definitive inpatient medical stabilization from October 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012. Per clinical protocol, prealbumin was checked on admission and approximately weekly thereafter until discharge. Results Patients had a median age of 28 years old, a mean admission body mass index (BMI) of 12.9 kg/m2 (S.D. 6.1), and 89% of patients were women. A total of 47% of patients had a low prealbumin at the time of admission. By discharge, 77% of patients had normalized their prealbumin levels. Patients with low admission prealbumin levels had a threefold increased risk of refeeding hypophosphatemia and a twofold increase in hypoglycemia compared with patients who had a normal admission prealbumin, independent of admission BMI. Discussion A low serum prealbumin level appeared concurrent with other markers of serious medical compromise, and was associated with two potentially life threatening complications of early refeeding: hypophosphatemia and hypoglycemia. The cause of low prealbumin remains elusive. Prealbumin should be checked in patients with severe AN prior to initiating weight restoration, as low levels may be an important harbinger of early refeeding complications. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Immunoassays have long been an important set of tools in clinical laboratories for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Over the last two decades, there has been growing interest in utilizing CE as a means for conducting immunoassays with clinical samples. The resulting method is known as a CE immunoassay. This approach makes use of the selective and strong binding of antibodies for their targets, as is employed in a traditional immunoassay, and combines this with the speed, efficiency, and small sample requirements of CE. This review discusses the variety of ways in which CE immunoassays have been employed with clinical samples. An overview of the formats and detection modes that have been employed in these applications is first presented. A more detailed discussion is then given on the type of clinical targets and samples that have been measured or studied by using CE immunoassays. Particular attention is given to the use of this method in the fields of endocrinology, pharmaceutical measurements, protein and peptide analysis, immunology, infectious disease detection, and oncology. Representative applications in each of these areas are described, with these examples involving work with both traditional and microanalytical CE systems.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Occupations characterized by a static low load and by repetitive actions show a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in the neck?shoulder region. Moreover, muscle fatigue and discomfort are reported to play a relevant initiating role in WMSD. Aims: To investigate relationships between altered sensory information, i.e. localized muscle fatigue, discomfort and pain and their associations to changes in motor control patterns. Materials & Methods:? In total 101 subjects participated. Questionnaires, subjective assessments of perceived exertion and pain intensity as well as surface electromyography (SEMG), mechanomyography (MMG), force and kinematics recordings were performed. Results:? Multi-channel SEMG and MMG revealed that the degree of heterogeneity of the trapezius muscle activation increased with fatigue. Further, the spatial organization of trapezius muscle activity changed in a dynamic manner during sustained contraction with acute experimental pain. A graduation of the motor changes in relation to the pain stage (acute, subchronic and chronic) and work experience were also found. The duration of the work task was shorter in presence of acute and chronic pain. Acute pain resulted in decreased activity of the painful muscle while in subchronic and chronic pain, a more static muscle activation was found. Posture and movement changed in the presence of neck?shoulder pain. Larger and smaller sizes of arm and trunk movement variability were respectively found in acute pain and subchronic/chronic pain. The size and structure of kinematics variability decreased also in the region of discomfort. Motor variability was higher in workers with high experience. Moreover, the pattern of activation of the upper trapezius muscle changed when receiving SEMG/MMG biofeedback during computer work. Discussion:? SEMG and MMG changes underlie functional mechanisms for the maintenance of force during fatiguing contraction and acute pain that may lead to the widespread pain seen in WMSD. A lack of harmonious muscle recruitment/derecruitment may play a role in pain transition. Motor behavior changed in shoulder pain conditions underlining that motor variability may play a role in the WMSD development as corroborated by the changes in kinematics variability seen with discomfort. This prognostic hypothesis was further, supported by the increased motor variability among workers with high experience. Conclusion:? Quantitative assessments of the functional motor adaptations can be a way to benchmark the pain status and help to indentify signs indicating WMSD development. Motor variability is an important characteristic in ergonomic situations. Future studies will investigate the potential benefit of inducing motor variability in occupational settings.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion of Immunological Origin (RSAI) is currently diagnosed by the occurrence of 2?3 consecutive miscarriages of unknown origin. The psychological trauma incurred by these events is a serious ailment which may be potentially avoided if a method of analysis is derived which may forecast these events and in turn prevent them from occurring. This review intends to examine studies of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) which use laboratory diagnosis and also studies of RSA that do not use laboratory diagnosis. We believe that when laboratory results are incorporated into the diagnosis of RSA/RSAI that treatment is highly successful whereas the absence of laboratory results severely hinders the effectiveness of treatment. It is worth noting that correlating treatment versus outcome is imprudent because of the multiple variables involved in patient cases. It is not imprudent, however, to say that incorporation of laboratory data is essential when diagnosing RSA/RSAI.

AB  - Abstract The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) is a multi-site naturalistic cohort study to: (1) describe the long-term course and consequences of depressive and anxiety disorders, and (2) to integrate biological and psychosocial research paradigms within an epidemiological approach in order to examine (interaction between) predictors of the long-term course and consequences. Its design is an eight-year longitudinal cohort study among 2981 participants aged 18 through 65 years. The sample consists of 1701 persons with a current (six-month recency) diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorder, 907 persons with life-time diagnoses or at risk because of a family history or subthreshold depressive or anxiety symptoms, and 373 healthy controls. Recruitment took place in the general population, in general practices (through a three-stage screening procedure), and in mental health organizations in order to recruit persons reflecting various settings and developmental stages of psychopathology. During a four-hour baseline assessment including written questionnaires, interviews, a medical examination, a cognitive computer task and collection of blood and saliva samples, extensive information was gathered about key (mental) health outcomes and demographic, psychosocial, clinical, biological and genetic determinants. Detailed assessments will be repeated after one, two, four and eight years of follow-up. The findings of NESDA are expected to provide more detailed insight into (predictors of) the long-term course of depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. Besides its scientific relevance, this may contribute to more effective prevention and treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - Abstract Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is correlated with angiogenesis and early relapse of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study investigated the role of miR-148a in the regulation of VEGF/angiogenesis and early relapse of CRC. We established a stable clone with miR-148a expression in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines and created a hypoxic condition by using CoCl2 to determine the underlying mechanism of miR-148a. The effects of miR-148a on the phosphoryl-ERK (pERK)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/VEGF pathway were evaluated through Western blotting and the inhibitory effect of miR-148a on angiogenesis was demonstrated through a tube formation assay. Sixty-three CRC tissues (28 early relapse and 35 non-early relapse) were analysed to assess the relationship between miR-148a and HIF-1α/VEGF. The protein expression of pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF in HCT116 and HT29 cells was significantly decreased by miR-148a (all P < 0.05). The protein expression of VEGF/HIF-1α was strongly inversely associated with the expression of miR-148a in the 63 CRC tissue samples (all P < 0.05). Tube formation assay demonstrated that miR-148a significantly obliterated angiogenesis. miR-148a suppresses VEGF through down-regulation of the pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway and might lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis; miR-148a down-regulation increased the early relapse rate of CRC. This demonstrates that miR-148a is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.

AB  - Abstract Objectives As mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be isolated easily from adipose tissues while retaining their self-renewal and multi-potential differentiation capacities, they hold promising possibilities for being applied extensively in tissue engineering. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members have been reported to provide instructive signals to MSCs for them to differentiate into several different cell lineages. The study described here aims to investigate whether BMP-4 could promote adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) differentiation into adipocytes under various concentrations. Materials and methods ASCs were isolated from mouse inguinal adipose pads and cultured in vitro. 10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml BMP-4 were added to adipogenic media for 8 days. Oil red-O staining, reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and immunocytofluorescence staining were performed to examine differentiation of the ASCs. Results As indicated by increased expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes (PPAR-?, APN and LPL) and proteins, 50 ng/ml BMP-4 seemed to induce mASCs to differentiate into the adipo-lineage compared to 10 ng/ml BMP-4, and control groups. In addition, lipid droplets accumulated within the adipocytes under 50 ng/ml BMP-4 stimulation, as shown by oil red-O staining. Conclusions Our present study suggests that BMP-4, as an adipo-inducing factor, promoted adipogenesis of ASCs at higher concentrations (50 ng/ml) and can perhaps be considered as a candidate for use in adipose tissue engineering.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction: The aim of this study was to apply quantitative MRI (qMRI) to assess structural modifications in thigh muscles of subjects with limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2A and 2B with long disease duration. Methods: Eleven LGMD2A, 9 LGMD2B patients and 11 healthy controls underwent a multi-parametric 3T MRI examination of the thigh. The protocol included structural T1-weighted images, DIXON sequences for fat fraction calculation, T2 values quantification and diffusion MRI. Region of interest analysis was performed on 4 different compartments (anterior compartment, posterior compartment, gracilis, sartorius). Results: Patients showed high levels of fat infiltration as measured by DIXON sequences. Sartorius and anterior compartment were more infiltrated in LGMD2B than LGMD2A patients. T2 values were mildly reduced in both disorders. Correlations between clinical scores and qMRI were found. Conclusions: qMRI measures may help to quantify muscular degeneration, but careful interpretation is needed when fat infiltration is massive. Muscle Nerve 58: 550?558, 2018

AB  - Abstract Clinical and point-of-care disease diagnostics promise to play an important role in personalized medicine, new approaches to global health, and health monitoring. Emerging instrument platforms based on lab-on-a-chip technology can confer perfomance advantages successfully exploited in electrophoresis and electrochromatography to affinity-based electrokinetic separations. This review surveys lab-on-a-chip diagnostic developments in affinity-based electokinetic separations for quantitation of proteins, integration of preparatory functions needed for subsequent analysis of diverse biological samples, and initial forays into multiplexed analyses. The technologies detailed here underpin new clinical and point-of-care diagnostic strategies. The techniques and devices promise to advance translation of until now laborabory-based sample preparation and analytical assays to near-patient settings.

AB  - ABSTRACT Rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures, and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), are examples of chronic (RCT and CTS) and acute (ACL ruptures) musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. These injuries are multifactorial in nature, with several identified intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Previous studies have implicated specific sequence variants within genes encoding structural and regulatory components of the extracellular matrix of tendons and/ligaments to predispose individuals to these injuries. An example, includes the association of sequence variants within the apoptotic regulatory gene, caspase-8 (CASP8) with other musculoskeletal injury phenotypes, such as Achilles tendinopathy. The primary aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate previously implicated DNA sequence variants within CASP8: rs3834129 (ins/del) and rs1045485 (G/C), and the rs13113 (T/A) identified using a whole exome sequencing approach, with risk of musculoskeletal injury phenotypes (RCT, ACL ruptures, and CTS) in three independent studies. In addition, the aim was to implicate a CASP8 genomic interval in the modulation of risk of RCT, ACL ruptures, or CTS. It was found that the AA genotype of CASP8 rs13113 (T/A) was independently associated with increased risk for CTS. In addition, it was found that the del-C haplotype (rs3834129?rs1045485) was significantly associated with non-contact ACL ruptures, which is in alignment with previous research findings. Collectively, the results of this study implicate the apoptosis pathway as biologically significant in the underlying pathogenesis of musculoskeletal injury phenotypes. These findings should be repeated in larger sample cohorts and across different populations. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 38:680?688, 2020

Role of decreased brain glucose metabolism in neurofibrillary degeneration ?? Subgroups of AD ?? Therapeutic approaches to inhibit neurofibrillary degeneration Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is multi-factorial and heterogeneous. Independent of the aetiology, this disease is characterized clinically by chronic and progressive dementia and histopathologically by neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau seen as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites, and by neuritic (senile) plaques of ?-amyloid. The neurofibrillary degeneration is apparently required for the clinical expression of AD, and in related tauopathies it leads to dementia in the absence of amyloid plaques. While normal tau promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau sequesters normal tau, MAP1 and MAP2, and disrupts microtubules. The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau also promotes its self-assembly into tangles of paired helical and or straight filaments. Tau is phosphorylated by a number of protein kinases. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and cyclin dependent protein kinase 5 (cdk5) are among the kinases most implicated in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. Among the phosphatases which regulate the phosphorylation of tau, protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A), the activity of which is down-regulated in AD brain, is by far the major enzyme. The inhibition of abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the development of disease modifying drugs. A great advantage of inhibiting neurofibrillary degeneration is that it can be monitored by evaluating the levels of total tau and tau phosphorylated at various known abnormally hyperphosphorylated sites in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients, obtained by lumbar puncture. There are at least five subgroups of AD, each is probably caused by a different etiopathogenic mechanism. The AD subgroup identification of patients can help increase the success of clinical trials and the development of specific and potent disease modifying drugs.
