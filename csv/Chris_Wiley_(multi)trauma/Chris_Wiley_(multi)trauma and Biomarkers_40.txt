AB  - Introduction Differentiating left ventricular (LV) dilatation caused by aortic regurgitation (AR) from athletic eccentric LV hypertrophy can be challenging. In human medicine, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and 2D speckle tracking (2DST) are used to distinguish ?athlete's heart? from pathological conditions. Methods 40 healthy horses (group 1) were compared to 13 horses with moderate AR (group 2) and 11 horses with severe AR (group 3), all with an end diastolic LV internal diameter (LVIDd) within maximal reference limits (≤14.2?cm). Fractional shortening (FS) was measured from a short-axis M-mode at chordal level. Peak TDI velocities during systole (S), early (E) and late (A) diastole were measured in the LV free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IVS). Global longitudinal strain was measured by 2DST. Groups were compared by a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Results The study included Warmbloods (n?=?52), trotters (n?=?9) and Thoroughbreds (n?=?3), used for jumping, dressage, racing and eventing. Group 2 (15?±?5 years; P<0.001) and 3 (20?±?4 years; P<0.001) were older than group 1 (8?±?4 years). LVIDd in group 3 (13.1?±?0.7 cm) was higher compared to group 1 (11.5?±?0.8?cm; P<0.001) and 2 (12.0?±?0.8?cm; P?=?0.003) but FS was not different. Peak S in IVS was higher in group 2 (6.6?±?1.5?cm/s; P?=?0.001) and 3 (9.0?±?1.7?cm/s; P<0.001) compared to group 1 (4.4?±?1.8?cm/s), indicating hyperkinetic septal motion. Peak E in LVFW was lower in group 2 (18.6?±?5.2?cm/s;P?=?0.001) and 3 (19.3?±?3.9?cm/s; P?=?0.006) compared to group 1 (24.4?±?4.6?cm/s), indicating decreased early filling velocity. Longitudinal strain was not different between groups. Conclusions TDI shows potential for differentiating AR-induced LV remodeling from athletic eccentric hypertrophy in horses.

AB  - Introduction Measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is the gold standard for assessing aerobic capacity, but in horses requires use of stationary equipment and a high-speed treadmill. Study objectives were to evaluate a portable system designed to measure VO2 in a field setting and to describe these measurements in a cohort of untrained Thoroughbreds. Methods Ventilatory parameters and VO2 were measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbreds (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask with customized software validated for horses galloping on a treadmill with an open-circuit flow-through gas collection system. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. Data was collected as horses travelled riderless up a 2% inclined woodchip track. Pre- and 5 minute post-exercise plasma lactate ([La5]), HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded and analysed by unpaired t-test and Pearson's correlation (P ≤ 0.05). Results All horses tolerated the mask and saddle pad. Exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm and [La5] 22.7?±?5.5?mmol/l. Average VO2peak, based on 6 breaths, was 117.7?±?24.1?ml/kg/min, breathing frequency 125.8?±?7.1?bpm, inspiratory volume 13.2?±?1.7?L, expiratory volume 13.4?±?1.9?L and minute ventilation 1669.3?±?193.3?L/min. VO2peak was not significantly different between colts (112.2?±?27.7?ml/kg/min) and fillies (121.4?±?21.3?ml/kg/min). There were no correlations between VO2peak and other measured parameters. There was a positive linear correlation between VO2peak and HRpeak (P?=?0.046, R2?=?0.16). Conclusions VO2peak values were similar to published reports for yearling Thoroughbreds. The high exercise intensity and linear relationship between VO2peak and HRpeak provides confidence in the system for field studies of aerobic capacity in untrained, unridden horses.

AB  - Introduction In chuckwagon racing, dubbed the ?half-mile of hell?, teams often race multiple consecutive days. Horses are in peak condition, however rare cases of sudden death attributed to cardiovascular failure occur. There are concerns regarding cumulative racing and its impact on the risk of sudden death. The objective was to determine if cumulative exercise affects integrity of the myocardium, assessed by high-sensitivity troponin-T (cTnT), and if the presence of arrhythmias during race or recovery affects plasma cTnT concentrations. Methods Heart rate and electrical activity were recorded on 148 horses (9?±?2.7 years) during racing days 1 and 2. 750 plasma samples were analysed (374 pre-exercise, 376 post-exercise) comparing cTnT before and after activity (paired t-test). Associations between consecutive racing days, age and cTnT were analysed (ANOVA, Pearson Correlation). The relationship between arrhythmias and cTnT was also examined. Results cTnT increased significantly with exercise (pre: 4.52?ng/L?±?0.17, post: 5.20?ng/L?±?0.23, P<0.001). However cTnt was not affected by cumulative exercise. A correlation between age and cTnT was found. 4235 arrhythmic events were recorded. No association existed between cTnT (post-exercise) and the presence of arrhythmias during exercise and recovery. Conclusions This is the first study examining the effect of exercise on high-sensitivity cTnT in horses and first large-scale study on chuckwagon horses. Racing increases cTnT, however values remain low, suggesting myocardial damage of little clinical significance. Chuckwagon horses have long careers therefore age and cTnT could be further examined. cTnT was not affected by the presence of arrhythmias during exercise, indicating chuckwagon racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a dominant, missense mutation in the equine glycogen synthase gene (GYS1) that increases the enzyme's activity. The amino acid sequence surrounding the PSSM1 mutation is highly conserved amongst species from yeast to horses suggesting that this region plays an important role, but its functional significance has yet to be determined. Methods Computer modelling can predict three dimensional (3D) protein structures using related proteins as templates. Yeast glycogen synthase (GS) has high sequence homology (73%) to the equine enzyme and since the yeast enzyme's structure has been solved, we hypothesised that in silico modelling based on the yeast protein using MODELLER and SwissPDBViewer software would predict the enzyme's structure and explain the mutant enzyme's increased activity. Results Homology-modelling revealed that, like the yeast enzyme, equine GS likely forms a tetramer surrounding a catalytic cleft and undergoes large structural rearrangements upon G6P binding to highly-conserved binding sites. The enzyme's glycogen binding sites are located on the extremities of the enzyme and are also conserved in the equine protein. The PSSM1 mutation lay close to the G6P binding site, but did not confer any clear structural rearrangement on the protein's 3D configuration. The mutation was distant from the known phosphorylation sites and the glycogen binding sites. Conclusions The close proximity of the mutation to the G6P binding site suggests that it might influence substrate interaction or allosteric regulation. Further studies evaluating G6P ligand binding and enzyme activation are warranted and might best be made following purification of the mutant and wild type proteins.

AB  - Introduction Myopathy associated with a gain-of- function mutation in the GYS1 gene is known in Quarter Horses and cold blood breeds. The mutation occurred between the collapse of the Roman Empire (500 AD) and the upsurge of Carolinian Reign (800 AD). The aim of this review is to reconstruct the development of the cold blood (brachimorph) breeds in Europe using existing literature. Methods Literature review Results Although archaeological evidence indicates the existence of a mesomorph horse (Cob) type in the early Iron Age, real cold blood breeding only started after 1750. The demand for draught power in the early Industrial Revolution resulted in a large population of cold bloods from 1850 onwards. In Roman times, the huge ugly horses from Thrace were known as ?easy keepers? and Ardennes might have been the first land races carrying the GYS1 mutation. Hunnish horses might have contributed to the prototype cold bloods as well. With mtDNA, Y-chromosome polymorphism, satellite markers and SNP genotyping some indication from where ancestors of particular breeds originate was obtained. Most phylogenetic trees place cold blood breeds, including Fell ponies, Haflinger and Friesian in a clearly different cluster than ponies, saddle horses and Thoroughbreds. Fjords and Mongolian horses are in neighbouring clusters. Since the last 200 years, genetic bottlenecks and the popular sire phenomenon could have caused high GYS1?H allele frequencies in many continental cold blood breeds. Conclusions Cold blood breeds and the GYS1 mutation likely trace back to the mesomorph tough, easily satisfied horse types from Eastern Europe and central Asia.

AB  - Introduction Turning is commonly used as a diagnostic aid in lameness examinations. Systematic movement deviations compared to locomotion in a straight line are noted across horses with variation at an individual level. This study aimed to investigate whether deviations from the expected body lean angle, predicted from the ratio of gravitational and centripetal accelerations, are consistent between trot and canter. It was hypothesized that, independent of gait, there would be agreement between the observed and predicted angle with variations on an individual horse level. Methods A GPS-aided inertial measurement unit was attached over the sacrum in twenty horses and quantified body lean angle, speed and circle radius in trot and canter on left and right rein. Predicted body lean angle was calculated from speed and circle radius and was compared to the observed body lean (?obs,pred). A generalized linear model was implemented to study the effect of horse, lungeing direction and gait. Results Mean speed and circle radius were 3.3?m/s and 4.9?m in trot and 4.5?m/s and 5.7?m in canter. On average ?obs,pred was ?1.1°in trot and ?0.8°in canter and was found to be significantly different between horses (P<0.0001) and between lungeing directions (P<0.0001) but not between gaits (P?=?0.14). Interactions between horse and direction (P<0.0001) and horse and gait (P?=?0.011) were also found to be significant. Conclusions Horses leaned marginally less into the circle than predicted. However, showing significant differences in body lean angle between horses and turn directions but not between gaits, we provide evidence for horse specific adaptations. Whether these are related to laterality or to underlying subclinical lameness needs to be further investigated. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

AB  - Introduction The diagonal limb support pattern at trot provides pitch and roll stability, controlled by regulating pitching moments about the centre of mass (COM). Correct COM location is critical in calculation of pitching moments, as COM location influences the contribution of loading in the fore and hindlimbs. This study examined the effect of COM location on pitching moments in trotting horses and explored how COM location could influence balance. Methods Kinematic (120?Hz) and GRF (4 force plates, 960?Hz) data were collected at trot from three strides of eight horses overground. The position of the COM was determined from the weighted summation of the segmental COMs from previously determined inertial data of Warmblood horses. The COM of the standing model was manipulated cranially and caudally to test the effects of pitching moments during trotting. Pitching moments were calculated for each manipulation of the model and their relationship determined using reduced major axis regression. Results Over the stride, the moments must sum to zero to prevent accumulation of rotational motion. This was found when the weight on the forelimbs in standing was 58.7%?±?3% (mean?±?95% C.I.). With this weight distribution moments were typically nose-up changing to nose-down at around 35% of stance, and then reversing again to nose-up in late stance. Conclusions Divergence of the COM from the COP creating a vertical force moment arm prior to midstance may aid in accelerating the COM about the hind foot, thereby passively assisting hindlimb propulsion. Lower forelimb weighting resulted in mean nose-up moments. Higher forelimb weighting resulted in mean nose-down moments. Both would cause an accumulation of pitching motion.

AB  - Introduction Track conditions in Thoroughbred racing significantly impact performance and injury. However, surface effects on limb biomechanics at racing speeds are poorly understood. Methods A racing shoe was modified to contain inertial transducers and a strain gauge to provide motion kinematics and a measure of hoof/surface interaction load. A two-phase non-linear surface reaction model was defined to represent the hoof deceleration phase, and the hoof penetration phase where the surface reaction force was represented by a quartic stiffness profile and a fixed damping term. Model parameters were determined using an ?output error? iteration method for 25 strides at medium gallop. Parameters were compared using a standard t-test. Results The sand track had a significantly greater (P<0.0001) maximum penetration of 61?±?10?mm (mean?±?SD), than the grass track (41?±?0.5?mm). Both stiffness parameters were significantly different between the two tracks (P<0.0001), but damping parameters did not differ significantly. Hoof impact at high speed involved decelerations of over 100 ?g? occurring within milliseconds. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a surface reaction model using data acquired from an instrumented horseshoe, distinguished between surface reaction profiles of a sand track and a grass track, as a step towards improving track rating methods. A further challenge will be to develop independent checks on instrument calibrations. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction The impact of cervical pathology on performance is of great importance to the equine industry. Accurate diagnosis of cervical disease with imaging modalities, including CT and MRI, requires thorough appreciation of normal cervical anatomy. The objectives of this study were to describe in detail the 3-dimensional anatomy of the equine cervical spine by comparing anatomical sections with corresponding MR and contrast-enhanced CT images in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and to determine the ability of MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging to visualize anatomical structures in the cervical spine. Methods Three cervical spines of young adults (3?8 years), were collected immediately after humane euthanasia. The spine was stabilized on a frame in a natural flexed position with an angle of 20-degrees. MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed within 6 hours after euthanasia. Anatomical sections of 1?cm were made in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and compared with corresponding CT and MR images. The intervertebral disk thickness, facet joint angle, amount of cerebrospinal fluid and amount of synovial fluid within each facet joint were quantified. Results The anatomical locations of clinically important structures including the facet joints, spinal cord, cervical nerve roots and intervertebral disks were reliably identified in the anatomical sections and their corresponding MR images. Contrast-enhanced CT images depicted all osseous borders; MR images were superior for soft tissue structures. Conclusions This study enhances the understanding of normal cervical spine anatomy and the diagnostic usefulness of cervical MRI and contrast-enhanced CT in the horse.

AB  - Introduction The mechanics of circular locomotion are relevant to equine training and lameness evaluation. Circular trotting is associated with asymmetries in upper body movement. This study investigated whether changes in foot placement explain upper body asymmetry and whether this asymmetry is dependent on centripetal force. Methods Six functionally sound horses walked and trotted on a 6?m diameter circle and straight line at their preferred speed. Optical motion capture (Motion Analysis Corp.) recorded foot position in 3D space. For each limb, horizontal foot placement was calculated in a body-based reference system. Vertical displacement asymmetry (Vector Sum, VS) was calculated from inertial sensors (Xsens, The Netherlands) attached above poll, withers, sacrum and tubera coxae. Variables were compared across movement directions and gaits using repeated measures ANOVA (parametric datasets) or Friedman Test (non-parametric datasets). Results Changes in foot placement relative to body position and orientation were small for both gaits in cranio-caudal and medio-lateral direction (maximum effect size at walk/trot: 66/102?mm). The amount of systematic movement asymmetry on the circle was comparable between walk (mean VS head/sacrum: 36/15?mm) and trot (30/15?mm, respectively), despite a 3-fold higher centripetal force during trot. Conclusions Foot placement relative to body position and line of travel does not differ markedly between straight line and circle and cannot solely account for the observed upper body movement asymmetry. Since movement asymmetry was comparable at walk and trot (despite differences in adopted movement pattern), centripetal force may not be the primary variable responsible for movement asymmetry on the circle.

AB  - Introduction Swimming can be used for conditioning and rehabilitation of horses. Its main advantage is minimal musculoskeletal stress. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of swimming on athletic performance of Mangalarga Marchador horses. Methods Eight horses (6.7?±?2.9 years old, 426?±?32?kg) conditioned to swim training were evaluated twice, before (M1) and after (M2) four weeks of training consisting of 60 minutes of hand-walking twice a week, alternating with marcha exercise with a rider for 40 minutes three days a week, and 20 minutes of marcha with a rider each day of the weekend. Four animals were randomly selected after M1 as a test group and were submitted to swim training for 15 minutes twice a week in a lake. During M1 and M2, heart rate, hematocrit, AST, CK and lactate were recorded before (T0) and after 5 (T1), 30 (T2) and 120 (T3) minutes of exercise (marcha gait for 40 minutes). Variables were analyzed for normality with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Comparisons between M1 and M2 and between control and test groups on each moment were made using paired t-test (P<0.05). Results No differences were observed for HR, hematocrit, lactate and AST. Serum CK was significantly different for the test group between M1 and M2 for T1 (P?=?0.0175), T2 (P?=?0.0498) and T3 (P?=?0.0226) with higher values for M2; also significant differences were observed between control and test groups for M1 at T1 (P?=?0.0385), T2 (P?=?0.0029) and T3 (P?=?0.0180) with higher values for control group. Conclusions The swimming training protocol used did not improve the athletic performance of selected horses.

AB  - Introduction Evaluation of the movement during trot in circles is commonly used in clinical equine lameness examinations to exacerbate mild or bilateral lameness. Sound horses trotting in a straight line have a high degree of movement symmetry, which decreases with lameness. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lungeing and circle size on movement symmetry in sound horses. Methods Twenty five riding horses categorized sound by inspection on straight line and lungeing were trotted in a straight line and in circles of 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 metres diameter on both reins. Overall symmetry (S), symmetry of diagonal limb pair loading (A), and symmetry of diagonal limb pair timing (W) were calculated from trunk accelerations measured over the 13th thoracic vertebrae (T13) with a 3-axis accelerometer. Data were analysed via ANOVA with horse as random effect. Results S, A, and W showed high degree of symmetry of straight line trot with mean?±?SE?= ?6.0?±?0.1, 0.01?±?0.02 and ?0.001?±?0.003, respectively, that decreased with circular trot (P<0.02 in pairwise tests). S and A showed decreasing symmetry with decreasing circle size. For 16 and 8 metres, respectively; S?= ?5.2?±?0.1 and ?4.7?±?0.1; A?= 0.10?±?0.01 and 0.16?±?0.01; W?= ?0.009?±?0.002 and ?0.012?±?0.002. Conclusions In sound horses, movement symmetry measured over T13 decreased with circular trot and decreasing circle size as shown in earlier studies of movement of the poll and sacrum. The asymmetry mimicked inside diagonal lameness. Effect of circular movement and circle size should be considered in interpretation of lameness signs and asymmetry measured during circular trot. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the department ethical committee. The horses belonged to the Danish army, who gave their informed consent. As no invasive procedures were applied approval from the Danish Animal Experimental board was not needed. Sources of funding:?Foreningen KUSTOS af 1861. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Introduction Adaptations to training include the accumulation of specific proteins. The ideal stimulus that alters gene transcriptive response that initiates changes in protein concentration is important for adaptations. Methods Fifty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 9 experimental groups, with six rats in each group. The groups consisted of: control (group 1); one day of training (2); continuous training groups who trained for a further two to four days followed by three days recovery (3,4,5,6); alternate-day training consisting of a further two to four sessions (7,8,9) finishing on the 7th day. On each training day, the animals ran on a motor driven treadmill at a slope of 10° and a speed of 19.3?m/min (?76%VO2max) for 90 minutes. Gastrocnemius muscle specimens were obtained from the respective groups 1 hour after training ceased. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the changes (in fold) in mRNA of PGC1α, COXIV, CaMKIV, NRF1, AMPKα1 and α2, and mtTFA. One-way ANOVA was used in comparisons of the mean values between groups. Results The results showed that mRNA expression was significantly different between the training groups for AMPkα1 after the 3rd training session, PGC1α after the 4th training session, with CaMKIV significantly different following three days of recovery. COXIV and mtTFA were not significantly different at any point. Conclusions Training design has differing effects on expression of the selected genes. This data has provided insight into the importance of training design and recovery intervals which warrants a need for further research.

AB  - Introduction In people with neck pain, ultrasonography (US) can measure atrophy and response to physiotherapy in peri-vertebral muscles of the cervical spine, i.e. m. multifidus and m. longus colli. This study compared the reproducibility of muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements made by US and MRI (the gold standard) at different levels in the equine cervical spine. Methods From US and MRI images of three mature pony cadavers, CSA was calculated at vertebral levels C3-C6 (m. multifidus) and C2-C5 (m. longus colli). ANOVA analysis compared US and MRI image acquisition reliability (n?=?360) and CSA (n?=?1080) among subjects and vertebral levels. Results For image acquisition of m. multifidus (C3-C5), the ICC (95% CI) for MRI and US was 99% and 61%, respectively. Image acquisition was unreliable at C6. CSA calculation did not differ between MRI and US. For m. longus colli (C3-C5), the ICC for image acquisition was 100% and 88% for MRI and US, respectively. Image acquisition was unreliable at C2. The ICC for CSA calculation was 98% for MRI and 100% for US. For both muscles, the mean CSA was largest at C4 and C5. Conclusions Based on these results, ultrasonography could be used in the live horse for reliable CSA measurement of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the mid-cervical spine. This technique may advance knowledge of causes and effects of neck pain in horses.

AB  - Introduction The Icelandic horse is popular and can be found in more than 30 countries. The breed is used for a variety of competitions but mounted pace competitions have the longest history. Despite this, pace training strategies have not been well documented. The aim of this study was to describe training strategies used by experienced trainers of Icelandic pace horses. Methods The study is based on the response to a questionnaire answered by nine trainers (age 42?±?13 years and 23?±?12 years of experience as pace trainers). The trainers selected were living in Iceland or Sweden, were on the world ranking list in 250?m pace races (FEIF, August 2013) and had a minimum of 12 years of experience in pace training. The questionnaire was sent to the trainers by e-mail and answers were obtained in text or during a phone interview. The questionnaire included open questions about training strategies, the development of the horse and physical health problems. Data is presented as mean?±?SD. Results Training commenced at an age of 5.4?±?1.0 years. Horses were trained five times per week (4.8?±?0.7) and pace training was performed less than twice per week (1.6?±?0.9). The average time to achieve competitive condition was 1.9?±?0.8 years. Horses were considered to be at their best at 13.8?±?4.6 years of age. Wounds after cross-firing (n?=?3) and reactions within the suspensory ligament (n?=?2) were the most common health problems mentioned. Conclusions In Icelandic pace horses, training appears to commence at mature age and although they are trained most week days, training in pace is limited.

AB  - Introduction Endurance horses must attain heart rates below a certain limit (usually 64 beats/min) to pass veterinary inspections in endurance rides. The time necessary for heart rate recovery is therefore important in this equestrian discipline. The objective was to determine heart rate (HR) and heart rate recovery time (HRtime) of endurance horses exercised at various velocities. Methods Twelve Arabian endurance horses completed an incremental field exercise test with concurrent ECG-recording. Horses were actively competing at distances of 80?160?km. The exercise protocol defined five intervals with intended velocity range of 11?13?km/h, 15?17?km/h, 18?20?km/h, 21?25?km/h, and >25?km/h, respectively. Each interval was terminated by a halt lasting until HR declined to 64 beats/min. Velocity was determined by a global positioning system, while HR and HRtime were calculated from the ECG. Descriptive statistics was performed. Results Velocity, HR and HRtime (as mean?±?SD); Interval 1: 12.4?±?0.9?km/h, 104?±?11 beats/min, 50?±?34?s; Interval 2: 15.9?±?0.5?km/h, 120?±?9 beats/min, 128?±?81?s; Interval 3: 20.0?±?0.6?km/h, 133?±?10 beats/min, 202?±?120?s; Interval 4: 22.9?±?1.0?km/h, 140?±?11 beats/min, 264?±?170?s; and Interval 5: 29.3?±?3.8?km/h, 171?±?15 beats/min, 341?±?187?s. HR showed linear correlation with velocity. HRtime varied between horses especially after greater velocities, with a tendency of being shortest in the best performing horses. Four outliers of HRtime were excluded from horses reluctant to stand still during the halt due to anticipatory excitement. Conclusions Heart rate recovery time shows great individuality and could potentially be used as a performance indicator in endurance horses. Possible fluctuations of HR due to anticipatory excitement during the halt may prolong HRtime and must be accounted for.

AB  - Introduction The effects of different amounts of training on performance of young horses have not yet been studied in a long term perspective. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effect on VLa4 of two training programs performed from the age of 2 to 3 in Standardbred horses. Methods Fourteen horses were in March as 2-year olds divided into two groups; one was randomized to a training program including intensive exercise (control) and the other to a training program with reduced amount of intensive exercise (distance ?30% compared to control). Group division was partly based on breeding index (means: control 110, reduced 109) and gluteus medius fiber type ratio (IIA/IIB, both groups mean 1.34). Horses were trained ?2 times/week. After 14 months, a VLa4-test was performed on a track (4?x?1000?m). Speed was measured by GPS and increased by ?3?s/1000?m for every interval. Blood samples were collected after each interval and lactate concentration was determined using Lactate Pro. Exponential regression analysis of speed and lactate concentration were used to estimate individual VLa4. ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyse differences between groups. Results There was no difference in VLa4 between the control and reduced exercise group (10.6?±?0.1 and 10.8?±?0.1?m/s). Conclusions The study indicates that it might be possible to reduce the amount of intensive training by ≤30% without impairing performance of 3 year old Standardbred horses.

AB  - Introduction The objective was to quantify warm-up (WU) jumping patterns/duration in showjumping horses. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three day training session. Riders received coaching during WU and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1 and twice on day-2; on day-3 the second round was an 8 fence jump-off. Fence type/height, number of jumping efforts (JE) and lead take-off/landing limbs during WU were recorded. Rider global-positioning-system recorded speed. Inertial motion sensors fixed to the lateral aspect of metatarsal/metacarpal bones, recorded time spent in each pace/rein plus stride length (SL) during WU and course. Paired Students T-tests were used to compare variables between days, as well as WU and course. Results Mean WU duration, time in each pace and on each rein did not differ within rider between days, however there were inter-rider differences (mean WU duration?=?18?mins; range?=?12?27?mins). Number of JE and fence type/height did not differ between days. During WU, there was marked canter lead, jump landing and leaving lead limb asymmetry (left canter lead predominating in all cases). There was no preference in canter lead when approaching WU fences. Horses cantered slower and with a shorter SL during WU compared to when jumping the course (speed-WU:4.21?±?0.09?m/sec; course:5.53?±?0.15?m/sec; SL- WU:2.59?±?0.06?m; course:3.16?±?0.08?m). Conclusions Results provide preliminary information on WU duration, and suggest that showjumping horses may WU asymmetrically, predominately on the left rein, at competitions and during training. This could have implications for injury risk to a particular forelimb or hindlimb in showjumping horses.

AB  - Introduction In humans, oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) are commonly used to assess energy expenditure (EE) during exercise in field conditions. We hypothesized that the estimation of EE from HR measurements could be a relevant parameter to estimate EE during submaximal field exercise. This study aimed to compare the EE from VO2 and HR measurements in exercising trotters. Methods Six harnessed French Trotters were submitted to a continuous field incremental test (FIT) at trot to establish their individual VO2/HR relationship. Then they undertook a submaximal exercise bout (EX) over 2375?m during 3.41?±?0.47?min at 70% of maximal velocity. VO2 and HR were recorded continuously (equine K4b2, COSMED, Rome, Italy) throughout FIT and EX. EE of EX was calculated by multiplying the total VO2 (Liters), either directly measured or predicted from HR, with its caloric equivalent (4.86?kcal/liter). Means were compared using a Student's t test. Results EE of EX was estimated at 2422?±?390?kcal and 2630?±?706?kcal from direct VO2 and HR methods respectively (P?=?0.54). Conclusions We found no significant difference between the two methods for estimating EE of submaximal exercise. This suggests that the prediction of EE from HR monitoring might be used to evaluate EE of moderate intensity workouts.
