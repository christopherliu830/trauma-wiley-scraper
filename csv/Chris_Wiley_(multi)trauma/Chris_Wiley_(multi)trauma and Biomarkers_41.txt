AB  - Introduction Horses have a large intestinal reserve of water and electrolytes that can be absorbed to replace sweat fluid losses during endurance exercise. As a consequence, the abdomen develops a ?tucked-up? appearance; however, data documenting changes in abdominal circumference during endurance exercise are lacking. Methods Abdominal circumference was measured directly (in triplicate with a measurement tape to nearest cm) every 15-km at three sites (front, middle, and back) in six 2-year-old Arabian horses that completed four 60-km bouts of treadmill exercise. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA and compared to body weight (BW) loss by correlation analysis. Results Abdominal circumference decreased at all three sites during the exercise test (1.8?±?0.7, 1.4?±?0.7, and 3.1?±?1.3?cm for front, middle, and back, respectively, [representing 1?2% of total circumference]) with the greatest decrease (>50% of total) occurring during the initial 15-km of the exercise test. Changes in abdominal circumference during each step of the exercise test were significantly correlated with BW changes (R values 0.18?0.39, P<0.05 for all). Conclusions These data support the clinical observation that the abdomen decreases in size during endurance exercise and that the largest changes are observed in the earlier stages of exercise, similar to the initial greater decrease in BW that has been documented in several studies during the initial half of endurance competitions.

AB  - Introduction Horses performance can be enhanced via growth hormone (GH) doping. The detection time for GH in blood is too short to allow detection during competition. GH not only affects the proteosynthesis in cells and tissues but can also cause long term metabolic variations. This study aimed to show the metabolomic modifications occurring after three months of GH treatment. Methods The study was performed on 20 Welsh ponies. 10 were injected with REPORCIN TM, an approved recombinant GH (30?mg.kg?1 per day) for 3 months and the other 10 comprised the control group. Blood samples were collected before GH treatment (T0), then 3 months later (T3). The NMR spectra acquired on the 40 serum samples were classified according to the factors (season, GH treatment) using the supervised multivariate orthogonal projection on latent structure (OPLS) method. A first OPLS model was computed with the control ponies (T0-T3). The predictive component of this model was subtracted from the whole data (treated, controls at T0 and T3) to only retain the GH-dependent variations. Results Before filtering seasonal effects, glucose, lipids and phospholipids were metabolites discriminating between T0 and T3 samples. After removing the seasonal effect, the OPLS model revealed the effect of GH treatment on protein metabolism through the modification of aromatic amino acids and branched chain amino acids. The variations of other metabolites (glycoproteins and lactate) were enhanced. Conclusions This study showed that chronic GH injection induced systemic metabolism modifications that can be detected using the NMR metabolomic method without neglecting the misleading effect of season.

AB  - Introduction There are no refereed blinded controlled documentations of the skeletal analgesic efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone. The objective was to test the hypothesis that intravenous dexamethasone is more efficacious in alleviating lameness than placebo in a reversible adjustable heart bar shoe model of equine foot pain. Methods Eight healthy horses (7 Thoroughbreds, 1 Warmblood, aged 6.5?±?3.3 years, age range 2?11 years) underwent weekly intravenous treatments 1 hour after lameness induction. Treatments were isotonic saline placebo at 1?ml/45?kg bwt, or dexamethasone (2?mg/ml in polyethylene glycol) at 0.045?mg/kg bwt, a typical dose used twice daily in the USA for anti-inflammatory effect. Treatments were randomly assigned and administered by a co-investigator who had no input on Heart Rate (HR) and Lameness Score (LS) measurements. Another investigator unaware of treatment assignments monitored HR and LS every 20?min for 5 hours after lameness induction and then hourly through 12 hours post-treatment. One week later treatment assignments were reversed and the experiment was repeated. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test were used to identify significant effects at P<0.05. Results After treatment, mean HR and LS were not different between treatments (P>0.05). HR and LS remained elevated over pre-lameness values throughout the 13-hour post-lameness monitoring period (P<0.05). Conclusions It was concluded that intravenous dexamethasone was no more effective than saline placebo. Neither treatment was effective at alleviating lameness over a 12-hour post-treatment period in this model. Dexamethasone at 0.045?mg/kg bwt should not affect acute foot lameness during equine exercise or performance.

AB  - Introduction Gastric ulcers are commonly found in equine athletes and there is evidence suggesting phenylbutazone may increase the incidence. In human athletes, gastric permeability has been shown to increase with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use with potential to negatively affect performance and recovery. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phenylbutazone on gastric mucosa and permeability. Methods 18 Arabian horses were examined via gastroscopy on day 0, 42, 49, 56, and 63, with ulceration in both the squamous and glandular regions scored from 0 to 4. For seven days commencing after the day 42 evaluation, horses received 4.4?mg/kg BW phenylbutazone twice daily PO. On day 49, sucrose (1?g/kg bwt) was administered via nasogastric tube, with blood and urine samples collected for 90?min and 4?h, respectively, to assess gastric permeability. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 with Proc MIXED. Results Ulcer scores increased from day 42 to day 49 (P<0.0001) with prevalence of grade 2 or greater ulceration being 33% on day 42 compared with 94% on day 49. Scores decreased from day 49 to 56 and, though continuing to decrease, had not returned to baseline scores by day 63. Squamous scores increased from day 0 to day 49 and remained elevated through day 63, while glandular scores were highest on day 49 but had decreased by day 56 (P<0.05). Sucrose concentration increased (P<0.0001) in both plasma and urine after phenylbutazone administration. Conclusions Besides exacerbating gastric ulcers, phenylbutazone contributes to gastric permeability and, particularly when combined with strenuous exercise, may impair recovery and increase illness susceptibility.

AB  - Introduction In endurance racing, horses are required to complete distances of up to 160?km in a single day. To date, the energy expenditure (EE) of such effort has not been quantified. This study aimed to evaluate EE during a 160?km endurance race from heart rate (HR) monitoring. Methods Three weeks before competing, two endurance horses (H1 and H2) were submitted to a field exercise test to determine their individual VO2-HR relationship. VO2 and HR were recorded simultaneously at trot (13?14?km/h for 10?min), and at canter (18?19?km/h for 10?min, and 22?23?km/h for 5?min), using the equine K4b2, a portable metabolic measurement system. H1 was then enrolled in Monpazier CEI and H2 in Florac CEI. HR was monitored from 2 minutes before the start to the finishing line of each loop. EE of exercise was calculated from individual VO2-HR relationship and caloric equivalent of oxygen. Results H1 and H2 completed the race at an average speed of 17.02 and 14.46?km/h, respectively. Mean HR was 108?±?8 and 124?±?24 and peak HR was 169 and 204 for H1 and H2, respectively. The proportion of time spent at HR≥180 was 0 and 2.7% for H1 and H2 respectively. EE of exercise was evaluated at 177 and 240?MJ for H1 and H2 respectively. Conclusions A 160-km endurance race might present a considerable energy cost, at least 5 times the EE of non-working state.

AB  - Introduction High concentrate diets increase the risk of several health problems and high energy forage diets could therefore be an alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the number of horses and the number of races performed at the age of three by a group of 16 Standardbred horses fed a forage only-diet from the age of 1.5 years (F) with the results of their siblings (S). Methods To F-horses, a forage diet was offered ad libitum (10.2?11.7?MJ metabolisable energy, 10?16% crude protein/kg dry matter) and supplemented daily with minerals and vitamins to meet requirements. F-horses were trained by pupils at the National Trotting School during supervision of professional trainers. For each individual in the F-group, the mean racing results from a maximum of five older siblings (same mother) were used for the S-group (5 siblings, n?=?9; 4-3 siblings, n?=?4 and 1?2 siblings, n?=?3). The siblings selected were born closest in time in relation to the F individual. S-horses were trained by different trainers and it was assumed that they had been fed a conventional high concentrate diet. Racing results were obtained from the Swedish Trotting Association. ANOVA and a Tukey test were used to analyse differences between groups. Results There was no difference in the number of horses that competed (F: 56% vs S: 54%, SE 10) and in the number of races performed (F: 1.6 vs S: 2.9, SE 0.5). Conclusions The study indicates that a forage-only diet may not be a limitation to achieve conventional training results and could therefore be an alternative to conventional diets.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Abstract The US healthcare system is plagued by unsustainable costs and yields suboptimal outcomes, indicating that new models of healthcare delivery are needed. The patient-centered medical home is one model that is increasingly regarded as a promising strategy for improving healthcare quality, decreasing cost, and enhancing the experience of both patients and providers. Conceptually, the patient-centered medical home may be described as combination of the core attributes of primary care?access, continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination of care?with new approaches to healthcare delivery, including office practice innovations and reimbursement reform. Implementation efforts are gaining momentum across the country, fueled by both private-payer initiatives as well as supportive public policy. High-quality evidence on the effectiveness of the patient-centered medical home is limited, but the data suggest that, under some circumstances, patient-centered medical home interventions may lead to improved outcomes and generate moderate cost savings. Although the patient-centered medical home enjoys broad support by multiple stakeholders, significant challenges to widespread adoption of the model remain.

AB  - Abstract Epithelial ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic cancers and the fifth most frequent cause of female cancer deaths in the United States. Despite dramatic treatment successes in other cancers through the use of molecular agents targeted against genetically defined events driving cancer development and progression, very few insights into epithelial ovarian cancer have been translated from the laboratory to the clinic. If advances are to be made in the early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of this disease, it will be critical to characterize the common and private (personalized) genetic defects underlying the development and spread of epithelial ovarian cancer. The tumor suppressor Kruppel-like factor 6 and its alternatively spliced, oncogenic isoform, Kruppel-like factor 6 splice variant 1, are members of the Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor family of proteins, which have diverse roles in cellular differentiation, development, proliferation, growth-related signal transduction, and apoptosis. Inactivation of Kruppel-like factor 6 and overexpression of Kruppel-like factor 6 splice variant 1 have been associated with the progression of a number of human cancers and even with patient survival. This article summarizes our recent findings demonstrating that a majority of epithelial ovarian cancer tumors have Kruppel-like factor 6 allelic loss and decreased expression coupled with increased expression of Kruppel-like factor 6 splice variant 1. The targeted reduction of Kruppel-like factor 6 in ovarian cancer cell lines results in marked increases in cell proliferation, invasion, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and intraperitoneal dissemination in vivo. In contrast, the inhibition of Kruppel-like factor 6 splice variant 1 decreases cellular proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumorigenicity; this provides the rationale for its potential therapeutic application. These results and our recent demonstration that the inhibition of Kruppel-like factor 6 splice variant 1 can dramatically prolong survival in a preclinical mouse model of ovarian cancer are reviewed and discussed.

AB  - The integrity of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) is critical to normal brain function. Traditional techniques for the assessment of BBB disruption rely heavily on the spatiotemporal analysis of extravasating contrast agents. However, such methods based on the leakage of relatively large molecules are not suitable for the detection of subtle BBB impairment or for the performance of repeated measurements in a short time frame. Quantification of the water exchange rate constant (WER) across the BBB using strictly intravascular contrast agents could provide a much more sensitive method for the quantification of the BBB integrity. To estimate WER, we have recently devised a powerful new method using a water exchange index (WEI) biomarker and demonstrated BBB disruption in an acute stroke model. Here, we confirm that WEI is sensitive to even very subtle changes in the integrity of the BBB caused by: (i) systemic hypercapnia and (ii) low doses of a hyperosmolar solution. In addition, we have examined the sensitivity and accuracy of WEI as a biomarker of WER using computer simulation. In particular, the dependence of the WEI?WER relation on changes in vascular blood volume, T1 relaxation of cellular magnetization and transcytolemmal water exchange was explored. Simulated WEI was found to vary linearly with WER for typically encountered exchange rate constants (1?4?Hz), regardless of the blood volume. However, for very high WER (>5?Hz), WEI became progressively more insensitive to increasing WER. The incorporation of transcytolemmal water exchange, using a three-compartment tissue model, helped to extend the linear WEI regime to slightly higher WER, but had no significant effect for most physiologically important WERs (WER?<?4?Hz). Variation in cellular T1 had no effect on WEI. Using both theoretical and experimental approaches, our study validates the utility of the WEI biomarker for the monitoring of BBB integrity.

AB  - Summary In the first edition of this journal, Barbara Weaver wrote a review titled ?Equine Anaesthesia?, stating that, at that time, it was quickly becoming accepted practice that many horses were being anaesthetised ?by essentially similar procedures, i.e. premedication, induction and then maintenance by controlled inhalation?. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first edition of this journal, this review covers the development of understanding and practice of inhalational anaesthesia and controlled ventilation in horses over the last 50 years. We review how the perceived benefits of halothane led to its widespread use, but subsequently better understanding of halothane's effects led to changes in equine anaesthetic practice and the utilisation of different inhalation agents (e.g. isoflurane and sevoflurane). We discuss how more recently, better understanding of the effects of the ?newer? inhalation agents? effects has led to yet more changes in equine anaesthetic practice, and while, further new inhalation agents are unlikely to appear in the near future, further enhancements to anaesthetic practice may still lead to improved outcomes. We review advances in our understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the equine lung as well of the effects of anaesthesia on lung function and how these predispose to some of the common problems of gas exchange and ventilation during anaesthesia. We identify the aims of optimal mechanical ventilation for anaesthetic management and whether the various methods of ventilatory support during equine anaesthesia achieve them. We also highlight that further developments in equipment and optimal ventilator modes are likely in the near future.

AB  - Abstract.? Cancer is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease involving a succession of genetic changes (frequently caused or accompanied by exogenous trauma), and resulting in a molecular phenotype that in turn results in a malignant specification. The development of malignancy has been described as a multistep process involving self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and finally tissue invasion and metastasis. The quantitative analysis of networking molecules within the cells might be applied to understand native-state tissue signalling biology, complex drug actions and dysfunctional signalling in transformed cells, that is, in cancer cells. High-content and high-throughput single-cell analysis can lead to systems biology and cytomics. The application of cytomics in cancer research and diagnostics is very broad, ranging from the better understanding of the tumour cell biology to the identification of residual tumour cells after treatment, to drug discovery. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint in detail these processes on the molecular, cellular and tissue level. A comprehensive knowledge of these will require tissue analysis, which is multiplex and functional; thus, vast amounts of data are being collected from current genomic and proteomic platforms for integration and interpretation as well as for new varieties of updated cytomics technology. This overview will briefly highlight the most important aspects of this continuously developing field.

AB  - In South Africa, careless implementation of child psychiatry's biomedical model of ?mental disorder? could stigmatise children and youth who have been made vulnerable by the lingering effects of apartheid ? poverty and malnutrition, violence and abuse, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. A focus on DSM-5 category changes ? regarding post-traumatic stress disorder and ADHD ? demonstrates that these psychiatric labels are impracticable and irrelevant in a post-colonial developing country, where mental health care is delivered in the context of scarce services and unequal access. A social constructivist perspective enables us to broaden policy decisions and suggest directions for research.

AB  - The recent clinical availability of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) opens the door for potential therapeutic repurposing for non-oncological indications. Considering (a) the preclinical efficacy data with PARP inhibitors in non-oncological diseases and (b) the risk?benefit ratio of treating patients with a compound that inhibits an enzyme that has physiological roles in the regulation of DNA repair, we have selected indications, where (a) the severity of the disease is high, (b) the available therapeutic options are limited, and (c) the duration of PARP inhibitor administration could be short, to provide first-line options for therapeutic repurposing. These indications are as follows: acute ischaemic stroke; traumatic brain injury; septic shock; acute pancreatitis; and severe asthma and severe acute lung injury. In addition, chronic, devastating diseases, where alternative therapeutic options cannot halt disease development (e.g. Parkinson's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis or severe fibrotic diseases), should also be considered. We present a preclinical and clinical action plan for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors.

AB  - Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a genetically mutated huntingtin (mHtt) protein with expanded polyQ stretch, which impairs cytosolic sequestration of the repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), resulting in excessive nuclear REST and subsequent repression of neuronal genes. We recently demonstrated that REST undergoes extensive, context-dependent alternative splicing, of which exon-3 skipping (?E3)?a common event in human and nonhuman primates?causes loss of a motif critical for REST nuclear targeting. This study aimed to determine whether ?E3 can be targeted to reduce nuclear REST and rescue neuronal gene expression in mouse striatal-derived, mHtt-expressing STHdhQ111/Q111 cells?a well-established cellular model of HD. We designed two morpholino antisense oligos (ASOs) targeting the splice sites of Rest E3 and examined their effects on ?E3, nuclear Rest accumulation and Rest-controlled gene expression in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells. We found that (1) the ASOs treatment significantly induced ?E3, reduced nuclear Rest, and rescued transcription and/or mis-splicing of specific neuronal genes (e.g. Syn1 and Stmn2) in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells; and (2) the ASOs-induced transcriptional regulation was dependent on ?E3 induction and mimicked by siRNA-mediated knock-down of Rest expression. Our findings demonstrate modulation of nuclear REST by ?E3 and its potential as a new therapeutic target for HD and provide new insights into environmental regulation of genome function and pathogenesis of HD. As ?E3 is modulated by cellular signalling and linked to various types of cancer, we anticipate that ?E3 contributes to environmentally tuned REST function and may have a broad range of clinical implications.

AB  - Summary Preoperative glucocorticoid administration reduces the systemic inflammatory response. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a novel inflammatory marker belonging to the humoral arm of innate immunity exerting a potentially protective host response. This study evaluated PTX3 and other complement marker changes after preoperative methylprednisolone (MP) early after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Seventy patients were randomized (1 : 1) to preoperative intravenous (i.v.) MP 125 mg (group MP) or isotonic saline i.v. (group C). The outcomes included change in plasma PTX3, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins (ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3), complement components (C4 and C3), terminal complement complex (TCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Blood samples were analysed at baseline and 2, 6, 24 and 48 h after surgery with complete sampling from 63 patients for analyses. MP resulted in an increase in circulating PTX3 compared to saline from baseline to 24 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001), while MP reduced the systemic inflammatory response (CRP) 24 and 48 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001). However, the small postoperative changes in MBL, ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3, C4, C3 and TCC concentrations did not differ between groups (P?>?0·05). In conclusion, preoperative MP 125 mg increased circulating PTX3 and reduced the general inflammatory response (CRP) early after TKA, but did not affect other complement markers.
