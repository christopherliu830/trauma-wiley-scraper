AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Cartilage is one of the most essential tissues for healthy joint function and is compromised in degenerative and traumatic joint diseases. There have been tremendous advances during the past decade using quantitative MRI techniques as a noninvasive tool for evaluating cartilage, with a focus on assessing cartilage degeneration during osteoarthritis (OA). In this review, after a brief overview of cartilage composition and degeneration, we discuss techniques that grade and quantify morphologic changes as well as the techniques that quantify changes in the extracellular matrix. The basic principles, in vivo applications, advantages, and challenges for each technique are discussed. Recent studies using the OA Initiative (OAI) data are also summarized. Quantitative MRI provides noninvasive measures of cartilage degeneration at the earliest stages of joint degeneration, which is essential for efforts toward prevention and early intervention in OA.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? Major classification systems for alcohol use disorders (DSM-IV and ICD-10) contain elements of the 1976 Edwards and Gross formulation of the Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (ADS). However, issues remain about the criteria that identify Alcohol Dependence (AD) as distinct from Alcohol Abuse (AA) in DSM-IV and Harmful Use in ICD-10. These issues, in part, have their roots in changing historical perceptions of alcohol use and its problems. We discuss current diagnostic criteria for AA and AD, collectively called Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs), in the context of their historical evolution; research progress in understanding alcohol problems, including alcohol dependence; new findings on the severity of AUDs as classified by DSM-IV; and the role of alcohol consumption patterns in future classifications of AUDs. Methods? This paper is based largely on the 2006 H. David Archibald Lecture. Parts of the original lecture have been modified to reflect more recent findings from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) of the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Results? The original Edwards and Gross ADS construct is supported by advances in biological and behavioral science over the past 30?years. New findings indicate that DSM-IV AA and AD are not diagnostically distinct entities, but represent a continuum of severity of AUDs. The ADS criteria may best represent one quantifiable dimension of alcohol use problems and this scale can be related to that of the frequency of harmful patterns of drinking. Conclusion? The Edwards and Gross ADS criteria can be used as the basis for beginning the development of scalable multi-dimensional criteria for diagnosing AUDs in new initiatives to revise DSM-IV and ICD-10.

AB  - Abstract Reconstruction of the bladder wall via in vitro differentiated stem cells on an appropriate scaffold could be used in such conditions as cancer and neurogenic urinary bladder. This study aimed to examine the potential of human endometrial stem cells (EnSCs) to form urinary bladder epithelial cells (urothelium) on nanofibrous silk?collagen scaffolds, for construction of the urinary bladder wall. After passage 4, EnSCs were induced by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and seeded on electrospun collagen-V, silk and silk?collagen nanofibres. Later we tested urothelium-specific genes and proteins (uroplakin-Ia, uroplakin-Ib, uroplakin-II, uroplakin-III and cytokeratin 20) by immunocytochemistry, RT?PCR and western blot analyses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histology were used to detect cell?matrix interactions. DMEM/F12 supplemented by KGF and EGF induced EnSCs to express urothelial cell-specific genes and proteins. Either collagen, silk or silk?collagen scaffolds promoted cell proliferation. The nanofibrous silk?collagen scaffolds provided a three-dimensional (3D) structure to maximize cell-matrix penetration and increase differentiation of the EnSCs. Human EnSCs seeded on 3D nanofibrous silk?collagen scaffolds and differentiated to urothelial cells provide a suitable source for potential use in bladder wall reconstruction in women.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating and often progressive condition leading to exercise intolerance and frequently the demise of the animal. Although uncommonly encountered in horses, the condition is intensely researched both in human medicine and animal models. Viral infections have long been suspected to play a part in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions in other species. In 2007, an association between equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5) infection and nodular pulmonary fibrosis in horses was suggested and the name equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) was introduced. Recently, the presence of EHV-5 in equine lymphoma has also emerged. The case report by Schwarz et?al. in this issue describes a horse suffering from concurrent T cell leukaemia and EMPF in association with EHV-5. This article summarises current knowledge about EMPF and EHV-5 infections in horses, recent developments in the understanding of pulmonary fibrosis in man and the proposed contribution of viral infections to pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions.

AB  - Myelin water imaging (MWI) is an MRI imaging biomarker for myelin. This method can generate an in vivo whole-brain myelin water fraction map in approximately 10?minutes. It has been applied in various applications including neurodegenerative disease, neurodevelopmental, and neuroplasticity studies. In this review we start with a brief introduction of myelin biology and discuss the contributions of myelin in conventional MRI contrasts. Then the MRI properties of myelin water and four different MWI methods, which are categorized as T2-, T2*-, T1-, and steady-state-based MWI, are summarized. After that, we cover more practical issues such as availability, interpretation, and validation of these methods. To illustrate the utility of MWI as a clinical research tool, MWI studies for two diseases, multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, are introduced. Additional topics about imaging myelin in gray matter and non-MWI methods for myelin imaging are also included. Although technical and physiological limitations exist, MWI is a potent surrogate biomarker of myelin that carries valuable and useful information of myelin.Evidence Level: 5Technical Efficacy: 1 Evidence Level: 5 Technical Efficacy: 1 J.

AB  - Mitral regurgitation (MR) related to chronic degenerative valvular disease is the most important cause of heart failure in dogs. Ultrasound examination of the heart can identify valve lesions, confirm the presence of valvular regurgitation, document cardiac remodeling, estimate intracardiac pressures, and quantify systolic ventricular function. These findings can influence prognosis or selection of medical therapy. Reductions in ventricular systolic function may be detected on serial echocardiographic examinations in some dogs with MR. However the changes in ventricular loading that accompany MR often complicate these measurements. For example, shortening and ejection fractions are often increased in severe MR, even in the setting of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography with Doppler is also used to assess ventricular diastolic function and filling pressures. This information helps predict the risk of congestive heart failure. However these findings are often rendered ambiguous by age-related impairment of ventricular relaxation, elevations in left atrial pressure due to MR, and effects of volume overload on myocardial tissue velocities. These factors limit the usefulness of ventricular filling and tissue velocities, as well as derived ratios such as the E/E' ratio, for predicting congestive heart failure in MR. More advanced Doppler and tissue echocardiographic methods, as well as prospective clinical studies, are needed to reduce the ambiguity involved with assessment of ventricular function and filling pressures in the setting of MR.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of stroke and dementia are diverging across the world, rising for those in low- and middle-income countries and falling in those in high-income countries. This suggests that whatever factors cause these trends are potentially modifiable. At the population level, neurological disorders as a group account for the largest proportion of disability-adjusted life years globally (10%). Among neurological disorders, stroke (42%) and dementia (10%) dominate. Stroke and dementia confer risks for each other and share some of the same, largely modifiable, risk and protective factors. In principle, 90% of strokes and 35% of dementias have been estimated to be preventable. Because a stroke doubles the chance of developing dementia and stroke is more common than dementia, more than a third of dementias could be prevented by preventing stroke. Developments at the pathological, pathophysiological, and clinical level also point to new directions. Growing understanding of brain pathophysiology has unveiled the reciprocal interaction of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration identifying new therapeutic targets to include protection of the endothelium, the blood-brain barrier, and other components of the neurovascular unit. In addition, targeting amyloid angiopathy aspects of inflammation and genetic manipulation hold new testable promise. In the meantime, accumulating evidence suggests that whole populations experiencing improved education, and lower vascular risk factor profiles (e.g., reduced prevalence of smoking) and vascular disease, including stroke, have better cognitive function and lower dementia rates. At the individual levels, trials have demonstrated that anticoagulation of atrial fibrillation can reduce the risk of dementia by 48% and that systolic blood pressure lower than 140 mmHg may be better for the brain. Based on these considerations, the World Stroke Organization has issued a proclamation, endorsed by all the major international organizations focused on global brain and cardiovascular health, calling for the joint prevention of stroke and dementia. This article summarizes the evidence for translation into action.

AB  - Objectives Over the past two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research regarding bipolar disorder (BD) among children and adolescents (ie, pediatric BD [PBD]). The primary purpose of this article is to distill the extant literature, dispel myths or exaggerated assertions in the field, and disseminate clinically relevant findings. Methods An international group of experts completed a selective review of the literature, emphasizing areas of consensus, identifying limitations and gaps in the literature, and highlighting future directions to mitigate these gaps. Results Substantial, and increasingly international, research has accumulated regarding the phenomenology, differential diagnosis, course, treatment, and neurobiology of PBD. Prior division around the role of irritability and of screening tools in diagnosis has largely abated. Gold-standard pharmacologic trials inform treatment of manic/mixed episodes, whereas fewer data address bipolar depression and maintenance/continuation treatment. Adjunctive psychosocial treatment provides a forum for psychoeducation and targets primarily depressive symptoms. Numerous neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies, and increasing peripheral biomarker studies, largely converge with prior findings from adults with BD. Conclusions As data have accumulated and controversy has dissipated, the field has moved past existential questions about PBD toward defining and pursuing pressing clinical and scientific priorities that remain. The overall body of evidence supports the position that perceptions about marked international (US vs elsewhere) and developmental (pediatric vs adult) differences have been overstated, although additional research on these topics is warranted. Traction toward improved outcomes will be supported by continued emphasis on pathophysiology and novel therapeutics.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage, synovitis, subchondral bone changes, and osteophyte formation. Currently there is no treatment for OA except temporary pain relief and end-stage joint replacement surgery. We performed a pilot study to determine the effect of kartogenin (KGN, a small molecule) on both cartilage and subchondral bone in a rat model of OA using multimodal imaging techniques. OA was induced in rats (OA and KGN treatment group) by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) surgery in the right knee joint. Sham surgery was performed on the right knee joint of control group rats. KGN group rats received weekly intra-articular injection of 125??M KGN 1 week after surgery until week 12. All rats underwent in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after surgery. Quantitative MR relaxation measures (T1? and T2) were determined to evaluate changes in articular cartilage. Cartilage and bone turnover markers (COMP and CTX-I) were determined at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 weeks. Animals were sacrificed at week 12 and the knee joints were removed for micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. KGN treatment significantly lowered the T1? and T2 relaxation times indicating decreased cartilage degradation. KGN treatment significantly decreased COMP and CTX-I levels indicating decreased cartilage and bone turnover rate. KGN treatment also prevented subchondral bone changes in the ACLT rat model of OA. Thus, kartogenin is a potential drug to prevent joint deterioration in post-traumatic OA. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 34:1780?1789, 2016.

AB  - Summary Early studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed key neurological features including the deposition of aggregates of insoluble ?-amyloid (A?) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and signs of chronic inflammation. The initial forms of these pathological hallmarks of the disease, including small oligomers of A? peptides and the hyperphosphorylated tau which aggregates into NFT, have been assumed to be part of ?the cause of AD? and have been specifically targeted to develop an effective monotherapy, but with limited success. In the absence of effective neuroprotective drugs, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have remained as the drug class that is most used to treat AD, yet they cannot and do not slow the progression of the disease. Imaging studies have confirmed what has long been suspected ? that there is a very long pre-clinical phase, when pathology gradually builds up, possibly starting with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated metabolism. Emerging therapies are targeted more towards these changes, sometimes as well as the A? and NFT pathologies in multi-targeted approaches, to interfere with the pathological cascades in AD. The aim is to prevent, stop, or at least slow the neurodegeneration before debilitating symptoms appear. This chapter summarises inflammatory and oxidative stress-related changes that occur in AD, and discusses some emerging therapies and supplements, particularly those directed at inflammation, that may slow pathogenesis of this complex neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Abstract Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy, but not to the level of being diagnostic for diabetes in a nonpregnant adult. In GDM, whole-body insulin-dependent glucose disposal decreases by 40%-60% which necessitates a 200%-250% increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycaemia. GDM develops when a pregnant woman does not produce sufficient insulin to compensate for the reduced glucose disposal. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that is expressed predominantly in the liver, but also in other metabolically active tissues such as pancreas, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In animals, FGF21 lowers blood glucose levels and inhibits glucagon secretion. In humans, circulating FGF21 levels are increased in insulin-resistant morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An elevated FGF21 level is also an independent predictor of T2DM. GDM and T2DM are proposed to have similar underlying pathophysiologies, raising the question of whether a similar relationship exists between FGF21 and GDM as it does with T2DM. There are a limited number of studies investigating FGF21 levels in patients with GDM. Moreover, recent clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of FGF21 have highlighted a major gap in our understanding of the biology of FGF21. This review evaluates what is currently known about FGF21 and GDM and highlights important gaps that warrant further research.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acetabular dysplasia is a common, multi-etiological, pre-osteoarthritic (OA) feature that can lead to pain and instability of the young adult hip. Despite the clinical significance of acetabular dysplasia, there is a paucity of small animal models to investigate structural and functional changes that mediate morphology of the dysplastic hip and drive the subsequent OA cascade. Utilizing a novel murine model developed in our laboratory, this study investigated the role of surgically induced unilateral instability of the postnatal hip on the initiation and progression of acetabular dysplasia and impingement up to 8-weeks post-injury. C57BL6 mice were used to develop titrated levels of hip instability (i.e., mild, moderate, and severe instabillity or femoral head resection) at weaning. Joint shape, acetabular coverage, histomorphology, and statistical shape modeling were used to assess quality of the hip following 8 weeks of destabilization. Acetabular coverage was reduced following severe, but not moderate, instability. Moderate instability induced lateralization of the femur without dislocation, whereas severe instability led to complete dislocation and pseudoacetabulae formation. Mild instability did not result in morphological changes to the hip. Removal of the femoral head led to reduced hip joint space volume. These data support the notion that hip instability, driven by mechanical loss-of-function of soft connective tissue, can induce morphometric changes in the growing mouse hip. This work developed a new mouse model to study hip health in the murine adolescent hip and is a useful tool for investigating the mechanical and structural adaptations to hip instability during growth. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objective Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable, with no preoperative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling. Methods Fifty-six children, comprising discovery (n = 38) and validation (n = 18) cohorts, were recruited from 3 separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates. Results Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibers, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (p <?0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 on 10-fold cross-validation. In the external validation cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3%, with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 75.0%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (p <?0.008). Interpretation This study provides the first multi-institutional, multimodal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure cost-effective allocation of health care resources.

AB  - Glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) play an important role in neuronal regulation and are of value as MRS-observable diagnostic biomarkers. In this study the relative concentrations of these metabolites have been measured in multiple regions in the normal brain using a short-TE whole-brain MRSI measurement at 3 T combined with a modified data analysis approach that used spatial averaging to obtain high-SNR spectra from atlas-registered anatomic regions or interest. By spectral fitting of high-SNR spectra this approach yielded reliable measurements across a wide volume of the brain. Spectral averaging also demonstrated increased SNR and improved fitting accuracy for the sum of Glu and Gln (Glx) compared with individual voxel fitting. Results in 26 healthy controls showed relatively constant Glu/Cr and Gln/Cr throughout the cerebrum, although with increased values in the anterior cingulum and paracentral lobule, and increased Gln/Cr in the superior motor area. The deep gray-matter regions of thalamus, putamen, and pallidum show lower Glu/Cr compared with cortical white-matter regions. Lobar measurements demonstrated reduced Glu/Cr and Gln/Cr in the cerebellum as compared with the cerebrum, where white-matter regions show significantly lower Glu/Cr and Gln/Cr as compared with gray-matter regions across multiple brain lobes. Regression analysis showed no significant effect of gender on Glu/Cr or Gln/Cr measurement; however, Glx/Cr ratio was found to be significantly negatively correlated with age in some lobar brain regions. In summary, this methodology provides the spectral quality necessary for reliable separation of Glu and Gln at 3 T from a single MRSI acquisition enabling generation of regional distributions of metabolites over a large volume of the brain, including cortical regions.

AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The soluble form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) was evaluated as an early prognostic marker of sepsis in patients with suspected infection. Design A single-centre prospective cohort study. Methods The cohort comprised 539 patients in the emergency department with suspected infection: 59 without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and without bacterial infection (group 1), 68 with bacterial infection and without SIRS (group 2), 54 with SIRS and without bacterial infection (group 3), 309 with sepsis (SIRS and bacterial infection) and without organ failure (group 4) and 49 with severe sepsis (SIRS, bacterial infection and organ failure) (group 5). suPAR was measured on admission using a commercial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The median soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) concentrations in groups 1?5 were 4.7, 5.0, 4.4, 4.8 and 7.9 ng mL?1, respectively (P < 0.001). The levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (8.3 vs. 4.9 ng mL?1, P < 0.001) and in patients with severe sepsis (group 5) compared with those in the other groups (7.9 vs. 4.8 ng mL?1, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCROC ) for the prediction of case fatality was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72?0.86, P < 0.0001) and 0.75 for severe sepsis (95% CI: 0.68?0.81, P < 0.0001). At a cut-off level of 6.4 ng mL?1, suPAR had 76% sensitivity and 69% specificity for fatal disease; at a cut-off level of 6.6 ng mL?1, the sensitivity and specificity for severe sepsis were 67% and 72%, respectively. In multivariate models, high suPAR remained an independent predictor of case fatality and severe sepsis after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions A high suPAR level predicts case fatality and severe sepsis in patients with suspected infection.

AB  - Abstract Background Fibrosis, a proliferative response of fibrocytes after tissue injury, is a common sequela of external radiotherapy and can vary greatly among patients even in the absence of DNA repair syndromes, due to their different intrinsic radiosensitivity. Fibrosis is also a serious cosmetic problem for patients, and in some cases it can also imply pain. Case Here, we report a case of a severe fibrosis 2 years after breast conserving surgery and postoperative 3D conformal breast irradiation. Furthermore, our patient had the suspicion of tumour recurrence. Our examinations were aimed at diagnosing recurrence or the lack of recurrence and investigating whether the symptoms occurred due to overdosing or extreme intrinsic radiosensitivity. Therefore, examining the patients' radiosensitivity, a cytogenetic test was performed, which revealed the patient's increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation, and therefore we rejected the prospect of overdosage. As a solution for the fibrosis, mastectomy was effectuated, and a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was used for reconstruction. Conclusions We suggest a multi-disciplinary approach to manage fibrosis and propose cytogenetic markers to be used as predictors to identify patients who most likely benefit from a certain therapeutic regimen in terms of reduction of therapy-related side effects.
