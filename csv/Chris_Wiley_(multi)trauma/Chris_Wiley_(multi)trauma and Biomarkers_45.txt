AB  - Reasons for performing study Thyroid hormones (THs) decrease with age in healthy dogs and cats, although they tend to remain within established reference ranges. Thyrotropin (TSH) is increased in elderly people, with or without mild alterations in THs. Objectives To test the hypothesis that geriatric horses will have lower THs and/or higher TSH compared with younger horses. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Resting THs and TSH, and responses to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were compared between young and old horses. Data from 71 normal, healthy horses that had participated in prior research projects were examined, and found to contain 42 horses 3?10 years of age, 16 horses >15 years and 10 horses >20 years. All samples had been assayed in the same previously validated radioimmunoassays. Statistical analysis was performed with commercial software. Results Although lower, THs were not significantly different between young and old horses when compared with the Mann?Whitney rank sum test. However, TSH concentration was significantly higher in horses aged >20 (median 0.52?ng/ml) or >15 years (0.44?ng/ml) compared to younger horses (0.33?ng/ml). TRH stimulation tests were performed in 19 of the younger horses, 7 of the horses >20, and 11 of the horses >15. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA on ranks revealed no significant differences in TH responses to TRH. The TSH response to TRH appeared to be slightly greater in the older horses, but did not quite reach significance (P?=?0.06). Conclusion Similar to reports in elderly humans, aged horses have higher serum TSH concentrations than younger horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Respiratory disease is a common cause of morbidity in geriatric horses, with a high prevalence of respiratory clinical signs; increasing with increasing horse age. However, owners frequently do not attribute these signs to disease and may not seek veterinary attention. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in the British geriatric equine population using a risk-screening questionnaire (RSQ) and identify factors associated with RAO. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Owners of geriatric horses/ponies enrolled in a previous cohort study were sent a postal questionnaire, combining a validated RSQ with questions regarding management, preventive healthcare, and respiratory-specific clinical signs. An RSQ score of >0.87 was the positive cut-off for RAO. Factors associated with RAO were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The useable response rate was 43.1%, providing data for 285 horses/ponies (median age 23.3 years). Coughing within the preceding year (27.0%) was the most prevalent owner-reported clinical sign. Among the study population, the apparent prevalence of RAO using the RSQ was 20.7%. 10.5% of horses/ponies were reported to have veterinary-diagnosed RAO (median age at diagnosis 13 years), of which 33.3% had a positive RSQ score. Data from 273 animals were included in the multivariable model, and factors associated with increased risk of RAO were ridden exercise ≥4 days/week (odds ratio [OR] 3.64; P?=?0.005) compared to no exercise; residing on a farm (OR 4.99; P?=?0.04) compared to residing on the owner's home premises and having had a respiratory infection within the past 12 months (OR 4.87; P<0.001). Conclusions Risk-screening questionnaire score-determined RAO prevalence was considerably higher than the proportion of animals previously diagnosed with RAO. This suggests under-diagnosis of respiratory problems in geriatric horses, much of which may be unrecognised or undiagnosed RAO. Risk factors identified differ from those previously reported for the general equine population. Ethical animal research:?This study was granted institutional ethical approval from the University of Liverpool and the Animal Health Trust. Return of a completed postal questionnaire was taken as informed owner consent.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Bronchopneumonia caused by Rhodococcus equi is an important disease of young horses throughout the world. Although early diagnosis and treatment improves the prognosis, this also increases the amount of antimicrobial usage and therefore increases the likelihood of resistance developing. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the level of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents of 97 virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates. Study design Analysis of archived samples. Methods Virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates were collected between 1991 and 2014 from clinically affected horses and from air samples collected in the breathing zone of foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed using a disc diffusion assay with a panel of agents. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and neomycin using a novel resazurin-based microtitre assay. Results Resistance to rifampicin was detected in 3 of the isolates (2 collected in 2013 and one in 2014) by both methods. The MIC for these isolates was 64??g/ml (n?=?2) and 16??g/ml (n?=?1). All isolates collected prior to 2013 had MICs<0.125??g/ml, which was the limit of detection in this assay. Although no isolates were resistant to tetracycline, there was a general increase in MIC in isolates collected in recent years. No isolates were resistant to either neomycin or erythromycin, with MIC values ranging between 0.25 and 2??g/ml for neomycin and 0.125?1??g/ml for erythromycin. Conclusions The success of the macrolide-rifampicin combination relies on the synergistic action of these 2 agents. Resistance to rifampicin will reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. It is of serious concern that the resistant isolates were all recently collected. Hopefully, recent research will lead to fewer asymptomatic foals receiving antimicrobials which will in turn reduce the likelihood of ongoing development of resistance.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early identification of surgical cases of colic is critical to improving outcome and welfare. There have been a number of studies on diagnostic tests for colic, evaluating a range of tests to differentiate between medical and surgical cases. Objectives To systematically review and appraise the evidence on diagnostic tests for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS quality assessment tool. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to equine colic; 976 related to diagnostic tests, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Of these, 16 papers reported on peritoneal fluid parameters, 21 on blood parameters, 10 on blood and peritoneal parameters, 3 on physical and blood parameters and one study on urine parameters. A range of different parameters were evaluated, with the majority of tests only being evaluated in single studies. None of the studies met QUADAS criteria 1 (representative spectrum of patients), 7/29 studies met criteria 2 (description of selection criteria) and 10/29 studies met criteria 9 (description of reference standard). Conclusions There are currently no published studies which use appropriate methodology to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test in differentiating medical and surgical colic. This made direct application of the QUADAS tool challenging; predominantly due to the lack of a pre mortem ?gold standard? reference diagnostic test for colic. Very few studies enrolled a randomised selection of patients and there was also a propensity to case?control study design, both increasing the risk of bias and under/overestimating diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Rasping of sharp enamel points (SEPs) is the most common procedure performed at routine dental examinations; however, there is little evidence to prove the true clinical significance of SEPs [1]. Maxillary SEPs are thought to cause buccal ulceration and pain on external palpation of the cheeks. Mandibular SEPs are thought to cause lingual ulceration. Objectives To examine associations between the presence of SEPs on the cheek teeth rows and the presence of pain on palpation of the cheeks and buccal and/or lingual ulceration. Study design Retrospective clinical case series. Methods Clinical records of routine dental examination performed by 8 veterinary surgeons in a single first opinion practice were examined. Presence of SEPs, buccal and/or lingual ulceration and pain on palpation of the cheeks (externally) were recorded. Chi squared tests were used to examine whether horses exhibiting pain on palpation or oral ulceration were significantly more likely to have SEPs present. Results Prevalence of buccal SEPs was 84.8% and prevalence of lingual SEPs was 84.3%. Five hundred and forty-eight horses (6.0%) had signs of pain on palpation. Prevalence of buccal ulceration was 5.9%. In contrast, only 0.2% of horses had visible lingual ulceration. Buccal ulceration and pain on palpation were significantly associated with presence of buccal SEPs (P<0.001 for both). Lingual ulceration was not significantly associated with lingual SEPs (P<0.0001). Conclusions Buccal SEPs are common and often result in pain and buccal ulceration. Routine rasping would appear to be justified. Lingual SEPs are common but rarely cause lingual ulceration. The value of routine rasping of lingual SEPs is therefore questionable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lameness negatively affects the welfare of horses; it often coexists with thoracolumbar pain. The mechanisms linking the two are not well understood. Objectives To document thoracolumbar movement in subjectively sound horses comparing straight lines with circles on left and right reins; to relate these observations to the objectively determined symmetry/asymmetry of hindlimb gait. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Fourteen non-lame horses were trotted in straight lines and lunged on a 10?m diameter circle on left and right reins and inertial sensor data collected at landmarks: withers, 13th (T13) and 18th thoracic vertebrae, 3rd lumbar vertebra, tubera sacrale, left and right tubera coxae. Data were processed using published methods [1]; pitch and roll, dorsoventral and lateral motion and symmetry within each stride were assessed. Results Dorsoventral motion during one stride had a sinusoidal pattern with 2 oscillations. The greatest amplitude and symmetry (119?±?4?mm, 96?±?1% in straight lines vs. 127?±?5?mm, 94?±?1% in circles) occurred at T13. Circles induced greater rotation around the transverse axis (>1.3°, P?=?0.002) and movement in a lateral direction (>16?mm P?=?0.002), greater dorsoventral amplitude and asymmetry; however, the latter differences were nonsignificant. There were no significant differences between reins. The difference in the left and right hindlimb stance phases and the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar were significantly associated. Greater circle-induced upward movement of a tuber coxae during the contralateral hindlimb stance was associated with greater circle-induced asymmetry of the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar (P?=?0.04). Conclusions Moving on a circle induces measurable changes in thoracolumbar movement compared with moving in straight lines, associated with alterations in the hindlimb gait.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is common in equids, with a high risk of re-injury associated with changes in tendon stiffness. In vivo measurement of limb stiffness has been shown to correlate with tendon stiffness after injury [1] but requires kinematic analysis which is impractical in a clinical setting. We have developed a simple system for measuring limb stiffness statically, which could be used as a tool for monitoring SDFT healing. Objectives To validate a goniometric measurement of limb stiffness. Study design Cross sectional study. Methods Initially, forelimb stiffness indices were determined at the walk for 6 equids using a validated kinematic analysis [1]. Limb stiffness indices were then calculated using portable floor scales to record ground reaction force (GRF), and an electrogoniometer to record metacarpophalangeal joint angle. Goniometric limb stiffness indices were subsequently measured in 11 horses ranging from 2 to 20 years of age, with no clinical evidence of SDFT injury. Strength and significance of correlation and agreement between the measurement methods was assessed and association between limb stiffness, limb (left vs. right), weight and age of horse and were calculated. Results There were strong positive correlations between GRF and joint angle (R2?=?0.98) and between the static and kinematic methods (R?=?0.78, P<0.01). There was a positive correlation between limb stiffness and weight (R2?=?0.85, P<0.01), but no association with age or limb. Conclusions This study validated the measurement of limb stiffness in a clinical setting. The positive correlation of limb stiffness and weight supports the theory of an optimised limb spring [2] for energy-efficient cursorial locomotion which may, in turn, provide a clinically-relevant measure of running efficiency and therefore the quality of tendon healing post injury.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The birthweight of Thoroughbred foals has increased in recent years. It is unknown whether this is associated with increased broodmare obesity or endocrine dysfunction. Objectives To determine insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations in obese and non-obese Thoroughbred mares throughout gestation and to investigate their association with foal birthweight. Study design Prospective, cohort study. Methods Fifty-seven pregnant Thoroughbred mares were included in the study. From 40 days post-breeding, body condition score (BCS), weight and venous blood samples were obtained every 60 days throughout gestation. Feed was withheld for 6?h before blood sampling. Serum/plasma insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations were measured using validated/standard methods. Foal birthweight was recorded. Association of hormone or triglyceride concentration with time, BCS and birthweight were analysed using a linear mixed effects model. A Pearson correlation co-efficient was calculated between hormone or triglyceride concentration, BCS and birthweight. Results Serum insulin concentrations were significantly greater (P<0.05) at 0?59 days compared with 240?299 days and at 60?119 days compared with 180?359 days gestation. 55% of mares had BCS?≥?7. There was 1.5% incidence of fasting hyperinsulinaemia throughout gestation and no association of fasting insulin concentration with BCS. Leptin concentration was significantly (P<0.0001) greater at 180?239 days compared with all other time points and was significantly (r?=?0.29, P<0.0003) correlated with BCS. Triglyceride concentration was significantly (P<0.02) greater at 240?299 days compared with earlier time points but was not associated with BCS. Foal birthweight was significantly positively correlated with BCS (r?=?0.13, P<0.001) and inversely correlated with leptin concentration at 60?119 days and 240?299 days gestation (r?=??0.64, P<0.05). Conclusions Mare BCS correlated with foal birthweight such that obese mares had heavier foals. Significant fasting hyperinsulinaemia was not identified in this population. Increased leptin concentration in early and late gestation was associated with decreased foal birthweight and may be useful to predict foal birthweight.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In cases of laminitis, an increased muscle force or contracture of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) is suggested, but evidence-based research is lacking. Objectives To test if the DDFM of laminitic equines shows an increased muscle force detectable by needle-EMG including Interference Pattern Analysis (IPA). Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Three groups consisted of Group 0 (control): 6 Royal Dutch Sport horses, 3 Shetland ponies and one Welsh pony (healthy, sound adults, mean?±?s.d. weight 411?±?217?kg). Group 1: 3 Royal Dutch Sport horses, one Friesian, one Haflinger, one Icelandic horse, 2 Welsh ponies, one miniature Appaloosa and 6 Shetland ponies (adults, mean?±?s.d. weight 310?±?172?kg) suffering from acute or chronic laminitis. EMG measurements including firing frequency (F) and IPA parameters Turns/Second (T), Amplitude/Turn (M) and Ratio M/T (R) were performed. ANOVA was used to analyse data. P values of P<0.05 were considered significant. Results Mean?±?s.d. F of Group 0 and Group 1 was 53?±?11 and 72?±?21?Hz, mean?±?s.d. T was 112?±?57 and 106?±?42, mean?±?s.d. M was 284?±?51 and 254?±?38??V and mean?±?s.d. R was 0.39?±?0.17 and 0.42?±?0.16%, respectively. The firing frequency of Group 1 was significantly higher compared to Group 0 (P?=?0.02), whereas other differences were not significant. Conclusions In human medicine, an increased firing frequency is a characteristic of increased muscle force [1,2]. Thus, the increased firing frequency of the DDFM in case of laminitis suggests an elevated muscle force. As all parameters show a high variance, a repeated study including a larger test group is advised.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Blackthorn (Prunus spinosus) is recognised as causing infections and tissue reactions. Objectives To describe the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of blackthorn plant thorn synovitis in the horse. Study design Case series. Methods All cases in this prospective study presented with acute onset synovitis within 24?h of thorn penetration, had a standardised clinical assessment, surgical treatment and aftercare. Surgical treatment was performed within 24?h of presentation under general anaesthesia, using a 2-stage procedure: Stage 1: perisynovial technique. Ultrasound guided placement of a 20 gauge 35?mm needle marker that is used as a guide for electrosurgical dissection onto perisynovial thorn fragments. Stage 2: endoscopic technique. Using standard and novel portals to locate and remove thorn fragments and debris from synovial structures. Results Thirty-five cases met the study inclusion criteria over a 24 month period. Mean lameness score on presentation was 4/5 (range 1?5). The most commonly affected structures were fetlock joints (11/35) and tendon sheaths (10/35). Mean synovial fluid total protein was 50.5?g/l (range 18?116), and TNCC was 158?x?109 (range 21?412) on presentation and 12?x?109 (range 1?46) at 48?h post operatively. All synovial fluid cultures were negative. All horses were sound (grade 0) at 5 days post operatively and all returned to full work. Conclusions There are a limited number of case series of blackthorn injury in humans; however, the consensus is that surgical treatment is required for a successful outcome. The 2-stage surgical procedure described, achieved accurate identification and removal of thorn material in all cases. In contrast to previous studies on synovial sepsis, these cases had a positive outcome despite high pre- and post operative synovial fluid total protein and TNCC. These findings suggest that thorn synovitis cases have a different aetiology from synovitis originating from sepsis or contamination.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Triamcinolone is commonly used in equine practice for the treatment of orthopaedic conditions. A serious potential adverse effect of triamcinolone is laminitis. However, evidence for the risk of laminitis associated with triamcinolone use is limited. Objectives To determine the risk of laminitis within 90 days of triamcinolone administration and compare with the risk of laminitis in a veterinary-attended horse population. Study design Retrospective study of clinical records. Methods Text mining and data extraction was performed using content analysis software (SimStat-WordStat v.6) on a database of anonymous digital clinical records from a convenience sample of North American equine practices (n?=?9). Medical records were retrieved using a dictionary of keywords for 3 groups of horses: 1) treated with triamcinolone, 2) age and practice matched control population (no triamcinolone) and 3) all laminitic horses. Records of horses within Groups 1 and 2 were mined for evidence of laminitis within a 90-day period of treatment or a random date respectively. Data manipulation and analysis was performed using R v3.0.0 (R Development Core Team). The prevalence of laminitis within all groups was determined and relative risk of developing laminitis determined by single logistic regression. Results The clinical records of 225,777 horses were examined. Overall prevalence of laminitis within the database was 1.1% (n?=?2533). Triamcinolone was administered to 12.4% (n?=?27,898) horses and 0.07% of treated horses (n?=?20) developed laminitis. In the control population (n?=?56,695), 0.2% of horses (n?=?134) developed laminitis. The risk of developing laminitis was significantly lower in the triamcinolone treatment group than the control population (OR 0.3 95%CI, 0.18?0.48 P<0.001). Conclusions Triamcinolone treatment does not increase the overall risk of a horse developing laminitis. However, further investigation of risk factors for laminitis in the 20 horses identified by this preliminary study is warranted to aid development of evidence-based treatment guidelines.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Effective diagnosis of equine laminitis is necessary to allow prompt instigation of palliative and therapeutic treatments, yet there has been limited work regarding diagnostic accuracy. Objectives To compare the prevalence of clinical signs in laminitis and non-laminitis lamenesses to evaluate the capabilities of discrimination for differential diagnosis. Study design Analytical epidemiological study. Methods Veterinary practitioners completed a pre-designed checklist of laminitis-associated clinical signs identified by literature review, for equine lameness of any origin. A case was defined as a horse/pony with veterinary-diagnosed, clinically apparent laminitis, attended by a participating practitioner. Associations between clinical signs and case/control status were tested by logistic regression with adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with veterinary practice as a fixed effect, and Wald P-value calculated. Multivariable analysis using graphical classification tree-based statistical models allowed comprehension of the prevalence in the data associated with particular clusters of clinical signs. Results Data were collected for 588 laminitis cases and 201 non-laminitis lamenesses. The overall prevalence of specific clinical signs ranged from 2.7% for ?sole prolapse? to 85.0% for ?lame at trot?. Differences in prevalence ranged from ?14.1% for ?lame at trot? (more common in controls) to +71.9% for ?short stilted gait at walk? (more common in cases). Five clinical signs had a difference in prevalence of greater than +50%: ?reluctance to walk?, ?short, stilted gait at walk?, ?difficulty turning?, ?shifting weight? and ?increased digital pulse?. Bilateral forelimb lameness was the best discriminator (92% of animals with this clinical sign had laminitis). The additional presence of increased digital pulses improved this to 99%. Flat/convex sole, shifting weight and short stilted gait at walk were also useful discriminators. Conclusions This is the first study to provide information aiding diagnostic hypothetico-deductive reasoning based on clinical signs to differentially diagnose laminitis from other lamenesses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In man, pulmonary veins (PV) are of major importance in atrial fibrillation pathophysiology as ectopy often originates in atrial myocardial sleeves extending in the PV wall. In addition, PV size on ultrasound is used to assess left atrial volume overload. In horses, PV anatomy and ultrasound have hardly been studied. Objectives To study PV anatomy and establish a standard approach for echocardiographic identification of the PV from a right and left parasternal view. Study design Anatomical and echocardiographic description. Methods Firstly, post mortem left atrial and PV silicone corrosion casts were made in 10 horses to investigate normal PV anatomy. Secondly, left and right parasternal ultrasound images and silicone casts were made in 3 horses, to compare images and casts. Results Four major PV ostia were identified on the casts, draining specific lung areas. From a right parasternal longitudinal view, ostium III was identified between the right atrial wall and right pulmonary artery, and ostium II left-dorsal to it. From a left parasternal oblique short-axis view, ostium III, its antrum and side-branches were used as anatomical landmarks (adjacent to the right atrial wall). Slightly more caudal, ostium II was visualised with, in one horse, its antrum and 2 branches. Ostium I was only seen in one horse, slightly ventral to ostium II. Ostium IV was always identified in cross-section on a left short-axis view, left to the pulmonary artery bifurcation. Conclusions A standard echocardiographic approach allows identification of pulmonary veins in adult horses. Left oblique and short axis views were superior although right long-axis views also showed ostiums II and III. These data allow reference values to be established for pulmonary venous size and flow, and to investigate new treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are currently no studies detailing cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release and clearance in normal horses post exercise using an analytically validated assay. These data are essential for selecting appropriate sampling times in equine athletes with suspected myocardial damage. Objective To plot the magnitude and time course of cTnI release and clearance, using a validated cTnI assay, after maximal effort. Study design Descriptive longitudinal study. Methods Five clinically normal Standardbred racehorses in full race training were included in the study. Physical examinations were performed on subjects and blood samples were taken via jugular venipuncture pre-exercise. Horses were exercised in harness at race intensity in groups on a training track. A second blood sample was taken immediately post exercise and an intravenous catheter was then placed in a jugular vein. Hourly blood samples were taken for 24?h. All samples were collected in red top serum Vacutainer? tubes and allowed to clot for 30?min before being centrifuged and serum harvested. Serum samples were stored at ?80°C until analysis. All samples were analysed using the Abbott ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity cTnI? assay. Results Mean resting cTnI level was 1.33?±?0.6?ng/l (range, 0.82?2.33?ng/l). All horses exhibited an increase in cTnI level after exercise with peak elevation occurring 2?6?h post exercise (mean, 4.6?±?1.7?h). Mean peak increase in cTnI level was 11.96?±?9.41?ng/l (range, 1.72?23.76?ng/l). All horses returned to baseline levels within 24?h. Conclusions All horses experienced an increase in cTnI post exercise, with the peak occurring 2?6?h post exercise. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of these increases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic remains a life-threatening condition in the horse. Ischaemia and reperfusion following correction of small intestinal strangulation may produce oxidative stress. The ability to withstand oxidative stress depends on antioxidant levels and may be linked to horse survival. Objectives To measure peripheral antioxidant levels in horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy with small intestinal strangulation. Study design Case?control study. Methods Blood and plasma were collected from horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for small intestinal strangulation and stored at ?80°C. Controls involved non-colic horses. Total plasma glutathione was measured spectrophotometrically at 412?nm using the 5,5?-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) reaction. Samples containing scavenger (to remove reduced glutathione, GSH) were used to measure oxidised glutathione (GSSG). Glutathione reductase (GR) activity (u/l) was measured as the rate of GSH production at 412?nm. Glutathione peroxidise (GPx) activity (u/l) was measured as the change in optical density (340?nm) following the consumption of NADPH after GSSG production. All assays were purchased from BioAssay Systems (Hayward, California). Clinical data including arterial blood gas analysis were collected on admission. Results Glutathione reductase activity in horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions was significantly reduced compared to control horses (12.2?±?1.1?u/l vs. 15.9?±?0.8?u/l, P?=?0.03, n?=?6) whereas GPx activity did not significantly differ between colic and control horses (155.7?±?48.7?u/l vs. 167.3?±?30.1?u/l, P?=?0.84, n?=?6). Total glutathione, reduced or oxidised glutathione did not differ significantly between control and colic horses. A positive correlation existed between GR activity and Ca2+ (r?=?0.93) and K+ (r?=?0.75) whereas a strong negative correlation was present between GR activity and HCO3? (r?=??0.92) and PaCO2 (r?=??0.96). Conclusions Reduced plasma glutathione reductase activity with small intestinal strangulation indicates oxidative stress and may be related to systemic electrolyte/bicarbonate abnormalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists such as prucalopride are used as human prokinetics, since activation of 5-HT4 receptors on intestinal cholinergic neurons facilitates acetylcholine release. 5-HT4 receptors, linked to adenylyl cyclase, act via generation of cAMP. None of the 4 in vitro studies on 5-HT in horses provided evidence for neuronal 5-HT4 receptors, but none used the protocol as described in human studies [1?4]. Objectives To investigate whether functional 5-HT4 receptors are present in the equine small intestine. Study design and methods In vitro organ bath set up, applying electrical field stimulation (EFS) in longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips. Results Results were similar in both muscle layers. In the presence of 0.3?mmol/l NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 0.3??mol/l apamine, excluding effects of the inhibitory transmitters NO and ATP, EFS induced voltage-dependent on-contractions; these were neurogenic as they were abolished by 3??mol/l tetrodotoxin. At a voltage inducing 50% of the maximal amplitude, the submaximal EFS-induced contractions were cholinergic as atropine (1??mol/l) abolished them. Prucalopride (0.3??mol/l) did not increase the amplitude of these submaximal EFS-induced contractions. Even in the presence of the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, previously shown to enhance the effect of neuronal 5-HT4 receptors by inhibiting breakdown of their 2nd messenger cAMP [5], prucalopride (3??mol/l) had no influence. Also 5-HT (10??mol/l), a full agonist at 5-HT4 receptors, tested in the presence of methysergide and granisetron to exclude interaction with other 5-HT receptor subtypes, did not enhance EFS-induced submaximal contractions. Conclusions There is no evidence for presence of 5-HT4 receptors on the cholinergic neurons of the equine small intestine. These results question the application of 5-HT4 prokinetic drugs in horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infrared imaging is becoming popular as an aid to traditional diagnostic tools, its repeatability under practically relevant conditions is still discussed. Objectives We hypothesise that time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity affect thermography readings, and that there is no difference between values from left and right side. Study design Repeated thermography in a convenience sample. Methods Fifteen sound horses were thermographically imaged at 3 time points in the same day (08.00, 12.00 and 16.00?h). Images were taken of the following regions: neck, carpus, distolateral thoracic limbs (cranial and tendon areas), thoracolumbar, pelvis, hock and pelvic limb tendons. Relative humidity and ambient temperature were recorded for each session. Results There was a significant difference between the temperature readings during the 3 imaging sessions in all areas (Friedman and Kruskal?Wallis; all P<0.014). Ambient temperature and relative humidity correlated with thermography readings in the caudal imaging areas (P<0.008 [temperature], P<0.032 [humidity]) of the horses, with an exception of one hock reading, but not in all cranial areas (P<0.365 [temperature], P<0.992 [humidity]) (Spearman's Rho). All but 2 regions (minimum values in the carpus and thoracic tendon areas in the morning session, (P?=?0.033, 0.034) did not show significant difference between left and right sides at the same time of day (all P>0.057). Conclusions Time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity must be considered when using infrared imaging. Variations between the left and right sides of the horse can occur and should be considered during the analysis of pathological asymmetry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an electrophysiological technique used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) to evaluate the functional integrity of the descending motor fibres in the spinal cord. Successful application of the technique was reported in horses with spinal cord compression. However, limited data are available on the correlation of TMS with histopathological changes. Objectives To determine sensitivity of TMS for assessing the integrity of the spinal cord in horses with compressive lesions of the spinal cord. Study design Case series. Methods The study was conducted on 6 horses with spinal ataxia grade III-V/V admitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. The horses underwent TMS, radiography of the cervical or thoracolumbar vertebral column, and myelography (4/6). All horses were subjected to euthanasia and the spinal cord examined histopathologically. Results In 5/6 horses MMEPs with abnormal onset latencies in both extensor carpi radialis muscles and cranial tibialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a cervical spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed cervical vertebral malformation (4/5) with cervical vertebral canal stenosis (3/5) and tumour/osteomyelitis (1/5). In 1/6 horse MMEPs with normal onset latencies in extensor carpi radialis muscles and prolonged onset latencies in tibialis cranialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed deformation of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae. Myelography showed reduction in dural diameter and dorsal contrast column (4/4). Histopathological examination of the spinal cord confirmed compressive type lesions in all 6 horses with degenerative changes in the white matter of all funiculi, ballooning of myelin sheets, swollen axons, loss of axons and astroglial activation. Conclusions In this case series abnormal function of descending motor pathways as registered by TMS showed 100% sensitivity with the histopathological characteristics of compressive lesions in the spinal cord, but the number of horses is limited and further research is warranted.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Limited information exists on distribution of local anaesthetic solution following palmar digital nerve blocks. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves using 2 different volumes of contrast medium and 2 different injection sites. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves were performed at the level of or 2?cm proximal to the proximal aspect of the ipsilateral ungular cartilage, using 1.5 or 2.5?ml radiodense contrast medium. In total 96 injections were performed. Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately after injections and 10 and 20?min later. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After distal injections, the contrast medium was more localised around the injection site; after proximal injections the contrast patch had greater proximal-distal length. The greatest proximal diffusion was to 31.7% of the length of the proximal phalanx (from distal) after distal injections and to 70% after proximal injections. The larger volume resulted in significantly greater proximal diffusion than the smaller volume at the distal, but not at the proximal injection site (P<0.01). There was significant proximal diffusion with time after proximal and distal injections (P<0.01). In most limbs numerous radiopaque lines of various thickness extended proximally from the contrast patches; subjectively, their number and thickness were greater at the distal injection site. Conclusions Palmar digital nerve blocks at the level of the ungular cartilage using ≤2.5?ml local anaesthetic solution may improve proximal interphalangeal joint and pastern region pain. If using a more proximal site, distal fetlock region pain may be improved. Due to diffusion into lymphatic vessels, too small a volume at the distal injection site may not provide sufficient analgesia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A quantifiable measure of muscle activity related to the cervical spine may provide further understanding and evidence based support for chiropractic techniques. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a noninvasive method of measuring muscle activity of the splenius muscle when the horse is at rest. Objectives To determine if there is a relationship between objective measurable muscle parameters and misalignments and muscle tension in the equine cervical spine. Study design Controlled paired randomised study. Methods Privately owned horses (n?=?14), of mixed sex, age and mean height 157.8?cm were selected and assigned a group by matching work, management regime, age, sex and breed. The treatment group (n?=?7) underwent manual chiropractic treatment following palpation. The control group underwent palpation only. A Delsys 4 sensor system was used for data collection. Probes were positioned on the muscle halfway between C1/C2 joint and the crest on the left and right sides, between the tendon insertion and the motor point to maximise signals. sEMG readings were taken at immediately before (0) and after palpation (PP) and 30?min later (30). Data were tested for normality and variance by one-way ANOVA and paired t test. Results Post treatment, there was a significant decrease (P<0.01) in sEMG activity for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There was a significant decrease (P<0.05) in sEMG for right side for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There were no such significant effects for the control group. The majority (83%) of horses had atlas rotation and tilt to the right. Conclusions This preliminary study supports use of sEMG as a means of assessing muscle activity of equines and suggests a statistically significant reduction in splenius muscle activity is observed following manual chiropractic treatment although the benefit to the horse is unknown.
