AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?≥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?≥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin ≥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol dependence results in two different clinical forms: ?uncomplicated? alcoholism (UA) and Korsakoff's syndrome (KS). Certain brain networks are especially affected in UA and KS: the frontocerebellar circuit (FCC) and the Papez circuit (PC). Our aims were (1) to describe the profile of white matter (WM) microstructure in FCC and PC in the two clinical forms, (2) to identify those UA patients at risk of developing KS using their WM microstructural integrity as a biomarker. Tract-based spatial statistics and nonparametric voxel-based permutation tests were used to compare diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data in 7 KS, 20 UA, and 14 healthy controls. The two patient groups were also pooled together and compared to controls. k-means classifications were then performed on mean fractional anisotropy values of significant clusters across all subjects for two fiber tracts from the FCC (the middle cerebellar peduncle and superior cerebellar peduncle) and two tracts from the PC (fornix and cingulum). We found graded effects of WM microstructural abnormalities in the PC of UA and KS. UA patients classified at risk of developing KS using fiber tracts of the PC from DTI data also had the lowest scores of episodic memory. That finding suggests that WM microstructure could be used as a biomarker for early detection of UA patients at risk of developing KS.

AB  - Abstract Carboplatin (CBP) is a widely used targeted anticancer therapeutic drug, however, multi-drug resistance induced by the accumulation of CBP eventually causes diseases progression. The anti-malarial drug artesunate (ART) also exerts anti-cancer effects in various cancers; however, the combined effect of ART and CBP on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In the present study, the NSCLC cell line A549 was pretreated with various concentrations of CBP, ART and gemcitabine (GEM). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were conducted to detect cell viability. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by both flow cytometry and TUNEL apoptotic assay. The expression profiles of cell cycle-related proteins and apoptotic proteins were determined by western blot. Cell clone numbers were visualized using crystal violet staining. Here, we found that both CBP and ART suppressed cell viability, and promoted cell apoptosis, and the combined application of ART and CBP at a lower concentration exhibited synergistic effects. Specifically, the combination of ART and CBP at a lower concentration suppressed cell clone numbers, promoted cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and induced the expression of the cell cycle and apoptosis related proteins BAX, p21, p53, and Caspae-3, while decreasing Bcl-2 and CyclinB1 expression. Based on these results, we concluded that combined application of ART and CBP exerts synergistic anti-tumor effects on NSCLC by enhancing cell apoptosis in a mitochondria-dependent manner.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Inflammation is key in the development of post operative ileus in rodents, with a similar pathogenesis likely occurring in other species. Dexamethasone reduces inflammation and therefore could help reduce post operative ileus in the horse. Objectives To determine if dexamethasone reduces post operative ileus in horses with small intestinal disease, and assess the effect on incisional health and short-term survival. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Fifteen horses that underwent small intestinal resection and anastomosis were given 0.1?mg/kg bwt dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX). Data from a comparable number of horses that did not receive dexamethasone (NoDEX) was collected retrospectively and sequentially. Horses were matched for the type of resection performed. Fisher's Exact and Student's t tests were used for data analysis. Results There was no significant difference in the amount of nasogastric reflux (litres) (DEX 8.06?±?17.12, NoDEX 10.02?±?24.03, P?=?0.39) produced or in the number of horses that produced nasogastric reflux post operatively. There was no difference in survival to discharge. The severity of incisional discharge/infection was significantly different between groups when scored 0?3 (0 being no discharge and 3 being severe discharge/infection), (P?=?0.01), in favour of DEX (2/15 horses affected) vs. NoDEX (7/15). Conclusions Dexamethasone did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the incidence of post-operative ileus. Administration of a single dose of dexamethasone does not appear to have a detrimental effect on short-term survival or on incisional complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infiltrative disease of the intestine is an important cause of weight loss in the horse. Infiltration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the intestinal wall and intestinal fibrosis cause changes in the integrity of the intestinal wall. This may lead to altered intestinal permeability which can be measured using the contrast medium iohexol. Objectives To determine if iohexol intestinal permeability, as evaluated by serum iohexol concentration, could be used to differentiate between healthy horses and horses with infiltrative disease of the large colon. Study design Prospective non-randomised controlled clinical trial. Methods Six healthy adult horses and 4 horses with chronic infiltrative disease of the large colon were used in the study. Infiltrative disease was confirmed on post mortem in all cases, and included alimentary lymphoma and mycobacterial granulomatous enterocolitis. Following a 16-h fast, each horse was dosed with 1.0?ml/kg bwt of iohexol as a 10% solution via nasogastric intubation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480?min after dosing. Iohexol concentration was determined using HPLC-UV and the differences between the groups were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. Results There was a statistically significant difference in iohexol serum concentration between the diseased and nondiseased horses (P?=?0.001). The overall difference in the mean iohexol concentration between the 2 groups was 6.07 (95% CI 3.19?8.96)??g/ml, however there appeared to be a trend towards increasing difference at later time points (240, 300, 360?min). Conclusions The iohexol permeability test has potential as a diagnostic tool for estimation of intestinal permeability in horses with infiltrative intestinal disease. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the test can be used to determine the site of intestinal pathology, predict the prognosis and potentially evaluate the response to treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season. Restoration of fertility in this study was lower than that previously reported and potential reasons for this include limited pre-surgical diagnostic testing, differing prior pathologies or reasons for sub-fertility, and case selection.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine whether horses could become infected with cyathostomins when bedded in deep litter straw. Objectives The specific objective of the study was to determine whether cyathostomin eggs could hatch and develop to infective larval stages on straw bedding. Study design Experimental study. Methods Four horticultural incubators were set up to simulate 3 straw bedding scenarios, and one grass turf control. Faeces were placed on 12 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass over a 17-day period. The plots within incubators A, B, and C contained dry straw, watered straw, and deep litter straw, respectively. Plot 1 of each incubator contained a faecal pat of a horse that tested negative for strongyle eggs ? these were to serve as negative control plots. Plots 2 and 3 of each incubator contained a faecal pat from horses that had average faecal worm egg counts (FWEC) of 269 epg and 921 epg, respectively. A thermostat within each incubator was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 20°C. Results No L3 larvae were recovered from the control plots of each incubator, and none were recovered from any of the plots within Incubator A. L3 larvae were first detected on plots 2 and 3 of Incubator B on Day 8, and on plot 3 of incubators C and D on Day 10. Conclusions It is evident that equine Cyathostominae can develop to infective L3 larvae on straw bedding, but only when the straw is moist. Therefore, it may be speculated that a horse bedded in deep litter straw may become infected by ingesting the infective L3 larvae contaminating the straw. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study While open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice for most ulnar fractures conservative treatment is sometimes chosen due to financial constraints. Additional motives for the choice of treatment may be present, and the clients perception is therefore of interest. Objectives To compare survival and outcome between horses treated for an ulnar fracture, either surgically or conservatively and to assess clients perception of treatment. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Medical records and radiographs of horses treated between January 2002 and December 2012, with a diagnosis of ulnar fracture were reviewed. Information regarding short- (within 1 year) and long-term (>1 year) outcome and owner satisfaction with treatment was obtained via telephone questionnaires. Differences between groups were investigated using a chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results Fracture types included 11 type 4, 7 type 5, one type 2, and one type 1b fracture. Eleven horses were treated surgically (Group 1). Nine horses were managed conservatively (Group 2). Group 1: 7/11 (64%) survived >1 year, 5/11 (45%) returned to previous athletic level. In Group 2: 6/9 (67%) survived >1 year, 4/9 (43%) returned to previous athletic level. No significant difference in outcome could be detected. There was no difference in the total treatment cost for horses that stayed at the hospital (P?=?0.22). Owners in Group 1 expressed more satisfaction with the treatment than owners in Group 2. Several of the latter expressed welfare concerns regarding the prolonged stall confinement in harness involved with this treatment. Conclusions Veterinarians recommending therapy for cases of ulnar fractures should be aware that many can be treated surgically with a good outcome. Prolonged hospitalisation and stall confinement of horses treated conservatively was a major welfare concern of the owners interviewed and had the same total cost as surgical treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF), causing epizootic lymphangitis (EZL), is endemic in parts of Africa including, Ethiopia, Senegal and Gambia. Despite its high prevalence, impact on animal welfare and socio-economic importance, there is little evidence upon which to build practical disease control strategies. The performance and availability of diagnostic tests currently used by clinicians is problematic. Methods such as pattern recognition of clinical signs and microscopy lack specificity and other reported methods are either not commercially available or not readily feasible in these settings (e.g. culture). This is a significant barrier to further understanding this disease within endemic countries. Objectives To validate a nested PCR method to confirm the presence of HCF in equine clinical samples. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Twenty-nine horses with suspected EZL were included from topographically varied regions of Ethiopia. Clinical data, lesion location drawn onto equine silhouettes, blood samples and aspirates of pus from cutaneous nodules were obtained before treatment provided by SPANA clinic. Blood and clinical data were collected from a further 20 horses with no cutaneous EZL lesions. Giemsa stained impression smears of pus were examined microscopically. Aliquots of heat-inactivated pus and blood were inoculated onto Whatman FTA cards and imported to the UK with Defra approved licensing. A nested PCR targeting the ITS region, was used to identify samples containing HCF and PCR products were sequenced. Results HCF was confirmed in heat-inactivated FTA card pus samples from 24 horses, additionally, 23 blood samples were positive from EZL suspected cases. Bioinfomatic analyses suggested that there was diversity within the ITS region among these HCF products. Conclusions These PCR techniques allow the rapid diagnosis of HCF directly from equine clinical samples. The identification of HCF in blood raises questions about the pathogenesis of HCF in horses and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Atrial fibrillation is a common equine arrhythmia. Quinidine alone, or with digoxin are common treatments. Studies on outcome in Warmblood populations in which duration of the AF is often unknown are limited. Objectives To identify the factors that are associated with the success of full treatment cardioversion with oral medication, and establish whether there are differences in these factors between institutions. Study design Retrospective case series using patient records of Equine University Clinic of Utrecht University and Rossdales Equine Hospital, Newmarket. Methods Forty-nine horses treated with quinidine were identified (29 Warmbloods, 20 Thorougbreds, 1 Anglo-Arabian). Details of signalment, history, duration physical examination and echocardiography including left atrial size and presence of mitral regurgitation were retrieved. Clinical details including mean weight, age and left atrial size were compared between clinics using independent samples t test. Association between variables and cardioconversion were evaluated in a backwards logistic regression using Akaike's information criterium (AIC) and odds ratios were calculated. Factors were sex, clinic, breed, mitral regurgitation, duration and poor performance. Covariates were age, weight and the size of the left atrium. Significance was set at 0.05. Results Fifty-one horses (mean age 8.8?s.d. 4.5 years) were treated with quinidine sulfate, 18 also received digoxin. Eighty per cent converted to sinus rhythm. In 8 horses the known duration was less than 3 months. The only factor associated with successful treatment was the use of digoxin in combination with quinidine sulfate (odds ratio 12.4; 95% CI 2.61 and 91.85 according to AIC analysis). Conclusions In this retrospective case series, there is much potential for bias in the data; however, the use of digoxin in addition to quinidine was associated with improved conversion rates regardless of breed even though AF duration was unknown in most horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Every year, several equine influenza (EI) epidemics are reported worldwide. Equine influenza vaccination is the most efficient method of prevention; however, not all horses develop sufficient immunity after EI immunisation, increasing the risk of infection, infectious virus excretion and the spread of the disease. Objectives This study aimed to better understand poor vaccine response mechanisms during the primary EI vaccination. Study design Cohort study. Methods The EI humoral immune response was measured in 118 Thoroughbred foals set in 3 different stud farms (SF#1 to SF#3) after the primary course of EI vaccination. All foals were immunised with a recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, following the vaccine manufacturer's recommendations. The age at first vaccination was 4 to 8 months. Sera were tested by single radial haemolysis (SRH) against the A/equine/Jouars/4/2006 EIV strain (Florida clade 2) at the time of the first vaccination (V1), 2 weeks and 3 months after the second immunisation (V2), 2 days and 3 months after the third immunisation (V3). Results Short (V2?+?2 weeks) and mid-term (V3?+?3 months) SRH antibody levels were statistically different between the stud farms (P-value?=?0.0011 and 0.003, respectively), with SF#1<SF#3<SF#2 and SF#1 SRH antibody titres below the protection threshold (i.e. 85?mm2) at all time points studied. SRH antibody levels induced by EI vaccination were related to the age of foals at the first immunisation (SF#1 median age 143 days, SF#2 median age 181 days and SF#3 median age 156 days), but were independent of the presence of maternal derived antibodies (MDA; P-value 0.41). Given the results in SF#1, a booster immunisation (V4) was brought forward to restore protective levels of antibody. Conclusion Independently of the presence of MDA, the age of foals at first immunisation plays an important role in the establishment of adequate antibody levels.

AB  - Abstract Acute poisonings represent a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prognostic utility of the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters combined with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in acute poisoning with different xenobiotics, upon admission in the hospital, was not evaluated. This prospective observational cohort study included 229 acutely poisoned non-diabetic adults, with a median age of 44 years (range 18?90 years), 50.7% women, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 8.7%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, the left ventricle kinetic abnormalities, the E-wave deceleration time (EDT) and BNP correlated significantly with mortality in acutely poisoned patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that only EDT [odds ratio (OR) 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54?7.69, p 0.003], BNP (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02?2.55, p 0.04) and age (OR 2.66, 95% CI: 1.23?5.76, p 0.013) are predictive for mortality. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis proved EDT [area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.85; CI: 0.76?0.94; p 0.001], BNP (AUC, 0.83; CI: 0.75?0.91; p 0.001) and age (AUC, 0.82; CI: 0.74?0.90; p 0.001) as indicators for fatalities. In hospitalized patients acutely intoxicated with undifferentiated poisons, EDT as a parameter of left ventricle diastolic function and BNP are useful to early predict mortality.

AB  - Abstract Objective Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a non-specific acute phase reaction protein that shows much higher levels in patients with cancer than in healthy individuals. The present study was designed to investigate the correlation of SAA level with overall survival (OS) and radiation pneumonitis (RP) in non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving thoracic radiotherapy. Methods Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving thoracic radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy were eligible for the study. Plasma samples were collected before radiotherapy (baseline), 2 and 4 weeks during radiotherapy, and at 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. The incidence of RP was recorded 1 year after radiotherapy. OS was defined as the interval between the date of treatment initiation and the date of death or last follow up if the patients were still alive. spss 18.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 software were used for statistical analyses, and P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results In total, data from 114 patients were used for the final analyses. The median baseline SAA level was 101.4 ?g/mL; patients with lower baseline SAA levels had a longer OS than those with a higher SAA level (25.8 vs 14.3 months, ?2 = 5.519, P = 0.019). In multivariate analysis, sex, radiation dose, and baseline SAA level were independent prognostic factors. The SAA level after radiotherapy was significantly lower than that at baseline (142.6 vs 420.1 ?g/mL, t = 3.50, P = 0.001). The average SAA level in patients with grade 2 or higher and less than grade 2 RP after radiotherapy was 476.7 ?g/mL and 113.0 ?g/mL, respectively, t = 2.72, P = 0.009. Conclusions SAA level might be a predictive biomarker for RP and OS in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving thoracic radiotherapy.

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.)

(Charcoal Hemoperfusion) Blood ? evidence of massive hemolysis intra-vascular hemolysis, shown in table (no evidence of HUS/TTP). She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - Reason for performing study Measurement of lactate in horses with colic has been described for over 20 years. Objectives To systematically review the evidence on the use of plasma and/or peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS scoring system. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to colic; 32 studies related to the use of lactate in the diagnosis of colic, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using QUADAS. Both papers investigated the use of plasma and peritoneal lactate to identify strangulating intestinal lesions. Both were cross-sectional studies, and together they evaluated a total of 71 horses with confirmed strangulating lesions. Appraisal of the studies using the QUADAS tool was performed. Both papers met QUADAS criteria relating to study design and data analysis, but the QUADAS tool did highlight some limitations in terms of sample and control groups in both papers. Data analysis varied, with one study developing a model to predict the presence of a strangulating lesion, which included peritoneal lactate and other measurements, and the other study assessing optimal predictive values associated with concentrations of peritoneal lactate. Both studies concluded that peritoneal lactate was a more useful diagnostic test than blood lactate. Conclusions Despite the large numbers of publications reporting use of lactate, only a small number used study designs considered suitable for evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy as proposed by the Cochrane Library. Although the current evidence is limited, there is agreement on the value of peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for strangulating intestinal lesions. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ethmoidal infection with Aspergillus spp. is rarely reported in horses. Three horses suffering from unilateral infection with Aspergillus spp. of the ethmoid with varying underlying conditions are described. Study design Case series. Methods Diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the ethmoid (presence of white mycotic plaques on a layer of thick yellow mucus) and confirmed by fungal culture (A. fumigatus) and/or cytology. Clinical details and outcome were obtained from the medical records and by contacting owners. Results Horse 1 and 2 had a progressive ethmoid haematoma (PEH) and had been treated for over 5 months with repeated formalin injections (one horse after initial surgical debulking of the PEH that also invaded the maxillary and sphenopalatine sinuses) before the infection with Aspergillus was diagnosed. The third horse, presented with poor performance and nasal discharge, had congenitally abnormal anatomy of the right dorsal nasal passage and right ethmoids. In the 2 horses with PEH the mycotic plaques were removed transendoscopically successfully. After 6 weeks the infection was no longer present at endoscopy in both horses (follow-up endoscopy: Horse 1 no relapse >16 months and Horse 2 no relapse >7 months). In the third horse, it was not possible to remove all mycotic plaques, therefore systemic treatment with itraconazole (3?mg/kg bwt q. 12?h for 8 weeks orally) was started. After 8 weeks, the clinical signs had resolved and endoscopy showed that the Aspergillus infection had cleared (follow-up: no relapse >14 months). No side effects were seen with systemic itraconazole treatment. Conclusions In horses with underlying ethmoidal conditions, secondary infection with Aspergillus spp. may occur. Transendoscopic removal of the mycotic plaques alone may be successful and if this approach is not feasible or unsuccessful, systemic treatment with itraconazole can be considered.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recent studies evaluating owner sound horses have identified a large proportion of horses with motion asymmetries but the prevalence, type and magnitude of asymmetries have not been investigated. The increasing use of objective lameness evaluation necessitates a further characterisation of the differences between lameness and motion asymmetries. Objectives To investigate prevalence, and quantify type and magnitude of motion asymmetries during straight-line trot in riding horses, perceived sound by their owners. Study design Cross-sectional prospective study. Methods Vertical head and pelvic movement symmetry was measured in 220 Warmblood riding horses, all functioning in daily work and considered sound by their owners; 100 of these individuals had been included in a previous report [1]. Body-mounted uni-axial accelerometers were used and differences between maximum and minimum head (HDmax, HDmin) and pelvic (PDmax, PDmin) vertical displacement between left and right forelimb and hindlimb stances were calculated during straight-line trot. Previously used symmetry thresholds (absolute differences >6?mm for the head and >3?mm for the pelvic variables) were used. Results The thresholds for symmetry were exceeded for 159 horses (72%) for at least one variable, HDmax (n?=?41, mean 12.7?mm, s.d. 5.5), HDmin (n?=?58, mean 14.3?mm, s.d. 7.1), PDmax (n?=?87, mean 6.5?mm, s.d. 3.10), PDmin (n?=?77, mean 5.7?mm, s.d. 2.1). Contralateral and ipsilateral concurrent fore- and hindlimb asymmetries were detected in 41 and 49 horses, respectively. Conclusions A surprisingly large proportion (72%) of horses perceived as sound by their owner showed movement asymmetries during straight-line trot. It is not known to what extent these asymmetries are related to pain or mechanical abnormalities as opposed to ?normal variation? and this leads to 2 potential welfare problems ? either too many horses in training are actually ?lame? or many horses categorised as ?lame? have no locomotor system disease. Ethical animal research:?This study was conducted within guidelines of the participating sites institutional animal care and use procedures (C 206/10, C48/13) and informed consent for data collection was obtained from the horse owners prior to the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It has been suggested that ultrasonography is unreliable for the detection of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) based on comparison between ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance images. Objectives To compare ultrasonography with gross and histopathological post mortem examination in horses with PSD diagnosed based on the response to local anaesthesia and ultrasonography. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Nineteen horses with hindlimb PSD were humanely destroyed. The ultrasonographic abnormalities were graded prospectively as mild, moderate or severe based on predefined criteria. Thirty-seven lame limbs were examined grossly and 36 suspensory ligaments (SLs) were examined histologically. The histological images were graded blindly based on predefined criteria (0?3 for each tissue type; 0?=?normal, 3?=?severe abnormality). Descriptive statistics were performed. Results Ultrasonographic lesions were graded moderate in 31/38 (81.6%) and severe in 7/38 (18.4%) limbs; in 4/36 (11.1%) limbs adhesion formation between the proximal aspect of the SL and the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon was predicted. Gross post mortem examination revealed substantial adhesions between the proximal aspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissues in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs; in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs there were adhesions between the body of the SL and the mid plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone, extending distally in 6 (16.2%) limbs. Histology revealed abnormalities (grades 1?3) of the collagenous tissue in 25/36 (69.4%) limbs. Muscle was abnormal (grades 1?3) in 35/36 (97.2%) limbs and adipose tissue (grades 1?3) in 16/36 (44.4%) limbs. Neural abnormalities (grades 1?3) were seen in 23/36 (63.9%) limbs and vascular changes (grade 1 and 2) in 2/36 (5.6%) limbs. In 1/36 limbs no abnormality was detected. Conclusions Ultrasonography was reasonably reliable for the detection of SL pathology based on histology as a gold standard, but the ability to detect gross adhesions was limited. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Animal Health Trust and had informed consent of the owners. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Sagittal plane slab fractures of the third carpal bone are a recognised injury in the racehorse. One study [1] reported 32 horses with sagittal fractures, 69% raced again. Surgical management appeared beneficial, with all horses that underwent inter-fragmentary compression racing again. Objectives To document the success rate following sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone in UK-based racehorses, and to compare conservative and surgical management. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Inclusion criteria were Thoroughbred racehorses with a simple sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone. Exclusion criteria were comminuted fractures, radial carpal bone fractures and short incomplete linear lucencies. Fractures were classified as complete, incomplete or uncertain. Time from injury to next race was recorded. Success rates were compared by Fisher's exact test. Results Forty horses were identified. Two were subjected to euthanasia and 3 have <6 months follow-up. Eleven were managed nonsurgically of which 4 (36%) were complete (5 uncertain) and 7 (64%) raced, 154?508 days following injury (median 242 days). Twenty-seven horses underwent surgery to place a single 3.5?mm (n?=?26) or 4.5?mm (n?=?1) lag screw under arthroscopic guidance, of which 18 (67%) were complete. Thirteen (48%) raced again 147?711 days following surgery (median 256 days) P?=?0.48. Of 23 horses with complete fractures 13 (57%) raced again, compared with 5/15 (33%) horses with incomplete fractures P?=?0.2. Of horses with complete fractures, 10/18 (55%) underwent surgery and raced again compared to 3/4 (75%) horses managed conservatively P?=?0.62. Conclusions The results confirm that the prognosis for athletic function is favourable but do not suggest that surgery is beneficial, or necessary for complete fractures. The numbers managed conservatively are small and it was not clear radiographically if the fracture was complete in 5/11 horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Previous studies show the effect of toe or heel wedges on tendon strain but there is little understanding of the effect of other shoe types. Objectives To quantify the effect of different shoeing conditions on the strain in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), distal check ligament (ALDDFT) and suspensory ligament (SL). Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Twelve equine cadaver forelimbs were loaded onto a force plate mimicking stance phase. Markers were placed proximally and distally in each tendon structure and tracked using a motion capture system and strain was calculated. Tendon strain was determined for the following conditions: barefoot, glue on heart bar and aluminium racing plates with and without packing material. Data were analysed using a mixed effects model. Results Significant variation in strain was observed between tendons. The DDFT had the lowest strain, then the ALDDFT, SDFT and SL. Glue on heart bar shoes significantly increased SDFT and SL strain compared to barefoot for the same leg force. Aluminium racing plates without packing material increased ALDDFT and SDFT strain and with packing material increased ALDDFT and SL. Conclusions Shoe selection should be based on minimising strain in the tendon with greatest injury risk. Aluminium racing plates with packing material may be most appropriate for the majority of racehorses as they do not significantly increase SDFT strain.
