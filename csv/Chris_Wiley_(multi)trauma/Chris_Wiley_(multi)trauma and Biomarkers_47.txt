AB  - Reasons for performing study Adverse effects on renal health and haemostasis have been documented in human patients administered hydroxyethyl starches (HES). Gelatins could provide useful substitutes for HES should similar adverse effects be identified in horses. Objectives To compare the effects of a 4% modified fluid gelatin (MFG) with a 130/0.4 6% tetrastarch (TES) on haemodilution, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), haemostasis and renal parameters in healthy ponies. Study design Randomised crossover. Methods Three treatments (A?=?10?ml/kg bwt TES, B?=?10?ml/kg bwt MFG and C?=?20?ml/kg bwt MFG) were administered to 6 healthy ponies with a one-week washout period. Packed cell volume (PCV), total serum protein (TSP), COP, platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thromboelastography (TEG) were measured at baseline and at multiple time points up to 24?h post infusion. Serum creatinine, urine specific gravity (USG), urine protein:creatinine (UPC), urine GGT:creatinine (UGC) and urine sediment examination (USE) were performed before and 24?h after each treatment, and one week after the final treatment. Results All treatments caused significant haemodilution and increases in COP with treatment C having a significantly greater effect on PCV than other treatments. The platelet count decreased with all treatments and was significantly lower for treatment C compared with treatment B. No significant differences were observed in any TEG parameter within or between treatments. No significant differences in PT, aPTT or fibrinogen were observed between treatments. Serum creatinine, UGC and UPC did not change significantly pre- and post study. USG and USE remained within normal limits. Conclusions 4% MFG could be considered as an alternative to 130/0.4 6% TES for volume expansion and oncotic support. Neither MFG nor TES were associated with clinically significant adverse effects on haemostasis or renal parameters.

AB  - Reasons for performing study New therapeutic strategies to modulate immune responses in human and equine allergic airway diseases are under extensive investigation. Stimulation of Treg cells with immune modulating agents is a novel therapeutic option. Objectives The aim of this field study was to compare the effects of a nebulised nanoparticulate CpG immunotherapy (CpG-GNP) with and without specific allergens. Study design Longitudinal clinical study comparing 2 therapeutic options. Methods Twenty RAO-affected horses were divided into 2 treatment groups (CpG alone and CpG with allergens). Two specific allergens were selected for each horse according to anamnesis and a functional in vitro test. Treatments were given by nebulisation 7 times and the horses were examined 3 times: baseline (I), after the treatment course (II), and after 6 weeks later (III). Clinical parameters, indirect intrapleural measurement, arterial blood gas, amount of tracheal mucus and neutrophil percentage were evaluated. Results CpG alone resulted in a significant improvement in clinical parameters and a significant reduction of tracheal mucus after treatment and at 6 weeks post treatment. After CpG plus specific allergens, there was significant improvement of 70% of examined parameters. However, there were no significant differences in the results compared with CpG-GNP treatment alone. Conclusions There were no significant differences between treatment groups. CpG-GNP immunotherapy alone produced a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory parameters and may have potential as for treatment of equine and human allergic inflammatory airway diseases. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the regional legal agency for animal experiments of the Government of Bavaria, Germany (No. 55.2-1-54-2531-31-10).

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little data on BALF cytokine profiles are available from racehorses with IAD; cytological diagnosis being most frequently made from one lung only per horse. Objectives To compare cytokine mRNA expressions and protein concentrations in BALF from both lungs of horses with unilateral IAD-consistent cytology. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods As part of a larger study, 250?ml saline was randomly instilled in one lung and 500?ml in the contralateral lung of 30 clinically healthy Standardbred racehorses. This procedure was repeated 72?h later, inversing the volume per lung. Cytological cut-off values for IAD diagnosis was neutrophil proportions >10% when instilling 250?ml. For these samples, mRNA expression and concentrations of IL-1?, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-? were determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Results Eleven horses had BALF with IAD- and CTL-consistent cytology from, respectively, each lung, and were enrolled in the study (22 samples). Data were not significantly influenced by the sampling day, and BALF total cell counts or cytokine concentrations were not significantly different among lungs. Relative mRNA expression of IL-1? (3.887?±?3.082; P?=?0.01) and IL-10 (3.225?±?1.710; P?=?0.005) were significantly higher in BALF of IAD- compared to CTL consistent lungs (respectively 1.408?±?1.118 and 1.488?±?1.393); and also correlated to neutrophil proportions (respectively r?=?0.54; P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.65; P?=?0.001). Conclusions Differences in cytokine mRNA expression were associated with IAD- or CTL consistent BALF cytology in the same racehorses in training. These findings suggest that specific local immune reactions or regulation within the lower airways should be considered in IAD. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Regional Animal Ethic Committee, and informed consent was provided by all horse owners.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is the most common equine emergency problem, and one of the main causes of equid deaths. The horse owners' ability to recognise colic is a critical first step in determining case outcome. Objectives To assess equine owners' knowledge and recognition of colic. Study design Online questionnaire of horse owners. Methods An online survey was designed to evaluate owners' approach to colic in the horse. The survey included questions on owner demographics, their recognition of colic (including owner's opinions of their ability to recognise colic, their approach, and their recognition of colic using case vignettes), and their knowledge of normal ranges for clinical parameters. Descriptive and chi squared statistical analysis was performed. Results The survey was completed by 1061 UK respondents. Six per cent of owners thought they could recognise all types of colic, 61% said they could recognise most cases and 30% said they could recognise some but not all cases. Owners said they would assess faecal output (73% of respondents), gastrointestinal sounds (69%), respiratory rate (62%) and heart rate (50%) in horses with suspected colic. One fifth (22%) of owners would call a vet immediately without assessing any parameters. Many respondents either did not know, or provided incorrect estimates of normal values for clinical parameters: 30.4% were ?unsure? of the normal heart rate and 35.5% gave heart rate values which were outside reference ranges; only 24.5% gave appropriate values for normal respiratory rates and only 31% gave normal temperature values. There was no statistical significance between participants' age, educational qualifications, or their experience with horses and their knowledge of normal clinical parameters. Conclusions Owners varied in their approach and ability to recognise colic, and many had significant gaps in their knowledge of normal parameters. Educational materials and/or training to assist owners could help address these issues. Ethical animal research:?The study did not involve animal research. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The questionnaire was conducted in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act, and the British Educational Research Association's Revised Ethical Guidelines for Educational Research (2004).

AB  - Musk, the dried secretion of the musk pod (sac) of adult male musk deer, has been used as traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in China and south-east Asian countries for thousands of years. Due to the anabolic steroid component in this TCM, musk preparations have been included in the list of medical products containing prohibited substances employed for doping by the State Food and Drug Administration of China. The application of musk pod formulation was claimed to be responsible for some adverse analytical findings (AAFs) in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Our preliminary study has suggested that musk ingestion did not lead to AAFs of doping control with the single dosage of 100 mg. However, the influences of musk administration in large and multi dosage are still unclear. The aim of this study is to further investigate the influences of musk administration for doping control. Wild and domestic deer musk samples were collected. The concentrations and δ13C-values of steroids in musk were analyzed. In an excretion study, 200 and 100 mg of wild and domestic deer musk samples were administrated by 29 subjects, respectively. Fluctuations in steroid profile could be observed, and the ratio of 5α-androstane-3α,17?-diol to 5?-androstane-3α,17?-diol was more sensitive than other parameters. In the IRMS test, the ??δ13C-value between endogenous reference compound and etiocholanolone was a sensitive parameter, and AAFs were obtained. It is the first time to confirm with excretion study that musk administration could lead to positive result of doping control. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Since the Osler's identification of the inherited nature of hereditary angioedema, a huge array of information was collected on pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. Over the last years, information grew fast, and mutations in different genes, in addition to C1-inhibitor, were found to be causative. All types are inherited as autosomal-dominant traits with incomplete penetrance and little or no genotype-phenotype correlation. As a result, the clinical expression is characterized by a large heterogeneity. The acknowledgement of mechanisms leading to heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype is likely to provide important information not only for a better understanding of the pathogenesis but also for therapy. Regardless of which gene is mutated, similar pathways seem to play a pivotal role, triggering the up-regulation of contact activation system/kallikrein kinin system and giving rise to an unbalanced increase of bradykinin. However, notwithstanding the increase of bradykinin in bloodstream, the phenomenon is localized and no general vascular leakage and oedema is recognized. Thus, it is conceivable that there exist one or more localized factors that stimulate the production of bradykinin, which does not become a systemically event. Uncovering of these factors may shed lights on the missing part of the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema. The present review, collecting information on pathogenesis from biochemical and genetics investigations, tries to provide a comprehensive view of the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema. This can allow for a better understanding of the disease and lead to focused investigations that can further improve our knowledge.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Aims Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibition has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improved glucose control. This Phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of a novel MetAP2 inhibitor, ZGN-1061. Methods This clinical trial included a single ascending dose (SAD) phase in healthy subjects (BMI, 23 to <30?kg/m2) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase in otherwise healthy subjects (BMI, 27 to 40?kg/m2). SAD phase doses, administered subcutaneously (SC), were 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8?mg and the MAD phase evaluated doses of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.8?mg twice weekly SC for 4?weeks. Results The SAD phase included 39 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?28; placebo, N?=?11); 90% were male and BMI was 26.4?kg/m2. ZGN-1061 was well tolerated across all doses, with the most frequent adverse events being mild headache and procedural-related irritation. There were no severe or serious adverse events. All doses of ZGN-1061 were rapidly absorbed and cleared, resulting in short duration of exposure that is anticipated to minimize potential off-drug target risks. The MAD phase included 29 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?22; placebo, N?=?7); 76% were male and BMI was 33.5?kg/m2. Safety observations were consistent with SAD findings. Efficacy measures in the MAD phase indicated trends for weight change (?1.5?kg total ZGN-1061 vs ?0.2?kg placebo) and other biomarker changes. Conclusions ZGN-1061 was well tolerated with no safety signals in all doses tested. In addition, the desired pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy observations with ZGN-1061 support evaluation in larger and longer clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Importance Region-specific pathology in proliferative diabetic retinopathy enhances our understanding and management of this disease. Background To investigate non-perfusion, neovascularization and macular oedema. Design A cross-sectional, observational, non-randomized study. Participants Consecutive 43 eyes of 27 treatment-naïve patients. Methods Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography for studying specific zones, that is, far-peripheral zone, mid-peripheral zone and central retina (cr), and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography for analysing thickness of macular layers. Main Outcome Measures Non-perfusion index (NPI) and neovascularization index (NVI) in different zones, thickness of cr, retinal nerve fibre layer, ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer plexiform layer in parafoveal regions. Results The NPI of far-periphery and NVI of mid-periphery were the highest by one-way analysis of variance testing. Ischemic retina defined as high NPI in far-periphery was significantly related to macular oedema via a binary classification approach (P?<?0.05). The ischemic retina was correlated with a decreased thickness of both retinal nerve fibre and GCL (P?<?0.05); macular oedema was correlated with increased INL thickness (P?<?0.0001). Conclusions and Relevance The region-specific correlation of NPI of far-periphery and NVI of mid-periphery, but not with central retinal thickness, suggests different pathogeneses of neovascularization and macular oedema. Retinal nerve fibre layer and GCL, both biomarkers of diabetic retinal neuronopathy, are associated with retinal ischemia, but not with macular oedema, suggesting that diabetic microangiopathy and neuronopathy possess distinct pathogenic pathways. The strong correlation between macular oedema and INL indicates that intracellular oedema is a determining factor of diabetic macular oedema.

AB  - Essentials Predicting the occurrence of portosplenomesenteric vein thrombosis (PSMVT) is difficult. We studied 72 patients with acute pancreatitis. Artificial neural networks modeling was more accurate than logistic regression in predicting PSMVT. Additional predictive factors may be incorporated into artificial neural networks. Summary Objective To construct and validate artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting the occurrence of portosplenomesenteric venous thrombosis (PSMVT) and compare the predictive ability of the ANNs with that of logistic regression. Methods The ANNs and logistic regression modeling were constructed using simple clinical and laboratory data of 72 acute pancreatitis (AP) patients. The ANNs and logistic modeling were first trained on 48 randomly chosen patients and validated on the remaining 24 patients. The accuracy and the performance characteristics were compared between these two approaches by SPSS17.0 software. Results The training set and validation set did not differ on any of the 11 variables. After training, the back propagation network training error converged to 1 ? 10?20, and it retained excellent pattern recognition ability. When the ANNs model was applied to the validation set, it revealed a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 85.7%, a positive predictive value of 77.6% and negative predictive value of 90.7%. The accuracy was 83.3%. Differences could be found between ANNs modeling and logistic regression modeling in these parameters (10.0% [95% CI, ?14.3 to 34.3%], 14.3% [95% CI, ?8.6 to 37.2%], 15.7% [95% CI, ?9.9 to 41.3%], 11.8% [95% CI, ?8.2 to 31.8%], 22.6% [95% CI, ?1.9 to 47.1%], respectively). When ANNs modeling was used to identify PSMVT, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.849 (95% CI, 0.807?0.901), which demonstrated better overall properties than logistic regression modeling (AUC = 0.716) (95% CI, 0.679?0.761). Conclusions ANNs modeling was a more accurate tool than logistic regression in predicting the occurrence of PSMVT following AP. More clinical factors or biomarkers may be incorporated into ANNs modeling to improve its predictive ability.

AB  - Summary Priapism due to sickle cell disease is a common but less well characterized complication of the disorder. It represents a ?medical emergency? with the key determinant of outcome being the duration of penile ischaemia and time to detumescence of <4 h associated with a successful treatment outcome. Management can be outpatient-based and consists of pre-emptive strategies for early stuttering attacks based on prior health education of the association between the 2 disorders, non pharmacological management, outpatient penile aspiration and irrigation with or without instillation of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists for acute episodes and secondary prophylaxis to prevent the high rates of recurrences. The evidence to recommend medical prophylaxis is sparse but based on a consensus of experts and small phase 2 or III clinical trials. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) involving normal and dysregulated erectile physiology, scavenger haemolysis and nitric oxide pathway paves way for the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in medical prophylaxis of stuttering attacks. These agents will need to be studied in multi-centre randomized phase III trials before they become standard of care. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to enhance ?sexual wellness? and prevent erectile dysfunction in this sexually vulnerable group.

AB  - This study aimed to develop and test a simultaneous acquisition and analysis pipeline for voxel-based magnetic susceptibility and morphometry (VBMSM) on a single dataset using young volunteers, elderly healthy volunteers, and an Alzheimer's disease (AD) group. 3D T1-weighted and multi-echo phase images for VBM and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) were simultaneously acquired using a magnetization-prepared spoiled turbo multiple gradient echo sequence with inversion pulse for QSM (MP-QSM). The magnitude image was split into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and was spatially normalized. The susceptibility map was reconstructed from the phase images. The segmented image and susceptibility map were compared with those obtained from conventional multiple spoiled gradient echo (mGRE) and MP-spoiled gradient echo (MP-GRE) in healthy volunteers to validate the availability of MP-QSM by numerical measurements. To assess the feasibility of the VBMSM analysis pipeline, voxel-based comparisons of susceptibility and morphometry in MP-QSM were conducted in volunteers with a bimodal age distribution, and in elderly volunteers and the AD group, using spatially normalized GM and WM volume images and a susceptibility map. GM/WM contrasts in MP-QSM, MP-GRE, and mGRE were 0.14 ± 0.011, 0.17 ± 0.015, and 0.045 ± 0.010, respectively. Segmented GM and WM volumes in the MP-QSM closely coincided with those in the MP-GRE. Region of interest analyses indicated that the mean susceptibility values in MP-QSM were completely in agreement with those in mGRE. In an evaluation of the aging effect, a significant increase and decrease in susceptibility and volume were found by VBMSM in deep GM and WM, respectively. Between the elderly volunteers and the AD group, the characteristic susceptibility and volume changes in GM and WM were observed. The proposed MP-QSM sequence makes it possible to acquire acceptable-quality images for simultaneous analysis and determine brain atrophy and susceptibility distribution without image registration by using voxel-based analyses.

AB  - Abstract Aim Colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy usually have elevated levels of inflammatory markers and experience numerous side effects from chemotherapy thereby leading to poor quality of life. Omega-3 fatty acid and microbial cell preparation (MCP) have been known to provide significant benefits in patients on chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid and MCP in quality of life, chemotherapy side effects and inflammatory markers in colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Methods A double-blind randomized study was carried out with 140 colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Subjects were separated into two groups to receive either placebo or MCP [30 billion colony-forming unit (CFUs) per sachet] at a dose of two sachets daily for 4 weeks, and omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 2 g daily for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were quality of life, side effects of chemotherapy and levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein. Results The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid improved the overall quality of life and alleviated certain side effects of chemotherapy. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid also managed to reduce the level of IL-6 (P = 0.002). There was a significant rise in the placebo group's serum TNF-α (P = 0.048) and IL-6 (P = 0.004). Conclusion The combined supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid may improve quality of life, reduce certain inflammatory biomarkers and relieve certain side effects of chemotherapy in colorectal patients on chemotherapy.

AB  - Primary urethral carcinoma (PUC) is a rare malignancy accounting for <1% of genitourinary cancers, with a predilection for men and African-Americans. The sites and histology of urethral carcinoma vary by gender and anatomical location. Squamous cell carcinoma is most common among both genders but adenocarcinomas are noted in 15?35% of cases among women. Obstructive or irritative symptoms and haematuria are common modes of presentation. Clinical evaluation includes cystourethroscopy with biopsy and examination under anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging provides a highly effective method to image the primary tumour while def?ning the potential involvement of surrounding structures. Most tumours are localised, with regional metastases to nodal sites seen in up to 30% of cases in both genders, while distant metastases at presentation are rare (0?6%), but occur in up to 40% of cases with recurrent disease. Among men, the two most important prognostic factors are disease location and stage. Low-stage tumours (T1?2) and tumours involving the fossa navicularis or the penile urethra have a better prognosis than higher stage tumours (>T2 or N+) and lesions involving the bulbomembranous urethra. In women, in addition to stage and location, the size of the tumour has also prognostic implications. While surgery and radiation therapy (RT) are of benefit in early stage disease, advanced stage PUC requires multimodal treatment strategies to optimise local control and survival. These include induction chemotherapy followed by surgery or RT and concurrent chemoradiation with or without surgery. The latter strategy has been used successfully to treat other human papillomavirus-related cancers of the vagina, cervix and anus and may be of value in achieving organ preservation. Given the rarity of PUC, prospective multi-institutional studies are needed to better define the optimal treatment approach for this disease entity.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The current prognostic biomarker of functional outcome in brachial plexus birth palsy is serial clinical examination throughout the first 6 months of age. This can delay surgical treatment and prolong parental anxiety in neonates who will recover spontaneously. A potentially superior biomarker is a volumetric proton density MRI performed at clinical presentation and within the first 12 weeks of life, providing a high spatial and contrast resolution examination in 4 minutes. METHODS Nine neonates ranging in age from 4 to 9 weeks who presented with brachial plexus birth palsy were enrolled. All subjects underwent non-sedated 3 Tesla MRI with Cube Proton Density MRI sequence at the same time as their initial clinical visit. Serial clinical examinations were conducted at routine 4 week intervals and the functional performance scores were recorded. MRI findings were divided into pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic injuries and a radiological scoring system (Shriners Radiological Score) was developed for this study. RESULTS Proton Density MRI was able to differentiate between pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic injuries. Radiological scores (Shriners Radiological Score) correlated better with functional performance at 6 months of age (P = .022) than the initial clinical examinations (Active Movement Scale P = .213 and Toronto P = .320). CONCLUSIONS Rapid non-sedated volumetric Cube Proton Density MRI protocol performed at initial clinical presentation can accurately grade severity of brachial plexus birth palsy injury and predict functional performance at 6 months of age.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Corpus callosum atrophy is a neurodegenerative biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS). Manual delineations are gold standard but subjective and labor intensive. Novel automated methods are promising but require validation. We aimed to compare the robustness of manual versus automatic corpus callosum segmentations based on FreeSurfer. METHODS Nine MS patients (6 females, age 38 ± 13 years, disease duration 7.3 ± 5.2 years) were scanned twice with repositioning using 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging on three scanners (two 1.5 T and one 3.0 T), that is, six scans/patient, on the same day. Normalized corpus callosum areas were measured independently by a junior doctor and neuroradiologist. The cross-sectional and longitudinal streams of FreeSurfer were used to segment the corpus callosum volume. RESULTS Manual measurements had high intrarater (junior doctor .96 and neuroradiologist .96) and interrater agreement (.94), by intraclass correlation coefficient (P < .001). The coefficient of variation was lowest for longitudinal FreeSurfer (.96% within scanners; 2.0% between scanners) compared to cross-sectional FreeSurfer (3.7%, P = .001; 3.8%, P = .058) and the neuroradiologist (2.3%, P = .005; 2.4%, P = .33). Longitudinal FreeSurfer was also more accurate than cross-sectional (Dice scores 83.9 ± 7.5% vs. 78.9 ± 8.4%, P < .01 relative to manual segmentations). The corpus callosum measures correlated with physical disability (longitudinal FreeSurfer r = ?.36, P < .01; neuroradiologist r = ?.32, P < .01) and cognitive disability (longitudinal FreeSurfer r = .68, P < .001; neuroradiologist r = .64, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS FreeSurfer's longitudinal stream provides corpus callosum measures with better repeatability than current manual methods and with similar clinical correlations. However, due to some limitations in accuracy, caution is warranted when using FreeSurfer with clinical data.

AB  - Abstract This study used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to investigate whole brain networks in patients with persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). We compared rsfMRI data from 38 patients with PPPD and 38 healthy controls using whole brain and region of interest analyses. We examined correlations among connectivity and clinical variables and tested the ability of a machine learning algorithm to classify subjects using rsfMRI results. Patients with PPPD showed: (a) increased connectivity of subcallosal cortex with left superior lateral occipital cortex and left middle frontal gyrus, (b) decreased connectivity of left hippocampus with bilateral central opercular cortices, left posterior opercular cortex, right insular cortex and cerebellum, and (c) decreased connectivity between right nucleus accumbens and anterior left temporal fusiform cortex. After controlling for anxiety and depression as covariates, patients with PPPD still showed decreased connectivity between left hippocampus and right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral temporal lobes, bilateral insular cortices, bilateral central opercular cortex, left parietal opercular cortex, bilateral occipital lobes and cerebellum (bilateral lobules VI and V, and left I?IV). Dizziness handicap, anxiety, and depression correlated with connectivity in clinically meaningful brain regions. The machine learning algorithm correctly classified patients and controls with a sensitivity of 78.4%, specificity of 76.9%, and area under the curve = 0.88 using 11 connectivity parameters. Patients with PPPD showed reduced connectivity among the areas involved in multisensory vestibular processing and spatial cognition, but increased connectivity in networks linking visual and emotional processing. Connectivity patterns may become an imaging biomarker of PPPD.

AB  - Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small brain hemorrhages caused by the break down or structural abnormalities of small vessels of the brain. Owing to the paramagnetic properties of blood degradation products, CMBs can be detected in vivo using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). SWI can be used not only to detect iron changes and CMBs, but also to differentiate them from calcifications, both of which may be important MR-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, SWI can be used to quantify the iron in CMBs. SWI and gradient echo (GE) imaging are the two most common methods for the detection of iron deposition and CMBs. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the number of voxels detected in the presence of a CMB on GE magnitude, phase and SWI composite images as a function of resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), TE, field strength and susceptibility using in silico experiments. Susceptibility maps were used to quantify the bias in the effective susceptibility value and to determine the optimal TE for CMB quantification. We observed a non-linear trend with susceptibility for CMB detection from the magnitude images, but a linear trend with susceptibility for CMB detection from the phase and SWI composite images. The optimal TE values for CMB quantification were found to be 3?ms at 7?T, 7?ms at 3?T and 14?ms at 1.5?T for a CMB of one voxel in diameter with an SNR of 20: 1. The simulations of signal loss and detectability were used to generate theoretical formulae for predictions. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background More sensitive troponin assays have the potential to better evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Meanwhile, they may result in avoidable diagnostic testing. Hypothesis Our aim was to determine the clinical impact of implementing a more sensitive cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay in patients with acute non-traumatic chest pain presenting to the emergency department (ED). Methods This is a pre-post cohort study. A total of 1201 consecutive patients with acute non-traumatic chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms suggestive of ACS were allocated to two groups according to the cTnI assay used. The outcomes included the ED length of stay (LOS), hospital admission rate, the use of procedures and the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30?days. Results The introduction of the more sensitive troponin assay shortened ED LOS (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.54) regarding patients discharged home directly, increased the hospital admission rate (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12-1.84), the use of echocardiography (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.22-2.06), coronary computed tomography angiography (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.04-3.06), coronary angiography (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10-2.12) and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.58-3.70) regarding patients discharged or admitted. The incidence of MACE did not decrease significantly (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.27-1.37). Conclusions The introduction of the more sensitive troponin assay appeared to result in less time spent in the ED regarding patients discharged home directly, but prompted more hospitalizations and procedures without impacting the incidence of MACE.

AB  - Abstract Cataract, the opacification of the eye lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide?it accounts for approximately 42% of all cases. The lens fibers have the highest protein content within the body, more than 35% of their wet weight. Given the eye lens pure composition of highly abundant structural proteins crystallins (up to 90%), it seems to be an ideal proteomic entity to study and might be also hypothesized to model the other protein conformational diseases. Crystallins are extremely long-lived, and there is virtually no protein turnover. This provides great opportunities for post-translational modifications (PTM) to occur and to predispose lens to the cataract formation. Despite recent progress in proteomics, the human lens proteome remains largely unknown. Mass spectrometry hold great promise to determine which crystallin modifications lead to a cataract. Quantitative analysis of PTMs at the peptide level with proteomics is a powerful bioanalytical tool for lens-tissue samples, and provides more comprehensive results. New mass spectrometry-based approaches that are being applied to lens research will be highlighted. Finally, the future directions of proteomics cataract research will be outlined. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1173?1184, 2011
