AB  - Summary Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a robust inflammatory response consisting of activated neutrophils, macrophages, astrocytes, T cells and B cells. The magnitude and timing of the immune response vary depending upon the spinal level of injury (thoracic vs. cervical), injury severity, species and strain, age at the time of injury, and mode of injury (i.e. contusion, compression or ischemic). Regardless of these factors, however, these immune responses persist after SCI and contribute to pathological and reparative processes. Throughout this chapter, we will discuss the role that individual aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses may be playing in repair or pathology after SCI. Where appropriate, current clinical therapies targeting these immune response will be highlighted.

AB  - Abstract Cataract, the opacification of the eye lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide?it accounts for approximately 42% of all cases. The lens fibers have the highest protein content within the body, more than 35% of their wet weight. Given the eye lens pure composition of highly abundant structural proteins crystallins (up to 90%), it seems to be an ideal proteomic entity to study and might be also hypothesized to model the other protein conformational diseases. Crystallins are extremely long-lived, and there is virtually no protein turnover. This provides great opportunities for post-translational modifications (PTM) to occur and to predispose lens to the cataract formation. Despite recent progress in proteomics, the human lens proteome remains largely unknown. Mass spectrometry hold great promise to determine which crystallin modifications lead to a cataract. Quantitative analysis of PTMs at the peptide level with proteomics is a powerful bioanalytical tool for lens-tissue samples, and provides more comprehensive results. New mass spectrometry-based approaches that are being applied to lens research will be highlighted. Finally, the future directions of proteomics cataract research will be outlined. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1173?1184, 2011

AB  - Summary Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin (Eze/Simva) 10/40?mg compared with doubling the statin dose upon discharge in patients taking a statin and admitted to the hospital for the investigation of a coronary event. Design:? This phase IV, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel group study enrolled 424 patients (aged?≥?18?years) hospitalised for an acute coronary event and taking a stable dose of a statin (≥?6?weeks) that could be doubled per the product label. Upon discharge from the hospital, patients were stratified by their statin dose/potency (high, medium and low) and randomised 1?:?1 to doubling of the statin dose (n?=?211) or Eze/Simva 10/40?mg (n?=?213) for 12?weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the absolute low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) value (mmol/l) at study end-point. Results:? Mean baseline LDL-C for the two treatment groups were 2.48 and 2.31?mmol/l for the Eze/Simva and statin groups respectively. At study end-point, least squares mean LDL-C values were 1.74?mmol/l in the Eze/Simva group and 2.22?mmol/l in the statin group resulting in a significant between-group difference of ?0.49?mmol/l (p?≤?0.001). Eze/Simva 10/40?mg also produced significantly lower total cholesterol (?0.49?mmol/l), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [(non-HDL-C); ?0.53?mmol/l] and apolipoprotein B (?0.14?mmol/l) values compared with doubling the statin dose (p?≤?0.001 for all). Both treatments produced similar effects on triglycerides, C-reactive protein and HDL-C; the between treatment group differences were not significant (p?≥?0.160). Significantly more patients achieved LDL-C levels <?2.5 (<?100?mg/dl; 86% vs. 72%), <?2.0 (<?77?mg/dl; 70% vs. 42%) and <?1.8?mmol/l (<?70?mg/dl; 60% vs. 31%) with Eze/Simva than statin (all p?≤?0.001). Eze/Simva was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to statin. There were no differences in the incidences of liver transaminases ≥?3???upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatine kinase ≥?10???ULN between the groups. Conclusions:? In patients taking a statin and admitted to the hospital for investigation of a coronary event, treatment with Eze/Simva 10/40?mg for 12?weeks produced greater improvements in lipids with a similar safety profile compared with doubling of the statin dose.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are intrinsically heterogeneous and comprise subpopulations that differ in their proliferation, multi-potency, and functional properties, which are commonly demonstrated by culturing hMSCs at different plating densities. The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of different subpopulations of hMSC by testing the hypothesis that the clonogenic hMSC subpopulation, which is selectively enriched in clonal density (CD) and low density (LD) culture (10 and 100 cells per square centimeter, respectively), possesses a metabolic phenotype that differs from that of hMSC in medium- or high-density (MD: 1,000 and HD: 3,000 cells per square centimeter, respectively). Cells at CD and LD conditions exhibited elevated expression of CD146 and colony forming unit-fibroblast compared with cells at MD- or HD. Global metabolic profiles revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of cell extracts showed clear distinction between LD and HD cultures, and density-dependent differences in coupling of glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Metabolic inhibitors revealed density-dependent differences in glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP generation, in glutamine metabolism, in the dependence on the pentose phosphate pathway for maintaining cellular redox state, and sensitivity to exogenous reactive oxygen species. We also show that active OXPHOS is not required for proliferation in LD culture but that OXPHOS activity increases senescence in HD culture. Together, the results revealed heterogeneity in hMSC culture exists at the level of primary metabolism. The unique metabolic characteristics of the clonogenic subpopulation suggest a novel approach for optimizing in vitro expansion of hMSCs. Stem Cells 2015;33:3368?3381

AB  - Objectives Bipolar I disorder is a disabling illness affecting 1% of people worldwide. Family and twin studies suggest that psychotic bipolar disorder (BDP) represents a homogeneous subgroup with an etiology distinct from non-psychotic bipolar disorder (BDNP) and partially shared with schizophrenia. Studies of auditory electrophysiology [e.g., paired-stimulus and oddball measured with electroencephalography (EEG)] consistently report deviations in psychotic groups (schizophrenia, BDP), yet such studies comparing BDP and BDNP are sparse and, in some cases, conflicting. Auditory EEG responses are significantly reduced in unaffected relatives of psychosis patients, suggesting that they may relate to both psychosis liability and expression. Methods While 64-sensor EEGs were recorded, age- and gender-matched samples of 70 BDP, 35 BDNP {20 with a family history of psychosis [BDNP(+)]}, and 70 psychiatrically healthy subjects were presented with typical auditory paired-stimuli and auditory oddball paradigms. Results Oddball P3b reductions were present and indistinguishable across all patient groups. P2s to paired stimuli were abnormal only in BDP and BDNP(+). Conversely, N1 reductions to stimuli in both paradigms and P3a reductions were present in both BDP and BDNP(?) groups but were absent in BDNP(+). Conclusions Although nearly all auditory neural response components studied were abnormal in BDP, BDNP abnormalities at early- and mid-latencies were moderated by family psychosis history. The relationship between psychosis expression, heritable psychosis risk, and neurophysiology within bipolar disorder, therefore, may be complex. Consideration of such clinical disease heterogeneity may be important for future investigations of the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disturbance.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite recent advances in molecular biology and genetics, the development of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is still poorly understood. Elucidation of the processes occurring in the IA wall is essential for a better understanding of IA pathophysiology. We sought to analyze the current evidence from histological, molecular and genetic studies of IA. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for articles published before Mar 1, 2019 reporting on different diagnostic markers in human IA specimens. Expression of the markers in IA wall (vs healthy arterial wall) and association with the rupture status were analyzed. The quality of the included studies and the level of the evidence for the markers were incorporated into the final data assessment. Results We included 123 studies reporting on analyses of 3476 IA (median 19 IA/study) published between 1966 and 2018. Based on microscopic, biochemical, genetic and biomechanical analyses, data on 358 diagnostic targets in the IA wall were collected. We developed a scale to distribute the diagnostic markers according to their specificity for IA or healthy arterial wall, as well as for ruptured or unruptured IA. We identified different functional pathways, which might reflect the intrinsic and extrinsic processes underlying IA pathophysiology. Conclusions Multiple histological and molecular markers and the related functional pathways contributing to the development of IA might present promising targets for future therapeutic interventions. Due to small numbers of IA samples in each study, 89% of the analyzed diagnostic markers presented with the lowest level of evidence. This underlines the need for the initiation of a multi-centric prospective histological IA register for pooled data analysis.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal brain malignancy which involves multi-gene abnormality. Unfortunately, effective therapy against GBM remains lacking. Previously, we found that NRP-1 and its downstream NRP-1/GIPC1 pathway played an important role in GBM. In our study, we further investigated the upstream signaling of NRP-1 to understand how it is regulated. First, we identified that hsa-miR-124-3p was miRNA differentially expressed in GBM and in normal brain tissues by high-throughput sequencing. Then, by dual luciferase reporter gene, we found miR-124-3p can specially bind to the 3?UTR region of the NRP-1 thus suppresses its expression. Moreover, miR-124-3p overexpression significantly inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration and tumor angiogenesis which resulted in GBM apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, putatively via NRP-1 mediated PI3K/Akt/NF?B pathways activation in GBM cells. Meanwhile, miR-124-3p overexpression also suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor angiogenesis when targeted by NRP-1 in a PDX model. Furthermore, NRP-1 mAb exerted synergistic inhibitory effects with miR-124-3p overexpression in GBM. Thus, we discovered that miR-124-3p acts as the upstream suppressor of NRP-1 which promotes GBM cell development and growth by PI3K/Akt/NF?B pathway. The miR-124-3p/NRP-1/GIPC1 pathway as a new pathway has a vital role in GBM, and it could be considered as the potential target for malignant gliomas in future.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Overcrowding is a serious and ongoing challenge in Canadian hospital emergency departments (EDs) that has been shown to have negative consequences for patient outcomes. The American College of Emergency Physicians recommends observation/short-stay units as a possible solution to alleviate this problem. However, the most recent systematic review assessing short-stay units shows that there is limited synthesized evidence to support this recommendation; it is over a decade old and has important methodologic limitations. The aim of this study was to conduct a more methodologically rigorous systematic review to update the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of short-stay units, compared with usual care, on hospital and patient outcomes. Methods A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Embase, ABI/INFOM, and EconLit databases and gray literature sources. Randomized controlled trials of ED short-stay units (stay of 72 hours or less) were compared with usual care (i.e., not provided in a short-stay unit), for adult patients. Risk-of-bias assessments were conducted. Important decision-making (gradable) outcomes were patient outcomes, quality of care, utilization of and access to services, resource use, health system?related outcomes, economic outcomes, and adverse events. Results Ten reports of five studies were included, all of which compared short-stay units with inpatient care. Studies had small sample sizes and were collectively at a moderate risk of bias. Most outcomes were only reported by one study and the remaining outcomes were reported by two to four studies. No deaths were reported. Three of the four included studies reporting length of stay found a significant reduction among short-stay unit patients, and one of the two studies reporting readmission rates found a significantly lower rate for short-stay unit patients. All four economic evaluations indicated that short-stay units were a cost-saving intervention compared to inpatient care from both hospital and health care system perspectives. Results were mixed for outcomes related to quality of care and patient satisfaction. Conclusions Insufficient evidence exists to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of short-stay units, compared with inpatient care.

AB  - Key points Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a maladaptation syndrome encountered at high altitude (HA) characterised by severe hypoxaemia that carries a higher risk of stroke and migraine and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We examined if exaggerated oxidative-inflammatory-nitrosative stress (OXINOS) and corresponding decrease in vascular nitric oxide bioavailability in patients with CMS (CMS+) is associated with impaired cerebrovascular function and adverse neurological outcome. Systemic OXINOS was markedly elevated in CMS+ compared to healthy HA (CMS?) and low-altitude controls. OXINOS was associated with blunted cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, impaired cognition and, in CMS+, symptoms of depression. These findings are the first to suggest that a physiological continuum exists for hypoxaemia-induced systemic OXINOS in HA dwellers that when excessive is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and depression, helping identify those in need of more specialist neurological assessment and targeted support. Abstract Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a maladaptation syndrome encountered at high altitude (HA) characterised by severe hypoxaemia that carries a higher risk of stroke and migraine and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The present cross-sectional study examined to what extent exaggerated systemic oxidative-inflammatory-nitrosative stress (OXINOS), defined by an increase in free radical formation and corresponding decrease in vascular nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, is associated with impaired cerebrovascular function, accelerated cognitive decline and depression in CMS. Venous blood was obtained from healthy male lowlanders (80 m, n = 17), and age- and gender-matched HA dwellers born and bred in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m) with (CMS+, n = 23) and without (CMS?, n = 14) CMS. We sampled blood for oxidative (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, HPLC), nitrosative (ozone-based chemiluminescence) and inflammatory (fluorescence) biomarkers. We employed transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reactivity. We utilised psychometric tests and validated questionnaires to assess cognition and depression. Highlanders exhibited elevated systemic OXINOS (P < 0.05 vs. lowlanders) that was especially exaggerated in the more hypoxaemic CMS+ patients (P < 0.05 vs. CMS?). OXINOS was associated with blunted cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, impaired cognition and, in CMS+, symptoms of depression. Collectively, these findings are the first to suggest that a physiological continuum exists for hypoxaemia-induced OXINOS in HA dwellers that when excessive is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and depression, helping identify those in need of specialist neurological assessment and support.

AB  - A six-month-old male entire Norfolk terrier was presented with a 3-month history of poor development, reluctance to exercise and progressive and diffuse muscle atrophy. Serum creatine kinase concentration was markedly elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging of the epaxial muscles revealed asymmetrical streaky signal changes aligned within the muscle fibres (hyperintense on T2-weighted images and short-tau inversion recovery with moderate contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images). Electromyography revealed pseudomyotonic discharges and fibrillation potentials localised at the level of the supraspinatus, epaxial muscles and tibial cranialis muscles. Muscle biopsy results were consistent with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. The dog remained stable 7 months after diagnosis with coenzyme Q10 and l-carnitine; however after that time, there was a marked deterioration and the owners elected euthanasia. This case report describes the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic and histopathological findings with immunohistochemical analysis in a Norfolk terrier with confirmed dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy, which has not been previously described in this breed.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to provide clinical evidence of the use of contrast-enhanced sonography in detecting and quantifying changes in intraneural vascularity due to median mononeuropathy. Methods Five Macaca fascicularis monkeys were exposed to 20 weeks of repetitive work to increase their risk of developing median mononeuropathy. Contrast-enhanced sonograms were obtained in 30-second increments for 7 minutes while a contrast agent was being delivered. Data were collected immediately at the conclusion of the 20-week work exposure and then again during a recovery phase approximately 3 months after the completion of work. Quantitative analysis and trend graphs were used to analyze median nerve perfusion intensity. This study also compared the use of both manual counting of pixels and semiautomatic measurement using specialized software. Results Based on the average data, maximum intensity values were identified as the best indicators of nerve hyperemia. Paired t tests demonstrated significantly higher maximum intensities in the working stage for 4 of the 5 subjects (P < .01). Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence that (1) in a controlled exposure model, a change in intraneural vascularity of the median nerve between working and recovery can be observed; (2) this vascular change can be measured using an objective technique that quantifies the intensity of vascularity; and (3) contrast-enhanced sonography may improve the ability to reliably capture and measure low-flow microvascularity.

AB  - Abstract In this review we critically summarize the evidence base and the progress to date regarding the genomic basis of periodontal disease and tooth morbidity (ie, dental caries and tooth loss), and discuss future applications and research directions in the context of precision oral health and care. Evidence for these oral/dental traits from genome-wide association studies first emerged less than a decade ago. Basic and translational research activities in this domain are now under way by multiple groups around the world. Key departure points in the oral health genomics discourse are: (a) some heritable variation exists for periodontal and dental diseases; (b) the environmental component (eg, social determinants of health and behavioral risk factors) has a major influence on the population distribution but probably interacts with factors of innate susceptibility at the person-level; (c) sizeable, multi-ethnic, well-characterized samples or cohorts with high-quality measures on oral health outcomes and genomics information are required to make decisive discoveries; (d) challenges remain in the measurement of oral health and disease, with current periodontitis and dental caries traits capturing only a part of the health-disease continuum, and are little or not informed by the underlying biology; (e) the substantial individual heterogeneity that exists in the clinical presentation and lifetime trajectory of oral disease can be identified and leveraged in a precision medicine framework or, if unappreciated, can hamper translational efforts. In this review we discuss how composite or biologically informed traits may offer improvements over clinically defined ones for the genomic interrogation of oral diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the results of genome-wide association studies for the development and testing of a genetic risk score for severe periodontitis. We conclude that exciting opportunities lie ahead for improvements in the oral health of individual patients and populations via advances in our understanding of the genomic basis of oral health and disease. The pace of new discoveries and their equitable translation to practice will largely depend on investments in the education and training of the oral health care workforce, basic and population research, and sustained collaborative efforts..

AB  - Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MR technique that depicts and quantifies magnetic susceptibility sources. Mapping iron, the dominant susceptibility source in the brain, has many important clinical applications. Herein, we review QSM applications in the diagnosis, medical management, and surgical treatment of disease. To assist in early disease diagnosis, QSM can identify elevated iron levels in the motor cortex of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, in the globus pallidus, putamen, and caudate of Huntington's disease patients, and in the basal ganglia of Wilson's disease patients. Additionally, QSM can distinguish between hemorrhage and calcification, which could prove useful in tumor subclassification, and can measure microbleeds in traumatic brain injury patients. In guiding medical management, QSM can be used to monitor iron chelation therapy in PD patients, to monitor smoldering inflammation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions after the blood?brain barrier (BBB) seals, to monitor active inflammation of MS lesions before the BBB seals without using gadolinium, and to monitor hematoma volume in intracerebral hemorrhage. QSM can also guide neurosurgical treatment. Neurosurgeons require accurate depiction of the subthalamic nucleus, a tiny deep gray matter nucleus, prior to inserting deep brain stimulation electrodes into the brains of PD patients. QSM is arguably the best imaging tool for depiction of the subthalamic nucleus. Finally, we discuss future directions, including bone QSM, cardiac QSM, and using QSM to map cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Male infertility is a multi-factorial disorder, and identification of its etiology in an individual is critical for treatment. Systematically elucidating the underlying genetic causes (chromosomal and Yq microdeletion) and factors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), which contribute to sperm DNA damage, may help to reduce the number of men with idiopathic infertility and provide them with the most suitable therapeutics and counseling. This study was done to comprehensively investigate genetic and oxidative stress factors that might be the etiology of a large percentage of men with idiopathic infertility. One hundred twelve infertile men and 76 fertile controls were screened for chromosomal aberrations and Yq microdeletions. ROS, TAC, and sperm DNA damage were assessed in cytogenetically normal, non-azoospermic men with intact Y chromosome (n?=?93). ROS was assessed in neat and washed semen by chemiluminescence; seminal TAC with a commercially available kit; and sperm DNA damage by the comet assay. Two men had cytogenetic abnormalities and seven men harbored Yq microdeletions. ROS levels in neat and washed semen of infertile men were significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Infertile men had significantly lower (P?<?0.01) TAC levels (1.79?mM), whereas sperm DNA fragmentation in infertile men was significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Genetic factors and oxidative stress cumulatively account for large number of idiopathic infertile cases. Unlike, genetic causes, which cannot be cured, timely identification and management of oxidative stress may help to reverse/reduce the effects on induced DNA damage, and improve the outcomes for infertile males.

AB  - Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a wide range of disabilities that cause life-long cognitive impairment and social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Early diagnosis and medical intervention are important for improving the life quality of autistic patients. However, in the current practice, diagnosis often has to be delayed until the behavioral symptoms become evident during childhood. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques for identifying high-risk ASD infants at as early as six months after birth. This is based on the observation that ASD-induced abnormalities in white matter (WM) tracts and whole-brain connectivity have already started to appear within 24 months after birth. In particular, we propose a novel multikernel support vector machine classification framework by using the connectivity features gathered from WM connectivity networks, which are generated via multiscale regions of interest (ROIs) and multiple diffusion statistics such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and average fiber length. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 76% and an area of 0.80 under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), in comparison to the accuracy of 70% and the AUC of 70% provided by the best single-parameter single-scale network. The improvement in accuracy is mainly due to the complementary information provided by multiparameter multiscale networks. In addition, our framework also provides the potential imaging connectomic markers and an objective means for early ASD diagnosis. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4880?4896, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Progressive knee joint degeneration occurs following removal of a torn meniscus. However, there is significant variability in the rate of development of post-meniscectomy osteoarthritis (OA). While there is no current consensus on the risk factors for development of knee OA in patients with meniscus tears, it is likely that both biological and biomechanical factors play critical roles. In this perspective paper, we review the mechanical and the biological predictors of the response of the knee to partial meniscectomy. We review the role of patient-based studies, in vivo animal models, cadaveric models, bioreactor systems, and statistically augmented computational models for the study of meniscus function and post-meniscectomy OA, providing insight into the important interplay between biomechanical and biologic factors. We then discuss the clinical translation of these concepts for ?biologic augmentation? of meniscus healing and meniscus replacement. Ultimately, collaborative studies between engineers, biologists, and clinicians is the optimal way to improve our understanding of meniscus pathology and response to injury and/or disease, and to facilitate effective translation of laboratory findings to improved treatments for our patients. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.
