AB  - Abstract The integration of liquid chromatography?mass spectrometry (LC?MS) with derivatization is a relatively new and unique strategy that could add value and could enhance the capabilities of LC?MS-based technologies. The derivatization process could be carried out in various analytical steps, for example, sampling, storage, sample preparation, HPLC separation, and MS detection. This review presents an overview of derivatization-based LC?MS strategy over the past 10 years and covers both the general principles and applications in the fields of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis, biomarker and metabolomic research, environmental analysis, and food-safety evaluation. The underlying mechanisms and theories for derivative reagent selection are summarized and highlighted to guide future studies. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1143?1172, 2011

AB  - Purpose Water exchange exists between different neuronal compartments of brain tissue but is often ignored in most diffusion models. The goal of the current study was to demonstrate the dependence of diffusion measurements on echo time (TE) in the human brain and to investigate the underlying effects of myelin water exchange. Methods Five healthy subjects were examined with single-shot pulsed-gradient spin-echo echo-planar imaging with fixed duration (δ) and separation (?) of diffusion gradient pulses and a set of varying TEs. The effects of water exchange and intrinsic T2 difference in cellular environments were investigated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results Both in vivo measurements and simulations showed that fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) had positive correlations with TE, while radial diffusivity (RD) showed a negative correlation, which is consistent with a previous study. The simulation results further indicated the sensitivity of TE dependence to the change of g-ratio. Conclusion The exchange between myelin and intra/extra-axonal water pools often plays a non-negligible role in the observed TE dependence of diffusion parameters, which may accompany or alter the effect of intrinsic T2 in causing such dependence. The TE dependence may potentially serve as a biomarker for demyelination processes (e.g., in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease).

AB  - Background Over 550,000 sinus surgeries are performed annually in the United States on patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Although the results of sinus surgery vary widely, no known genetic factor has been identified to predict surgical outcomes. The bitter taste receptor T2R38 has recently been demonstrated to regulate upper airway innate defense and may affect patient responses to therapy. Our goal was to determine whether TAS2R38 genetics predicts outcomes in CRS patients following sinus surgery. Methods A prospective study of patients undergoing sinus surgery evaluating postoperative outcomes through the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). Patients were genotyped for TAS2R38. Results A total of 123 patients with CRS were initially analyzed; 82 patients showed nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and 41 patients were without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Six months after surgery, the overall SNOT-22 improvement was 25 ± 23 points. The TAS2R38 genotype was found to significantly correlate with surgical outcomes in patients without polyps; homozygotes for the functional receptor had a mean improvement of 38 ± 21, whereas heterozygotes or homozygotes for the nonfunctional receptor had a mean improvement of 12 ± 22 (p = 0.006). This result was confirmed with a multivariate regression that incorporated further patients with 1-month and 3-month scores (n = 207). Conclusion In patients undergoing sinus surgery for CRS, we have identified a genetic polymorphism that predicts variability in quality of life improvement following surgery at 6 months in nonpolypoid CRS. This is the first genetic polymorphism identified that has demonstrated to predict surgical outcome for a select group of CRS patients.

AB  - Abstract On May 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized sepsis as a global health priority by adopting a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of this deadly disease. While it has long been known that sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic inflammatory response, pivotal observations based on clinical flow cytometry indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a resultant, some septic patients enter a stage of protracted immunosuppression. This paved the way for immunostimulation approaches in sepsis. Clinical flow cytometry permitted this evolution by drawing a new picture of pathophysiology and reshaping immune trajectories in patients. Additional information from cytometry by time of flight mass cytometry and other high-dimensional flow cytometry platform should rapidly enrich our understanding of this complex disease. This review reports on landmarks of clinical flow cytometry in sepsis and how this single-cell analysis technique permitted to breach the wall of decades of unfruitful anti-inflammatory-based clinical trials in sepsis. ? 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Abstract Aim To report a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial examining if a symptom self-management programme helps patients with acute myocardial infarction self-manage their physical and psychological symptoms. Background In addition to physical conditions, people with acute myocardial infarction often experience psychological symptoms. However, there is limited empirical evidence on how to help individuals self-manage these psychological symptoms. Design A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial is proposed. Methods A convenience sample of 90 will be recruited. Eligible participants will be adult patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: Intervention 1 and standard care (n = 30), Intervention 2 and standard care (n = 30) and standard care alone (n = 30). Data will be collected by self-reported questionnaires, physiological measures and open-ended questions. Quantitative data will be analysed by descriptive statistics, t-test, analysis of covariance and repeated measures analysis of variance. Open-ended questions will be analysed by content analysis. Discussion This study will identify a potentially efficacious symptom self-management programme for patients with acute myocardial infarction. If the efficacy of the programme is demonstrated, the programme can be integrated into hospital services to improve patient care. A new teaching method (virtual reality?based teaching) and new teaching materials (virtual reality videos and relaxation videos) derived from this study can be offered to patients. Future research with larger samples and multi-centre recruitment can be undertaken to further test the efficacy of the interventions.

AB  - Recently, a significant epigenetic component in the pathology of suicide has been realized. Here we investigate candidate functional SNPs in epigenetic-regulatory genes, DNMT1 and DNMT3B, for association with suicide attempt (SA) among patients with co-existing psychiatric illness. In addition, global DNA methylation levels [5-methyl cytosine (5-mC%)] between SA and psychiatric controls were quantified using the Methylflash Methylated DNA Quantification Kit. DNA was obtained from blood of 79 suicide attempters and 80 non-attempters, assessed for DSM-IV Axis I disorders. Functional SNPs were selected for each gene (DNMT1; n?=?7, DNMT3B; n?=?10), and genotyped. A SNP (rs2424932) residing in the 3? UTR of the DNMT3B gene was associated with SA compared with a non-attempter control group (P?=?0.001; Chi-squared test, Bonferroni adjusted P value?=?0.02). Moreover, haplotype analysis identified a DNMT3B haplotype which differed between cases and controls, however this association did not hold after Bonferroni correction (P?=?0.01, Bonferroni adjusted P value?=?0.56). Global methylation analysis showed that psychiatric patients with a history of SA had significantly higher levels of global DNA methylation compared with controls (P?=?0.018, Student's t-test). In conclusion, this is the first report investigating polymorphisms in DNMT genes and global DNA methylation quantification in SA risk. Preliminary findings suggest that allelic variability in DNMT3B may be relevant to the underlying diathesis for suicidal acts and our findings support the hypothesis that aberrant DNA methylation profiles may contribute to the biology of suicidal acts. Thus, analysis of global DNA hypermethylation in blood may represent a biomarker for increased SA risk in psychiatric patients.

AB  - Background Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an inherited multi-systemic disease involving the central nervous system (CNS) and is consequently characterized by a range of cognitive impairments. However, whether this cognitive profile progresses over time is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to longitudinally assess a DM1 sample, in order to compare, for the first time, this progression with that of a control group. Clinical and socio-demographic predictive factors potentially implicated in this possible decline are analysed. Method Seventy-five DM1 patients with childhood, juvenile, adult, and late-onset, and 54 control participants were re-assessed in an 11-year follow-up with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. The analyses employed were mixed ANOVA for repeated measures to test intergroup comparisons over time and multiple linear regression for predictive variable analysis. Results Myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients significantly worsened in visuospatial/visuoconstructive abilities and visual memory compared with controls. Multiple linear regression revealed that progression of cognitive impairment measured by copy of the Rey?Osterrieth complex figure was predicted by muscular impairment, whilst on the block design test age predicted the change with a cut-off at 31 years of age. Discussion A domain-specific progressive cognitive decline was found in DM1, with visuospatial/visuoconstructive abilities showing the greatest vulnerability to the passage of time. In addition to important clinical implications, these results suggest the need for the scientific community to delve deeper into the potential mechanisms underlying early cognitive decline in this population.

AB  - Abstract A growing body of research has documented associations between adverse childhood environments and DNA methylation, highlighting epigenetic processes as potential mechanisms through which early external contexts influence health across the life course. The present study tested a complementary hypothesis: indicators of children's early internal, biological, and behavioral responses to stressful challenges may also be linked to stable patterns of DNA methylation later in life. Children's autonomic nervous system reactivity, temperament, and mental health symptoms were prospectively assessed from infancy through early childhood, and principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to derive composites of biological and behavioral reactivity. Buccal epithelial cells were collected from participants at 15 and 18 years of age. Findings revealed an association between early life biobehavioral inhibition/disinhibition and DNA methylation across many genes. Notably, reactive, inhibited children were found to have decreased DNA methylation of the DLX5 and IGF2 genes at both time points, as compared to non-reactive, disinhibited children. Results of the present study are provisional but suggest that the gene's profile of DNA methylation may constitute a biomarker of normative or potentially pathological differences in reactivity. Overall, findings provide a foundation for future research to explore relations among epigenetic processes and differences in both individual-level biobehavioral risk and qualities of the early, external childhood environment.

AB  - The Ehlers?Danlos syndromes (EDSs) comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases, characterized by fragility of the soft connective tissues and widespread manifestations in skin, ligaments, joints, blood vessels and internal organs. The clinical spectrum varies from mild skin and joint hyperlaxity to severe physical disability and life-threatening vascular complications. The current Villefranche classification recognizes six subtypes, most of which are linked to mutations in genes encoding fibrillar collagens or enzymes involved in post-translational modification of these proteins. Mutations in type V and type III collagen cause classic or vascular EDS respectively, while mutations involving the processing of type I collagen are involved in the kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasis and dermatosparaxis type of EDS. Establishing the correct EDS subtype has important implications for genetic counseling and management and is supported by specific biochemical and molecular investigations. Over the last years, several new EDS variants have been characterized which call for a refinement of the Villefranche classification. Moreover, the study of these diseases has brought new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EDS by implicating genetic defects in the biosynthesis of other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, such as proteoglycans and tenascin-X, or genetic defects in molecules involved in intracellular trafficking, secretion and assembly of ECM proteins.

AB  - Abstract l-glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and has a central role in a variety of brain functions. The termination of glutamate neurotransmission by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) is essential to maintain glutamate concentration low in extracellular space and avoid excitotoxicity. EAAT2/GLT-1, being the most abundant subtype of glutamate transporter in the CNS, plays a key role in regulation of glutamate transmission. Dysfunction of EAAT2 has been correlated with various pathologies such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, among others. Therefore, activators of the function or enhancers of the expression of EAAT2/GLT-1 could serve as a potential therapy for these conditions. Translational activators of EAAT2/GLT-1, such as ceftriaxone and LDN/OSU-0212320, have been described to have significant protective effects in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and epilepsy. In addition, pharmacological activators of the activity of EAAT2/GLT-1 have been explored for decades and are currently emerging as promising tools for neuroprotection, having potential advantages over expression activators. This review describes the current status of the search for EAAT2/GLT-1 activators and addresses challenges and limitations that this approach might encounter. Termination of glutamate neurotransmission by glutamate transporter EAAT2 is essential to maintain homeostasis in the brain and to avoid excitotoxicity. Dysfunction of EAAT2 has been correlated with various neurological pathologies. Therefore, activators of the function or enhancers of the expression of EAAT2 (green arrows) could serve as a potential therapy for these conditions. This review describes the current status of the search for EAAT2 activators and addresses challenges and limitations of this approach.

AB  - Abstract Background Adenosine kinase deficiency is a recently described defect affecting methionine metabolism with a severe clinical phenotype comprising mainly neurological and hepatic impairment and dysmorphism. Methods Clinical data of 11 additional patients from eight families with adenosine kinase deficiency were gathered through a retrospective questionnaire. Two liver biopsies of one patient were systematically evaluated. Results The main clinical symptoms are mild to severe liver dysfunction with neonatal onset, muscular hypotonia, global developmental retardation and dysmorphism (especially frontal bossing). Hepatic involvement is not a constant finding. Most patients have epilepsy and recurrent hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Major biochemical findings are intermittent hypermethioninemia, increased S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in plasma and increased adenosine in urine. S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine are the most reliable biochemical markers. The major histological finding was pronounced microvesicular hepatic steatosis. Therapeutic trials with a methionine restricted diet indicate a potential beneficial effect on biochemical and clinical parameters in four patients and hyperinsulinism was responsive to diazoxide in two patients. Conclusion Adenosine kinase deficiency is a severe inborn error at the cross-road of methionine and adenosine metabolism that mainly causes dysmorphism, brain and liver symptoms, but also recurrent hypoglycemia. The clinical phenotype varies from an exclusively neurological to a multi-organ manifestation. Methionine-restricted diet should be considered as a therapeutic option.

AB  - Summary During recent years, inappropriate antifungal use has contributed to the global increase in antifungal resistance and has played a role in the shift in the aetiology of invasive fungal infections. Moreover, overuse of antifungals may also lead to higher toxicity associated with unnecessary medication exposure and to increased healthcare costs. Antifungal stewardship (AFS) programmes consist of multidisciplinary interventions, led by specialists in infectious disease, microbiology and pharmacy that cooperate and communicate with the major prescribing departments in order to optimise antifungal therapies evaluating the indication, dose, streamlining and duration. Herein, we review the available evidence for the use of AFS and their impact on health economics. We also describe our AFS program, the successive steps we followed and the main difficulties we found.
