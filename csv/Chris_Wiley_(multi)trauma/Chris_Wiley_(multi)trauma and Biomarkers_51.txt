AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - Abstract Background To explore the similar and different pathogenesis between non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Methods This study used bioinformatics methods, including functional enrichment analysis, compared the topological features of SCLC and NSCLC in the human protein interaction network in a system aspect, and analyzed the highly intense modules from an integrated network. Results This study included 5082 and 2781 significantly different expression genes for NSCLC and SCLC, respectively. The differently expressed genes of NSCLC are mainly distributed in the extracellular region and synapse. By contrast, the genes of SCLC are located in the organelle, macromolecular complex, membrane-enclosed lumen, cell part, envelope, and synapse. Compared with SCLC, the differently expressed genes of NSCLC act in the biological regulation, multicellular organismal process, and viral reproduction and locomotion, which show that NSCLC is more likely to cause a wide range of cancer cell proliferation and virus infection than SCLC. The network topological properties of SCLC and NSCLC are similar, except the average shortest path length, which indicates that most of the genes of the two lung cancers play a similar function in the entire body. The commonly expressed genes show that all of the genes in the module may also cause NSCLC and SCLC, simultaneously. Conclusions The proteins in module will involve the same or similar biological functions and the interactions among them induce the occurrence of lung cancer. Moreover, a potential biomarker of SCLC is the interaction between APIP and apoptotic protease activating factor (APAF)1, which share a common module.

AB  - Abstract Hair cortisol (CORT) is a biomarker of chronic stress via long-term alterations in hypothalamus?pituitary?adrenal axis activity. Relationships to perceived stress measures, however, have rarely been specifically investigated. A diverse sample of 135 adults participated in a study assessing relationships between chronic stress indicator CORT to perceived stress and health indicators. CORT was not correlated to single perceived domain indices but with a global stress composite. Differences in objective and subjective measures were found for sociodemographics: racial/ethnic identity, sex and socioeconomic status (SES). Race by SES interactions predicted both CORT and perceived stress, but produced a complex and partially unanticipated pattern of results. For minorities, low and high SES showed the highest CORT, with mid-SES showing the lowest CORT; there was little change in perceived stress at all levels of SES. For non-minorities, mid-SES showed the highest CORT, with decreases in both CORT and perceived stress in high SES. The unanticipated findings of deleterious outcomes for high SES minorities highlight the importance of investigating potential stressors and moderators, including perceived discrimination and social identity. Moreover, these results suggest that CORT may not always correlate with single stress indices but may provide a global assessment of chronic stress, with implications for the allostatic load literature.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic osteolytic disease that shares pathogenic inflammatory features with other conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation. A hallmark of PD is inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. Myeloid cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages (Mac), are essential players in PD by control of gingival biofilm pathogenicity, activation of adaptive immunity, as well as nonresolving inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Despite mounting evidence of significant innate immune implications to PD progression and healing after therapy, myeloid cell markers and targets for immune modulation have not been validated for clinical use. The remarkable plasticity of monocytes/Mac in response to local activation factors enables these cells to play central roles in inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis and provides opportunities for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery for management of chronic inflammatory conditions, including osteolytic diseases such as PD and arthritis. Along a wide spectrum of activation states ranging from proinflammatory to pro-resolving, Macs respond to environmental changes in a site-specific manner in virtually all tissues. This review summarizes the existing evidence on Mac immunomodulation therapies for osteolytic diseases in the broader context of conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation, and discusses osteoimmune implications of Macs in PD.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Ischemia-reperfusion injury impacts early liver graft function. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) as early as at reperfusion has shown to predict in-hospital complications, but its impact on vascular complications and long-term outcomes is not ascertained. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on all consecutive patients transplanted during a 6-year period to define significant early systemic inflammatory response (ESIR). The main end-point was 3-year graft survival. Significant ESIR was defined according to IL-6 level at reperfusion on an exploratory set of 121 patients and validated on an independent cohort (n = 153). Results Significant ESIR was defined as IL-6 at reperfusion >1000 ng/mL in the exploratory cohort. Three-year graft and overall survival were lower in patients with ESIR in the determination set (P = 0.001 and 0.045, respectively). This was confirmed in the validation set (P = 0.045 and 0.027). In patients with high cytolysis, IL-6 identified patients at risk for arterial thrombosis. The main determinants for IL-6 level were intragraft lactate level, cold ischemia time, and anhepatic phase duration (P = 0.005). IL-6 level independently predicted graft survival (P = 0.0003). Conclusions IL-6 at reperfusion is a valid biomarker to predict long-term survival. Furthermore, it helps the interpretation of cytolysis in the prediction of early vascular complications.

AB  - Abstract The study was aimed to explore the functions of circulating fibrocytes (CFs) on injury repair in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) mice model and its clinical value as a biomarker for ALI/ARDS. ALI/ARDS mice model was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of ALI/ARDS model and flow cytometry was used to measure CFs defined as cells positive for CD45 and collagen-1. Histological changes of lung tissues were evaluated by H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. The correlations of CFs counts with damnification of lung tissue and the severity of pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of collagen-1. ELISA was applied to determine cytokine CXCL12 concentration. Clinical relevance between CFs and ALI/ARDS was investigated. The greater number of CFs in the ALI/ARDS group implied higher degree of lung injury and more severe pulmonary fibrosis. The protein expression of collagen-1 and concentration of cytokine CXCL12 in ALI/ARDS group were higher than that in control group. Clinical and prognostic analysis revealed the higher injury degree and death rates in ALI/ARDS group than those in control group, and identified a greater severity and mortality for patients with ARDS than those with ALI. ROC curve analysis indicated the counts of CFs greater than 5.85% can predict death rates with AUC?=?0.928. CFs had an inhibitory effect on injury repair in ALI/ARDS mice model. This might be unfavorable as a clinical marker for progression of ALI/ARDS.

AB  - Abstract Objective MRI is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex post-processing or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time-efficient simultaneous T1/T2-relaxometry and proton density mapping, in multiple sclerosis. Methods Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3 Tesla MRI; ex vivo in three multiple sclerosis brain samples and in vivo in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex-matched healthy controls, with scan-rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Results Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin-related stains (proteolipid protein-immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole-brain and normal-appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow-up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability. Interpretation Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal-appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Since the technique is fast with automatic post-processing and FDA/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination.

AB  - Abstract Lanthanides, once termed rare-earth elements, are not as sparce in the environment as their traditional name suggests. Mean litospheric concentrations are in fact comparable to the physiologically fundamental elements such as iodine, cobalt, and selenium. Recent advances in medical technology have resulted in accumulation of lanthanides presenting potential exposure to both our central and peripheral nervous systems. Extensive and detailed studies on these peculiar active metals in the context of their influence on neural functions are therefore urgently required. Almost all neurochemical effects of trivalent lanthanide ions appear to result from the similarity of their radii to the key signaling ion calcium. Lanthanides, especially La3+ and Gd3+ block different types of calcium, potassium, and sodium channels in human and animal neurons, regulate neurotransmitter turnover and release, as well as synaptic activity. Lanthanides also act as modulators of several ionotropic receptors, e.g., GABA, NMDA, and kainate and can also affect numerous signaling mechanisms including NF-?B and apoptotic-related endoplasmic reticulum IRE1-XBP1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways. Several lanthanide ions may cause oxidative neuronal injuries and functional impairment by promoting reactive oxygen species production. However, cerium and yttrium oxides have some unique and promising neuroprotective properties, being able to decrease free radical cell injury and even alleviate motor impairment and cognitive function in animal models of multiple sclerosis and mild traumatic brain damage, respectively. In conclusion, lanthanides affect various neurophysiological processes, altering a large spectrum of brain functions. Thus, a deeper understanding of their potential mechanistic roles during disease and as therapeutic agents requires urgent elucidation.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of all deaths in the United States and is the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged ≥65 years. Although other major causes of death have been on the decrease, deaths because of AD have been rising dramatically. Between 2000 and 2008 (preliminary data), heart disease deaths decreased by 13%, stroke deaths by 20%, and prostate cancer-related deaths by 8%, whereas deaths because of AD increased by 66%. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD; approximately 200,000 people aged <65 years with AD comprise the younger-onset AD population. Every 69 seconds, someone in America develops AD; by 2050, the time is expected to accelerate to every 33 seconds. Over the coming decades, the baby boom population is projected to add 10 million people to these numbers. In 2050, the incidence of AD is expected to approach nearly a million people per year, with a total estimated prevalence of 11 to 16 million people. Dramatic increases in the numbers of ?oldest-old? (those aged ≥85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups will also significantly affect the numbers of people living with AD. In 2010, nearly 15 million family and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $202 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are almost 3 times higher than for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments in 2011 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people aged ≥65years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $183 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health effect of AD, including incidence and prevalence, mortality, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general. The report also examines the current state of AD detection and diagnosis, focusing on the benefits of early detection and the factors that present challenges to accurate diagnosis.
