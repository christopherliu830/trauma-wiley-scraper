AB  - Aims Near-infrared spectroscopy has the potential for aiding the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the evidence from observational studies regarding the use of near-infrared spectroscopy in patients with major depressive disorder and to identify the characteristic pattern of prefrontal lobe activity in major depressive disorder. Methods medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched in December 2013. All case?control studies were included. The quality of evidence was examined using the Newcastle?Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The primary outcome measures were the mean oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin alterations of the cerebral cortex during cognitive activation periods. The standard mean difference for the overall pooled effects across the included studies was estimated using random or fixed effect models. The primary outcome measures were included in the meta-analysis. Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies (n?=?692 participants) were included in the analysis of the mean oxygenated hemoglobin alterations; the pooled mean standardized difference was ?0.74 (95% confidence interval, ?0.97 to ?0.52), indicating that patients with major depressive disorder were associated with attenuated increase in oxygenated hemoglobin during cognitive activation in the prefrontal regions compared to healthy controls. Five studies (n?=?668 participants) were included in the analysis of mean deoxygenated-hemoglobin changes; the pooled standardized mean difference was 0.18 (95% confidence interval, ?0.20 to 0.56). Conclusions Using near-infrared spectroscopy measurements, we observed that compared to healthy subjects, patients with major depressive disorder had significantly lower prefrontal activation during cognitive tasks.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in infants and children with acute lung injury (ALI), and to investigate associations between BNP levels and clinical outcome. Design Prospective observational study. Subjects After informed consent, plasma was collected from 48 pediatric patients on day 1 of ALI. Methodology Plasma BNP levels were measured by immunoassay on day 1 of ALI in 48 pediatric patients. Associations between BNP levels and outcome were determined. Results The mean PaO2/FiO2 at the onset of ALI was 155 (±74) and BNP values ranged from 5 to 2,060?pg/ml with a mean of 109 (±311). BNP levels were inversely correlated with ventilator-free days (Spearman rho ?0.30, P?=?0.04), and positively correlated with exhaled tidal volume (Spearman rho 0.44, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were higher in patients receiving inotropic support (n?=?12) than patients not receiving inotropic support (n?=?33, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were correlated with PRISM III scores (Spearman rho 0.55, P?<?0.001) and PELOD scores (Spearman rho 0.4, P?=?0.006). Mortality for the cohort was 15%. BNP levels were higher in non-survivors (n?=?7) than survivors (n?=?41, P?=?0.055). Conclusions BNP levels are elevated in children with ALI/ARDS early in the disease course, and increased levels are associated with worse clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract Vulnerability and resilience are intertwined yet unraveling constructs in the allostatic load literature centered on stress-disease pathways. In examining this paradigm shift, this chapter focuses on allostatic load indices of multisystemic physiological dysregulations among marginalized populations. Social inequalities reviewed include early adversity, socioeconomic health gradients, race/ethnicity and discrimination, Brazil's shifting economy, the struggles of North American and Australian Indigenous peoples, and finally sex/gender diversity and sexual orientation as key determinants of allostatic load. We then present innovative biochemical, neurological, and cognitive approaches for future empirical consideration, with conclusions centered on clinical and social policy implications. In espousing a developmental psychopathology approach that emphasizes causal processes, developmental mechanisms, and diverse conceptualizations of health, we highlight allostatic load studies that focus on resilient pathways and how these trajectories can be promoted to protect populations otherwise considered vulnerable.

AB  - ABSTRACT The majority of periprosthetic joint infections occur shortly after primary joint replacement (<3 months) and require the removal of all implant components for the treatment period (~4 months). A clinically relevant animal model of periprosthetic infection should, therefore, establish an infection with implant components in place. Here, we describe a joint replacement model in the rat with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium components inoculated at the time of surgery by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which is one of the main causative microorganisms of periprosthetic joint infections. We monitored the animals for 4 weeks by measuring gait, weight-bearing symmetry, von Frey testing, and micro-CT as our primary endpoint analyses. We also assessed the infection ex vivo using colony counts on the implant surfaces and histology of the surrounding tissues. The results confirmed the presence of a local infection for 4 weeks with osteolysis, loosening of the implants, and clinical infection indicators such as redness, swelling, and increased temperature. The utility of specific gait analysis parameters, especially temporal symmetry, hindlimb duty factor imbalance, and phase dispersion was identified in this model for assessing the longitudinal progression of the infection, and these metrics correlated with weight-bearing asymmetry. We propose to use this model to study the efficacy of using different local delivery regimens of antimicrobials on addressing periprosthetic joint infections. Statement of clinical significance: We have established a preclinical joint surgery model, in which postoperative recovery can be monitored over a multi-week course by assessing gait, weight-bearing, and allodynia. This model can be used to study the efficacy of different combinations of implant materials and medication regimens. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
