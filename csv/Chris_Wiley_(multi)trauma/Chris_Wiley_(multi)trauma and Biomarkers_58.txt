AB  - Summary The discipline of psychiatric epidemiology is, at its most basic level, the study of the patterns of mental disorders. Recently, the scope of the field has greatly expanded and now includes detailed examinations of the natural history of psychiatric disorders, genetic and epigenetic risk factors, the relationships between physical and mental disorders, the psychological impact of traumatic events, and studies of the use and outcomes of mental health treatments. Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend divided the growth of psychiatric epidemiologic research into three periods, or ?generations.? This chapter discusses the key studies and prevalence rates from each of these periods. It further describes the largest third-generation studies, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study, the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCSR), and the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, a suite of surveys conducted throughout the world using comparable sampling and diagnostic instruments.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder resulting from a self-destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells. The complete proteome of the human pancreas, where both the dysfunctional beta cells and their proximal environment co-exist, remains unknown. Here, we used TMT10-based isobaric labeling and multidimensional LC-MS/MS to quantitatively profile the differences between pancreatic head region tissues from T1D (N = 5) and healthy subjects (N = 5). Among the 5357 (1% false discovery rate) confidently identified proteins, 145 showed statistically significant dysregulation between T1D and healthy subjects. The differentially expressed pancreatic proteome supports the growing notion of a potential role for exocrine pancreas involvement in T1D. This study also demonstrates the utility for this approach to analyze dysregulated proteins as a means to investigate islet biology, pancreatic pathology and T1D pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Dysfunction of physiological regulation systems may underlie the disrupted emotional and self-regulatory processes among people with substance use disorder (SUD). This paper reviews evidence as to whether or not respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), as a psychophysiological index of emotional regulation, could provide useful information in treatment?outcome research to provide insights into recovery processes. Methods We reviewed the use of RSA in clinical research and studies on SUD treatment. Search terms for the review of RSA in clinical research included respiratory sinus arrhythmia, heart rate variability, vagal, cardiac vagal control, psychophysiology, intervention, treatment, mindfulness, mind?body, mental health, substance use, chemical dependence, regulation and emotion regulation. For the review of RSA in intervention studies, we included only those that provided adequate description of psychophysiological methods, and examined RSA in the context of an intervention study. Results RSA appears to be able to provide an index of self-regulatory capacity; however, it has been little used in either intervention or treatment research. Of the four intervention studies included in this review, all were mindfulness-based interventions. Two studies were with substance-using samples, and both showed pre?post increases in RSA and related improved substance use outcomes. Two of the three studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and both showed significant increases in RSA in the experimental compared to comparison condition. Conclusion Respiratory sinus arrhythmia may be a useful index of emotional regulation in people with substance use disorder, and a potential measure of underlying mechanisms for SUD treatment studies, particularly mindfulness-based interventions.

AB  - Abstract Encephalitis is a complex neurological syndrome caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. The management of encephalitis is challenging because: the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy is broad; there is often rapid disease progression; it often requires intensive supportive management; and there are many aetiologic agents for which there is no definitive treatment. Patients with possible meningoencephalitis are often encountered in the emergency care environment where clinicians must consider differential diagnoses, perform appropriate investigations and initiate empiric antimicrobials. For patients who require admission to hospital and in whom encephalitis is likely, a staged approach to investigation and management is preferred with the potential involvement of multiple medical specialties. Key considerations in the investigation and management of patients with encephalitis addressed in this guideline include: Which first-line investigations should be performed?; Which aetiologies should be considered possible based on clinical features, risk factors and radiological features?; What tests should be arranged in order to diagnose the common causes of encephalitis?; When to consider empiric antimicrobials and immune modulatory therapies?; and What is the role of brain biopsy?

AB  - Abstract Chronic nonhealing wounds cause significant morbidity and mortality and remain a challenging condition to treat. Regenerative wound surgery involves operative debridement of wounds to remove dead and healing-impaired tissue and bacterial contamination and, subsequently, the application of regenerative medicine treatments to accelerate healing. Regenerative treatments aim to restore native tissue structure and function by targeting biological mechanisms underlying impaired healing. A wide range of regenerative modalities are used for treating chronic and complex wounds, including decellularized scaffolds, living engineered donor tissues, autologous stem cells, and recombinant growth factors. Each of these modalities has specific and sometimes complex requirements for implementation. The advanced wound care team, including OR staff members, should be aware of how these products are used and regulated. This article highlights some of the common and emerging regenerative treatments that are applied in wound surgery and focuses on how the products are used practically in the OR.

AB  - Abstract Psychiatric and neurological diseases combined represent a considerable social and economic burden in Europe. A recent study conducted by the European Brain Council (EBC) quantified the ?cost and burden? of major brain diseases in Europe, amounting to ?386bn per year. Considering that these costs will increase exponentially in the years to come due to ageing of the European population, it is necessary to act now in order to curb this increase and possibly reverse the trend. Thus, establishing a strong European platform supporting basic and clinical research in neuroscience is needed to confront the economic and social challenge posed by management of brain diseases in European countries. To setup a platform for discussion, EBC published in 2006 a Consensus Document on European Brain Research, describing needs and achievements of research in Europe and presenting proposals for future research programs. Since 2006, European research in neuroscience has advanced tremendously. The present document represents an update elaborated to reflect changes in research priorities and advances in brain research that have taken place since 2006. The same approach and format have been used here as in the previous version. Multinational and multidisciplinary teams have once again come together to express their views, not only on the current strengths in European research, but also on what needs to be done in priority, hoping that this update will inspire policy makers and stakeholders in directing funding for research in Europe.
