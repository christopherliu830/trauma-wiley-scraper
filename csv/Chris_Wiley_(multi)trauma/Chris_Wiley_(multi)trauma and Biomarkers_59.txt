AB  - Objective Accurate and rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is of major medical and economic importance. The objective of this study was to identify whole saliva high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in patients with acute MI. Subjects and Methods A case?control study was carried out in 30 normal healthy individuals, and 30 patients with acute MI were hospitalized in CCU of Imam Hossein hospital, Tehran, Iran. The hs-cTnT levels were assayed in serum and whole saliva in the first and second morning following the MI by ELISA method. Statistical analysis of the Student's t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient was performed. Results The mean stimulated and unstimulated saliva and serum levels of hs-cTnT at both the first and the second morning following the acute MI were significantly higher in patients with acute MI compared with healthy individuals. Furthermore, stimulated and unstimulated saliva hs-TnT levels correlated significantly with serum hs-TnT level (r = 0.415, P < 0.023; r = 0.466, P < 0.021, respectively). Conclusion Results suggest that salivary hs-cTnT can be used as an alternative to serum hs-cTnT for diagnosis and monitoring of myocardial infarction.

AB  - Abstract The differential diagnosis of a pancreatic head mass encompasses a wide range of clinical entities that include both solid and cystic lesions. This chapter focuses on our approach to the patient presenting with a newly found pancreatic head mass with the main goals of determining the risk of the lesion being malignant or premalignant, resectability if the patient is appropriate for surgical intervention, assessment of need for multimodality treatment and determination the patient's surgical risk.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent cause of dementia, is escalating as a global epidemic, and so far, there is neither cure nor treatment to alter its progression. The most important feature of the disease is neuronal death and loss of cognitive functions, caused probably from several pathological processes in the brain. The main neuropathological features of AD are widely described as amyloid beta (A?) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of the aggregated protein tau, which contribute to the disease. Nevertheless, AD brains suffer from a variety of alterations in function, such as energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic activity. The latest decades have seen an explosion of genes and molecules that can be employed as targets aiming to improve brain physiology, which can result in preventive strategies for AD. Moreover, therapeutics using these targets can help AD brains to sustain function during the development of AD pathology. Here, we review broadly recent information for potential targets that can modify AD through diverse pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches including gene therapy. We propose that AD could be tackled not only using combination therapies including A? and tau, but also considering insulin and cholesterol metabolism, vascular function, synaptic plasticity, epigenetics, neurovascular junction and blood?brain barrier targets that have been studied recently. We also make a case for the role of gut microbiota in AD. Our hope is to promote the continuing research of diverse targets affecting AD and promote diverse targeting as a near-future strategy.

AB  - Abstract Background WHO stated that nearly one million people commit suicide every year worldly, and 40% of the suicide completer suffered from depression. The primary aim of this study was to explore the association between long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and suicide risk of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Using Human LncRNA 3.0 microarray profiling which includes 30,586 human lncRNAs and RT-PCR, six down-regulated lncRNAs were identified differentially expressed in MDD patients. According to suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt, the suicide risk of MDD patients was classified into suicidal ideation versus no suicidal ideation groups, and past attempt versus no past attempt groups, respectively. The expression of six lncRNAs in MDD patients and controls were examined by RT-PCR. Results The expression of six lncRNAs had significant differences between no suicidal ideation, suicidal ideation, and controls; corresponding lncRNAs associated with suicidal attempt had remarkable differences between no past attempt, past attempt, and controls. Additionally, only the expression of lncRNAs in suicidal ideation group and past attempt group markedly declined compared with controls. Conclusions This study indicated that the expression of six down-regulated lncRNAs had a negative association with suicide risk in MDD patients, and the expression of lncRNAs in PBMCs could have the potential to help clinician judge the suicide risk of MDD patients to provide timely treatment and prevent suicide.

Choice of cell types ?? Regulating cellular activities -? Influence of growth factors on chondrogenic differentiation -? Influence of growth factors on matrix deposition -? Supportive effect of biomaterials ?? Interference of inflammation with cartilage repair ?? Tracking of transplanted cells in vivo ?? Conclusion and future directions Abstract Since the first cell therapeutic study to repair articular cartilage defects in the knee in 1994, several clinical studies have been reported. An overview of the results of clinical studies did not conclusively show improvement over conventional methods, mainly because few studies reach level I of evidence for effects on middle or long term. However, these explorative trials have provided valuable information about study design, mechanisms of repair and clinical outcome and have revealed that much is still unknown and further improvements are required. Furthermore, cellular and molecular studies using new technologies such as cell tracking, gene arrays and proteomics have provided more insight in the cell biology and mechanisms of joint surface regeneration. Besides articular cartilage, cartilage of other anatomical locations as well as progenitor cells are now considered as alternative cell sources. Growth Factor research has revealed some information on optimal conditions to support cartilage repair. Thus, there is hope for improvement. In order to obtain more robust and reproducible results, more detailed information is needed on many aspects including the fate of the cells, choice of cell type and culture parameters. As for the clinical aspects, it becomes clear that careful selection of patient groups is an important input parameter that should be optimized for each application. In addition, the study outcome parameters should be improved. Although reduced pain and improved function are, from the patient's perspective, the most important outcomes, there is a need for more structure/tissue-related outcome measures. Ideally, criteria and/or markers to identify patients at risk and responders to treatment are the ultimate goal for these more sophisticated regenerative approaches in joint surface repair in particular, and regenerative medicine in general.
