AB  - Summary The conscious experience of pain defies precise anatomic, physiologic, and/or pharmacologic definition; furthermore, it can be experienced even in the absence of obvious external noxious stimulation, and it can be modified by behavioral experiences including fear, memory, and stress. Nociception is the neural process of encoding noxious stimuli, the consequences of which may be behavioral - either a simple motor withdrawal reflex or more complex avoidance behaviors - or autonomic. Two main approaches have been adopted when studying pain in animals. The first approach is to study responses to brief noxious stimuli in naive animals. The second approach is to induce pain in the animal by delivery of a tonic, sustained noxious stimulus that induces peripheral or central sensitization and subsequently to study pain mechanisms and test analgesic drugs. Phasic pain tests, analgesic testing, local anesthetics, pharmacologic treatment of pain, pain assays, N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract It is difficult to convey the accelerating rate and growing importance of mass spectrometry applications to human blood proteins and peptides. Mass spectrometry can rapidly detect and identify the ionizable peptides from the proteins in a simple mixture and reveal many of their post-translational modifications. However, blood is a complex mixture that may contain many proteins first expressed in cells and tissues. The complete analysis of blood proteins is a daunting task that will rely on a wide range of disciplines from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, electromagnetic instrumentation, mathematics and computation. Therefore the comprehensive discovery and analysis of blood proteins will rank among the great technical challenges and require the cumulative sum of many of mankind's scientific achievements together. A variety of methods have been used to fractionate, analyze and identify proteins from blood, each yielding a small piece of the whole and throwing the great size of the task into sharp relief. The approaches attempted to date clearly indicate that enumerating the proteins and peptides of blood can be accomplished. There is no doubt that the mass spectrometry of blood will be crucial to the discovery and analysis of proteins, enzyme activities, and post-translational processes that underlay the mechanisms of disease. At present both discovery and quantification of proteins from blood are commonly reaching sensitivities of ?1?ng/mL. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:685?732, 2011

AB  - Summary Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is receiving increasing attention, particularly as it mainly affects the (growing) elderly population. Until recently, cognitive deficits after cardiac surgery were thought to be caused by physiological disturbances associated with the cardiopulmonary bypass technique. Although the technique of ?off-pump? coronary revascularisation may potentially be associated with improved outcome, long-term follow-up studies have failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The focus of research is thus shifting from cardiopulmonary bypass to other factors common to both techniques, such as surgery, anaesthesia and patient-related predisposing factors. Priming of the immune system by ageing and atherosclerosis may result in an exaggerated systemic and cerebral inflammatory response to cardiac surgery and anaesthesia, causing neuronal loss or dysfunction resulting in cognitive dysfunction. We briefly discuss the evidence for cardiopulmonary bypass-related neuronal injuries in adult cardiac surgery patients, and review the evidence that immune priming is a key factor in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery.

AB  - Abstract To date, there has been little opposition to the growing influence of cognitive neuroscience in education from the education profession itself. However there is growing criticism from the fields of psychology and philosophy. This paper aims to summarize the central arguments found in literature critical of the claims made by cognitive neuroscientists who advocate its potential to improve education. The paper is organized around three sections which draw together assessments from psychology, philosophy and sociology of education. The first, ?Brain, Mind and Culture,? lays out the general argument against neuro-education and evaluates two common assumptions made by advocates of neuro-education: that there is a causal relationship between brain and mind and that learning is a central tenet of education. The second section, ?Promises and Problems,? critically considers an example of neuro-educational research and then goes on to discuss how neuro-education has detrimental consequences for two necessary conditions of liberal subject-based education; disciplinarity and pedagogic authority. The final section, ?Discourses of Risk, Vulnerability and Optimal Outcomes,? considers wider sociological literature to locate neuro-education within its contemporary cultural context. The paper concludes with a summary of the main philosophical and moral objections to neuro-education.
