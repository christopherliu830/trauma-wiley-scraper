AB  - Abstract To date, there has been little opposition to the growing influence of cognitive neuroscience in education from the education profession itself. However there is growing criticism from the fields of psychology and philosophy. This paper aims to summarize the central arguments found in literature critical of the claims made by cognitive neuroscientists who advocate its potential to improve education. The paper is organized around three sections which draw together assessments from psychology, philosophy and sociology of education. The first, ?Brain, Mind and Culture,? lays out the general argument against neuro-education and evaluates two common assumptions made by advocates of neuro-education: that there is a causal relationship between brain and mind and that learning is a central tenet of education. The second section, ?Promises and Problems,? critically considers an example of neuro-educational research and then goes on to discuss how neuro-education has detrimental consequences for two necessary conditions of liberal subject-based education; disciplinarity and pedagogic authority. The final section, ?Discourses of Risk, Vulnerability and Optimal Outcomes,? considers wider sociological literature to locate neuro-education within its contemporary cultural context. The paper concludes with a summary of the main philosophical and moral objections to neuro-education.

AB  - Aim Previous research indicates that preventive intervention is likely to benefit patients ?at risk? of psychosis, in terms of functional improvement, symptom reduction and delay or prevention of onset of threshold psychotic disorder. The primary aim of the current study is to test outcomes of ultra high risk (UHR) patients, primarily functional outcome, in response to a sequential intervention strategy consisting of support and problem solving (SPS), cognitive-behavioural case management and antidepressant medication. A secondary aim is to test biological and psychological variables that moderate and mediate response to this sequential treatment strategy. Methods This is a sequential multiple assignment randomised trial (SMART) consisting of three steps: Step 1: SPS (1.5 months); Step 2: SPS vs Cognitive Behavioural Case Management (4.5 months); Step 3: Cognitive Behavioural Case Management?+?Antidepressant Medication vs Cognitive Behavioural Case Management?+?Placebo (6 months). The intervention is of 12 months duration in total and participants will be followed up at 18 months and 24 months post baseline. Conclusion This paper reports on the rationale and protocol of the Staged Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP) study. With a large sample of 500 UHR participants this study will investigate the most effective type and sequence of treatments for improving functioning and reducing the risk of developing psychotic disorder in this clinical population.

AB  - Abstract ?? Introduction -? Models of sepsis -? Evidence for complement activation in sepsis -? Protective effects of C5a generated in limited amounts -? Sepsis-induced changes in signalling cascades -? Divergent effects on phagocytic cells during sepsis -? Harmful effects of C5a and C5a receptors in experimental sepsis ?? Future directions Sepsis in human beings is a major problem involving many individuals and with a high death rate. Except for a single drug (recombinant activated protein C) that has been approved for treatment of septic patients, supportive measures represent the main clinical approach. There are many models of experimental sepsis, mostly in rodents. A commonly used model is cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, robust activation of complement occurs together with up-regulation of C5a receptors (C5aR, C5L2) in a variety of different organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart). In septic human beings there is abundant evidence for complement activation. Interception of C5a or its receptors in the CLP model greatly improves survival in septic rodents. There is compelling evidence that CLP causes an intense pro-inflammatory state and that C5a interaction with its receptors can be linked to apoptosis of the lymphoid system and cells of the adrenal medulla, loss of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils, consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac dysfunction. These findings may have implications for therapeutic interventions in human beings with sepsis.

AB  - Summary The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was introduced as a stage in the Global Deterioration Scale to describe the progression from normal aging to dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. The potential clinical and demographic risk factors for developing AD at an earlier age of onset identified over the last three decades include depression, female gender, low levels of education, smaller head circumference, and family history of Down's syndrome. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a synucleinopathy characterized by a progressive dementia syndrome that is usually associated with parkinsonism and typically dominated by attentional, visuospatial, and executive dysfunction and relatively preserved memory. Vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, prion diseases, and normal pressure hydrocephalus are also discussed in the chapter.
