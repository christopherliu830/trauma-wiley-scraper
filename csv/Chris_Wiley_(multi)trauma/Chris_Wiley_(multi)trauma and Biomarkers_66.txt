AB  - Abstract Significant changes have occurred in the well-established partnership between fisheries managers and geneticists over the last 50 years. It is therefore timely to review and recalibrate the ways in which genetic technologies can assist the fishing industry to maintain productive and sustainable harvests. Our objective is to contribute to the mutual understanding of all stakeholders in the genetics?management partnership. Genetic technologies that are relevant to fisheries management are grouped into eleven themes, which are described in plain language for a non-specialist audience. The role that the genetic information plays in fisheries management is explained, along with an assessment of the challenges and barriers that may be preventing the uptake of the information into the fisheries management process. The compelling conclusion is that genetics offers a diverse collection of versatile and useful tools for informing fisheries managers about issues that have a biological basis. Presently, mainstream use of genetic tools focuses on a narrow set of fisheries management issues, but the diversity of genetic tools and the novel issues they can address indicates that uptake will grow, particularly as communication between geneticists and end-users improves.

AB  - Abstract Preclinical Research Central nervous system (CNS) disorders represent a major problem of health in developed countries, with important consequences in disability and health economics. Recent findings in CNS genomics and pharmacogenomics suggest that the introduction of pharmacogenomic procedures in clinical practice may help to optimize therapeutics (efficacy and safety issues). The genes involved in the pharmacogenomics of CNS drugs fall into five categories: (i) genes associated with CNS pathogenesis; (ii) genes associated with the mechanism of action of drugs; (iii) genes associated with drug metabolism; (iv) genes associated with drug transporters; and (v) pleiotropic genes involved in multifaceted cascades and metabolic reactions. Pharmacogenomics accounts for 30?90% variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Only 20?30% of the Caucasian population processes normally approximately 60% of the current drugs that are metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Clinical pharmacogenomics may contribute to personalizing pharmacological treatment, predicting patient/drug-dose selection, minimizing drug interactions, increasing drug efficacy, and reducing unnecessary costs.

AB  - Summary Dementia and cognitive impairment are very common and accompany many neurological as well as systemic diseases. This chapter first talks about delirium, dementia and cognitive impairment. Cognition, like other aspects of human brain function, has a modular organisation, and different cognitive functions have distinct anatomical substrates. The chapter then focuses on the differential diagnosis of delirium and dementia, and a structured approach to the investigation of cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's disease is the prototypical cortical dementia against which other dementias are compared in a differential diagnosis. The prion diseases are transmissible agents with unique composition and properties, being apparently devoid of significant nucleic acid. The greatest risk factor for development of dementia is age. However, there are several modifiable risk factors. Moderate exercise reduces the risk of dementia as does modification of vascular risk factors: obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, hypertension and smoking.

AB  - Abstract Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injections are a common approach in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The effectiveness of injections and particular injection products is often discussed and debated in clinical arenas. The following therapeutic review examines the evidence for intra-articular methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) injections in the management of OA knee. A review of research evidence, published guidelines and clinical literature was undertaken following an electronic database and relevant literature search. The review found that there is limited evidence which indicates that a single dose intra-articular MPA injection can provide short to medium term benefits for pain, with less evidence for beneficial effects on function or stiffness. There is heterogeneity across studies and until recently, most studies had only short to medium term follow-up periods, thus limiting the evidence available on longer term benefit. There was also evidence indicating equivalent overall efficacy of MPA to that of other corticosteroid products. Most guideline recommendations concerning IA injections for OA knee have drawn on evidence from pooled data for several corticosteroid products. The review also found there was limited reporting of the incidence of adverse events in most studies. Overall, MPA shows efficacy for symptom relief in OA knee. At an individual management level, evidence for a limited duration of effect needs consideration in injections decisions. Furthermore, consensus across clinical guidelines suggests that the management of OA knee should be individualized to a person's clinical history, degree of disability, risk factors, quality of life and personal preferences, whereby injecting involves a shared decision and forms part of a multimodal approach.
