AB  - Abstract The outcome for gait recovery from paralysis due to spinal lesion remains uncertain even when damage is limited. One critical factor is the survival of motoneurons, which are very vulnerable cells. To clarify the early pathophysiological mechanisms of spinal damage, an in vitro injury model of the rat spinal cord caused by moderate excitotoxicity was used. With this preparation we investigated whether motoneuron survival was dependent on the expression of the neuroprotective protein HSP70. In the present study excitotoxicity evoked by kainate induced delayed (24 h) loss (35%) of motoneurons, which became pyknotic with translocation of the cell death biomarker apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus. This process was concomitant with suppression of locomotor network electrical activity. Surviving cells showed strong expression of HSP70 without nuclear AIF. The HSP70 inhibitor VER155008 per se induced neurotoxicity similar to that of kainate, while the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin did not damage spinal tissue. Electrophysiological recording following kainate or VER155008 indicated depression of motoneuron field potentials, with decreased excitability and impaired synaptic transmission. When these two drugs were applied together, more intense neurotoxicity emerged. Our data indicate that HSP70 was one important contributor to motoneuron survival and suggest that enhancing HSP70 activity is a potential future strategy for neuroprotecting these cells.

AB  - Abstract Human adipose-derived microvascular endothelial cells (HAMEC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to bear angiogenic and vasculogenic capabilities. We hypothesize that co-culturing HAMEC:MSC on a porous biodegradable scaffold in vitro, later implanted as a graft around femoral blood vessels in a rat, will result in its vascularization by host vessels, creating a functional vascular flap that can effectively treat a range of large full-thickness soft tissue defects. HAMEC were co-cultured with MSC on polymeric three-dimensional porous constructs. Grafts were then implanted around the femoral vessels of a rat. To ensure vessel sprouting from the main femoral vessels, grafts were pre-isolated from the surrounding tissue. Graft vascularization was monitored to confirm full vascularization before flap transfer. Flaps were then transferred to treat both abdominal wall and exposed bone and tendon of an ankle defects. Flaps were analysed to determine vascular properties in terms of maturity, functionality and survival of implanted cells. Findings show that pre-isolated grafts bearing the HAMEC:MSC combination promoted formation of highly vascularized flaps, which were better integrated in both defect models. The results of this study show the essentiality of a specific adipose-derived cell combination in successful graft vascularization and integration, two processes crucial for flap survival.

AB  - Abstract Background Neuropathy can lead not only to impaired function but also to sensory sensitization. We aimed to link reduced skin nerve fibre density in different levels to layer-specific functional impairment in neuropathic pain patients and tried to identify pain-specific functional and structural markers. Methods In 12 healthy controls and 36 patients with neuropathic pain, we assessed clinical characteristics, thermal thresholds (quantitative sensory testing) and electrically induced pain and axon reflex erythema. At the most painful sites and at intra-individual control sites, skin biopsies were taken and innervation densities in the different skin layers were assessed. Moreover, neuronal calcitonin gene-related peptide staining was quantified. Results Perception of warm, cold and heat pain and nerve fibre density were reduced in the painful areas compared with the control sites and with healthy controls. Warm and cold detection thresholds correlated best with epidermal innervation density, whereas heat and cold pain thresholds and axon reflex flare correlated best with dermal innervation density. Clinical pain ratings correlated only with epidermal nerve fibre density (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.05) and better preserved cold detection thresholds (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.05), but not with other assessed functional and structural parameters. Conclusions Thermal thresholds, axon reflex measurements and assessment of skin innervation density are valuable tools to characterize and quantify peripheral neuropathy and link neuronal function to different layers of the skin. The severity of small fibre neuropathy, however, did not correspond to clinical pain intensity and a specific parameter or pattern that would predict pain intensity in peripheral neuropathy could not be identified.
