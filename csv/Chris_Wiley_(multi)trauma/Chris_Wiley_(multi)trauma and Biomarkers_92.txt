Consistent with other specialty areas of practice, a collection of important literature is valuable for both the new and experienced clinician. A diverse breadth of medical problems are represented that were felt to be the most pertinent issues facing the emergency medicine pharmacist; however, it is not intended to be a complete representation of available literature.

AB  - Abstract This report describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. It also examines in detail the financial impact of Alzheimer's on families, including annual costs to families and the difficult decisions families must often make to pay those costs. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from Alzheimer's disease, making it the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 23%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which Alzheimer's disease contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease recorded on death certificates. In 2016, an estimated 700,000 Americans age ≥65 years will die with Alzheimer's disease, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by Alzheimer's disease. In 2015, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $221 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2016 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with dementia are estimated to be $236 billion. The costs of Alzheimer's care may place a substantial financial burden on families, who often have to take money out of their retirement savings, cut back on buying food, and reduce their own trips to the doctor. In addition, many family members incorrectly believe that Medicare pays for nursing home care and other types of long-term care. Such findings highlight the need for solutions to prevent dementia-related costs from jeopardizing the health and financial security of the families of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine, within the first-year post?head and neck cancer (HNC) diagnosis, the contribution of past and upon HNC psychiatric diagnoses (ie, substance use disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder) to the extent (ie, cumulated dose) of opioid prescription. Methods Prospective longitudinal study of 223 consecutive adults (on 313 approached; 72% participation) newly diagnosed (<2 weeks) with a first occurrence of primary HNC, including Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV disorders, validated psychometric measures, and medical chart reviews. Opioid doses were translated into standardized morphine milligram equivalents (MME) using CDC guidelines. A model of variables was tested using multiple linear regression. Results Fifty-five percent (123/223) of patients received opioids at some point during the first 12 months post?HNC diagnosis, 37.7% (84/223) upon HNC diagnosis (pre-treatment), 40.8% (91/223) during treatments, and 31.4% (70/223) post-treatment. The multiple linear regression indicated that an AD (P = 0.04) upon HNC diagnosis in early stage contributes to cumulated MME dose in the first year post?HNC diagnosis. Conclusion This study underlines how anxiety has important repercussions on the management of pain and illustrates the importance of screening for AD upon HNC diagnosis to allow for early prophylactic treatment and support.
