AB  - Abstract Ageing is a universal, intrinsic, progressive and deleterious process. Understanding it is of major interest to scientist, physicians as well as to the general population. Critical to this understanding is to formulate comprehensive theories of aging with high predictive and explanatory power. More than 300 theories have been postulated and are reviewed here. The free radical theory of ageing is one of the most prominent and well studied. It was further developed by one of us (JM) in what has become known as the mitochondrial theory of ageing. These theories provide new experimental approaches to further develop our understanding of the phenomenon of ageing. IUBMB Life, 59: 249-254, 2007

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Abstract The past decade has been characterized by a lot of remodeling in the field of learning and memory. Both of them, often associated with neuronal oscillations, an emergent property of brain networks, are governed by temporal lobe (TL) functional connectivity. An impairment of oscillatory mechanisms indeed often leads to TL-dependent cognitive deficits. While the classical view assigned the TL a major role in spatial information processing, new theories rather confer to the TL a more general function in cognitive processes beyond space representation. The present review covers, both in humans and in animal models, (a) the updated role of the TL in cognitive processes, addressing current debates in the field and proposing a scenario on how TL structures cooperate in order to bind an integrated representation of afferent information, (b) the oscillatory mechanisms underlying these TL-dependent cognitive functions (theta, gamma, sharp wave ripples) and (c) how TL-dependent cognition is altered during temporal lobe epilepsy, proposing a scenario on how reorganized TL networks in TLE leads to rhythmopathies and cognitive deficits. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a well-studied neurological disease. Patients do not only suffer from epileptic seizures but also from cognitive and behavioral deficits between their seizures called comorbidities. TLE animal models are therefore used to understand how and when these comorbidities arise and what their underlying mechanisms are.

AB  - Summary Red blood cells (RBCs) degrade progressively during the weeks of refrigerated storage. No universally accepted definition of ?fresh? or ?old? RBCs exists. While practices vary from country to country, preservative solutions permitting shelf life as long as 7 weeks have been licenced. Transfusion of stored RBCs, particularly those at the end of the approved shelf life, has been implicated in adverse clinical outcomes. The results of observational analyses, animal models and studies in volunteers have proved provocative, controversial and contradictory. A recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) in premature infants exemplifies the difficulties with moderately sized clinical studies. Several other RCTs are in progress. The effect of RBC storage may well vary according to the clinical setting. Resolution of the importance of the storage lesion may require large pragmatic clinical trials. In the meantime, institutions involved in blood collection and transfusion should explore strategies that assure blood availability, while limiting the use of the oldest RBCs currently approved by regulation.
