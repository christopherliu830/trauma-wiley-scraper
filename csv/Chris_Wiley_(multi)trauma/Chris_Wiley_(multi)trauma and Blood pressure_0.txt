AB  - All multi-trauma patients with suspected cervical spine injury should have their cervical spine protected while other life-threatening injuries are being managed. The application of a hard cervical collar is an acceptable method of temporarily immobilizing the cervical spine. Two cases of significant occipital pressure ulceration associated with the use of hard cervical collar are presented.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To review emergency sedation intubation as practised in the Melbourne-based ambulance helicopter. Specifically, to describe patient profiles, drug dosage, difficulties encountered, success rate and patient outcomes. Methods: Retrospective review of all helicopter primary and secondary retrieval patients, who received application of the emergency sedation intubation protocol using morphine and diazepam during a 3 year period (January 1995 to December 1997). Data were collected from an audit of patient care records completed by flight paramedics and from hospital records. Results: Emergency sedation intubation was performed on 128 patients: 103 adults and 25 children. The median dose of drugs required for emergency sedation intubation by adult patients was 20 mg morphine and 20 mg diazepam. The overall success rate for emergency sedation intubation was 94.5%, with 73.6% of these being successful intubations at the first attempt. On intubation, 54.1% of patients were fully relaxed, while a gag reflex was still present in 45.9% of patients during or just after emergency sedation intubation. Twenty-two per cent of patients had a change in blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg. The maximum rise in blood pressure was 60 mmHg and the maximum fall was 80 mmHg. Conclusions: Flight paramedics achieved a high success rate for intubation with the morphine/ diazepam emergency sedation intubation protocol. However, there was still a significant percentage of patients for whom more than one attempt was required to achieve emergency sedation intubation and, in almost half the patients, gag reflexes remained present either during or immediately after intubation. Additionally, some patients experienced blood pressure changes following intubation that may have potential adverse consequences in terms of compromised cerebral perfusion or rises in intracranial pressure. Consideration should be given to revision of the protocol to allow the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and alternative airway management techniques, such as cricothyroidotomy, for specified circumstances in the aeromedical environment.

AB  - Background: Severe truncal multi trauma patients often develop coagulopathy, acidosis and hypothermia that makes major reparative trauma surgery dangerous. It was aimed to try to develop physiological indicators that would predict a poor outcome when conventional reparative surgery was applied. These indicators may help in the decision to switch from conventional reparative surgery to surgery limited to the control of major haemorrhage or organ disruption: so-called ?damage-control? surgery. Method: A retrospective review was conducted of 40 patients with severe multivisceral trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 35) who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Waikato Hospital and who underwent conventional reparative surgery. Results: Survival was strongly associated with base deficit (BD), core temperature and ISS. Using multiple logistic regression on these indices, outcome could be predicted with 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 92%, positive predictive value for death = 96%). Either severe hypothermia (< 33°C) or severe acidosis (BD > 12 mEq/L), or a combination of moderate core temperature < 35.5°C, and a BD of > 5 mEq/L were strong predictors of death if conventional reparative surgery was practised. Conclusions: At the abovementioned levels of physiological compromise, patient survival after conventional trauma surgery can be predicted to be very unlikely. Damage-control measures would be worth attempting.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aimed to determine factors related to ICU mortality in critically ill patients transferred by Adult Retrieval Victoria (ARV) medical staff. Patients who died in ICU after interhospital transfer were compared against those who survived. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of ARV cases between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010. Retrieval data were linked with data from the ANZICS CORE APD (Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation Adult Patient Database). Victoria Data Linkage (VDL) performed linkage of data. Data included demographic and clinical data obtained during transfer and clinical data recorded in ICU. Results Of the 601 cases transferred by ARV during the study period, 549 cases were eligible for linkage to 25?543 ANZICS APD case records for the same period. VDL matched 460 of these cases (83.8%). Mortality rate in the matched sample was 13.9%. Variables associated with mortality were: advanced age (odds ratios [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00?1.04, P = 0.02), principal referral problem cardiac (OR 1.84, 95%CI 1.02?3.32, P = 0.04), lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95?0.99, P = 0.005) and tachycardia (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00?1.03, P = 0.008) on arrival at destination hospital. Conclusions Advanced age, lower mean arterial blood pressure and tachycardia towards the completion of transfer were associated with increased ICU mortality in this population. Clinicians should be aware of the additional risk for cardiac patients.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Acinetobacter baumannii and A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex are commonly encountered pathogens in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment and prognostic risk factors in nosocomial pneumonia caused by these microorganisms. Methods The study was conducted retrospectively in Uludag University Hospital and included 356 adult non-neutropenic patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Results Of the subjects, 94.9% (n?=?338) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. The clinical response rate was 57.2%, the 14-day mortality 39.6% and the 30-day mortality 53.1%. The significant independent risk factors for the 30-day mortality were severe sepsis (OR, 2.60; 95% CI: 1.49?4.56; P?=?0.001), septic shock (OR, 6.12; 95% CI: 2.75?13.64; P?<?0.001), APACHE II score?≥?20 (OR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28?3.50; P?=?0.003) and empiric monotherapy (OR, 1.63; 95% CI: 1.00?2.64; P?=?0.048). Multi-trauma (OR, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.11?5.68; P?=?0.028) was found to be a protective factor. In patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS)?>?6 on the third day of treatment, both the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were high (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.001). Also, the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were significantly higher in the patients treated with empiric monotherapy compared with combination therapy (48/93 (51.6%)?46/123 (37.4%), P?=?0.037 and 62/93 (66.7%)?65/123 (52.8%), P?=?0.041, respectively) in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant strains. Conclusion Mortality rates were high in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant A. baumannii or A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex. In the units with a high level of carbapenem resistance, antibiotic combinations should be considered for empiric therapy.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objective Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is recommended as the initial form of acute circulatory support for many disease processes. The epidemiology of its use in the ED is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess indications, use patterns and short-term effects of FBT in a paediatric ED. Methods Retrospective observational study in the ED of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (annual census >90?000) using hospital electronic medical record data for all patients who received an i.v. fluid bolus in the ED over the calendar year 2018 were included in the study. We extracted demographics, indications, volume, content of FBT as well as subsequent vital sign and biochemical changes. Results One thousand five hundred and thirty-nine fluid boluses were administered to 1343/90?000 children (1.5%), 1185 received 1, 123 received 2, 32 received 3, and 3 received 4 boluses. Fluid bolus volume of 10 mL/kg was used in 45.3%, 20?mL/kg in 35.7%, 500?mL in 6.4% and 1000?mL in 7.1%. The fluid content was 0.9% saline in 99.9% of cases. The most common indications for FBT were: vomiting/diarrhoea (23%), acute febrile illness (11%) and pneumonia or sepsis (10% each). FBT was associated with a reduction in median heart rate by 6 beats per minute (P?<?0.01), reduction in mean blood pressure by 3?mmHg (P?<?0.01), and reduction in venous lactate by 0.2?mmol/L (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Fluid bolus therapy is a commonly used intervention in the paediatric ED, most often for dehydration. Variability in indications, dose and effects of FBT warrant further exploration.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Lung hyperinflation is a technique used by physiotherapists to mobilize and remove excess bronchial secretions, reinflate areas of pulmonary collapse and improve oxygenation. Hyperinflation may be delivered by the ventilator or manually, by use of a manual resuscitation circuit, depending upon the respiratory and cardiovascular status of the patient. The effects of manual hyperinflation, with respect to excess bronchial secretions and static lung compliance, have been well-established. There is, however, only limited evidence as to the efficacy of ventilator hyperinflation as a physiotherapy treatment technique. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation on static pulmonary compliance and sputum clearance in stable intubated and ventilated patients. Method Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied. This was a double crossover study where all patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences over two days. The first sequence involved manual hyperinflation followed two hours later by ventilator hyperinflation and the order was reversed on the second day. In the second sequence, ventilator hyperinflation preceded manual hyperinflation. The variables of static pulmonary compliance and sputum wet weight were analysed by use of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results There was no significant difference in sputum wet weight production between either technique or on either day of treatment. Static pulmonary compliance improved with both hyperinflation techniques (p < 0.05). Conclusions Hyperinflation as part of a physiotherapy treatment can be performed with equal benefit using either a manual resuscitation circuit or a ventilator. Both methods of hyperinflation improve static pulmonary compliance and clear similar volumes of pulmonary secretions. Copyright ? 2002 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background:? There were 59 unprovoked shark attacks worldwide in 2008. Twelve of these occurred in Australia, ranking it as second only to the USA. In February 2009, two attacks occurred within 72?h in Sydney, Australia. Methods:? The two patients involved survived severe limb trauma. Case 1 suffered bite trauma to the lower limb and hand and underwent staged debridement and early amputation. Case 2 presented with a hand severed at the level of the wrist that was initially replanted. However, it would succumb to progressive necrosis after 12 days. We discuss the aspects of these cases that contributed to the patients' survival and ultimately good functional outcomes. Discussion:? New paradigms for the management of major trauma patients have emerged over the last decade. We consider recent advances in the understanding of pre-hospital tourniquet use, rapid transit to the operating suite and damage control surgery, and examine how they impacted on the management of our patients. Very little is known about the microbiology of shark bites. Organisms from sea water, the patient's skin and the shark's mouth must all be considered when selecting appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis. The planning of definitive surgery in severe limb trauma is dependent on the interactions of a number of factors including physical, psychological and social issues. The decision to ultimately replant or amputate the effected limb is best made in union with the patient and their family.

AB  - Summary Abdominal trauma is second only to head injury as a cause of serious injury in children, and the third most common cause of trauma-related death. The most common organs injured in blunt abdominal trauma are the spleen, liver and kidneys. When the spleen and liver are injured, intraperitoneal bleeding occurs (haemoperitoneum). In all suspected intra-abdominal injuries, the presence or absence of macroscopic blood in the urine must be established. The presence of macroscopic haematuria is strongly predictive of serious intra-abdominal injury and may form part of the basis for further investigation with a computerised tomography (CT) scan. Apart from those patients with intraperitoneal haemorrhage, extraperitoneal extravasation or haematuria, there is a difficult group with ill-defined symptoms and signs that may persist for several days after the injury. On the rare occasion of penetrating thoracic trauma, injuries to the mediastinal structures and lungs should be assumed until proven otherwise.

AB  - Objective To detail the 9-year experience of renal trauma at a modern Level 1 trauma centre and report on patterns of injury, management and complications. Patients and methods We analysed 338 patients with renal injuries who presented to our institution over a 9-year period. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, management and complications were recorded. Results Males comprised 74.9% of patients with renal injuries and the highest incidence was amongst those aged 20?24 years. Blunt injuries comprised 96.2% (n = 325) of all the renal injuries, with road trauma being the predominant mechanism accounting for 72.5% of injuries. The distribution of injury grade was; 21.6% grade 1 (n = 73), 24.3% grade 2 (n = 82), 24.9% grade 3 (n = 84), 16.6% grade 4 (n = 56), and 12.7% grade 5 (n = 43). Conservative management was successful in all grade 1 and 2 renal injuries, and 94.9%, 90.7% and 35.1% of grade 3, 4 and 5 injuries respectively. All but one of the 13 patients with penetrating injuries were successfully managed conservatively. Conclusions Road trauma is the greatest cause of renal injury. Most haemodynamically stable patients are successfully managed conservatively.

AB  - Abstract Objectives and methods In the framework of the EU-funded project ?EU-Madness,? we collected and analysed all the reports of fatalities directly or indirectly related to substances of abuse registered in Ibiza from January to September 2015, in order to analyse the characteristics of the sample, the identified substances, and the nature of deaths associated with their consumption. Results A significant increase of substance-caused deaths with respect to the previous 4 years has been highlighted. Most of the subjects were young males, more than half were not Spanish. Males prevailed also amongst the victims of traffic accidents and suicides. The most commonly involved substances included MDMA, alcohol, cocaine, THC, opiates and prescription drugs. Conclusions Although the use of NPS is rapidly increasing in Europe, according to the results from our sample, alcohol and well-known stimulants (MDMA and cocaine) are still the substances of abuse mainly involved in the cases of substance-caused and substance-related fatalities. The significant increase of fatalities in Ibiza in the last 5 years is an issue that must be taken into account and should be better investigated, as other theories besides NPS-increased diffusion should be proposed, and therefore, targeted prevention strategies should be designed.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to determine those factors which contribute to a poor outcome and to propose a management plan that is complementary to trauma systems in common use. Methods: A prospective study of 110 consecutive patients with moderate head injury (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 9?13) was carried out. Results: A total of 75% of the patients sustained multisystem trauma, generally of minor or moderate grade according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However, the death rate increased with the severity of the injury as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The initial cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was abnormal in 61% and no patient with a normal scan developed a delayed intracranial haematoma or neurological worsening. Those patients who developed a delayed intracerebral haematoma had a worse outcome. Sixteen patients underwent craniotomy for haematoma. The intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured selectively in 20 patients and exceeded 20 mmHg in half, requiring treatment. Nine patients died, four as a result of head injury and all those had an intracranial haematoma. As a group, those who died were older and had a higher ISS. Conclusions: A plan for care of patients with moderate head injury is proposed, complementary to the Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) protocol and the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia guidelines for neurotrauma management in rural and remote locations.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Objective: To describe the prevalence, characteristics and outcomes of amphetamine-related presentations to a tertiary hospital emergency department (ED). Design, setting and participants: Prospective observational study of amphetamine-related presentations to the ED of the Royal Perth Hospital (RPH), an adult, inner-city, tertiary referral hospital, between 3?August and 2?November 2005. For all patients presenting to the ED, the treating doctors were automatically prompted by the computerised data entry system to consider amphetamine use. Main outcome measures: Proportion of ED presentations related to amphetamine use; demographic features and usage practices of amphetamine users; characteristics of presentations and admissions; associated psychiatric illnesses and use of other drugs. Results: Over the study period, there were 13?125?presentations, of which 156?(1.2%) were judged to be causally related to amphetamine use. Of those 156?patients, over half were habitual drug users (89?[57.1%] used amphetamines at least weekly), and the majority were men (111?[71.2%]). The mean age was 28?years (range, 16?55?years). Presentations were of high acuity: 104?patients [66.7%] were rated 1, 2?or 3?on the Australasian Triage Scale; 50?(32.1%) arrived by ambulance; and 25?(16.0%) arrived with police. The mean time spent in the ED was 6?h (range, 0.5?24?h). Fifty patients (32.1%) required sedation, and the likelihood of requiring sedation increased almost threefold if the heart rate was over 100?beats/min on presentation. Sixty-two patients (39.7%) were admitted and 58?(37.2%) required psychiatric evaluation. Repeat attendance was common, with 71?patients (45.5%) having previous amphetamine-related presentations to the RPH ED. Conclusions: Amphetamine-related presentations comprise 1.2% of all ED attendances and have a major impact on hospital EDs. Patients are often agitated and aggressive, require extensive resources, and frequently re-attend. The burden of amphetamine-related illnesses on EDs is likely to increase in the future.

AB  - Summary? In this selective study, 59% of the patients had a renal injury (laceration, rupture or pedicle injury). A normal IVU excluded significant renal injury after blunt trauma. Renal angiography was more accurate than ultrasonography or computed tomography in determining the extent of the injury. A retroperitoneal haematoma found during laparotomy should be explored if significant renal trauma cannot be excluded. Renal salvage after rupture or pedicle injury should be attempted in stable patients.

AB  - Summary Injury is a leading cause of death and disability, carrying with it a large economic burden to society. Young adults are over-represented in this patient group, with the highest economic impact due to years of productive life lost. Regional trauma system planning as well as specific, organised, in-hospital trauma team responses are required to ensure that experienced reception, investigation, decision-making and intervention are both timely and optimised. Trauma guidelines and protocols are the best means of ensuring a thorough and safe approach to injured patients overall, although none of these can function as an alternative to the on-site presence of a clinician with surgical experience. In total, all these approaches are essential for minimising avoidable in-hospital deaths and morbidity in severely injured patients.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.
