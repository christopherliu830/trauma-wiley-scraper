AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - ABSTRACT TRAUMA IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH for people younger than age 45 in the United States. To help prevent death or disability, critically in jured trauma patients must reach definitive care within the ?golden hour.? OFTEN, THE PERIOPERATIVE TEAM has no more than 10 minutes to prepare the room before a patient who has suffered multiple, critical, traumatic injuries is rushed into the OR. FOR THE TRAUMA PATIENT'S SAFETY, the perioperative team must be diligent and use creative measures to efficiently ensure that all surgical counts are completed. Foregoing surgical counts places the trauma patient at an increased risk for unintentionally retained foreign objects.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with severe abdominal trauma injuries can have improved outcomes if a priority-oriented approach is taken to surgical intervention. This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.

AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Background: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptaminei agonist (sumatriptan). Methods: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan: 0.01 mg·kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg·kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg·kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg·kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro. Results: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro. Conclusion: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.

AB  - ABSTRACT Usage of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in the management of acute and chronic wounds has grown exponentially in the past decade. Hundreds of studies have been published regarding outcomes and methods of therapy used for adult wounds. This treatment is increasingly being used to manage difficult-to-treat paediatric wounds arising from congenital defects, trauma, infection, tumour, burns, pressure ulceration and postsurgical complications in children, although relatively few studies have been aimed at this population. Given the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children, a multidisciplinary expert advisory panel was convened to determine appropriate use of NPWT with reticulated open cell foam (NPWT/ROCF) as delivered by Vacuum Assisted Closure? (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI Licensing, Inc., San Antonio, TX) for the treatment of paediatric wounds. The primary objectives of the expert advisory panel were to exchange state-of-practice information on paediatric wound care, review the published data regarding the use of NPWT/ROCF in paediatric wounds, evaluate the strength of the existing data and establish guidelines on best practices with NPWT/ROCF for the paediatric population. The proposed paediatrics-specific clinical practice guidelines are meant to provide practitioners an evidence base from which decisions could be made regarding the safe and efficacious selection of pressure settings, foam type, dressing change frequency and use of interposing contact layer selections. The guidelines reflect the state of knowledge on effective and appropriate wound care at the time of publication. They are the result of consensus reached by expert advisory panel members based on their individual clinical and published experiences related to the use of NPWT/ROCF in treating paediatric wounds. Best practices are described herein for novice and advanced users of NPWT/ROCF. Recommendations by the expert panel may not be appropriate for use in all circumstances. Decisions to adopt any particular recommendation must be made by the collaborating medical team, including the surgeon and wound care specialist based on available resources, individual patient circumstances and experience with the V.A.C.? Therapy System.
