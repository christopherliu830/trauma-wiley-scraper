AB  - Abstract Fever is a cardinal symptom of infectious or inflammatory insults, but it can also arise from noninfectious causes. The fever-inducing agent that has been used most frequently in experimental studies designed to characterize the physiological, immunological and neuroendocrine processes and to identify the neuronal circuits that underlie the manifestation of the febrile response is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our knowledge of the mechanisms of fever production and lysis is largely based on this model. Fever is usually initiated in the periphery of the challenged host by the immediate activation of the innate immune system by LPS, specifically of the complement (C) cascade and Toll-like receptors. The first results in the immediate generation of the C component C5a and the subsequent rapid production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The second, occurring after some delay, induces the further production of PGE2 by induction of its synthesizing enzymes and transcription and translation of proinflammatory cytokines. The Kupffer cells (Kc) of the liver seem to be essential for these initial processes. The subsequent transfer of the pyrogenic message from the periphery to the brain is achieved by neuronal and humoral mechanisms. These pathways subserve the genesis of early (neuronal signals) and late (humoral signals) phases of the characteristically biphasic febrile response to LPS. During the course of fever, counterinflammatory factors, ?endogenous antipyretics,? are elaborated peripherally and centrally to limit fever in strength and duration. The multiple interacting pro- and antipyretic signals and their mechanistic effects that underlie endotoxic fever are the subjects of this review. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) of the stifle joint is a progressive degenerative disease in dogs, which can have a profound impact on quality of life. The clinical signs of stifle OA include discomfort, limited joint range of motion, loss of muscle mass and muscle tone, and decreased overall limb use. The importance of weight management in the prevention and treatment of OA cannot be over-estimated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly prescribed class of medications to alleviate the clinical signs of OA and are the mainstay in any medical management. A multi-modal approach incorporating additional analgesics with differing mechanisms and sites of action is often indicated for improved pain control while lowering the therapeutically effective dose, thereby minimizing the adverse effects of NSAIDs. Nutritional supplementation with omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy for the management of OA.

AB  - Abstract Models of sepsis have been instructive in understanding the sequence of events in animals and, to an extent, in humans with sepsis. Events developing early in sepsis suggest that a hyperinflammatory state exists, accompanied by a buildup of oxidants in tissues reflective of a redox imbalance. Development of immunosuppression and degraded innate and adaptive immune responses are well-established complications of sepsis. In addition, there is robust activation of the complement system, which contributes to the harmful effects of sepsis. These events appear to be associated with development of multiorgan failure. The relevance of animal models of sepsis to human sepsis and the failure of human clinical trials are discussed, together with suggestions as to how clinical trial design might be improved.

AB  - Many synthetic polymeric membranes have been widely used for blood purification therapies. Among them polyester polymer alloy (PEPA) membrane shows unique blood compatibility and filtration characteristics. Objective:? To evaluate blood compatibility and filtration characteristics of 3 different PEPA membranes, including FLX (PEPA only), FDX (PEPA with polyvinylpyrrolidone, (PVP) as a hydrophilic agent), and FDY (PEPA with PVP) that has larger pore diameter. Methods:? Ultrafilters with 3 PEPA membranes (FLX, FDX, FDY, Nikkiso, Tokyo) were compared with those with polysulfone (PS; NK-PS, Nikkiso, Tokyo) for blood compatibility in vivo. Also, ultrafilters with PEPA, PS, and cellulose triacetate (CTA; FB-110GA, Nipro, Osaka) membranes were also investigated for filtration characteristics of albumin in aqueous in vitro. Results:? FDY, the latest version of the three PEPA, showed excellent small changes in C5a concentration during the treatment right after switching from PS membrane, leaving no significant changes in other biocompatible indices. First 60?min of the time course of s.c. for albumin were shown below taken under aqueous low albumin concentration, i.e., 2.42???10?3?kg/dm3. The time-dependent patterns were totally different from each other in 5 filters. Generally speaking, PS takes a peak value 20?40?min after starting the experiment, depending on the flow conditions. Since PEPA is a hydrophobic material, it showed high s.c. for albumin in FLX (PEPA with no PVP) and never reached plateau. With a hydrophilic agent (PVP), the s.c. greatly reduced in FDX and showed little time-dependent change. By enlarging the pore diameter in FDY, the s.c. increased in accordance with the enlargement. Conclusion:? Newly developed PEPA with PVP has excellent blood compatibility and has unique separation characteristics for albumin.

AB  - ABSTRACT Multirelational interventions are well described in the psychoanalytic parent?infant literature. Daniel Stern (1995) originally suggested and described five ?ports of entry? that may be employed to access the multiperson parent?infant clinical system. Other authors have elaborated and extended Stern's original list of ports of entry. The impact of using multiple ports of entry on the psychoanalytic frame, however, is largely neglected in the parent?infant psychotherapy literature. Danielle Quinodoz's (1992) four facets of the psychoanalytic setting are used to structure a discussion of how the multiplicities associated with parent?infant psychotherapy may impact the frame. The article argues strongly for a necessary flexing of the psychoanalytic frame to establish therapeutic alliances. A fifth facet, that of psychoanalytic mindfulness, is offered as a counterbalance to the risks associated with excessive flexing of the frame, particularly in relation to Quinodoz's fourth facet of ?refraining from ?doing.?? This article relies on case material to illustrate the issues under discussion. Further engagement and debate are invited.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Summary Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid covalently bound in esterified form in the cell membranes of most body cells. Following irritation or injury, arachidonic acid is released and oxygenated by enzyme systems leading to the formation of an important group of inflammatory mediators, the eicosanoids. It is now recognised that eicosanoid release is fundamental to the inflammatory process. For example, the prostaglandins and other prostanoids, products of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme pathway, have potent inflammatory properties and prostaglandin E2 is readily detectable in equine acute inflammatory exudates. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and this explains the mode of action of agents such as phenylbutazone and flunixin. Lipoxygenase enzymes metabolise arachidonic acid to a group of non-cyclised eicosanoids, the leukotrienes, some of which are also important inflammatory mediators. They are probably of particular importance in leucocyte-mediated aspects of chronic inflammation. Currently available non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, however, do not inhibit lipoxygenase activity. In the light of recent evidence, the inflammatory process is re-examined and the important emerging roles of both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase derived eicosanoids are explored. The mode of action of current and future antiinflammatory drugs offered to the equine clinician can be explained by their interference with arachidonic acid metabolism.

AB  - Summary Early studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed key neurological features including the deposition of aggregates of insoluble ?-amyloid (A?) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and signs of chronic inflammation. The initial forms of these pathological hallmarks of the disease, including small oligomers of A? peptides and the hyperphosphorylated tau which aggregates into NFT, have been assumed to be part of ?the cause of AD? and have been specifically targeted to develop an effective monotherapy, but with limited success. In the absence of effective neuroprotective drugs, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have remained as the drug class that is most used to treat AD, yet they cannot and do not slow the progression of the disease. Imaging studies have confirmed what has long been suspected ? that there is a very long pre-clinical phase, when pathology gradually builds up, possibly starting with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated metabolism. Emerging therapies are targeted more towards these changes, sometimes as well as the A? and NFT pathologies in multi-targeted approaches, to interfere with the pathological cascades in AD. The aim is to prevent, stop, or at least slow the neurodegeneration before debilitating symptoms appear. This chapter summarises inflammatory and oxidative stress-related changes that occur in AD, and discusses some emerging therapies and supplements, particularly those directed at inflammation, that may slow pathogenesis of this complex neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Abstract The complement cascade has long been recognized to play a key role in inflammatory and degenerative diseases. It is a ?double edged? sword as it is necessary to maintain health, yet can have adverse effects when unregulated, often exacerbating disease. The contrasting effects of complement, depending on whether in a setting of health or disease, is the price paid to achieve flexibility in scope and degree of a protective response for the host from infection and injury. Loss or even decreased efficiency of critical regulatory control mechanisms can result in aggravated inflammation and destruction of self-tissue. The role of the complement cascade is poorly understood in the nervous system and neurological disorders. Novel studies have demonstrated that the expression of complement proteins in brain varies in different cell types and the effects of complement activation in various disease settings appear to differ. Understanding the functioning of this cascade is essential, as it has therapeutic implications. In this review, we will attempt to provide insight into how this complex cascade functions and to identify potential strategic targets for therapeutic intervention in chronic diseases as well as acute injury in the CNS.

AB  - Summary.? Infection frequently elicits a coagulation response. Endotoxin triggers the formation of tissue factor initiating coagulation, down regulates anticoagulant mechanisms including the protein C pathway and heparin-like proteoglycans and up regulates plasminogen activator inhibitor. The overall physiological result of this is to promote coagulation through enhancing initiation, suppressing negative regulation and impairing fibrin removal. The response to infection also leads to tissue destruction. Nucleosomes and histones released from the injured cells trigger further inflammation, protection from the pathogen but further tissue injury leading to multi-organ failure. Such a complex response to infection presumably arises due to the role of coagulation in the control and clearance of the infectious agent.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - Abstract There is a growing awareness that complement plays an integral role in human physiology and disease, transcending its traditional perception as an accessory system for pathogen clearance and opsonic cell killing. As the list of pathologies linked to dysregulated complement activation grows longer, it has become clear that targeted modulation of this innate immune system opens new windows of therapeutic opportunity for anti-inflammatory drug design. Indeed, the introduction of the first complement-targeting drugs has reignited a vibrant interest in the clinical translation of complement-based inhibitors. Compstatin was discovered as a cyclic peptide that inhibits complement activation by binding C3 and interfering with convertase formation and C3 cleavage. As the convergence point of all activation pathways and a molecular hub for crosstalk with multiple pathogenic pathways, C3 represents an attractive target for therapeutic modulation of the complement cascade. A multidisciplinary drug optimization effort encompassing rational ?wet? and in silico synthetic approaches and an array of biophysical, structural and analytical tools has culminated in an impressive structure-function refinement of compstatin, yielding a series of analogues that show promise for a wide spectrum of clinical applications. These new derivatives have improved inhibitory potency and pharmacokinetic profiles and show efficacy in clinically relevant primate models of disease. This review provides an up-to-date survey of the drug design effort placed on the compstatin family of C3 inhibitors, highlighting the most promising drug candidates. It also discusses translational challenges in complement drug discovery and peptide drug development and reviews concerns related to systemic C3 interception.

AB  - Summary Cumulative evidence indicates a role for the complement system in both pathology and recovery after ischemic stroke. Here, we review the current understanding of the dual role of complement in poststroke injury and recovery, and discuss the challenges of anti-complement therapies. Most complement directed therapeutics currently under investigation or development systemically inhibit the complement system, but since complement is important for immune surveillance and is involved in various homeostatic activities, there are potential risks associated with systemic inhibition. Depending on the target within the complement pathway, other concerns are high concentrations of inhibitor required, low efficacy and poor bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, approaches to target complement inhibitors to specific sites have been investigated. Here, we discuss targeting strategies, with a focus on strategies developed in our lab, to specifically localize complement inhibition to sites of tissue injury and complement activation, and in particular to the postischemic brain. We discuss various injury site-specific targeted complement inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of ischemic stroke treatment, as well as their use as investigative tools for probing complement-dependent pathophysiological processes.
