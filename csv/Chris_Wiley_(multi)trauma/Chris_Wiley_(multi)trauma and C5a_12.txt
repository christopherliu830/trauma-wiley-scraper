AB  - Abstract Hyaluronan (HA) is well known for its biocompatibility and has widespread clinical use. To change its mechanical and physiologic properties to adapt to specific clinical scenarios, HA is crosslinked with chemically reactive linker molecules, most of which are toxic chemical reagents. Adverse events related to clinical use of crosslinked HA have been documented. Although approved by the FDA as dermal filler, the safety of perineural application of 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE)-crosslinked HA has not been assessed critically. Concern exists owing to the vulnerability of neural tissues, because of their elongated morphology, high ratio of membrane surface area to cell volume, and complicated electrophysiologic properties. In this study, we systematically investigated the toxicity profile of BDDE-crosslinked HA, using in vitro and in vivo experiments in a rat model. The in vivo experiments included the evaluation of aspects of histopathology, electrophysiology, and neurobehavior. There were no significant changes in the treatment group compared with the control group in all aspects of the experiments, except for the increased epineurial vascular formation in the 0.5% crosslinked HA-treated group during 2 weeks of observation. Further studies involving perineural application of BDDE-crosslinked HA can be done based on our findings, which ruled out the safety concern of cytotoxicity and adverse changes in electrophysiology and neurobehavior. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - To cite this article: Hammad H, Lambrecht BN. Dendritic cells and airway epithelial cells at the interface between innate and adaptive immune responses. Allergy 2011; 66: 579?587. Abstract Because they can recognize and sample inhaled allergens, dendritic cells (DC) have been shown to be responsible for the initiation and maintenance of adaptive Th2 responses in asthma. It is increasingly clear that DC functions are strongly influenced by a crosstalk with neighboring cells like epithelial cells. Whereas the epithelium was initially considered only as a barrier, it is now seen as a central player in controlling the function of lung DCs through release of innate cytokines-promoting Th2 responses. Clinically relevant allergens, as well as known environmental and genetic risk factors for allergy and asthma, often interfere directly or indirectly with the innate immune functions of airway epithelial cells and DC. A better understanding of these interactions might lead to a better prevention and ultimately to new treatments for asthma.

AB  - Abstract Assays facilitating the measurement of mediators and markers of allergic inflammation have evolved during the past 40 years, arising from two primary discoveries: first, that immunoglobulin E (IgE) is the source of reaginic activity in serum, and second, that tissue mast cells and blood basophils cells expressing the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεR1)?respond to allergen by releasing the most relevant mediators underlying immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Naturally, skin testing has long been used to assess the in vivo mast cell response to allergen. Basophils, however, by virtue of their accessibility and the fact that they are the sole source of many of these mediators among blood leukocytes, continue to dominate the performance of in vitro assays assessing IgE-mediated responses.

AB  - Summary:? The discovery of antibodies specific for citrullinated protein epitopes [anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)] is a hallmark for the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and will also be a useful tool for understanding the fundamental pathologic processes. There are several essential questions pertaining to ACPA that remain to be explored, such as understanding the early specificity of the underlying T-cell recognition, whether the production of ACPA is a primary or secondary process, and in the event of such antibodies being arthritogenic, whether they could possibly regulate the disease development. To answer these questions, animal models are needed, but unfortunately ACPA is not a prominent feature of any of the classical animal models of RA. However, we showed recently that ACPA can be isolated from animals susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis that are specific for citrullinated type II collagen (CII). The citrulline specificity could be visualized, and the specificity is determined primarily by a direct interaction with citrulline. We also demonstrated that these antibodies are specific for the citrullinated epitopes and are pathogenic in vivo. A new hypothesis to explain how inflammation in RA can be directed to cartilaginous joints and be self-perpetuating is suggested, which involves recognition of post-translational modifications (glycosylation and citrullination) on CII by T and B cells that can have both arthritogenic and regulatory consequences.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.
