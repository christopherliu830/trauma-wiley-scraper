AB  - Abstract Many years of research have resulted in the successful examples of immunotherapies for many diseases including cancers and inflammatory diseases. These new treatments are referred to as biological therapies-such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine therapies. The recent technological advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) development have caused significant investment and interest in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. Therefore, this chapter will highlight these new advances in the biological therapy arena.

AB  - Background Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal skin disease of cats and dogs. The most common pathogens of small animals belong to the genera Microsporum and Trichophyton. It is an important skin disease because it is contagious, infectious and can be transmitted to people. Objectives The objective of this document is to review the existing literature and provide consensus recommendations for veterinary clinicians and lay people on the diagnosis and treatment of dermatophytosis in cats and dogs. Methods The authors served as a Guideline Panel (GP) and reviewed the literature available prior to September 2016. The GP prepared a detailed literature review and made recommendations on selected topics. The World Association of Veterinary Dermatology (WAVD) provided guidance and oversight for this process. A draft of the document was presented at the 8th World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology (May 2016) and was then made available via the World Wide Web to the member organizations of the WAVD for a period of three months. Comments were solicited and posted to the GP electronically. Responses were incorporated by the GP into the final document. Conclusions No one diagnostic test was identified as the gold standard. Successful treatment requires concurrent use of systemic oral antifungals and topical disinfection of the hair coat. Wood's lamp and direct examinations have good positive and negative predictability, systemic antifungal drugs have a wide margin of safety and physical cleaning is most important for decontamination of the exposed environments. Finally, serious complications of animal?human transmission are exceedingly rare.

AB  - Summary Many neurological diseases share pathological processes that require an understanding of genetics or immunity. This chapter considers these from the perspective of the molecular lesion rather than the clinical manifestation. It examines abnormalities of ion channels, which can be affected by either inherited mutations or autoantibodies. The chapter then deals with genetic disorders and neuro-immunology. Genetic diseases can be divided into five main categories: Abnormalities in the structure or complement of chromosomes (chromosomal disorders), Mutations or other defects affecting a gene; Nucleotide repeat expansions; Mendelian disorders that are likely to be caused by digenic or epistatic inheritance; and Conditions in which genetic and environmental factors interact.The immune system distinguishes the self from non-self organisms and acts to delete, disable or inactivate foreign invaders. Neurological channelopathies potentially identify signalling pathways and circuits involved in diseases that account for a large fraction of neurological practice.

AB  - Background Intradermal test (IDT) is used widely for determination of allergens to include in allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT). The optimal concentration of allergen solutions used for testing has not been established in atopic dogs. Inadequate concentrations could lead to falsely negative test results and lack of inclusion of important allergens in AIT. Hypothesis/Objectives To compare IDT reactivity to two concentrations of five pollen extracts and determine the effect on ASIT prescription. Animals Atopic dogs (n = 67) had IDT results including all of the allergens of interest. Methods and materials Medical records from a veterinary teaching hospital were reviewed for all atopic dogs undergoing IDT over a three year period. In addition to the hospital's standard IDT concentration of 1,000 PNU/mL for pollen allergens, five pollen allergens of higher concentration (3,000?8,000 PNU/mL) had been added at the beginning of that period. The IDT scores for the standard test concentration of each of the five allergens were compared to the scores for the higher concentration. Results Positive reactions occurred much more commonly to the higher test concentration for each of the paired allergens (P < 0.05, chi-square). The AIT formulation was different in 58% of the dogs from what it would have been without the higher concentration allergens. Conclusions and clinical importance The current standard IDT concentration of 1,000 PNU/mL for pollen allergens is likely too low, possibly resulting in inaccurate AIT formulations. This might explain treatment failures and the incorrect diagnosis of atopic-like dermatitis. Further work is needed to establish optimal allergen test concentrations.
