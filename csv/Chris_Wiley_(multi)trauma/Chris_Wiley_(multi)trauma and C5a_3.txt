AB  - The serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), also known as GC-globulin, is a multifunctional protein known for its role in the transport of vitamin D metabolites. DBP also binds fatty acids and actin monomers, preventing their polymerization that could be detrimental in the circulatory system. DBP may have immune functions independent of its role as a transporter of vitamin D. Because of the abundance of DBP, many aspects of its basic biochemistry were quickly established. Other features of vitamin D action, particularly transcriptional mechanisms of regulation, received greater focus and early interest in DBP centred on its value as a tool for population genetics because of its intriguing genetic variations. Nonetheless, knowledge of DBP mechanisms in physiology was obtained, and functions beyond vitamin D ligand binding were identified. With the recent increased attention regarding the benefits of vitamin D (bone health and immunological regulation), there has been a resurgence of interest in DBP. Because DBP is the primary transporter of vitamin D, it has a role in maintaining the total levels of vitamin D for the organism and in regulating the amounts of free (unbound) vitamin D available for specific tissues and cell types to utilize. This review will describe the findings on the basic biochemistry and molecular biology of DBP, the studies that elucidated its biological functions and highlight these results in light of the current renewed interest in vitamin D and human health, as well as the debate over what constitutes sufficient levels of vitamin D.

AB  - Abstract Liver cell death induced by stresses such as ischemia-reperfusion, cholestasis and drug toxicity can trigger a sterile inflammatory response with activation of innate immune cells through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). A similar inflammatory response can be induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as endotoxin. Both DAMPs and PAMPs activate through toll-like receptors the resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) and recruit activated neutrophils and monocytes into the liver. Central to this inflammatory response is promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by these phagocytes. ROS are the principal toxic mediators by which inflammatory cells kill their targets, e.g. bacteria during host defense but also hepatocytes and other liver cells. The mechanism of ROS-induced cell killing during inflammation involves the promotion of mitochondrial dysfunction through an intracellular oxidant stress in hepatocytes leading mainly to oncotic necrosis and less apoptosis. The additional release of cell contents amplifies the inflammatory injury. However, an inflammatory oxidant stress insufficient to directly cause cell damage can induce transcription of stress defence genes including antioxidant genes. This preconditioning effect of ROS enhances the resistance against future inflammatory oxidant stress and promotes the initiation of tissue repair processes. Despite the substantial progress in our understanding of mechanisms of inflammatory liver injury during the last decade, more research is necessary to better understand the role of ROS in acute liver inflammation and to develop clinically applicable therapeutic strategies that selectively target the detrimental effects of oxidant stress without compromising the vital function of ROS in host defense.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Keeping a small stock of liquid plasma readily available for transfusion is common practise in Sweden. We report data on complement activation markers in plasma components during storage in the liquid state and the kinetics of C3a-desArg after transfusion of autologous plasma with high content of C3a-desArg. Material and Methods? Plasma components were prepared by apheresis or from whole blood. C3 fragments (C3a-desArg, C3d,g, iC3), and soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9) were investigated. C3a-desArg kinetics was investigated in regular apheresis donors. Results? Apheresis plasma prepared by membrane centrifugation had significantly higher level of C3a-desArg, C3d,g and sC5b-9 from day 0 and low iC3, than plasma prepared by other methods. By storage day 7, C3a-desArg -levels were above the reference value in 88% of all components. After re-infusion of autologous plasma with high C3a-desArg content, there were rapid a1 and a2-distribution followed by a slower b-elimination phase. Conclusion? Plasma components prepared by different methods and stored in the liquid phase differ significantly in the amount and timing of complement activation. C3a-desArg present in plasma is rapidly eliminated after transfusion. Autologous plasma could be used to study complement kinetics in different clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract The study was designed to investigate whether complement is activated in patients subject to rectal surgery and whether the choice of surgical technique (open or laparoscopic) has any impact on the activation of complement. Our hypothesis is that laparoscopic surgery leads to a lower-level activation of complement than open surgery. Patients (n?=?24) subject to rectal surgery owing to rectal cancer were included. The study was prospective and randomized. The patients were randomized to either laparoscopic surgery (n?=?12) or open surgery (n?=?12). Blood samples for determination of complement activation (C4d, Bb, C3bc and the terminal C5b-9 complex TCC) were drawn before start of surgery (T0) and at the following time-points after start of surgery: 180?min (T1), 360?min (T2), 24?h (T3) and 3?5?days (T4). A significant increase in the alternative pathway activation product Bb and in the terminal pathway activation product TCC was seen over time in both groups (P?<?0.001). Bb peaked early (T1) and returned to baseline levels post-operatively, whereas TCC increased steadily with maximum values in the late post-operative period. The plasma concentrations of C4d and C3bc decreased significantly in both groups at T1 and T2 and returned to baseline levels at T4. There was no significant difference between the groups. Rectal surgery causes activation of the complement system. Complement is activated through the alternative pathway. Results mostly showed no significant differences between laparoscopic and open rectal surgery apart from lower levels of factor Bb in the former group in the perioperative period.

AB  - Abstract The effects of cell size, shape and deformability on cellular function have long been a topic of interest. Recently, mechanical phenotyping technologies capable of analysing large numbers of cells in real time have become available. This has important implications for biology and medicine, especially haemato-oncology and immunology, as immune cell mechanical phenotyping, immunologic function, and malignant cell transformation are closely linked and potentially exploitable to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we introduce the technologies used to analyse cellular mechanical properties and review emerging findings following the advent of high throughput deformability cytometry. We largely focus on cells from the myeloid lineage, which are derived from the bone marrow and include macrophages, granulocytes and erythrocytes. We highlight advances in mechanical phenotyping of cells in suspension that are revealing novel signatures of human blood diseases and providing new insights into pathogenesis of these diseases. The contributions of mechanical phenotyping of cells in suspension to our understanding of drug mechanisms, identification of novel therapeutics and monitoring of treatment efficacy particularly in instances of haematologic diseases are reviewed, and we suggest emerging topics of study to explore as high throughput deformability cytometers become prevalent in laboratories across the globe.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - The recruitment of leukocytes to a tissue is a critical step in the inflammatory response. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important receptor involved in the initiation of inflammatory responses. Administration of the ligand for TLR4, lipopolysaccharide, is often used to model inflammation?local responses to stimuli within a specific tissue and systemic responses such as those observed during endotoxic or septic shock. Here, we review work, which demonstrates that in response to local activation of TLR4, highly coordinated and multistep processes are initiated, ultimately resulting in the leukocyte?s arrival at the inflamed tissue. In contrast, systemic activation of TLR4 results in nonspecific accumulation of leukocytes within the lung capillaries and liver sinusoids through mechanisms profoundly different than those involved in local tissue recruitment. Contrary to current dogma, leukocyte accumulation in the lung is dependent on endothelial rather than leukocyte activation. Finally, we discuss recent evidence suggesting that activation of leukocytes through TLR4, although still in the circulation, effectively paralyzes inflammatory cells, rendering them incapable of appropriate trafficking to inflamed tissues.
