AB  - Summary Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is a frequent cause of severe skin infections. The ability to control the infection is largely dependent on the rapid recruitment of neutrophils (PMN). To gain more insight into the dynamics of PMN migration and host?pathogen interactions in vivo, we used intravital two-photon (2-P) microscopy to visualize S.?aureus skin infections in the mouse. Reporter S.?aureus strains expressing fluorescent proteins were developed, which allowed for detection of the bacteria in vivo. By employing LysM-EGFP mice to visualize PMN, we observed the rapid appearance of PMN in the extravascular space of the dermis and their directed movement towards the focus of infection, which led to the delineation of an abscess within 1 day. Moreover, tracking of transferred labelled bone-marrow neutrophils showed that PMN localization to the site of infection is dependent on the presence of G-protein-coupled receptors on the PMN, whereas Interleukin-1 receptor was required on host cells other than PMN. Furthermore, the S.?aureus complement inhibitor Ecb could block PMN accumulation at thesite of infection. Our results establish that 2-P microscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the orchestration of the immune cells, S.?aureus location and gene expression in vivo on a single cell level.

AB  - Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the often fatal sequelae of a broad range of precipitating conditions. Despite decades of intensive research and clinical trials there remain no therapies in routine clinical practice that target the dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response that characterises ARDS. Neutrophils play a central role in the initiation, propagation and resolution of this complex inflammatory environment by migrating into the lung and executing a variety of pro-inflammatory functions. These include degranulation with liberation of bactericidal proteins, release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species as well as production of neutrophil extracellular traps. Although these functions are advantageous in clearing bacterial infection, the consequence of associated tissue damage, the contribution to worsening acute inflammation and prolonged neutrophil lifespan at sites of inflammation are deleterious. In this review, the importance of the neutrophil will be considered, together with discussion of recent advances in understanding neutrophil function and the factors that influence them throughout the phases of inflammation in ARDS. From a better understanding of neutrophils in this context, potential therapeutic targets are identified and discussed. ? 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal muscle continuously adapts to changes in its mechanical environment through modifications in gene expression and protein stability that affect its physiological function and mass. However, mechanical stresses commonly exceed the parameters that induce adaptations, producing instead acute injury. Furthermore, the relatively superficial location of many muscles in the body leaves them further vulnerable to acute injuries by exposure to extreme temperatures, contusions, lacerations or toxins. In this article, the molecular, cellular, and mechanical factors that underlie muscle injury and the capacity of muscle to repair and regenerate are presented. Evidence shows that muscle injuries that are caused by eccentric contractions result from direct mechanical damage to myofibrils. However, muscle pathology following other acute injuries is largely attributable to damage to the muscle cell membrane. Many feaures in the injury-repair-regeneration cascade relate to the unregulated influx of calcium through membrane lesions, including: (i) activation of proteases and hydrolases that contribute muscle damage, (ii) activation of enzymes that drive the production of mitogens and motogens for muscle and immune cells involved in injury and repair, and (iii) enabling protein-protein interactions that promote membrane repair. Evidence is also presented to show that the myogenic program that is activated by acute muscle injury and the inflammatory process that follows are highly coordinated, with myeloid cells playing a central role in modulating repair and regeneration. The early-invading, proinflammatory M1 macrophages remove debris caused by injury and express Th1 cytokines that play key roles in regulating the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of satellite cells. The subsequent invasion by anti-inflammatory, M2 macrophages promotes tissue repair and attenuates inflammation. Although this system provides an effective mechanism for muscle repair and regeneration following acute injury, it is dysregulated in chronic injuries. In this article, the process of muscle injury, repair and regeneration that occurs in muscular dystrophy is used as an example of chronic muscle injury, to highlight similarities and differences between the injury and repair processes that occur in acutely and chronically injured muscle. ? 2011 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Summary Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a versatile human pathogen causing diseases ranging from uncomplicated mucosal infections to life-threatening invasive disease. The development of human-relevant animal models of GAS infection and introduction of new technologies have markedly accelerated the pace of discoveries related to GAS host?pathogen interactions. For example, recently investigators have identified pili on the GAS cell surface and learned that they are key components for adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. Similarly, the recent development of a transgenic mouse expressing human plasminogen has resulted in new understanding of the molecular processes contributing to invasive infection. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GAS pharyngeal, invasive and other infections holds the promise of assisting with the development of novel preventive or therapeutic agents for this prevalent human pathogen.
