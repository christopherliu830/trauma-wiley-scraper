AB  - The effects of complement activation on pulmonary vascular permeability are disputed. In rabbit lungs perfused with autologous blood, zymosan activated plasma (ZAP) induced a moderate increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), but did not detectably change the vascular permeability within 2 h. The stronger neutrophil granulocyte (PMN) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), usually gave larger PVR increases and also increased pulmonary vascular permeability. Lungs from neutropenic animals, similarly perfused and given PMA, showed unchanged PVR reactions but had no apparent increase in vascular permeability. Lungs perfused with cell-free medium and given PMA displayed modest PVR increases, and no measurable permeability change. The lung preparatory procedure itself markedly influenced leukocyte circulation. Exsanguination of lung donors decreased the concentration of circulating PMN significantly, and they virtually disappeared from the perfusate within minutes after start of lung perfusion. PMN-mediated effects must therefore have been caused by cells already sequestered in the lungs. We conclude that ZAP docs not induce an increased pulmonary vascular permeability in isolated, perfused rabbit lungs, in contrast to PMA. The permeability effects of PMA appear to be PMN dependent.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate whether major abdominal surgery leads to complement activation and interleukin response and whether the kind of anaesthesia influence complement activation and the release of inflammatory interleukins. The study design was prospective and randomised. Fifty patients undergoing open major colorectal surgery due to cancer disease or inflammatory bowel disease were studied. Twenty-five patients were given total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil, and 25 patients were given inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl. To determine complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9) and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins (tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-8, IL-4 and IL-10), blood samples were drawn preoperatively, 60 minutes after start of surgery, 30 minutes after end of surgery and 24 hours postoperatively. Complement was activated and pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-10) were released during major colorectal surgery. There was no significant difference between TIVA and inhalational anaesthesia regarding complement activation and cytokine release. Major colorectal surgery leads to activation of the complement cascade and the release of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There are no significant differences between total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil and inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl regarding complement activation and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Necrotizing soft tissue infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis (NF), is a fast-spreading life-threatening infection that most commonly affects the lower limbs, groin, or abdomen. Periocular necrotizing fasciitis (PNF) is rare. Limited data exist on PNF immune cell subset; hence, this study aims to determine the representation of immune cell subsets in patients diagnosed with PNF using immunohistochemical stainings. Methods All patients diagnosed with PNF at Copenhagen University Hospital from 2008 to 2018 were included. Their electronic medical records and pathology reports were assessed, and available tissue specimens were reviewed and stained with monoclonal antibodies for CD1a+ Langerhans? cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells, CD68+ histiocytes, CD79α+ B lymphocytes, and FXIIIa+ dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells. The number of positive cells was counted, and an average score was calculated. The location of immune cells and bacteria was assessed. Results The specimens were characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of the fascia, while striated muscle involvement was less frequent. Haemolytic group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and mainly located in the deep dermis and subcutis in close relation to the fascia. Only few areas harboured both bacteria and inflammatory cells. Granulocytes, histiocytes and CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells were demonstrated to be abundant in all patients, while B and T lymphocytes, dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells were less frequent. Conclusion The immune cell subsets found in this study of PNF were consistent with those identified in the literature on NF in other anatomical locations. This study concludes that immune cells are abundant and exhibit a typical pattern in PNF.
