AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To demonstrate that a positive CK-MB in the emergency department (ED) predicts an increased risk for complications of myocar-dial ischemia in patients admitted to the hospital for evaluation of chest pain. Methods: 53 academic and community hospital EDs participated in this prospective observational cohort analysis of 5,120 patients with chest pain without ST-segment elevation on the initial ED 12-lead electrocardiogram. All patients were admitted for evaluation of chest pain in one of the participating hospitals as part of the National Cooperative CK-MB Project. Patients were stratified by whether or not they had an elevated CK-MB level in the ED. CK-MB measurements were made on ED presentation and two hours later. Patient medical records were reviewed for inpatient diagnoses?myocardial infarction (MI) or other diagnosis ?and for ischemic complications?cardiac-related death, recurrent or delayed in-hos-pital MI, significant ventricular arrhythmias, new conduction defects, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Results: 369 (7.2%) of the 5,120 patients had MI. The proportion of patients with any complication in the MI group was 24%, while the complication rate in the non-MI group was 0.4%. In all patients, regardless of final diagnosis, the relative risk of any complication was 16.1 (95% CI 11.0?23.6) in those with a positive ED CK-MB versus negative ED CK-MB patients. Similarly, the relative risk of death was 25.4 (95% CI 10.8? 60.2) in positive ED CK-MB versus negative ED CK-MB patients. Conclusions: Multicenter data support the hypothesis that CK-MB measurements can help risk-stratify ED chest pain patients whose initial ECGs are without diagnostic ST-segment elevation.

AB  - Summary We conducted a prospective study of non-cardiac surgical patients aged 70?years or more in 23 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. We studied 4158 consecutive patients of whom 2845 (68%) had pre-existing comorbidities. By day 30, 216 (5%) patients had died, and 835 (20%) suffered complications; 390 (9.4%) patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Pre-operative factors associated with mortality included: increasing age (80?89?years: OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6?2.8), p?<?0.001; 90+?years: OR 4.0 (95% CI 2.6?6.2), p?<?0.001); worsening ASA physical status (ASA 3: OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.8?5.5), p?<?0.001; ASA 4: OR 12.4 (95% CI 6.9?22.2), p?<?0.001); a pre-operative plasma albumin <?30?g.l?1 (OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8?3.5), p?<?0.001); and non-scheduled surgery (OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3?2.5), p?<?0.001). Complications associated with mortality included: acute renal impairment (OR 3.3 (95% CI 2.1?5.0), p?<?0.001); unplanned Intensive Care Unit admission (OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.9?4.9), p?<?0.001); and systemic inflammation (OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.7?3.7), p?<?0.001). Patient factors often had a stronger association with mortality than the type of surgery. Strategies are needed to reduce complications and mortality in older surgical patients.

AB  - Abstract Patients with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are one of the most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). Although the recognition of patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardized approach to the research framework using a common language for data definitions must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardized data definitions set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive data definitions set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible acute coronary syndrome was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardized data definitions set will facilitate?knowledge translation? by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Today, cardiologists seek to minimize time from symptom onset to interventional treatment for the most favorable results. Hypothesis In the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) symptom complex, sweating can differentiate ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from non?ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) during early hours of infarction. Methods This single-center, prospective, observational study compared symptoms of STEMI and NSTE-ACS patients admitted from August 2012 to July 2014. Results Of 12 913 patients, 90.56% met ACS criteria. Among these, 22.51% had STEMI. Typical angina was the most common symptom (83.82%). On stepwise multiple regression, sweating (odds ratio: 97.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.16-114.14, P < 0.0001) and typical angina (odds ratio: 2.72, 95% CI: 2.18-3.38, P < 0.001) had significant association with STEMI. For diagnosis of STEMI, positive likelihood ratio (LR) and positive predictive value (PPV) were highest for typical angina with sweating (LR: 11.17, 95% CI: 10.31-12.1; PPV: 76.09, 95% CI: 74.37-77.75), followed by sweating with atypical angina (LR: 3.6, 95% CI: 3.07-4.21; PPV: 50.61, 95% CI: 46.45-54.76), typical angina (LR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03-1.07; PPV: 22.97, 95% CI: 22.11-23.84), and atypical angina (LR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69-0.87; PPV: 18.09, 95% CI: 16.32-19.97). C statistic values of 0.859 for typical angina with sweating and 0.519 for typical angina alone reflected high discriminatory value of sweating for STEMI prediction. Conclusions Presence of sweating with ACS symptoms predicts probability of STEMI, even before clinical confirmation. Sweating in association with typical or atypical angina is a much better predictor of STEMI than NSTE-ACS.

AB  - Echocardiography in the emergency room presents exciting practice possibilities that can facilitate prompt and reliable diagnostic evaluations in patients with suspected cardiovascular emergencies. Echocardiography has the diagnostic potentials to evaluate the entire spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities short of delineating coronary anatomy and evaluation of the conduction system. By reliably assessing the global and regional function, visualizing the cardiovascular structures from multiple tomographic planes, and quantitating hemodynamic abnormalities, echocardiography should be able to assist emergency room physician's evaluation and triage of the patients with chest pain syndrome, unexplained dyspnea, hypotension, shock, chest trauma, and cardiac arrest, whereby hopefully minimizing the unnecessary admission to the hospital and facilitating inhospital evaluation of the admitted patients with echocardiographic information. However, the optimal echocardiography practice in the emergency room requires well trained sonongraphers and echocardiographers who can respond to the clinical needs at anytime. Whether an emergency room physician can perform and interpret echocardiographic examinations satisfactorily will depend on his/her level of training and continuing education in this area. Currently, there is no established guideline for performing echocardiography in the emergency room. Further clinical investigations are necessary to define the most optimal and economical utilization of this versatile imaging and hemodynamic diagnostic modality in the emergency room.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Primary graft failure (PGF) is an important contributor to early mortality, accounting for 41% of deaths within the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HT). Donor hypernatremia has been associated with PGF development. However, controversial data exist regarding the impact of sodium deregulation in patient survival after HT. This study aimed to assess the influence of donor hypernatremia on PGF development and to determine the serum sodium level threshold to assist in decision-making for organ procurement. Methods The medical record from 200 HT patients and organ donors were retrospectively assessed and categorized by PGF occurrence. Donor sodium levels were compared and cut-off points obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to assess the effects of factors and covariates that influence PGF development. Results Sodium levels of donors were significantly higher in recipients who developed PGF than those who did not develop PGF (162 vs. 153 mmol/L, P = .001). The sodium cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was 159 mmol/L. The group who received organs from donors with a serum sodium concentration ≥159 mmol/L had a higher incidence of PGF (63.3% vs 32.4%, P < .001). Furthermore, donor sodium levels ≥159 mmol/L increased the likelihood of recipients developing PGF by 3.4 times. It is also observed that the incidence of donor smoking addiction was significantly higher in the PGF group (28.6% vs. 11.5%, P = .004) and donor smoking addiction increased the risk of developing PGF by 2.8 times. Conclusion Smoking addiction and the application of suboptimal organs from donors with hypernatremia contribute to primary graft failure in heart transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aimed to investigate changes in the ultrastructure, apoptosis, cycle progression, and migration ability of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Methods MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured in a rotary cell culture system bioreactor to simulate microgravity for 7 days. The cells were randomly divided into a simulated microgravity (SMG) group and normal gravity control (NG) group. Changes in apoptosis, ultrastructure, cell cycle, and migration ability were evaluated. Results Transmission electron microscopy showed that cells in the SMG group had more secondary lysosomes than the NG groups. The flow cytometry assay showed that the proportion of apoptotic cells in the SMG group was significantly increased compared with the NG group; additionally, the median and interquartile spacing of the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase in the SMG group was lower than in the NG group, but the proportion of cells in the S phase was increased in the SMG group compared with the NG group. The transwell migration assay showed that cell migration in the SMG group was significantly reduced compared with the NG group. The expression of BCL-2 and MMP9 in the SMG group was decreased compared with the NG group, whereas the expression of cyclin D3 in the SMG group was increased. Conclusion Simulated microgravity through rotary cell culture system had significant effects on human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells: the cell cycle and ultrastructure were impaired, apoptosis increased, migration ability decreased, and the expression of BCL-2, cyclin D3, and MMP9 were affected.

AB  - Abstract Sorafenib is the first multi-kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) and is increasingly being used to treat patients with well-differentiated radioiodine-resistant thyroid cancer (DTC). Sorafenib demonstrates targeted activity on several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression of cancer. Sorafenib treatment results in long-term efficacy and low incidence of life-threatening toxicities. Although sorafenib has demonstrated many benefits in patients, the adverse effects cannot be ignored. The most common treatment-related toxicities include diarrhoea, fatigue, hand?foot skin reaction and hypertension. Most of these toxicities are considered mild to moderate and manageable to varying degrees; however, cardiovascular events might lead to death. In this MiniReview, we summarize the adverse effects of sorafenib that commonly occur in patients with advanced cancers.

AB  - Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are rare and are characterized by great clinical variability according to the deletion breakpoint. We report a on 6-year-old girl with a de novo 0.63?Mb deletion on chromosome 6q25.1 who demonstrated multiple congenital anomalies including a ventricular septal defect and an underdeveloped cerebellar vermis. She presented with severe pre- and post-natal growth failure, hyperextensible small joints (Beighton scores?=?8/9; with normal parental scores), and an abnormally elastic, redundant skin. Abnormally high upper/lower segment ratio (i.e., 1.34?=?>?3SD), mild dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay were also present. The girl's phenotype was compared with: (i) two girls, each previously reported by Bisgaard et al. and Caselli et al. with similar albeit larger (2.6?7.21?Mb) deletions; (ii) seven additional individuals (6?M; 1?F) harboring deletions within the 6q25.1 region reported in the literature; and (iii) ten further patients (5?M; 4?F; 1 unrecorded sex) recorded in the DECIPHER 6.0 database. We reported on the present girl as her findings could contribute to advance the phenotype of 6q deletions. In addition, the present deletion is the smallest so far recorded in the 6q25 region encompassing eight known genes [vs. 41 of Bisgaard et al., and 23 of Caselli et al.,], including the TAB2 (likely responsible for the girl's congenital heart defect), LATS1 gene, and the UST gene (a regulator of the homeostasis of proteoglycans, which could have played a role in the abnormal dermal and cartilage elasticity). ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Time-out protocols have reportedly improved team dynamics and patients? safety in various clinical settings ? particularly in the operating room. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a Trauma Care checklist, which outlines steps to follow immediately after the primary and secondary surveys and prior to the team leaving the patient. The WHO Trauma Care checklist's main perceived benefit is the prompting of clinicians to complete trauma admissions as per evidence-based guidelines. The WHO Trauma Care checklist, while likely to be successful in reducing errors of omission related to hospital admission, may be limited in its ability to reduce errors that occur in the initial 30 min of trauma reception ? when most of the life-saving decisions are made. To address this limitation a Trauma Team Time-out protocol is proposed for initial trauma resuscitation, targeting the critical first 30 min of hospital reception.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracoronary administration of prourokinase via balloon catheter during primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods Acute STEMI patients underwent primary PCI were randomly divided into two groups: intracoronary prourokinase (IP) group (n?=?118) and control group (n?=?112). During primary PCI, prourokinase or saline were injected to the distal end of the culprit lesion via balloon catheter after balloon catheter dilatation. Demographic and clinical characteristics, infarct size, myocardial reperfusion, and cardiac functions were evaluated and compared between two groups. Hemorrhagic complications and MACE occurred in the 6-months follow up were recorded. Results No significant differences were observed between two groups with respect to baseline demographic, clinical, and angiographic characteristics (P?>?0.05). In IP group, more patients had complete ST segment resolution (>70%) compared with control group (P?<?0.05). Patients in IP group showed lower levels of serum CK, CK-MB and TnI, and a much higher myocardial blood flow (MBF) than those in control group (P?<?0.05). No significant differences of TIMI major or minor bleeding complications were observed between the two groups (P?>?0.05). At 6-months follow-up, there was a trend that patients in the IP group had a less chance to have MACE, though it was not statistically different (8.5% vs 12.5%, P?>?0.05). Conclusions Intracoronary administration of prourokinase via balloon catheter during primary PCI effectively improved myocardial perfusion in STEMI patients.

AB  - Abstract Among the variety of transducer concepts proposed for label-free detection of biomolecules, the semiconductor field-effect device (FED) is one of the most attractive platforms. As medical techniques continue to progress towards diagnostic and therapies based on biomarkers, the ability of FEDs for a label-free, fast and real-time detection of multiple pathogenic and physiologically relevant molecules with high specificity and sensitivity offers very promising prospects for their application in point-of-care and personalized medicine for an early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The presented paper reviews recent advances and current trends in research and development of different FEDs for label-free, direct electrical detection of charged biomolecules by their intrinsic molecular charge. The authors are mainly focusing on the detection of the DNA hybridization event, antibody-antigen affinity reaction as well as clinically relevant biomolecules such as cardiac and cancer biomarkers.
