AB  - Aims The multi-center SPEED registry evaluated the procedural success and in-hospital clinical outcomes of direct stenting with the Svelte ?all-in-one? coronary stent Integrated Delivery System (IDS) through diagnostic catheters to identify the clinical indications for which this approach is appropriately suited. Methods & results Forty-eight (48) patients with 54 lesions of lengths ≤20 mm and RVD 2.5?3.5 mm were targeted for direct stenting through diagnostic catheters (4?6F) via radial or femoral approach. Procedural characteristics early in an investigator's experience (28 lesions) were compared with outcomes following experience (26 lesions). Procedure, device and strategy success were realized in 54 (100%), 50 (93%) and 46 (85%) lesions, respectively, with strategy success significantly related to RVD (P?=?0.05), lesion location (P?=?0.01), and diagnostic catheter size (P?=?0.05). Significant improvement in crossing and intervention time and trends toward improvement in device and strategy success, reductions in procedure and radiation time and contrast use were observed. Conclusions Direct stenting through diagnostic catheters via radial or femoral approach using the Svelte IDS is feasible and associated with good in-hospital outcomes. This approach offers the attractive option of assessing lesions via diagnostic catheter and, depending upon vessel anatomy and lesion morphology, continuing with ad-hoc interventional treatment using the same diagnostic catheter. Improvements in strategy success and procedural efficiencies, based on operator experience, facilitate catheter downsizing and reduce intervention time, ancillary product use and overall procedure costs. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Echocardiography in the emergency room presents exciting practice possibilities that can facilitate prompt and reliable diagnostic evaluations in patients with suspected cardiovascular emergencies. Echocardiography has the diagnostic potentials to evaluate the entire spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities short of delineating coronary anatomy and evaluation of the conduction system. By reliably assessing the global and regional function, visualizing the cardiovascular structures from multiple tomographic planes, and quantitating hemodynamic abnormalities, echocardiography should be able to assist emergency room physician's evaluation and triage of the patients with chest pain syndrome, unexplained dyspnea, hypotension, shock, chest trauma, and cardiac arrest, whereby hopefully minimizing the unnecessary admission to the hospital and facilitating inhospital evaluation of the admitted patients with echocardiographic information. However, the optimal echocardiography practice in the emergency room requires well trained sonongraphers and echocardiographers who can respond to the clinical needs at anytime. Whether an emergency room physician can perform and interpret echocardiographic examinations satisfactorily will depend on his/her level of training and continuing education in this area. Currently, there is no established guideline for performing echocardiography in the emergency room. Further clinical investigations are necessary to define the most optimal and economical utilization of this versatile imaging and hemodynamic diagnostic modality in the emergency room.

AB  - Hip fractures in the elderly are a serious problem for the health service due to the high rate of complications. One of these complications is pressure ulcers that, according to the literature, occur in 8.8% to 55% of patients and mainly arise in the sacral area. The present randomised controlled trial tests whether applying a new innovative multi-layer polyurethane foam dressing (ALLEVYN LIFE?), reduces the onset of pressure ulcers in the sacral area. From March to December 2016, 359 fragility hip fracture patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 182 in the control group and 177 in the experimental group. Pressure ulcers occurred overall in 36 patients (10%): 8 patients (4.5%) in the experimental group compared to 28 (15.4%) in the control group: P = 0.001, relative risk 0.29 (95% CI 0.14-0.61) with NNT of 9 (95% CI 6-21). In the experimental group the onset of pressure ulcers occurred on average on the 6th day compared to the 4th day in the control group (HR 4.4). Using polyurethane foam is effective at reducing the rate of pressure ulcers in the sacrum in elderly patients with hip fracture. The adhesiveness of this device also enables costs to be kept down.

AB  - Since Haissaguerre and his colleagues demonstrated the importance of the pulmonary veins in the generation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 1998, a variety of different ablative interventions have been performed to eliminate AF. Various complications related to catheterization, ablation itself including pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial effusion, stroke, and atrioesophageal fistula have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome characterized by enhanced activation of coagulation with some intravascular fibrin formation and deposition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient whose condition was complicated by DIC after segmental ostial isolation of pulmonary veins for persistent AF. The patient has completely recovered from the DIC by hemodialysis, administration of blood constituents for 15 days.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries an increasing incidence rate worldwide and increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as the medical expenses during the post-AKI course. The Taiwan Consortium for Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKs) has thus launched a nationwide epidemiology and prognosis of dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (NEP-AKI-D) study, which prospectively enrols critically ill patients with AKI. Through thoroughly evaluating the risk and prognostic factors of AKI, we hope to lower the incidence of AKI and ESRD from the perspective of AKI-ESRD interaction. Methods The CAKs includes 30 hospitals which distribute widely through the four geographical regions (north, middle, south, and east) of Taiwan, and have a 1:1 ratio of medical centres to regional hospitals in each region. The NEP-AKI-D study enrols intensive care unit-based AKI patients who receive dialysis in the four seasonal sampled months (October 2014, along with January, April, and July 2015) in the included hospitals. The collected data include demographic information, pertaining laboratory results, dialysis settings and patient outcomes. The data are uploaded in a centre website and will be audited by on-site principal investigators, computer logic gates, and the CAKs staffs. The outcomes of interest are in-hospital mortality, dialysis-dependency and readmission rate within 90 days after discharge. Conclusion The NEP-AKI-D study enrols a large number of representative AKI patients throughout Taiwan. The results of the current study are expected to provide more insight into the risk and prognostic factors of AKI and further attenuated further chronic kidney disease transition.

AB  - Summary Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Genitourinary tract injuries are rare, accounting for <3% of trauma cases. The majority of these injuries are due to blunt trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. In developed countries, iatrogenic injuries are especially prominent in the neonatal period whilst school-age children are prone to sports-related injuries, kicks and straddle injuries. Recent literature regarding pediatric genital trauma has focused on identifying and treating sexual abuse injuries as well as distinguishing these injuries from accidental trauma. This chapter reviews common etiologies for traumatic genital injuries and evaluate current diagnostic and treatment options. Risk factors, presenting signs and the evaluation of sexual abuse will also be reviewed.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Primary graft failure (PGF) is an important contributor to early mortality, accounting for 41% of deaths within the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HT). Donor hypernatremia has been associated with PGF development. However, controversial data exist regarding the impact of sodium deregulation in patient survival after HT. This study aimed to assess the influence of donor hypernatremia on PGF development and to determine the serum sodium level threshold to assist in decision-making for organ procurement. Methods The medical record from 200 HT patients and organ donors were retrospectively assessed and categorized by PGF occurrence. Donor sodium levels were compared and cut-off points obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to assess the effects of factors and covariates that influence PGF development. Results Sodium levels of donors were significantly higher in recipients who developed PGF than those who did not develop PGF (162 vs. 153 mmol/L, P = .001). The sodium cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was 159 mmol/L. The group who received organs from donors with a serum sodium concentration ≥159 mmol/L had a higher incidence of PGF (63.3% vs 32.4%, P < .001). Furthermore, donor sodium levels ≥159 mmol/L increased the likelihood of recipients developing PGF by 3.4 times. It is also observed that the incidence of donor smoking addiction was significantly higher in the PGF group (28.6% vs. 11.5%, P = .004) and donor smoking addiction increased the risk of developing PGF by 2.8 times. Conclusion Smoking addiction and the application of suboptimal organs from donors with hypernatremia contribute to primary graft failure in heart transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The effectiveness of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) has been assumed from low quality studies with multiple biases. This review aimed to (i) evaluate the association between the institution of an MTP and mortality and (ii) determine the effect of MTPs on transfusion practice post trauma. Methods A systematic review of studies that examined patient outcomes before and after the institution of an MTP in the same centre was conducted. The design and results of each study were described. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes from each study were pooled. Results There were eight studies that satisfied inclusion criteria with marked heterogeneity in study populations (I2 = 72.1%, P = 0.001). Two studies showed significantly improved mortality following implementation of an MTP, and six studies showed no significant change. Pooled OR for the effect of an MTP on short-term mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.48?1.11). The effect of MTPs on transfusion practice was varied. Conclusion Despite the popularity of MTPs and directives mandating their use in trauma centres, in before?after studies, MTPs have not always been associated with improved mortality. Evidence-based standardization of MTPs, improved compliance and analysis of broader endpoints were identified as areas for further research.

AB  - Crocus sativus L. (C.?sativus), commonly known as saffron, is used as a food additive, preservative, and medicinal herb. Traditionally, it has been used as an alternative treatment for different diseases. C.?sativus' medicinal effects are related to its major constituents like crocins, crocetin, and safranal. According to the literature, C.?sativus and its constituents could be considered as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, coronary artery diseases, asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, diabetes, and so on. Recently, numerous studies have reported such medicinal properties and found that the underlying mechanisms of action may be mediated by antioxidant, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. C.?sativus enhances the antioxidant capacity and acts as a free radical scavenger. As an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, it modulates inflammatory mediators, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity responses. This review highlights in vitro and animal findings regarding antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of C.?sativus and its constituents. Present review found that the C.?sativus and its main constituents such as safranal, crocins, and crocetin could be effective against various diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulatory effects.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aimed to investigate changes in the ultrastructure, apoptosis, cycle progression, and migration ability of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Methods MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured in a rotary cell culture system bioreactor to simulate microgravity for 7 days. The cells were randomly divided into a simulated microgravity (SMG) group and normal gravity control (NG) group. Changes in apoptosis, ultrastructure, cell cycle, and migration ability were evaluated. Results Transmission electron microscopy showed that cells in the SMG group had more secondary lysosomes than the NG groups. The flow cytometry assay showed that the proportion of apoptotic cells in the SMG group was significantly increased compared with the NG group; additionally, the median and interquartile spacing of the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase in the SMG group was lower than in the NG group, but the proportion of cells in the S phase was increased in the SMG group compared with the NG group. The transwell migration assay showed that cell migration in the SMG group was significantly reduced compared with the NG group. The expression of BCL-2 and MMP9 in the SMG group was decreased compared with the NG group, whereas the expression of cyclin D3 in the SMG group was increased. Conclusion Simulated microgravity through rotary cell culture system had significant effects on human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells: the cell cycle and ultrastructure were impaired, apoptosis increased, migration ability decreased, and the expression of BCL-2, cyclin D3, and MMP9 were affected.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Abstract Sorafenib is the first multi-kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) and is increasingly being used to treat patients with well-differentiated radioiodine-resistant thyroid cancer (DTC). Sorafenib demonstrates targeted activity on several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression of cancer. Sorafenib treatment results in long-term efficacy and low incidence of life-threatening toxicities. Although sorafenib has demonstrated many benefits in patients, the adverse effects cannot be ignored. The most common treatment-related toxicities include diarrhoea, fatigue, hand?foot skin reaction and hypertension. Most of these toxicities are considered mild to moderate and manageable to varying degrees; however, cardiovascular events might lead to death. In this MiniReview, we summarize the adverse effects of sorafenib that commonly occur in patients with advanced cancers.
