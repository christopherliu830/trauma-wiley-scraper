AB  - Introduction Controversy surrounds certain head and neck postures in sport horses and their potential impact on the nuchal ligament. Methods Three dead near-term equine foetuses in lateral recumbency with upper-side neck musculature removed to expose the nuchal ligament were placed in 6 head and neck positions (HNP's) between extreme hyperflexion and hyperextension, along with 3 thoracic positions: Low, Medium and High. In each of these 18 positions, the funicular length, lamella dorsoventral width at the level of C4, and craniocaudal length of the 5 major lamella bands of the nuchal ligament were measured manually. Results In intermediate HNP's (HNP1, HNP2), thoracic postures significantly impacted nuchal ligament measurements. Compared to the Medium thorax position, depression and elevation of the thorax decreased lamella sheet widths by 24% (P?=?0.014) and 11% (P?=?0.267) respectively for HNP1, and by 8% (P?=?0.01 for both depression and elevation) for HNP2. More extreme head and neck positions were not associated with any change in measurements of the nuchal ligament with changes in thoracic position. Conclusions A decreased width suggests increased tension in an elastic structure. Hence, if the anatomical connections are similar in adults, extreme head and neck postures may reduce the effect that thoracic posture might have on the nuchal ligament in certain unnatural positions required in sport horses and may interfere with normal elastic energy storage in the nuchal ligament during movement.

AB  - Introduction The simplest model of circular locomotion is a point mass moving uniformly on a circle. To produce circular motion, a centripetal force is generated. This study investigated contributions of individual limbs to the net centripetal force in horses trotting on a circle. Methods Six horses trotted on a 6?m diameter circle at their preferred speed. Optical motion capture (Motion Analysis Corp) recorded kinematics, while six force plates (AMTI) recorded ground reaction forces (GRF). Whole body center of mass (CoM) was computed using a 23-segment rigid body model. The GRF of each limb was expressed at the CoM in cylindrical coordinates centered at a best-fit circle of the ground path of the CoM. Average vertical, tangential and radial force components were computed for each limb over the whole stride duration. Forces were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Results The maximum ground-path deviation of the CoM from the best-fit circle among all trials was only 2.8% of the radius. The forelimbs contributed an average centripetal (radial) force of 0.49 ± 0.16?N/kg (mean ± SD, normalized to body mass), which was significantly greater (P<0.001) than the hind limb contribution of 0.36 ± 0.13?N/kg. There was no significant difference between inside and outside limbs. Conclusions The contribution of individual limbs to the centripetal force provided a direct indication of their role in circular locomotion. The forelimbs generated significantly more centripetal force, possibly in direct relation to their greater support of the body mass against gravity.

AB  - Introduction Minimal research has examined the effect of draft loading on equine muscle activity. It is hypothesised that increases in draft load of 10 and 20% body mass (BM) will increase EMG intensity and duration of vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) during walk. Methods Data were collected from six Irish Cob geldings (11?±?4 years; height: 1.47?±?0.05?m; BM: 490?±?65?kg) all trained to draft-load. A modified lorry tyre was used as a loading platform. Surface EMG electrodes were positioned over VL and GL. An accelerometer placed on the left hind hoof collected kinematic data. EMG and accelerometer data at a draft load equivalent to 0 (zero load), 10 and 20% BM were recorded as the horses were led at walk in a 20?m straight line. A stopwatch determined mean speed over 20?m. Mean kinematic and EMG values were determined for 10 consecutive strides. EMG intensities were normalised to each horse. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test explored data normality. Friedman test (P<0.05) compared between conditions. A pair-wise Wilcoxon signed ranks test identified where the differences lay. Results Data for one horse was excluded because of poor accelerometer data. The remaining horses (n?=?5) maintained a constant velocity (1.10?±?0.02?m/s {SD}) between conditions (P>0.7). VL and GL increased their muscular activity in terms of EMG intensity and duration of contraction with increasing draft load from 0 to 10% and 10 to 20% BM (P?=?0.04; n?=?5). Conclusions Draft loading can be utilised for strength training following injury or to improve athletic performance.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred foals are born with fully developed hooves and stand within minutes. A ring in the horn occurs at birth and grows down the hoof wall, marking the fetal hoof (distal) and foal hoof (proximal). Birth rings in hoof horn have been noted in other species and used to estimate age. Hoof wall renewal in all ages of horse has been poorly reported; horn growth and complete hoof capsule renewal has not been measured in Thoroughbred foals. Partial hoof wall avulsions are relatively common. The objective was to measure the time taken for the fetal hoof of a newborn foal to grow out and be replaced by hoof grown since birth. Methods Thoroughbred foals (N?=?150) on four Newmarket stud farms were studied during June to September. The age of the foal and the day that routine hoof trimming removed the remnants of the fetal hoof of the front hooves was recorded. Foals that were on restricted exercise, ill or where the remnants of the fetal hoof still remained after trimming were excluded from the data. 45 foals fulfilled the criteria. The data were tabulated in Excel, analysed in Minitab and assessed for normality (Anderson-Darling). Results The mean age at which the fetal hoof grew out was 145?±?15 days (95% confidence interval, 141.77?147.16). Conclusions Thoroughbred foals replace the fetal hoof at twice the speed given for mature horses (270?365 days). Knowing the time of hoof renewal will allow accurate predictions of healing to be made in cases of partial hoof wall avulsion and other hoof lesions.

AB  - Abstract Medical educators are increasingly charged with the development of outcomes-based ?best practices? in medical student and resident education and patient care. To fulfill this mission, a cadre of well-trained, experienced medical education researchers is required. The experienced medical educator is in a prime position to fill this need but often lacks the training needed to successfully contribute to such a goal. Towards this end, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Group on Educational Affairs developed a series of content-based workshops that have resulted in Medical Education Research Certification (MERC), promoting skills development and a better understanding of research by educators. Subsequently, the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) partnered with the AAMC to take MERC a step further, in the MERC at CORD Scholars Program (MCSP). This venture integrates a novel, mentored, specialty-specific research project with the traditional MERC workshops. Collaborative groups, based on a common area of interest, each develop a multi-institutional project by exploring and applying the concepts learned through the MERC workshops. Participants in the inaugural MCSP have completed three MERC workshops and initiated a project. Upon program completion, each will have completed MERC certification (six workshops) and gained experience as a contributing author on a mentored education research project. Not only does this program serve as a multi-dimensional faculty development opportunity, it is also intended to act as a catalyst in developing a network of education scholars and infrastructure for educational research within the specialty of emergency medicine.

AB  - Introduction Field exercise tests (FET) can assist design of individualized training programs. Although FETs have been used in other breeds, there are limited reports for Quarter horses (QH) and cross-bred QH which are widely used in traditional Venezuelan equestrian activities. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of an FET in cross-bred Quarter horses in Venezuela. Methods Six horses (3 stallions and 3 mares) performed a FET consisting of a four-step incremental increase in speed (91?±?10; 136?±?3; 271?±?20; 439?±?43?m/min). Each cycle lasted 3 to 5?min with 3 minutes of rest between each. Environmental temperature was 32°C. Heart rate and speed were recorded (Polar Equine RS800CX?) and the speed to reach a heart rate of 200 and 170 beats/min was calculated by linear regression. The rate of heart rate decline was determined 5 minutes after the last step. Linear regression analysis, descriptive statistics and an unpaired t- test (Graph Pad Prism 5.0) were utilized to identify gender differences (P<0.05). Results Gender did not influence the results. V200 and V170 were slightly higher in stallions (617?±?98 and 465?±?66?m/min, respectively) than in mares (511?±?60 and 387?±?60?m/min, respectively). The rate of heart rate decline was slightly more rapid in mares (25?±?7 beats/min) compared to stallions (13?±?5 beats/min). Conclusions Although a low number of horses were evaluated, these preliminary data suggest that gender has limited influence on fitness of cross-bred Quarter horses used in local Venezuelan equestrian activities under tropical environmental conditions. The mean V200 and V170 values obtained were lower than those reported for Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds, but similar to those reported in young racing Quarter horses.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to validate a field standardized exercise test (SET) adapted for young endurance horses and to evaluate the effects of age/conditioning level on speed and heart rate values. Methods The study involved 31 horses of Arabian origin bred specifically for endurance and aged 4?yo (n?=?11), 5?yo (n?=?13) or 6?yo (n?=?7). The SET consisted of a warm-up, followed by 15 (4?yo), 30 (5?yo) or 45 (6?yo) minutes of canter at a comfortable steady speed, and finished with 500 meters of fast gallop. Heart rate (HR) was recorded continuously during the SET. The velocities at which HR reached 160 and 200 beats per minute (V160 and V200) were calculated by the linear regression of HR versus speed. Results All horses were able to complete the SET. Resting HR was higher in 4?y than in 5?y and 6?y (P<0.05 via Student's t test). HR and velocities during the SET did not vary significantly with age. Mean?±?SD values for 4?yo, 5?yo and 6?yo respectively are as follows: Resting HR: 47.5?±?7.2, 42.3?±?3.2, 41.3?±?5.4?bpm; HRcanter: 162.7?±?14.3, 156.9?±?17.3, 161.4?±?10.7?bpm; Vcanter: 22.6?±?0.9, 22.4?±?1.2, 23.3?±?1.6?km/h; HRsprint: 191.3?±?18.1, 181.7?±?18.5, 184.1?±?16.2?bpm; Vsprint: 30.3?±?3.0, 31.5?±?6.4, 35.3?±?6.9?km/h; V160: 25.8?±?3.5, 24.8?±?5.0, 27.1?±?5.8?km/h; V200: 36.8?±?6.1, 37.4?±?7.3, 44.3?±?10.9?km/h; Post-exercice lactatemia: 7.4?±?4.5, 13.5?±?3.6, 5.6?±?3.4?mmol/l. These values perfectly fit with those described previously for adult endurance horses. Conclusions The proposed field SET involved both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism reproducing the progress of an endurance race. Further studies are being conducted to discriminate if possible the effects of age from those of conditioning.

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a dominant, missense mutation in the equine glycogen synthase gene (GYS1) that increases the enzyme's activity. The amino acid sequence surrounding the PSSM1 mutation is highly conserved amongst species from yeast to horses suggesting that this region plays an important role, but its functional significance has yet to be determined. Methods Computer modelling can predict three dimensional (3D) protein structures using related proteins as templates. Yeast glycogen synthase (GS) has high sequence homology (73%) to the equine enzyme and since the yeast enzyme's structure has been solved, we hypothesised that in silico modelling based on the yeast protein using MODELLER and SwissPDBViewer software would predict the enzyme's structure and explain the mutant enzyme's increased activity. Results Homology-modelling revealed that, like the yeast enzyme, equine GS likely forms a tetramer surrounding a catalytic cleft and undergoes large structural rearrangements upon G6P binding to highly-conserved binding sites. The enzyme's glycogen binding sites are located on the extremities of the enzyme and are also conserved in the equine protein. The PSSM1 mutation lay close to the G6P binding site, but did not confer any clear structural rearrangement on the protein's 3D configuration. The mutation was distant from the known phosphorylation sites and the glycogen binding sites. Conclusions The close proximity of the mutation to the G6P binding site suggests that it might influence substrate interaction or allosteric regulation. Further studies evaluating G6P ligand binding and enzyme activation are warranted and might best be made following purification of the mutant and wild type proteins.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the horse and rider partnership is a challenging and complex area. There is limited scientific research regarding the occurrence of misalignments in the horse and rider, and if there is any relationship between the two. This study investigated asymmetry of single horse and rider combinations focusing on pelvis asymmetry. Methods 14 single horse/rider combinations (minimum 6 month partnership) on the same daily routine were assessed. Horses and riders were assessed for misalignments of the pelvis, spine, and neck by a fully qualified human and animal (McTimoney) practitioner on the same day. Triplicate measurements of rider dorsal iliac crest (IC) distance (nearest 0.2?cm) and degree of tilt (0d.p) were recorded, sitting and standing, using a PALM palpation meter to calculate IC height discrepancy. Triplicate horse tuber coxae (TC) heights (nearest 0.5?cm) were measured using a plumb line. Difference between means indicated direction and value of asymmetry relative to symmetry of zero. Student's t-test and Pearson's Product Moment correlation examined asymmetry relationships. Results Mean rider IC height discrepancy, standing, was 0.89?±?0.64?cm and sitting, 1.00?±?0.66?cm. Mean TC height discrepancy was 1.3?±?1.6?cm. Asymmetry of the pelvis was a feature of 93% of horse/rider combinations, 85% occurring in the same direction. There was a significant positive correlation between horse TC and rider IC height discrepancies (r2?=?0.4, F?=?8.24, P?=?0.014). Conclusions This study provides positive evidence of a relationship between the direction of horse pelvic rotation and rider pelvic tilt and also between the degree of tilt and rotation. This has implications for physical therapy treatment of horse and rider. Further research of causal effect relationships of the asymmetries is recommended.

AB  - Abstract Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common and often devastating birth defect that can occur in isolation or as part of a malformation complex. Considerable progress is being made in the identification of genetic causes of CDH. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of ?1Mb resolution to 29 CDH patients with prior normal karyotypes who had been recruited into our multi-site study. One patient, clinically diagnosed with Fryns syndrome, demonstrated a de novo 5Mb deletion at chromosome region 1q41?q42.12 that was confirmed by FISH. Given prior reports of CDH in association with cytogenetic abnormalities in this region, we propose that this represents a locus for Fryns syndrome, a Fryns syndrome phenocopy, or CDH. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Many jurisdictions measure plasma tCO2 to determine if racehorses may have been administered exogenous alkalinizers illegally (?milkshakes?). Our hypothesis was that plasma tCO2 test results vary within a racing jurisdiction due to inter-day instrument variability. Methods Individual or daily mean plasma tCO2 test results from New York (n?=?584) and Maine (n?=?443) Standardbreds and California Thoroughbreds (n?=?23,686) were obtained through legal discovery in adjudicated cases where trainers were accused of tampering with horses resulting in tCO2 concentrations ≥37.0?mmol/L. Daily results were grouped by days on which no horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (LOW) or days on which at least one horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (HIGH). HIGH days were further subsampled by eliminating ?positive? test results ≥37.0?mmol/L (MODIFIED HIGH). With P<0.05 considered significant, differences between groups were compared by Student's t test for means and Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test for medians. Results HIGH tCO2 means (32.9?±?2.6, 35.2?±?3.4, 32.6?±?2.7) and medians (32.9, 35.4, 32.6) for all 3 jurisdictions were higher than LOW means (31.7?±?2.3, 31.9?±?4.3, 31.5?±?0.7) and medians (31.8, 32.9, 31.5) (P<0.001). Even when ?positive? tests ≥37.0 were eliminated, MODIFIED HIGH means (32.5?±?2.2, 33.6?±?2.6, 32.4?±?2.5) and medians (32.7, 34.2, 32.5) were still higher than LOW (P<0.001). Conclusions Unless the population tCO2 mean varies significantly daily, it must be concluded that instrument variability resulted in day-to-day differences in plasma tCO2 test results. Without appropriate quality control including correction of individual suspect results to a contemporaneous standard curve, horse trainers may be accused unfairly of tampering when day-to-day instrument variability contributes to positive plasma tCO2 test results.

AB  - GBS is characterized by ascending motor paresis, hypo/areflexia, minimal objective sensory symptoms, electrophysiological evidence of demyelination, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation. Several related syndromes are regarded as variants being the pathogenesis considered an autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve antigens. A 42-year-old veterinary was admitted because of severe myalgias following one-day high fever. Twelve hours later, he experienced dysphonia, dysphagia, and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination showed: normal eye movements, bilateral facial weakness, tongue paralysis, limb and trunk sensory ataxia. Muscle strength was minimally affected and deep jerks were weakened. Sensory testing revealed distal loss for pin-prick, vibration, and position sense in the four extremities. Normal laboratory included emato-urinary tests, CK, rheumatology and endocrine profiles, microbiological and viral screenings. Search for enteric Campylobacter jejuni was negative. CSF protein was 160?mg/dl (normal?<?45). In serum, antiGQ1b IgG were elevated. On admission, electrophysiology was normal. Twenty days later, in motor nerves conduction velocity was normal whereas evidence of demyelination was limited to prolonged F-waves and terminal latencies. IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) produced transient improvement. Because of relapse of sensory symptoms, 10 days later a course of PE was performed with benefit. Patient was followed clinically during six months showing almost complete recovery. In conclusion, we report an acute neuropathy with benign course, high protein in CSF, predominant involvement of sensory fibers, electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination. The nosologic position of this case seems to fit the criteria of GBS sensory variant. The detection in serum of antiGQ1b IgG proposes similarities with FS and with ataxic GBS suggesting a continuity and a possible common autoimmune mechanism attacking either Schwann cells or motor axons.

AB  - Introduction The fixation of the bridle, particularly the noseband, is important in the horse-rider interaction. The goal of this study was to show the influence of noseband tightness on tensile forces elicited in side reins under traction to position the horse's head. Methods Ten Warmblood horses (2 mares, 8 geldings; mean age: 12.4?±?5.3 years) were assessed during walk and trot on a treadmill. Side reins were used to position the horse's head so that the nose was nearly vertical. Measurements were made with a correctly tightened noseband (two fingers space between the noseband and nasal bone?=?N1) and with a tight noseband (=?N2). Rein forces were measured with an electronic sensor based on a force sensing resistor (27?g, sample rate 120?Hz, Interlink Electronics corp.), synchronized with a kinematic system (10 cameras, 120?Hz, Motion Analysis corp.). The force sensors were calibrated with masses of 1?Kg (=9.81?N) and 4?Kg (=39.24?N). Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS. Normality of data was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test and data were analysed with repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results Side rein forces in N1 were significantly higher than in N2 during walk and trot. Maximum forces at walk were 8.6?±?0.9?N for N1 and 6.7?±?0.95?N for N2. At trot the forces (7.2?±?0.95?N for N1; 5.96?±?0.9?N N2) were significantly reduced compared to walk. There was no significant difference between left and right rein forces. Conclusions This study demonstrated that noseband tightness has an influence on rein tension. The rein forces that were exerted were lower than in ridden horses.

AB  - Introduction Racing Quarter Horses (QH) typically compete at shorter distances and faster speeds than Thoroughbreds (Tbred). The two components of speed are stride rate and stride length. The hypothesis of this study is that racing QH have greater stride rates than Tbreds, and that stride rate decreases as distance increases, even within breed. Methods Five runnings of sprint and classic distance stakes races for both QH (Texas Twister Stakes, 100.6?m; Champion of Champions, 402.3?m) and Tbred (Breeders? Cup Sprint, 1,207.0?m; Breeders? Cup Classic, 2,011.7?m) contested from 2008 to 2012 were obtained and viewed by five individuals. Individuals watched each race three times (in slow motion when needed) and the average number of strides per second taken by the winning horse was calculated. Using the PROC Mixed Procedure of SAS, the averages from the five individuals were used to compare differences between breeds, and between distances within a breed. The stride rates were also used to determine average stride length by factoring in length of each race. Results The average stride rate was greater for QH than for Tbred (2.88 vs 2.34 strides/sec; P<0.0001). Additionally, stride rate decreased (P<0.0001) as distance increased (2.96, 2.81, 2.45, 2.23 strides/sec, respectively). Stride length was longest in the Tbred races and shortest in the 100.6?m QH race (P<0.0001). Conclusions The Tbred stride rates reported here, and associated respiratory rates, have been previously reported and are remarkable. However, QH rates are nearly 25% greater. The associated rapid acceleration and deacceleration of the lower limb and quick breathing rate may have implications for skeletal and respiratory soundness. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in this study and all information was obtained from previously conducted races for which video was publicly available.

AB  - Introduction Increasing cardiac dimension with endurance training is well known in adult athletes. However, adaptation of the heart to training in growing Arabian type horses is less well documented. Methods During the national finals for young endurance horses, standardized echocardiographic examinations were performed before the races by two experienced examiners. In 2011 left ventricle (LV) was assessed in 74 horses aged 4-years (18), 5-years (33) and 6-years (23). In 2012 left atrial (LA) dimensions and the great heart vessels were measured in 122 horses aged 4-years (32), 5-years (40) and 6-years (50). Data were normally distributed; age groups and gender were compared by one-way ANOVA (Holm-Sidak test for multiple comparisons, significance P<0.05); relationships between echocardiographic dimensions and body weight (BWT) were assessed by linear regressions. Results BWT was highest in 5-year old horses. LV dimensions increased with age, but for most measurements the difference was significant only for the group of 6-year old horses. The stroke volume (SV) increased (P?=?0.0016) and the heart rate decreased (P?=?0.06) with increasing age, leading to a constant cardiac output in all age groups. There was a weak relationship between BWT and SV. Two dimensional LA measurements increased between 4 and 5 years but remained constant between 5 and 6 years. LA area measurements and LA functional indices showed no evolution between the groups. Aortic dimension increased with age but pulmonary artery dimension showed no such increase. No influence of gender on echocardiographic dimensions and function could be found. Conclusions Great heart vessels, LA and LV dimensions showed different growth patterns between 4 and 6 years of age. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Alfort Veterinary School and the University of Paris-Est under number 12/07/11-1; owner informed consent was obtained.

AB  - Introduction Muscle glycogen is a potentially limiting substrate for horses during intense exercise. Low-starch, high-fat concentrates have become popular for performance horses, but their effect on muscle glycogen usage and repletion is unclear. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses were studied in a 3?x?3 Latin Square design to measure the effect of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC), fat and fiber intake on glycogen repletion following intense exercise. Horses were fed isocaloric, isonitrogenous rations that supplied high (HS), medium (MS) or low (LS) NSC intake. The horses were fed 1.25% BW/d grass-hay and 1.0% BW/d concentrate. These rations provided 45%, 36% and 18% of total digestible energy (DE) from NSC, 11%, 15% and 23% of total DE from fat, and 30%, 33% and 45% of total DE from fiber. During each 1-month period horses were trained for three weeks on a high-speed treadmill followed by a three-day glycogen-depletion period comprising multiple bouts of intense exercise. Muscle biopsies were taken before and 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-depletion. A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed on day 1 of the depletion period. Results During the SET, lactate was lower in LS compared to MS or HS (P<0.05). Heart rate, plasma glucose, VO2, VCO2 were unaffected by treatment. Muscle glycogen depletion averaged 33%, 30%, and 36% in the HS, MS and LS treatments. Muscle glycogen repletion was significantly lower in the LS group 72 hours post exercise (P<0.05). Conclusions Low NSC concentrates may not provide enough substrate for glycogen repletion following multiple bouts of intense exercise.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the complications and outcome after total prostatectomy in dogs with histologically confirmed prostatic carcinoma. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals 25 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing total prostatectomy were reviewed from 2004 to 2016. Data retrieved included signalment, presenting signs, preoperative clinical findings, laboratory data, diagnostic imaging, surgical technique, histologic diagnosis, postoperative complications, occurrence of postoperative metastasis, and survival. Results Twenty-five dogs underwent total prostatectomy for prostatic carcinoma. Urinary anastomotic techniques included urethrourethral anastomosis in 14 dogs, cystourethral anastomosis in 9 dogs, ureterocolonic anastomosis in 1 dog, and anastomosis between the bladder neck and penile urethra in 1 dog. All dogs survived to discharge. Fifteen dogs were diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma, 8 dogs with prostatic adenocarcinoma, 1 with prostatic cystadenocarcinoma, and 1 with an undifferentiated carcinoma. Permanent postoperative urinary incontinence was present in 8 of 23 dogs. The median survival time was shorter in dogs with extracapsular tumor extension compared with those with intracapsular tumors. The overall median survival time was 231 days (range, 24-1255), with 1- and 2-year survival rates equal to 32% and 12%, respectively. Conclusion and Clinical Significance Total prostatectomy, combined with adjunct therapies, prolongs survival and lowers complication rates compared to previous reports of dogs with prostatic carcinoma. It should be noted, however, that case selection likely played a significant role in postoperative outcome.

AB  - Introduction Despite dressage popularity, little research exists in relation to the rider's posture and effect on aids given to the horse. The aim was to investigate asymmetry during sitting trot and shoulder-in between varying rider abilities. Methods Full body kinematics were collected at 120?Hz (XSENS MVN Biomech) for 10 novice (age 28?±?12 years, height?=?168?±?7?cm) and 10 advanced (age 29?±?6 years, height?=?163?±?4?cm) predominantly right handed participants, with one left handed rider in each group. Range of motion for right hip, left hip, right knee, left knee, right ankle, left ankle, ASIS vertical movement, trunk rotation were generated in Visual 3D. Results Independent t-tests demonstrated significant differences between groups within right and left hip external rotation when straight (P?<?0.001, d?=?2.52; P?=?0.02, d?=?1.25), shoulder-in right (P?=?0.01, d?=?1.47; P?=?0.02, d?=?1.31), only significant in right hip within shoulder-in left (P?=?0.01, d?=?1.30). Axial rotation to the right was found in all conditions, with the range significantly (P<0.05) increased between groups in straight and shoulder-in right, as did right ASIS vertical excursion when riding straight (P?=?0.01, d?=?1.90), and left ASIS excursion within shoulder-in left (P?=?0.04, d?=?1.03). Conclusions Right trunk axial rotation is considered closely linked to right hand dominance, rotating the rider's trunk to the dominant rein aid. Left shoulder-in scored higher which may be because right trunk rotation is one of the aids given to the horse when executing this dressage movement.
