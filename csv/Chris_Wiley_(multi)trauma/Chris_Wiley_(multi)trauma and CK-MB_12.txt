AB  - Abstract Two patients with traumatic high cervical cord injury are described. Both patients required long-term ventilatory support. Diaphragmatic pacing has been successful in meeting their ventilatory requirements and improving their quality of life. Both patients are now living in their own homes. Their medical, nursing and psychosocial needs have been met by multi-disciplinary team involvement and their ongoing support in the community.

AB  - Introduction Controversy surrounds certain head and neck postures in sport horses and their potential impact on the nuchal ligament. Methods Three dead near-term equine foetuses in lateral recumbency with upper-side neck musculature removed to expose the nuchal ligament were placed in 6 head and neck positions (HNP's) between extreme hyperflexion and hyperextension, along with 3 thoracic positions: Low, Medium and High. In each of these 18 positions, the funicular length, lamella dorsoventral width at the level of C4, and craniocaudal length of the 5 major lamella bands of the nuchal ligament were measured manually. Results In intermediate HNP's (HNP1, HNP2), thoracic postures significantly impacted nuchal ligament measurements. Compared to the Medium thorax position, depression and elevation of the thorax decreased lamella sheet widths by 24% (P?=?0.014) and 11% (P?=?0.267) respectively for HNP1, and by 8% (P?=?0.01 for both depression and elevation) for HNP2. More extreme head and neck positions were not associated with any change in measurements of the nuchal ligament with changes in thoracic position. Conclusions A decreased width suggests increased tension in an elastic structure. Hence, if the anatomical connections are similar in adults, extreme head and neck postures may reduce the effect that thoracic posture might have on the nuchal ligament in certain unnatural positions required in sport horses and may interfere with normal elastic energy storage in the nuchal ligament during movement.

AB  - Introduction The simplest model of circular locomotion is a point mass moving uniformly on a circle. To produce circular motion, a centripetal force is generated. This study investigated contributions of individual limbs to the net centripetal force in horses trotting on a circle. Methods Six horses trotted on a 6?m diameter circle at their preferred speed. Optical motion capture (Motion Analysis Corp) recorded kinematics, while six force plates (AMTI) recorded ground reaction forces (GRF). Whole body center of mass (CoM) was computed using a 23-segment rigid body model. The GRF of each limb was expressed at the CoM in cylindrical coordinates centered at a best-fit circle of the ground path of the CoM. Average vertical, tangential and radial force components were computed for each limb over the whole stride duration. Forces were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Results The maximum ground-path deviation of the CoM from the best-fit circle among all trials was only 2.8% of the radius. The forelimbs contributed an average centripetal (radial) force of 0.49 ± 0.16?N/kg (mean ± SD, normalized to body mass), which was significantly greater (P<0.001) than the hind limb contribution of 0.36 ± 0.13?N/kg. There was no significant difference between inside and outside limbs. Conclusions The contribution of individual limbs to the centripetal force provided a direct indication of their role in circular locomotion. The forelimbs generated significantly more centripetal force, possibly in direct relation to their greater support of the body mass against gravity.

AB  - Introduction Minimal research has examined the effect of draft loading on equine muscle activity. It is hypothesised that increases in draft load of 10 and 20% body mass (BM) will increase EMG intensity and duration of vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) during walk. Methods Data were collected from six Irish Cob geldings (11?±?4 years; height: 1.47?±?0.05?m; BM: 490?±?65?kg) all trained to draft-load. A modified lorry tyre was used as a loading platform. Surface EMG electrodes were positioned over VL and GL. An accelerometer placed on the left hind hoof collected kinematic data. EMG and accelerometer data at a draft load equivalent to 0 (zero load), 10 and 20% BM were recorded as the horses were led at walk in a 20?m straight line. A stopwatch determined mean speed over 20?m. Mean kinematic and EMG values were determined for 10 consecutive strides. EMG intensities were normalised to each horse. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test explored data normality. Friedman test (P<0.05) compared between conditions. A pair-wise Wilcoxon signed ranks test identified where the differences lay. Results Data for one horse was excluded because of poor accelerometer data. The remaining horses (n?=?5) maintained a constant velocity (1.10?±?0.02?m/s {SD}) between conditions (P>0.7). VL and GL increased their muscular activity in terms of EMG intensity and duration of contraction with increasing draft load from 0 to 10% and 10 to 20% BM (P?=?0.04; n?=?5). Conclusions Draft loading can be utilised for strength training following injury or to improve athletic performance.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred foals are born with fully developed hooves and stand within minutes. A ring in the horn occurs at birth and grows down the hoof wall, marking the fetal hoof (distal) and foal hoof (proximal). Birth rings in hoof horn have been noted in other species and used to estimate age. Hoof wall renewal in all ages of horse has been poorly reported; horn growth and complete hoof capsule renewal has not been measured in Thoroughbred foals. Partial hoof wall avulsions are relatively common. The objective was to measure the time taken for the fetal hoof of a newborn foal to grow out and be replaced by hoof grown since birth. Methods Thoroughbred foals (N?=?150) on four Newmarket stud farms were studied during June to September. The age of the foal and the day that routine hoof trimming removed the remnants of the fetal hoof of the front hooves was recorded. Foals that were on restricted exercise, ill or where the remnants of the fetal hoof still remained after trimming were excluded from the data. 45 foals fulfilled the criteria. The data were tabulated in Excel, analysed in Minitab and assessed for normality (Anderson-Darling). Results The mean age at which the fetal hoof grew out was 145?±?15 days (95% confidence interval, 141.77?147.16). Conclusions Thoroughbred foals replace the fetal hoof at twice the speed given for mature horses (270?365 days). Knowing the time of hoof renewal will allow accurate predictions of healing to be made in cases of partial hoof wall avulsion and other hoof lesions.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To examine the basic premises of gun control and the relationship linking legal firearm ownership to homicide and suicide in Australia. Data sources/ Available data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding firearms ownership, study selection: suicide and homicide in Australia were reviewed. Medline database searches using key words of ?firearms?, ?homicide, statistics, trends?, ?suicide, statistics, trends? and ?violence, prevention and control, statistics? identified English language publications relating to violence prevention and/or firearms from 1966 to 1996. These papers were manually searched to identify additional references. Internet home pages of The Coalition for Gun Control, The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Handgun Control Inc. and The National Rifle Association were reviewed and information that could be independently validated was considered. Results: Few papers approach the subject of violence with the same focus, limiting the ability to perform meta-analysis or direct comparisons of data. Conclusions: Current knowledge is inconclusive, but does not provide strong support for some existing Australian firearm control measures. Evidence suggests that further reducing the levels of firearm ownership in Australia will not cause an overall reduction in rates of homicide or suicide.

AB  - Abstract Medical educators are increasingly charged with the development of outcomes-based ?best practices? in medical student and resident education and patient care. To fulfill this mission, a cadre of well-trained, experienced medical education researchers is required. The experienced medical educator is in a prime position to fill this need but often lacks the training needed to successfully contribute to such a goal. Towards this end, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Group on Educational Affairs developed a series of content-based workshops that have resulted in Medical Education Research Certification (MERC), promoting skills development and a better understanding of research by educators. Subsequently, the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) partnered with the AAMC to take MERC a step further, in the MERC at CORD Scholars Program (MCSP). This venture integrates a novel, mentored, specialty-specific research project with the traditional MERC workshops. Collaborative groups, based on a common area of interest, each develop a multi-institutional project by exploring and applying the concepts learned through the MERC workshops. Participants in the inaugural MCSP have completed three MERC workshops and initiated a project. Upon program completion, each will have completed MERC certification (six workshops) and gained experience as a contributing author on a mentored education research project. Not only does this program serve as a multi-dimensional faculty development opportunity, it is also intended to act as a catalyst in developing a network of education scholars and infrastructure for educational research within the specialty of emergency medicine.

AB  - Introduction Turning is commonly used as a diagnostic aid in lameness examinations. Systematic movement deviations compared to locomotion in a straight line are noted across horses with variation at an individual level. This study aimed to investigate whether deviations from the expected body lean angle, predicted from the ratio of gravitational and centripetal accelerations, are consistent between trot and canter. It was hypothesized that, independent of gait, there would be agreement between the observed and predicted angle with variations on an individual horse level. Methods A GPS-aided inertial measurement unit was attached over the sacrum in twenty horses and quantified body lean angle, speed and circle radius in trot and canter on left and right rein. Predicted body lean angle was calculated from speed and circle radius and was compared to the observed body lean (?obs,pred). A generalized linear model was implemented to study the effect of horse, lungeing direction and gait. Results Mean speed and circle radius were 3.3?m/s and 4.9?m in trot and 4.5?m/s and 5.7?m in canter. On average ?obs,pred was ?1.1°in trot and ?0.8°in canter and was found to be significantly different between horses (P<0.0001) and between lungeing directions (P<0.0001) but not between gaits (P?=?0.14). Interactions between horse and direction (P<0.0001) and horse and gait (P?=?0.011) were also found to be significant. Conclusions Horses leaned marginally less into the circle than predicted. However, showing significant differences in body lean angle between horses and turn directions but not between gaits, we provide evidence for horse specific adaptations. Whether these are related to laterality or to underlying subclinical lameness needs to be further investigated. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

AB  - Introduction Track conditions in Thoroughbred racing significantly impact performance and injury. However, surface effects on limb biomechanics at racing speeds are poorly understood. Methods A racing shoe was modified to contain inertial transducers and a strain gauge to provide motion kinematics and a measure of hoof/surface interaction load. A two-phase non-linear surface reaction model was defined to represent the hoof deceleration phase, and the hoof penetration phase where the surface reaction force was represented by a quartic stiffness profile and a fixed damping term. Model parameters were determined using an ?output error? iteration method for 25 strides at medium gallop. Parameters were compared using a standard t-test. Results The sand track had a significantly greater (P<0.0001) maximum penetration of 61?±?10?mm (mean?±?SD), than the grass track (41?±?0.5?mm). Both stiffness parameters were significantly different between the two tracks (P<0.0001), but damping parameters did not differ significantly. Hoof impact at high speed involved decelerations of over 100 ?g? occurring within milliseconds. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a surface reaction model using data acquired from an instrumented horseshoe, distinguished between surface reaction profiles of a sand track and a grass track, as a step towards improving track rating methods. A further challenge will be to develop independent checks on instrument calibrations. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction There are no refereed blinded controlled documentations of the skeletal analgesic efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone. The objective was to test the hypothesis that intravenous dexamethasone is more efficacious in alleviating lameness than placebo in a reversible adjustable heart bar shoe model of equine foot pain. Methods Eight healthy horses (7 Thoroughbreds, 1 Warmblood, aged 6.5?±?3.3 years, age range 2?11 years) underwent weekly intravenous treatments 1 hour after lameness induction. Treatments were isotonic saline placebo at 1?ml/45?kg bwt, or dexamethasone (2?mg/ml in polyethylene glycol) at 0.045?mg/kg bwt, a typical dose used twice daily in the USA for anti-inflammatory effect. Treatments were randomly assigned and administered by a co-investigator who had no input on Heart Rate (HR) and Lameness Score (LS) measurements. Another investigator unaware of treatment assignments monitored HR and LS every 20?min for 5 hours after lameness induction and then hourly through 12 hours post-treatment. One week later treatment assignments were reversed and the experiment was repeated. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test were used to identify significant effects at P<0.05. Results After treatment, mean HR and LS were not different between treatments (P>0.05). HR and LS remained elevated over pre-lameness values throughout the 13-hour post-lameness monitoring period (P<0.05). Conclusions It was concluded that intravenous dexamethasone was no more effective than saline placebo. Neither treatment was effective at alleviating lameness over a 12-hour post-treatment period in this model. Dexamethasone at 0.045?mg/kg bwt should not affect acute foot lameness during equine exercise or performance.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to validate a field standardized exercise test (SET) adapted for young endurance horses and to evaluate the effects of age/conditioning level on speed and heart rate values. Methods The study involved 31 horses of Arabian origin bred specifically for endurance and aged 4?yo (n?=?11), 5?yo (n?=?13) or 6?yo (n?=?7). The SET consisted of a warm-up, followed by 15 (4?yo), 30 (5?yo) or 45 (6?yo) minutes of canter at a comfortable steady speed, and finished with 500 meters of fast gallop. Heart rate (HR) was recorded continuously during the SET. The velocities at which HR reached 160 and 200 beats per minute (V160 and V200) were calculated by the linear regression of HR versus speed. Results All horses were able to complete the SET. Resting HR was higher in 4?y than in 5?y and 6?y (P<0.05 via Student's t test). HR and velocities during the SET did not vary significantly with age. Mean?±?SD values for 4?yo, 5?yo and 6?yo respectively are as follows: Resting HR: 47.5?±?7.2, 42.3?±?3.2, 41.3?±?5.4?bpm; HRcanter: 162.7?±?14.3, 156.9?±?17.3, 161.4?±?10.7?bpm; Vcanter: 22.6?±?0.9, 22.4?±?1.2, 23.3?±?1.6?km/h; HRsprint: 191.3?±?18.1, 181.7?±?18.5, 184.1?±?16.2?bpm; Vsprint: 30.3?±?3.0, 31.5?±?6.4, 35.3?±?6.9?km/h; V160: 25.8?±?3.5, 24.8?±?5.0, 27.1?±?5.8?km/h; V200: 36.8?±?6.1, 37.4?±?7.3, 44.3?±?10.9?km/h; Post-exercice lactatemia: 7.4?±?4.5, 13.5?±?3.6, 5.6?±?3.4?mmol/l. These values perfectly fit with those described previously for adult endurance horses. Conclusions The proposed field SET involved both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism reproducing the progress of an endurance race. Further studies are being conducted to discriminate if possible the effects of age from those of conditioning.

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a dominant, missense mutation in the equine glycogen synthase gene (GYS1) that increases the enzyme's activity. The amino acid sequence surrounding the PSSM1 mutation is highly conserved amongst species from yeast to horses suggesting that this region plays an important role, but its functional significance has yet to be determined. Methods Computer modelling can predict three dimensional (3D) protein structures using related proteins as templates. Yeast glycogen synthase (GS) has high sequence homology (73%) to the equine enzyme and since the yeast enzyme's structure has been solved, we hypothesised that in silico modelling based on the yeast protein using MODELLER and SwissPDBViewer software would predict the enzyme's structure and explain the mutant enzyme's increased activity. Results Homology-modelling revealed that, like the yeast enzyme, equine GS likely forms a tetramer surrounding a catalytic cleft and undergoes large structural rearrangements upon G6P binding to highly-conserved binding sites. The enzyme's glycogen binding sites are located on the extremities of the enzyme and are also conserved in the equine protein. The PSSM1 mutation lay close to the G6P binding site, but did not confer any clear structural rearrangement on the protein's 3D configuration. The mutation was distant from the known phosphorylation sites and the glycogen binding sites. Conclusions The close proximity of the mutation to the G6P binding site suggests that it might influence substrate interaction or allosteric regulation. Further studies evaluating G6P ligand binding and enzyme activation are warranted and might best be made following purification of the mutant and wild type proteins.

AB  - Introduction The objective was to quantify warm-up (WU) jumping patterns/duration in showjumping horses. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three day training session. Riders received coaching during WU and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1 and twice on day-2; on day-3 the second round was an 8 fence jump-off. Fence type/height, number of jumping efforts (JE) and lead take-off/landing limbs during WU were recorded. Rider global-positioning-system recorded speed. Inertial motion sensors fixed to the lateral aspect of metatarsal/metacarpal bones, recorded time spent in each pace/rein plus stride length (SL) during WU and course. Paired Students T-tests were used to compare variables between days, as well as WU and course. Results Mean WU duration, time in each pace and on each rein did not differ within rider between days, however there were inter-rider differences (mean WU duration?=?18?mins; range?=?12?27?mins). Number of JE and fence type/height did not differ between days. During WU, there was marked canter lead, jump landing and leaving lead limb asymmetry (left canter lead predominating in all cases). There was no preference in canter lead when approaching WU fences. Horses cantered slower and with a shorter SL during WU compared to when jumping the course (speed-WU:4.21?±?0.09?m/sec; course:5.53?±?0.15?m/sec; SL- WU:2.59?±?0.06?m; course:3.16?±?0.08?m). Conclusions Results provide preliminary information on WU duration, and suggest that showjumping horses may WU asymmetrically, predominately on the left rein, at competitions and during training. This could have implications for injury risk to a particular forelimb or hindlimb in showjumping horses.

AB  - Introduction Degenerative changes in sacroiliac joints (SIJ) are reported to cause poor performance in horses. The aim of this study was to document the frequency and nature of changes in SIJ surfaces of Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses and to correlate gross morphology and marginal new bone formation to age, body weight and history of back pain. Methods SIJ surfaces from 37 deceased TBs retired from the Hong Kong Jockey Club were photographed and measurements taken to facilitate subjective and objective analysis of gross changes. SIJ surfaces were described, and the surface area of the joint surfaces determined from the photographs, using Image J. Area and shape of the joint surfaces were recorded and SIJs were graded and allocated a type according to pre-determined criteria. Changes were compared for horses with and without clinical records of back pain. Results Mean age was 6.6?±?2.3 years; weight 494?±?35?kg; with no differences between horses with (n?=?14) and without (n?=?23) a history of back pain. There was no relationship between bodyweight (r?=?0.08) or age (r?=?0.13) and SIJ surface area. SIJs of the back pain group were affected by obvious gross pathology that showed certain characteristics. There was a relationship between surface area of joint and degree of marginal bone formation (P<0.001). SIJs from the group of TBs with no back pain had fewer and less obvious gross findings. Conclusions Clinical evidence of back pain, which may reasonably be expected to have affected the horse's racing performance, was associated with characteristic gross pathology of the SIJ. Ethical Animal Research Ethical approval for animal use was obtained by the institutional animal ethics committee (University of Queensland) and Hong Kong ethics committee. The study was performed on material collected during post-mortem examination. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Introduction Continuous monitoring of core body temperature may provide useful information about the thermal response to metabolic heat load and environmental challenges. The aim of this study was to evaluate a telemetric gastrointestinal (GI) pill (Equivital?) measuring gastrointestinal temperature (GT) during endurance exercise. It was hypothesised that a temperature and metabolic heat profile could be established. Methods The GI pill was administered to 6 horses by nasogastric tube (n?=?3) or modified-drench gun (n?=?3), the day before competition. During competition, GT, skin temperature and heart rate (HR) were recorded (by Equivital? belt). Other data collected included body weight and rectal temperature (RT), GPS/HR monitor information, and environmental conditions using a data logger. Metabolic heat production was calculated [1] and GT correlations were explored using simple correlation estimates (P<0.05). Results Data were collected from 6 horses during 80?km (n?=?4 horses) and 100?km (n?=?2) competition days with mean data loss of 7.4% (±2.4%). GT profiles showed increasing temperature with cumulative metabolic heat production, and time to reach maximum GT was 2.14?6.29?h (maximum GT range: 38.4?39.5°C). During exercise (7?h 6?min?±?1?h 3?min duration), mean and maximum speeds ranged from 10.1?14.5?km/h and 23.5?30.8?km/h, respectively. No correlation was found between GT and HR, skin, or environment temperature. Maximum GT increased with bodyweight (r?=?0.775, P?=?0.08). GT was systematically higher than RT (mean difference +0.46°C). Conclusions GT was recorded successfully during competition with minimal data loss. The GI pill has great potential as a method to further investigate thermoregulation in horses under field conditions.

AB  - Introduction Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytology is a major diagnostic method for detecting exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) and inflammatory airway disease (IAD) in racehorses. Our hypothesis was that training and racing would increase the incidence of IAD and EIPH. Methods On three different occasions (day-1, ?30 and ?60), BAL fluid was obtained from both lungs of 14 Standardbred trotters with similar age and training level. Cytological inclusion criteria were neutrophils >10%, and/or mast cells ≥5%, and/or eosinophils ≥5% for IAD, and haemosiderophage/macrophage (H/M) ratio >20% for EIPH. Since previously found not to be equivalent, both samples from each horse were independently investigated. Horse status (?IAD?,?EIPH?, ?mixed?, or ?control?) at each time point was based on cytological profiles from both lungs. Cell proportions were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Haemosiderophage proportions and H/M were significantly higher on day-60 compared to day-1. No significant difference was observed for other cell proportions. On day-1, 5 horses were ?control?, 2 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-30, 3 horses were ?control?, 4 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH?, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-60, 3 horses were ?control?, 0 ?IAD?, 3 ?EIPH?, and 8 ?mixed?. Despite the different horses? distribution within each category, an overall increase in EIPH was observed. Five of the 7 horses classified ?control? or ?IAD? on day-1 presented EIPH on day-30 and/or ?60. EIPH was detected in 11/14 horses (78.6%) on day-60, versus 7/14 horses (50%) on day-1. Conclusions The incidence of EIPH, but not IAD, significantly increased during a racing season. This evolution should be considered when assessing BAL fluid cytology in racehorses.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the horse and rider partnership is a challenging and complex area. There is limited scientific research regarding the occurrence of misalignments in the horse and rider, and if there is any relationship between the two. This study investigated asymmetry of single horse and rider combinations focusing on pelvis asymmetry. Methods 14 single horse/rider combinations (minimum 6 month partnership) on the same daily routine were assessed. Horses and riders were assessed for misalignments of the pelvis, spine, and neck by a fully qualified human and animal (McTimoney) practitioner on the same day. Triplicate measurements of rider dorsal iliac crest (IC) distance (nearest 0.2?cm) and degree of tilt (0d.p) were recorded, sitting and standing, using a PALM palpation meter to calculate IC height discrepancy. Triplicate horse tuber coxae (TC) heights (nearest 0.5?cm) were measured using a plumb line. Difference between means indicated direction and value of asymmetry relative to symmetry of zero. Student's t-test and Pearson's Product Moment correlation examined asymmetry relationships. Results Mean rider IC height discrepancy, standing, was 0.89?±?0.64?cm and sitting, 1.00?±?0.66?cm. Mean TC height discrepancy was 1.3?±?1.6?cm. Asymmetry of the pelvis was a feature of 93% of horse/rider combinations, 85% occurring in the same direction. There was a significant positive correlation between horse TC and rider IC height discrepancies (r2?=?0.4, F?=?8.24, P?=?0.014). Conclusions This study provides positive evidence of a relationship between the direction of horse pelvic rotation and rider pelvic tilt and also between the degree of tilt and rotation. This has implications for physical therapy treatment of horse and rider. Further research of causal effect relationships of the asymmetries is recommended.

AB  - Abstract Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common and often devastating birth defect that can occur in isolation or as part of a malformation complex. Considerable progress is being made in the identification of genetic causes of CDH. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of ?1Mb resolution to 29 CDH patients with prior normal karyotypes who had been recruited into our multi-site study. One patient, clinically diagnosed with Fryns syndrome, demonstrated a de novo 5Mb deletion at chromosome region 1q41?q42.12 that was confirmed by FISH. Given prior reports of CDH in association with cytogenetic abnormalities in this region, we propose that this represents a locus for Fryns syndrome, a Fryns syndrome phenocopy, or CDH. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Gastric ulcers are commonly found in equine athletes and there is evidence suggesting phenylbutazone may increase the incidence. In human athletes, gastric permeability has been shown to increase with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use with potential to negatively affect performance and recovery. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phenylbutazone on gastric mucosa and permeability. Methods 18 Arabian horses were examined via gastroscopy on day 0, 42, 49, 56, and 63, with ulceration in both the squamous and glandular regions scored from 0 to 4. For seven days commencing after the day 42 evaluation, horses received 4.4?mg/kg BW phenylbutazone twice daily PO. On day 49, sucrose (1?g/kg bwt) was administered via nasogastric tube, with blood and urine samples collected for 90?min and 4?h, respectively, to assess gastric permeability. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 with Proc MIXED. Results Ulcer scores increased from day 42 to day 49 (P<0.0001) with prevalence of grade 2 or greater ulceration being 33% on day 42 compared with 94% on day 49. Scores decreased from day 49 to 56 and, though continuing to decrease, had not returned to baseline scores by day 63. Squamous scores increased from day 0 to day 49 and remained elevated through day 63, while glandular scores were highest on day 49 but had decreased by day 56 (P<0.05). Sucrose concentration increased (P<0.0001) in both plasma and urine after phenylbutazone administration. Conclusions Besides exacerbating gastric ulcers, phenylbutazone contributes to gastric permeability and, particularly when combined with strenuous exercise, may impair recovery and increase illness susceptibility.

AB  - We describe a patient affected by MMN with CB exhibiting unusual progression and clinical features. MMN is a chronic immune mediated demyelinating neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive painless asymmetrical weakness usually in distal limb muscles. GM1 antibodies are found in high titer in 22%- 84% of cases. Electrophysiological findings are CB not at usual sites of compression, abnormal temporal dispersion and F-waves, normal or near-normal sensory conduction studies. This 63 year old woman was referred for evaluation of one year and half duration weakness which began in right upper limb and progressed to contralateral and to lower extremities. On first admission (July 2001) neurological examination showed normal cranial nerves and sensory testing, severe asymmetric weakness mainly proximal in the upper extremities and distal in the lower. There were atrophy of small hand muscles and weak deep reflexes. She denied sensory symptoms. There were no upper motor neuron signs. Laboratory tests including CK, tumor marker, CSF, anti-GM1 antibodies were unremarkable. Electrophysiological study was consistent with MMN with CB. Patient underwent IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) and PE without significant improvement. In October 2002, her conditions rapidly worsened: she became quadriplegic, unable to swallow, to chew and to protrude her tongue. Admitted to ICU because of respiratory failure, tracheotomy was performed. Repeated searches for GM1 antibodies gave negative results. CSF was still normal. IVIG was administered twice with partial benefit although severe disability persisted. The case presented has notable features: the rapid monophasic progression to quadriplegia within two years and half, the acute worsening in absence of precipitating events and of systemic illness, the severe involvement of cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. The late response to IVIG is in favor of an immune mediated disorder despite the absence of GM1 antibodies.
