AB  - Abstract Objective To define and compare clinical characteristics of canine primary appendicular hemangiosarcoma (HSA) and telangiectatic osteosarcoma (tOSA), including signalment, presentation, response to treatment, and prognosis. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Seventy dogs with primary appendicular HSA or tOSA. Methods Patient data were obtained from institutions' medical records. Immunohistochemistry was applied to archived tissues to establish tumor type. Patient characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes were described and compared by tumor type. Results Forty-one HSA and 29 tOSA were identified. Dogs with HSA were more likely than dogs with tOSA to be male and have hind limb tumors; 78% of HSA occurred in hind limbs, particularly the tibia. Dogs with tOSA weighed a median of 9.9?kg (95% CI 4.6-15.3) more than dogs with HSA. Most dogs received antineoplastic treatment, predominantly amputation with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall survival with local treatment and chemotherapy was 299 days (95% CI 123-750) for HSA and 213 days (95% CI 77-310) for tOSA. Younger age and more aggressive treatment were associated with longer survival in dogs with HSA but not tOSA. One-year survival rates did not differ between dogs with HSA (28%) and those with tOSA (7%). Conclusion Distinct clinical features were identified between HSA and tOSA in this population. Both tumors were aggressive, with a high incidence of pulmonary metastases. However, local treatment combined with chemotherapy led to an average survival 7 months for tOSA and 10 months for HSA. Clinical significance HSA should be considered as a differential in dogs with aggressive lytic bone lesions, particularly medium-sized dogs with tibial lesions. HSA has a unique clinical presentation but similar therapeutic response and outcome to OSA. Amputation and chemotherapy appear to prolong survival in some dogs with HSA and tOSA.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the cardiovascular and thoracic surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be indicated for extreme cases in patients with massive anterior mediastinal masses, but resection of this mass without prior tissue diagnosis would not be an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Cardiopulmonary bypass is rarely necessary for management of lung injury. The requirement for high-dose anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass would present prohibitive risk and would likely be associated with a dismal neurological outcome. All patients undergoing intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treatment must be assessed with frequent neurovascular examinations. Benign etiologies include superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis, mediastinal fibrosis, and complications of intravascular devices and catheters. Several operative techniques have been described for damage control of thoracotomy to control hemorrhage and decrease operative time and transfusion requirements, as well as improving survival.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.

AB  - Introduction Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is considered height-linked in Thoroughbreds. A SNP (BIEC2-808543) proximal to the LCORL/NCAPG gene significantly influences height variation in horses. It has been suggested that the C-allele of this SNP is associated with RLN risk. Our objective was to investigate the association between the BIEC2-808543 C-allele, RLN and height in a cohort of Thoroughbreds. Methods Resting and exercising upper respiratory tract endoscopic videos, laryngeal ultrasonograms, wither height, age and sex were recorded in 79 Thoroughbreds (age 34?±?11 months). The Havemeyer grading scale was used to characterise RLN cases (Grade B or C at exercise) and controls (Grade 1.1 or 2.1 at rest, Grade A at exercise, normal laryngeal ultrasound). All horses were genotyped for the BIEC2-808543 SNP using a custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Logistic regression was performed measuring additive effects of allele dosage with sex, age and height as covariates (P≤0.05). Horses were subcategorised into tall (T,≥162?cm) and short (S,<162?cm) groups for C-allele frequency determination, with data presented as mean?±?SD. Results There were 16 RLN cases (height 164.5?±?4?cm) and 32 controls (height 156.2?±?4?cm). With sex and age as covariates, a significant association between the C-allele and RLN cases was observed (P?=?0.01). With height included as a covariate, a strong trend of association between the C-allele and RLN remained (P?=?0.06). C-allele frequency was 41.7% for the T-RLN group (n?=?12, height 166.2?±?3?cm), 12.5% for the S-RLN group (n?=?4, height 159.5?±?2?cm), 13% for the T-Control group (n?=?16, height 165.1?±?2?cm) and 14% for the S-Control group (n?=?16, height 156.2?±?4?cm). Conclusions The association between the BIEC-808543 C-allele and RLN appears to be independent of height. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.

AB  - Abstract The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multi-component epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce US Army suicides and increase basic knowledge about the determinants of suicidality. This report presents an overview of the designs of the six components of the Army STARRS. These include: an integrated analysis of the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) designed to provide data on significant administrative predictors of suicides among the more than 1.6 million soldiers on active duty in 2004?2009; retrospective case-control studies of suicide attempts and fatalities; separate large-scale cross-sectional studies of new soldiers (i.e. those just beginning Basic Combat Training [BCT], who completed self-administered questionnaires [SAQs] and neurocognitive tests and provided blood samples) and soldiers exclusive of those in BCT (who completed SAQs); a pre-post deployment study of soldiers in three Brigade Combat Teams about to deploy to Afghanistan (who completed SAQs and provided blood samples) followed multiple times after returning from deployment; and a platform for following up Army STARRS participants who have returned to civilian life. Department of Defense/Army administrative data records are linked with SAQ data to examine prospective associations between self-reports and subsequent suicidality. The presentation closes with a discussion of the methodological advantages of cross-component coordination. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, and interventional radiology. Patients with flow-limiting intimal defects should be explored. Posterior knee dislocation is associated with popliteal arterial injuries. These patients should undergo diagnostic imaging to rule out popliteal artery injury. Good diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) angiographic extremity examinations require careful patient preparation, to give images that will provide the necessary information. The use of abdominal ultrasound for detecting the need for operative intervention in a patient who has sustained a penetrating trauma to the abdomen carries a low sensitivity and a high specificity. A normal ultrasound examination of the thoracic cavity demonstrates the rib, the sliding of the pleura, and the presence of a comet tail artifact. Sternal fracture is a diagnosis that can be made using ultrasound, and some reports suggest that ultrasound is more sensitive and specific for this injury than plain radiology.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate and compare the clinical effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) and medetomidine (MED) in cats, and their reversal with atipamezole (ATI). Study design? Prospective blinded randomized multi-centre clinical trial. Animals? One hundred and twenty client-owned cats. Methods? Cats were randomly allocated to receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of either DEX (0.04?mg?kg?1, n?=?62) or MED (0.08?mg?kg?1, n?=?58) for minor procedures requiring sedation and analgesia. Afterwards, ATI (0.2?mg?kg?1) was administered IM to half the cats, randomly assigned. Prior to, during and after the procedure the sedative, analgesic and cardiorespiratory effects and body temperature were assessed. Results? Dexmedetomidine and MED produced clinically and statistically comparable effects. The intended procedure(s) could be performed in over 90% of cats. Sedation and analgesia were apparent within 5?minutes, peak effects were observed at approximately 30?minutes and spontaneous recovery occurred by 180?minutes of injection. Heart and respiratory rate and body temperature decreased significantly over time and had not returned to baseline values 180?minutes after administration. ATI administration completely reversed the sedative and analgesic effects, returned the heart rate to normal and prevented any further reductions in respiratory rate and body temperature in both DEX- and MED-treated cats. The reporting of adverse events was low and the most commonly observed event was vomiting (7%). No serious adverse events or concerns regarding safety were reported. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Dexmedetomidine (0.04?mg?kg?1) produced comparable sedative and analgesic effects to MED (0.08?mg?kg?1) in cats. DEX produced adequate sedation and analgesia for radiography, grooming, dental care and lancing of abscesses. ATI fully reversed the clinical effects of DEX.

The number of adult heart transplant survivors continued to increase, and in 2016, 30,622 recipients were living with heart transplants. Patient mortality following transplant has declined. The number of pediatric candidates and transplants performed also increased. New listings for pediatric heart transplants increased from 454 in 2005 to 624 in 2016. The number of pediatric heart transplants performed each year increased from 319 in 2005 to 445 in 2016. Among pediatric patients who underwent transplant in 2015, death occurred in 5.9% at 6 months and 7.2% at 1 year.

AB  - Abstract The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multi-component epidemiological and neurobiological study of unprecedented size and complexity designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce US Army suicides and increase basic knowledge about determinants of suicidality by carrying out coordinated component studies. A number of major logistical challenges were faced in implementing these studies. The current report presents an overview of the approaches taken to meet these challenges, with a special focus on the field procedures used to implement the component studies. As detailed in the paper, these challenges were addressed at the onset of the initiative by establishing an Executive Committee, a Data Coordination Center (the Survey Research Center [SRC] at the University of Michigan), and study-specific design and analysis teams that worked with staff on instrumentation and field procedures. SRC staff, in turn, worked with the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army (ODUSA) and local Army Points of Contact (POCs) to address logistical issues and facilitate data collection. These structures, coupled with careful fieldworker training, supervision, and piloting, contributed to the major Army STARRS data collection efforts having higher response rates than previous large-scale studies of comparable military samples.

AB  - Abstract A clinical reappraisal study was carried out in conjunction with the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) All-Army Study (AAS) to evaluate concordance of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Screening Scales (CIDI-SC) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist (PCL) with diagnoses based on independent clinical reappraisal interviews (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [SCID]). Diagnoses included: lifetime mania/hypomania, panic disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder; six-month adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and 30-day major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and substance (alcohol or drug) use disorder (abuse or dependence). The sample (n?=?460) was weighted for over-sampling CIDI-SC/PCL screened positives. Diagnostic thresholds were set to equalize false positives and false negatives. Good individual-level concordance was found between CIDI-SC/PCL and SCID diagnoses at these thresholds (area under curve [AUC]?=?0.69?0.79). AUC was considerably higher for continuous than dichotomous screening scale scores (AUC?=?0.80?0.90), arguing for substantive analyses using not only dichotomous case designations but also continuous measures of predicted probabilities of clinical diagnoses.

AB  - Abstract Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord remain challenging due to the small cross-sectional size of the cord and susceptibility-related distortions. Although partially addressable through parallel imaging, few highly parallel array coils have been implemented for the cervical cord. Here, we developed a 32-channel coil that fully covers the brain and c-spine and characterized its performance in comparison with a commercially available head/neck/spine array. Image and temporal signal-to-noise ratio were, respectively, increased by 2? and 1.8? in the cervical cord. Averaged g-factors at 4? acceleration were lowered by 22% in the brain and by 39% in the spinal cord, enabling 1-mm isotropic R = 4 multi-echo magnetization prepared gradient echo of the full brain and c-spine in 3:20 min. Diffusion imaging of the cord at 0.6 ? 0.6 ? 5 mm3 resolution and tractography of the full brain and c-spine at 1.7-mm isotropic resolution were feasible without noticeable distortion. Improvements of this nature potentially enhance numerous basic and clinical research studies focused on spinal and supraspinal regions. Magn Reson Med, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods A total of 5,416 Danish female eldercare workers from 309 work units were surveyed using questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms and psychosocial working conditions. LTSA was derived from a national register. We aggregated scores of psychosocial working conditions to the work unit-level and conducted multi-level Poisson regression analyses. Results Depressive symptoms, but not psychosocial working conditions, predicted LTSA. Psychosocial working conditions did not statistically significantly modify the effect of depressive symptoms on LTSA. Conclusions Psychosocial working conditions did not modify the effect of depressive symptoms on LTSA. The results, however, need to be interpreted with caution, as we cannot rule out lack of exposure contrast and non-differential misclassification of the exposure. Am. J. Ind.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic odontoid fractures (TOFs) have been described as the most common injury affecting the C-spine in the elderly. Previous studies have identified degenerative changes and bone loss as important predisposing factors. However, their interaction and respective age-adjusted impact needs further clarification. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 5303 patients (aged ≥60 years) admitted to a level I trauma center between January 2008 and January 2016 who underwent CT imaging of the C-spine. Ninety-two patients with TOF and 80 patients with other cervical spine fractures (OCSF) were identified and a respective 3:1 age- and sex-matched control group without fractures after trauma was built. In all groups, cervical bone mineral density (cBMD) was determined using phantom calibration, and degenerative changes were evaluated in a qualitative manner. In all groups, the severity of degenerative changes of the C-spine increased with age (all p <?0.05) and was inversely correlated with cBMD (all p < 0.05). cBMD was the only significant predictor of a TOF in a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?3.066, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432?6.563 for cervical osteoporosis). An association between odontoid cysts and TOF reached significance only in Anderson and D'Alonzo (A 95% CI 1.012?1.890). Patients with OCSFs, compared with patients with TOFs, were younger (median 74 versus 83 years) and had a higher cBMD (median 208?mg/mL versus 172?mg/mL). No differences were observable when comparing cBMD and grades of degenerative changes between OCSFs and their control group (all p >0.1). Decreased cBMD is the major predisposing factor for the occurrence of TOF but not for OCSF in the elderly. The severity of odontoid cysts was found to be a cBMD-independent factor associated with A&D type II TOFs. However, degenerative changes in the odontoid neighboring joints seem to be an epiphenomenon of bone loss and older age but do not independently predispose for TOF. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Methylene blue (MB+) and pyrrole were copolymerised to electrodeposit a novel electroactive polymer on a Au electrode which was assessed for O2 sensing. The electroactive polymer exhibits diffusion-limited behaviour and an electrochemical, followed by catalytic (EC?) mechanism in the presence of dissolved O2. Notably, it is pH-insensitive in both N2-purged and air-equilibrated phosphate buffered saline (PBS) from pH?4 to 8. It is stable over 18?days, possesses a good sensitivity of 256.335?µA?mM?1?cm?2, wide linear range of 15?µM to 285?µM and detection limit of 1.47?µM (S/N=3) for dissolved O2. It is highly promising for use in biological investigations where pH fluctuations are expected.

AB  - Introduction Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most important Brazilian horse breed. Functional evaluation of MM horses is performed in marcha competitions, where horses must perform 4-gaited exercise at 13?km/h for 70?min. The aim of this work was to test a training protocol to prepare MM horses for marcha competition. Methods Eight untrained MM mares, in randomized blocks with Split plots, were trained for 84 days. Three days/week horses were ridden for one hour (10?min walk, then an individual amount of marcha exercise at 13?km/h established in a previous test, then walk to complete one hour total exercise time). Two days/week, horses walked for one hour. Before training and every 21 days a marcha test (MT) was performed, totaling 5 tests in the experimental period. During the MT, mares were exercised at 13?km/h using a heart rate monitor. Every 10?min heart rate (HR) and blood lactate concentration [La] were recorded. The MT was stopped at 70?min of exercise, or if HR was ≥150?bpm and [La] was ≥4?mmol/L, or if Marcha Time was reached. Blood samples for hemogram, lactate, glucose, triglyceride and CK, LDH, AST determination were collected. Individual time used for training was 10?min less than the exercising time in the previous MT. Regression was used to analyze the results. Results From MT 1 to 4, the positive effect of training was shown on HR, [La] and marcha time (from 9.52?min to 70.5?min, CV?=?26.41). There was not an increase in marcha time on test 5. Conclusions MM mares trained for 63?days with the described protocol are ready to compete in marcha competition. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Ethical Animal (CETEA) of the UFMG with the 255/11 protocol. Sources of funding:?CNPq, CAPES, FAPEMIG, ABCCMM, Haras Catuni e Raç?es Total.

AB  - Introduction In Thoroughbreds, genetic variation in myostatin (MSTN g.66493737C/T) is highly predictive of optimum race distance and influences mRNA expression, precocity, skeletal muscle development, two-year-old earnings, speed variables and skeletal muscle fibre type. The aim of this study was to investigate MSTN variation associations with VO2peak in untrained yearling Thoroughbreds. Methods Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbred yearlings (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) from one flat racing yard (November-December). Data was collected as horses freely travelled up an all-weather gallop (2% incline) with no rider. VO2 was measured using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask and associated customized software validated for field testing. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded. MSTN genotypes were determined using a customised Taqman SNP genotyping assay. Tests of association between genotype and phenotype were performed using PLINK software. Results Average exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, and HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm. MSTN genotypes and VO2peak based on 6 breaths were n?=?16 CC, VO2peak?=?119.49?±?21.8; n?=?22 CT, VO2peak?=?116.40?±?-27.2; n?=?3 TT, 115.08?±?20.2.There was no association (P>0.05) between genotype and VO2peak. Conclusions In yearling Thoroughbreds no association between MSTN genotype and untrained peak oxygen consumption was observed. This may be a function of the small number of TT genotype individuals evaluated or a reflection of a requirement for MSTN-associated skeletal muscle entrainment in VO2peak changes resulting from a period of exercise training. Such changes may be associated with MSTN genotype and this requires further investigation. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?Science Foundation Ireland under Grant Number 11/PI/1166.
