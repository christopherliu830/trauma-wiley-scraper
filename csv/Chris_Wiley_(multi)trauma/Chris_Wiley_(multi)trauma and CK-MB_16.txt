AB  - OBJECTIVES To develop a scoring system model that predicts mortality within 30?days of admission of patients older than 80?years admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING A total of 306 ICUs from 24 European countries. PARTICIPANTS Older adults admitted to European ICUs (N?=?3730; median age?=?84?years [interquartile range?=?81-87 y]; 51.8% male). MEASUREMENTS Overall, 24 variables available during ICU admission were included as potential predictive variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Model sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS The 30-day-mortality was 1562 (41.9%). In multivariable analysis, these variables were selected as independent predictors of mortality: age, sex, ICU admission diagnosis, Clinical Frailty Scale, Sequential Organ Failure Score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. The discrimination, accuracy, and calibration of the model were good: the area under the curve for a score of 10 or higher was .80, and the Brier score was .18. At a cut point of 10 or higher (75% of all patients), the model predicts 30-day mortality in 91.1% of all patients who die. CONCLUSION A predictive model of cumulative events predicts 30-day mortality in patients older than 80?years admitted to ICUs. Future studies should include other potential predictor variables including functional status, presence of advance care plans, and assessment of each patient's decision-making capacity.

AB  - Objectives To describe the biochemical changes ? also known as the storage lesion ? that occur in canine packed red blood cells during ex vivo storage. Materials and Methods Ten 125-mL units of non-leuco-reduced packed red blood cells in citrate phosphate dextrose adenine were obtained from a commercial blood bank within 24 hours of donation. Samples were aseptically collected on days 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 for measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate, glucose, pH and ammonia concentrations. All units were cultured on day 42. Friedman's repeated measures test with Dunn's multiple comparison test was used for non-parametric data. A repeated-measures analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used for parametric data. Alpha was set to 0·05. Results All analytes changed significantly during storage. The mean ammonia on day 1 (58·14 g/dL) was significantly lower (P<0·05) than those on days 28 (1266 g/dL), 35 (1668 g/dL) and 42 (1860 g/dL). A significant increase in median lactate concentration over time was also observed, with day 1 (4·385 mmol/L) being significantly less (P<0·05) than days 14 (19·82 mmol/L), 21 (22·81 mmol/L), 35 (20·31 mmol/L) and 42 (20·81 mmol/L). Median pH was significantly decreased after day 7. All bacterial cultures were negative. Clinical Significance Many biochemical alterations occur in stored canine packed red blood cells, although further studies are required to determine their clinical importance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interferon is regarded as a promising treatment option for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. However, sporadic cases of axonal PNP and one case of CIDP after treatment with Interferon (INF) alfa-2a were reported. The objective of this study was to test the onset of PNP in patients affected by relapsing-remitting MS after treatment with INF beta-1b. METHODS: from the OPTIMS trial we have selected 23 patients (9 males, 14 females; mean age 30.5; range 22?50) with diagnosis of relapsing-remitting SM in treatment with INF beta-1b (8?12.000.000 UI). In these patients bilateral motor nerve conduction study (NCS) of peroneal, tibial, median, ulnar nerves and antidromic sensory NCS of sural, median and ulnar nerves were performed according standard techniques. All patients (23/23) were submitted to neurophysiological tests before the treatment (T0), 16/23 (7 drop out) after six months (T1) and after nine months of therapy (T2). RESULTS: at T0 no patient showed electrophysiological signs indicating PNP; after six and nine months of therapy (T1 and T2) no patient submitted to NCS showed alterations in the PNS either. CONCLUSIONS: all tested patients showed absence of electrophysiological signs of PNP as side effects after one year of treatment with high dose of INF beta-1b.

AB  - Summary Some plant terpenes such as sterols and carotenes are part of primary metabolism and found essentially in all plants. However, the majority of the terpenes found in plants are classified as ?secondary? compounds, those chemicals whose synthesis has evolved in plants as a result of selection for increased fitness via better adaptation to the local ecological niche of each species. Thousands of such terpenes have been found in the plant kingdom, but each species is capable of synthesizing only a small fraction of this total. In plants, a family of terpene synthases (TPSs) is responsible for the synthesis of the various terpene molecules from two isomeric 5-carbon precursor ?building blocks?, leading to 5-carbon isoprene, 10-carbon monoterpenes, 15-carbon sesquiterpenes and 20-carbon diterpenes. The bryophyte Physcomitrella patens has a single TPS gene, copalyl synthase/kaurene synthase (CPS/KS), encoding a bifunctional enzyme producing ent-kaurene, which is a precursor of gibberellins. The genome of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii contains 18 TPS genes, and the genomes of some model angiosperms and gymnosperms contain 40?152 TPS genes, not all of them functional and most of the functional ones having lost activity in either the CPS- or KS-type domains. TPS genes are generally divided into seven clades, with some plant lineages having a majority of their TPS genes in one or two clades, indicating lineage-specific expansion of specific types of genes. Evolutionary plasticity is evident in the TPS family, with closely related enzymes differing in their product profiles, subcellular localization, or the in planta substrates they use.

AB  - Abstract:? Imaging is an integral diagnostic tool in mass fatality investigations undertaken traditionally by plain X-rays, fluoroscopy, and dental radiography. However, little attention has been given to appropriate image reporting, secure data transfer and storage particularly in relation to the need to meet stringent judicial requirements. Notwithstanding these limitations, it is the risk associated with the safe handling and investigation of contaminated fatalities which is providing new challenges for mass fatality radiological imaging. Mobile multi-slice computed tomography is an alternative to these traditional modalities as it provides a greater diagnostic yield and an opportunity to address the requirements of the criminal justice system. We present a new national disaster victim/forensic identification imaging system?Fimag?which is applicable for both contaminated and non-contaminated mass fatality imaging and addresses the issues of judicial reporting. We suggest this system opens a new era in radiological diagnostics for mass fatalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors.

AB  - ABSTRACT The number of heart transplants performed annually continues to increase gradually, and the number of adult candidates on the waiting list increased by 34.2% from 2003 to 2013. The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates peaked at 149.0 per 100 waitlist years in 2007 and has been declining since then; in 2013, the rate was 87.4 heart transplants per 100 active waitlist years. Increased waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase in waitlist mortality. Since 2008, the proportion of patients on life support before transplant increased from 53.4% to 65.8% in 2013. Medical urgency categories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgency categories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list each year; the number of pediatric transplants performed each year increased from 293 in 2003 to 411 in 2013. Patient survival among pediatric recipients continues to improve; 5-year patient survival for transplants performed from 2001 through 2008 was 70% to 80%. Medicare paid for some or all of the care for 42.2% of all heart transplant recipients in 2012.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early pregnancy loss (EPL) between Days 15 and 65 of pregnancy occurs in 7?10% of Thoroughbred pregnancies causing substantial financial losses. Despite this, very little is known about risk factors associated with the condition. Objectives To determine the current incidence of EPL in Thoroughbred mares and to investigate risk factors associated with the condition. Study design A prospective cohort study was carried out on a population of 927 Thoroughbred mares in the Newmarket area during the 2013 breeding season. Methods Questionnaires were completed by clinicians from 2 veterinary hospitals and stud secretaries from 23 stud farms. Univariable risk factor analyses were conducted using Chi-squared and t tests. Results The incidence of pregnancy loss was 6.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3?8.6%) between Days 15?42 and 2% (95% CI 1.2?3.0%) between Days 43?65. Mares aged 11 years or over were 2.4 times more likely to suffer EPL than younger mares (95% CI 1.5?3.9): the risk of loss increased as mare age increased. Foaling, rested or barren mares had a 4.3 times increased risk of loss compared to maiden mares (95% CI 1.5?12.0). Mares receiving the preovulatory hormones deslorelin or hCG were shown to have a significantly reduced risk of EPL (P?=?0.03) compared with mares who had not received any preovulatory treatments. Pregnancies undergoing loss had a significantly smaller vesicle size (mean 1.7?cm, s.d. 0.51) at the initial (Day 14?17) pregnancy scan compared to pregnancies which were maintained throughout the study period (mean 2.0?cm, s.d. 0.49, P?=?0.01). Conclusions The incidence of EPL in 2013 was similar to that previously reported in the Newmarket area. Further multivariable risk factor analyses and investigations to discover novel causes of EPL are required to reduce the incidence of this condition.

AB  - Although intergenerational patterns of punitive physical punishment garner considerable research attention, the mechanisms by which historical, cognitive, and contextual factors interplay to influence disciplinary responding remains poorly understood. Disciplinary attitudes have been shown to mediate the association between disciplinary history and disciplinary responding. The present study investigated whether frustration influences these mediation effects. Half of a sample of 330 undergraduates was randomly assigned to frustration induction. Structural equation modeling confirmed that, for participants in the frustration condition, the relation between disciplinary history and physical discipline decision-making was fully mediated by attitudes approving physical discipline. In contrast, for respondents in the no-frustration condition, the pathway from disciplinary history to discipline decision-making was only partially mediated by attitudes. Under conditions of frustration, attitudes may become a more central means by which personal disciplinary history is associated with disciplinary decision-making. Aggr.

AB  - Thalidomide seems to be effective in the treatment of cutaneous forms of lupus erythematosus refractory to other therapies. Peripheral neuropathy is the most severe side effect, but the incidence of neuropathy and its relation to thalidomide doses are still unclear. We prospectively monitored 12 patients treated with thalidomide for cutaneous lupus erythematosus in order to estimate the occurrence of side effects, particularly peripheral neuropathy. A total of 12 female patients, median age 38,6 years (range 26?56), with subacute or chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus were considered. The patients were treated with low dose thalidomide (starting dose 100?mg, tapered to 50?mg/day or 50?mg alternative day) for up to 18 months. The average follow-up period was 8,6 months (range 2?18). Prior to, and regularly during treatment patients underwent neurological evaluation and electrophysiological study of at least 8 nerves in the 4 arms (ulnar, median, sural, peroneal nerves). At recruitment, one patient presented a sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy. Of the remaining 11 patients, six did not present electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy, one had a carpal tunnel syndrome and four showed slowing of ulnar nerve velocity at elbow. No patients developed neuropathy neither worsening of electrophysiological parameters during thalidomide treatment. The most common side effect was tremor, always reversible after withdrawing or reducing thalidomide. Paresthesias, somnolence, amenhorrea, constipation were also present. Only one patient had to stop the therapy for the occurrence, 10 days after taking 50?mg of thalidomide, of a severe, stabbing, ?zoster-like? thoracic pain, which disappeared upon withdrawal of the drug. Started again on thalidomide, the symptoms reappeared and the patient definitely interrupted the therapy with benefit. All the 11 patients who continued on the therapy presented a significant improvement or remission of the cutaneous alterations. These preliminary data seem to indicate that low dose thalidomide is efficacious and tolerable for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Peripheral neuropathy seems not to be a major side effect. A longer follow-up and the study of more patients are needed to confirm the results.

AB  - Summary Disaster triage remains a complex and uncomfortable topic in contemporary bioethics. Questions of how best to allocate scarce resources have frequently pushed the boundaries of clinical bioethics and sparked significant debate over the past few decades. In its dual focus on the wellbeing of individuals and the welfare of communities, disaster relief unfolds at the intersection of clinical medicine, public health, disaster management, and humanitarian aid. It therefore requires striking a balance between competing concerns that shape micro- and macroallocation decisions. An integrated, system-wide approach that is based on community values may serve society's interests and ideals even when circumstances undermine its stability.

AB  - Dry eye conditions are prevalent with one in four to five patients presenting to eye care practitioners having dry eye signs and/or symptoms. An intimate relationship exists between the ocular surface and the tear film. The cycle of tear film instability and ocular surface damage characteristic of dry eye conditions suggests that dry eye represents a dysfunction of an integrated ocular surface-lacrimal gland unit. Therefore, dry eye is a multifactorial condition and an approach based on clinical subtypes is required for diagnosis and management. There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a contributing and exacerbating factor in dry eye conditions and anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy for chronic dry eye conditions may facilitate ocular surface healing. Other promising new treatments for dry eye include new generation artificial tear polymers and preservative systems, secretagogues, topical androgen supplements and surgical techniques for ocular surface reconstruction.

AB  - Problem The intersecting epidemics of gender-based violence, specifically forced sex, and HIV continue to affect women worldwide. Both in the United States and worldwide, women of African descent are disproportionately affected. Method of study The current literature was reviewed for inclusion based on its relevance to the intersection of forced sex and HIV risk behaviors. Results This brief review synthesizes research on the linkages between forced sex and behavioral risk factors for HIV infection. We explore forced sex from the perspective of the perpetrator being a current or former intimate partner, as well as the first sexual intercourse experience occurring through the use of physical force (i.e., forced sexual initiation). The review also emphasizes the importance of expanding current research to understand the physiological mechanisms linking forced sex to HIV risk. Conclusion The factors linking intimate partner forced sex and forced sexual initiation with HIV/AIDS are varied and complex. The review concludes with recommendations for future research in this area and implications this research could have on preventing violence and mitigating the health consequences.
