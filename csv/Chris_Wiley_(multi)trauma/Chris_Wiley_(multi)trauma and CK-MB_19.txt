AB  - Abstract Objective:? To describe and identify the relationship between ED length of stay (LOS) and mortality after ICU admission. Methods:? We undertook a retrospective cohort study of records from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006). Data from 45 hospitals and 48?803 ED patients directly transferred to ICU were included. Patients were divided into ED LOS < 8?h and ED LOS ≥ 8?h. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results:? Median ED LOS was 3.9?h (interquartile range 2.0?6.8). Patients transferred within 8?h (80.9%) were younger (P < 0.001) and more seriously ill (higher mortality and mechanical ventilation rate) than those transferred ≥8?h. There was no clear relationship between ED LOS and hospital survival for patients admitted directly to ICU (odds ratio = 1.01 per hour, 95% confidence intervals 0.99?1.02). Conclusion:? Although 20% of critically ill patients spend more than 8?h in ED before transfer to ICU, we were unable to demonstrate an adverse relationship between time in ED and hospital mortality.

AB  - Summary Understanding how, why, and when individuals create particular self-meanings has preoccupied scholars for decades, leading to an explosion of research on identity work. We conducted a wide-ranging review of this literature with the aim of presenting an overarching framework that comprehensively summarizes and integrates the vast amount of recent research in this domain. Drawing on our analysis of the empirical literature, we present an enhanced conceptual understanding of identity work. We then summarize the four dominant theoretical approaches researchers have used to explain how, when, and why individuals engage in identity work. This side-by-side comparison of these theoretical perspectives allows us to parse out the unique contribution of each theoretical lens and highlights how these theories can be integrated into a holistic view of an inherently multifaceted concept. Lastly, we critically analyze the state of the field and lay a detailed roadmap for future researchers to draw from to expand our current understanding of how individuals work on their identities in occupations and organizations.

AB  - Abstract Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2016 are no-table for (1) the largest total number of transplants performed (7841); (2) the shortest median waiting time in recent history (11.3 months); (3) continued reduction in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis C-related indications; (4) increasing numbers of patients whose clinical profiles are consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and (5) equilibration of transplant rates in patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the increase in the number of available organs, waitlist mortality remained an important concern. Graft survival rates continued to improve. In 2016, 723 new active candidates were added to the pediatric liver transplant waiting list, down from a peak of 826 in 2005. The number of prevalent candidates (on the list on December 31 of the given year) was stable, 408 active and 169 inactive. The number of pediatric living donor liver transplants decreased from a peak of 79 in 2015 to 62 in 2016, with most from donors closely related to the recipients. Graft survival continued to improve over the past decade among recipients of deceased donor and living donor livers.

PY  - 1996
AB  - Abstract A healthy woman sought preconceptional genetic counseling regarding a family history of a mitochondrial myopathy in her brother and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in her two maternal aunts. Several questions were raised: (1) What is the likelihood of a familial mitochondrial condition? (2) What molecular tests or prenatal screening can we offer? (3) How would these tests help assess the likelihood of a familial mitochondrial condition? A mitochondrial mutation previously identified in the brother consisted of a heteroplasmic 2.9 kb deletion. We detected this deletion in the peripheral blood of the brother by PCR amplification of the deletion breakpoint, but not in his mother, the consultand, nor in one of the two aunts affected with RP. Although the molecular analysis was encouraging to the consultand, a familial mitochondrial disorder could not be eliminated with certainty. The pros and cons of prenatal testing for mitochondrial disorders are discussed in general, and as specifically related to this family.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case of 83-year-old woman who brought to the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical services (EMSs) after being found wandering the streets in her nightgown. With the aging of world's population, the prevalence of elder abuse and neglect will increase. Increased educational efforts for healthcare providers, leading to increased awareness of this societal problem, are needed to protect our elderly patients. Treat the presenting condition and then mobilize the support services to ensure that the elderly person will be cared for appropriately when discharged. The difficult part is recognizing that the elderly patient's condition is due to abuse or neglect. One of the important points in the recognition of elder abuse is that there is no stereotypical victim. There are several screening tools to facilitate the detection of elder abuse. One that is easy to complete in the ED is the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI).

AB  - Summary Cyathostomins represent a potential cause of equine morbidity and have become the main focus of endoparasite control in managed horses. All grazing horses are at risk of infection with cyathostomins; therefore, the application of appropriate management measures is essential. Anthelmintics currently comprise the main method of control for equine nematodes and the ready availability of these products in some countries has resulted in their use becoming dissociated from veterinary involvement. This is concerning given the levels of anthelmintic resistance that have been recorded in cyathostomin populations. It is important that veterinarians re-establish control over the implementation of parasite control programmes, a major objective of which should be the preservation of anthelmintic efficacy. This article details the principles of cyathostomin control in horses with particular reference to anthelmintic resistance, and the use and interpretation of diagnostic tests for detecting cyathostomins and identifying anthelmintic resistance.

AB  - Summary Photography should be regarded as an integral part of daily clinical practice, and photographic equipment as part of the dental armamentarium, no different to a dental handpiece. However, the common consensus is that a camera is an extraneous apparatus, exclusively reserved for specialists, or clinicians with a penchant for taking pictures. The technical requirements of a lens for dental photography is that it serves a dual-purpose, first for portraiture and second for close-up or macrophotography. Many cameras have built-in flashes that pop-up when the lighting conditions are less than optimal. This is satisfactory for general photography but ill-advised for macrophotography. Some relatively inexpensive items are also useful for completing the photographic equipment arsenal. These include rechargeable batteries, a multi-card reader for transferring images to a computer, UV bulbs for visualising fluorescence of natural teeth and artificial prostheses, or porosity defects in porcelain restorations.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In cases of laminitis, an increased muscle force or contracture of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) is suggested, but evidence-based research is lacking. Objectives To test if the DDFM of laminitic equines shows an increased muscle force detectable by needle-EMG including Interference Pattern Analysis (IPA). Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Three groups consisted of Group 0 (control): 6 Royal Dutch Sport horses, 3 Shetland ponies and one Welsh pony (healthy, sound adults, mean?±?s.d. weight 411?±?217?kg). Group 1: 3 Royal Dutch Sport horses, one Friesian, one Haflinger, one Icelandic horse, 2 Welsh ponies, one miniature Appaloosa and 6 Shetland ponies (adults, mean?±?s.d. weight 310?±?172?kg) suffering from acute or chronic laminitis. EMG measurements including firing frequency (F) and IPA parameters Turns/Second (T), Amplitude/Turn (M) and Ratio M/T (R) were performed. ANOVA was used to analyse data. P values of P<0.05 were considered significant. Results Mean?±?s.d. F of Group 0 and Group 1 was 53?±?11 and 72?±?21?Hz, mean?±?s.d. T was 112?±?57 and 106?±?42, mean?±?s.d. M was 284?±?51 and 254?±?38??V and mean?±?s.d. R was 0.39?±?0.17 and 0.42?±?0.16%, respectively. The firing frequency of Group 1 was significantly higher compared to Group 0 (P?=?0.02), whereas other differences were not significant. Conclusions In human medicine, an increased firing frequency is a characteristic of increased muscle force [1,2]. Thus, the increased firing frequency of the DDFM in case of laminitis suggests an elevated muscle force. As all parameters show a high variance, a repeated study including a larger test group is advised. Ethical animal research:?Data collection from controls was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Utrecht University, approval number 2008.III.07.061 and 2013.III.01.012. Clinical cases were privately owned and written owner consent was obtained. Source of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Macaque species, specifically rhesus (Macaca mulatta), are the most common nonhuman primates (NHPs) used in biomedical research due to their suitability as a model of high priority diseases (e.g., HIV, obesity, cognitive aging), cost effective breeding and housing compared to most other NHPs, and close evolutionary relationship to humans. With this close evolutionary relationship, however, is a shared adaptation for a socially stimulating environment, without which both their welfare and suitability as a research model are compromised. While outdoor social group housing provides the best approximation of a social environment that matches the macaque behavioral biology in the wild, this is not always possible at all facilities, where animals may be housed indoors in small groups, in pairs, or alone. Further, animals may experience many housing changes in their lifetime depending on project needs, changes in social status, management needs, or health concerns. Here, we review the evidence for the physiological and health effects of social housing changes and the potential impacts on research outcomes for studies using macaques, particularly rhesus. We situate our review in the context of increasing regulatory pressure for research facilities to both house NHPs socially and mitigate trauma from social aggression. To meet these regulatory requirements and further refine the macaque model for research, significant advances must be made in our understanding and management of rhesus macaque social housing, particularly pair-housing since it is the most common social housing configuration for macaques while on research projects. Because most NHPs are adapted for sociality, a social context is likely important for improving repeatability, reproducibility, and external validity of primate biomedical research. Am. J.

AB  - Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis, that has a classic complication of acquired coronary artery aneurysm. Severe forms with multi-organ involvement or neurological dysfunction are rare. Cerebral vascular involvement has been related to large-vessel injury or cardioembolism, leading to focal brain infarction. A 4-year-old female presented with unusual, rapidly catastrophic Kawasaki disease with refractory shock, acute renal failure, and coma, requiring intensive haemodynamic management. The observation of diffuse micro-haemorrhages (T2*-weighted sequence) associated with white matter injury on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pointed towards lesions of the medium/small blood vessels. Cerebral vasculitis was suspected and the immunosuppressive treatment was increased Subsequently, the patient?s recovery was rapid. On follow-up severe, bilateral vitritis was evident and surgery improved visual outcome. Early recognition of severe or unusual forms of Kawasaki disease could lead to more favourable outcome using appropriate treatment strategies. Diffuse cerebral micro-haemorrhages on T2* brain MRI sequences might be a key sign for the diagnosis of medium or small cerebral vessel involvement.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of liver and spleen. In a nonoperative patient, angiographic embolization (AE) can be an adjunct in liver injuries that contains an arterio-venous fistula or have ongoing bleeding. Nonoperative management of blunt liver injuries in patients with normal hemodynamics is recommended with greater than 90% success. Hydatid disease of the liver is uncommon. It is caused by parasitic Echinococcus, which has dogs as its definitive hosts. Patients with high-grade liver injuries have an increased risk of developing post-injury biloma as a complication. The accessory spleen is a common anomaly, occurring in up to 20% of the population. However, it can occur in up to 30% of patients with a hematologic disorder. Splenic artery aneurysm is very uncommon, but it is the third most frequent abdominal artery to undergo aneurismal changes.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe renal replacement therapy (RRT) prescribing practices in Malaysian intensive care units (ICU), and compare this with previously published data from other regions. Method A survey was sent to physicians responsible for prescribing RRT in major ICU throughout Malaysia. The questionnaire sought information on the physicians' background, and detailed information regarding RRT settings. Results Nineteen physicians from 24 sites throughout Malaysia responded to the survey (response rate 79.2%). Sixteen respondents were intensivists (84%), 2 were anaesthetists (11%) and one was a nephrologist (5%). The majority (58%) used continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) as the treatment of choice for acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. RRT prescription was predominantly practitioner-dependent (63%), while 37% reported use of a dedicated protocol. The mean blood flow rate and effluent flow rate used for continuous RRT (CRRT) were 188.9?±?28.9?mL/min and 30.6?±?4.7?mL/kg/h respectively. Replacement fluid solutions containing both lactate and bicarbonate were commonly used during CRRT, applied both pre- and post-dilution. Conclusion CRRT was the first-choice modality used to treat AKI in critically ill patients. CVVH was the most common CRRT technique used, while other RRT modalities were used less frequently. Overall, RRT practices were similar to those observed in other regions, although the modality and settings used were slightly different, likely due to local availability.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
