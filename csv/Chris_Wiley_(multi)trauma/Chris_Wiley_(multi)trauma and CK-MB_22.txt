AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been found to be among the complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the mechanisms of PN in patients with HCV infection are still unknown, cryoglobulinemia has been implicated as a possible cause of ischemic peripheral nerve impairment mediated by vasoconstriction, altered blood viscosity, and thrombosis of small vessels. However, available information is mostly based on referral patients with chronic HCV infection. In this study, an unselected sample of cases with newly diagnosed HCV infection has been examined to assess the prevalence and type of PN and to correlate the disease with the presence of cryoglobulinemia. The study population included 41 patients with HCV infection and no documented risk factors for PN (18 women and 23 men, aged 17 to 72 years) referred to the neurophysiology units of 7 Italian centers (Genova, Lodi, Messina, Monza, Napoli, Padova, and Siena) for a clinical and electrophysiological screening of peripheral nerve disease. The mean latency between diagnosis of HCV infection (interpreted as a surrogate of the duration of infection) and study entry was 6.8 months (range 1?12). PN was documented in 13 cases (31.7%). Of these, 7 had mononeuropathy and 6 had polyneuropathy. Cryoglobulinemia was present in 4 patients (9.8%) and 3 of them had PN (polyneuropathy 2, mononeuropathy 1). The odds ratio of PN in patients with cryoglobulinemia, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of infection, was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3?68.2) and was fairly similar (4.1; 95% CI 0.3?56.3) when the analysis was limited to the presence of polyneuropathy. The lack of statistical significance may by explained by the small sample size. Based on these findings, cryoglobulinemia can be interpreted as an independent risk factor for PN at the presence of HCV infection. However, given the fairly high prevalence of PN in patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection and the high proportion of cases not attributable to cryoglobulinemia (9 out of 13), other factors should be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of HCV neuropathy.

AB  - Background: Data on periodontal conditions in adolescents in the Dominican Republic are scarce. The aim of the present crosssectional study was to estimate the prevalence of periodontal attachment loss among Dominican adolescents. This study did not attempt to classify the disease into aggressive and chronic periodontitis. Methods: A random sample of 2,007 Dominican adolescents was obtained. A probability, weighted sample was selected using a complex, multi-stage probability sampling design. The study was clustered in 26 schools and 106 classes. The study subjects were clinically examined under field conditions by a single calibrated examiner who measured gingival recession and probing depth at six sites per tooth, with subsequent calculation of clinical periodontal attachment level for each site. Results: The prevalence of clinical attachment loss ≥1 mm was 49.5%, with the prevalence ranging between 48.7% and 50.2%, depending on age and gender. Clinical attachment loss ≥2 mm was found in 15% of the students and attachment loss ≥3 mm in 4.0% of the students. Logistic regression model revealed that only age significantly increased the probability of having clinical attachment loss. Conclusion: We conclude that clinical attachment loss is common in adolescents in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, suggesting the necessity for improved standards of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these lesions.

AB  - Abstract Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPS; OMIM 259770) is an autosomal-recessive genetic disorder characterized by severe osteoporosis and visual disturbance from childhood. Biallelic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 gene (LRP5) have been frequently detected, while a subset of patients had only one or no detectable mutation. We report on the clinical and molecular findings of four unrelated Japanese patients with the syndrome. The four patients had typical skeletal and ocular phenotypes of OPS, namely severe juvenile osteoporosis and early-onset visual disturbance, with or without mental retardation. We undertook standard PCR-based sequencing for LRP5 and found four missense mutations (p.L145F, p.T244M, p.P382L, and p.T552M), one nonsense mutation (p.R1534X), and one splice site mutation (c.1584+1G>A) among four OPS patients. Although three patients had two heterozygous mutations, one had only one heterozygous splice site mutation. In this patient, RT-PCR from lymphocytic RNA demonstrated splice error resulting in 63-bp insertion between exons 7 and 8. Furthermore, the patient was found to have only mutated RT-PCR fragment, implying that a seemingly normal allele did not express LRP5 mRNA. We then conducted custom- designed oligonucleotide tiling microarray analyses targeted to a 600-kb genome region harboring LRP5 and discovered a 7.2-kb microdeletion encompassing exons 22 and 23 of LRP5. We found various types of LRP5 mutations, including an exon-level deletion that is undetectable by standard PCR-based mutation screening. Oligonucleotide tiling microarray seems to be a powerful tool in identifying cryptic structural mutations. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Equine grass sickness (EGS) remains a frequently fatal disease of equids in Great Britain (GB). The first nationwide surveillance scheme for EGS was developed to obtain information on the occurrence of EGS and to help facilitate future proposed intervention studies, such as vaccine trials. Objectives: To collect both retrospective and prospective data on cases of EGS occurring in GB since 2000 and to assess potential risk factors for categories of EGS and survival after chronic EGS. Methods: Prospective data were collected using a nationwide surveillance scheme for EGS that was developed and initiated in 2007. Data were collected by means of postal and online questionnaires documenting both retrospective premises-level and prospective case-level information. Data on outcomes of EGS category and survival after chronic grass sickness (CGS) were analysed using univariable logistic regression. Results: Descriptive data for 1410 EGS cases occurring in GB in the decade between the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2009 are presented. Univariable logistic regression analyses identified that CGS cases in Scotland were significantly more likely to survive than those occurring elsewhere in GB. There was no relationship between case details and the category of EGS or the outcome among CGS cases. Conclusions: EGS affected equids throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Although an overall average of 141 cases were reported to the nationwide surveillance scheme annually, this number of cases was not consistent between years. Around 50% of CGS cases survived, although regional differences in survival rates existed, probably due to variation in expertise of care and/or disease severity. Potential relevance: This study provides information on the spatiotemporal occurrence of EGS in GB during the last decade. Data from the nationwide surveillance scheme can be used in developing protocols for future intervention studies such as Clostridium botulinum vaccine trials.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To develop recommendations for child unintentional injury prevention by comparing New Zealand's child unintentional injury mortality and injury prevention policies with those of European countries. Methods: Unintentional child injury death rates based on external cause of injury were calculated and ranked. NZ's score for each of the 12 domains (based on external causes of injury) from the New Zealand Child and Adolescent Report Card was compared to European scoring. Policy priorities are identified by domains where mortality makes up a high proportion of overall child unintentional injury mortality (high burden of injury) and where report card score for that domain is low in comparison to other countries (under-utilisation of effective interventions). Results: Death as a motor vehicle occupant accounts for 49% of all child unintentional injury deaths, followed by pedestrian (10%) and drowning deaths (8%). The overall score for the 12 policy domains of the NZ Report Card ranks NZ as 15th among the 25 European countries. There are important policy and legislative actions which NZ has not implemented. Conclusions: A number of evidence-based injury prevention policy and legislative actions are available that could target areas of greatest childhood injury mortality in NZ. Implications: A set of injury prevention policy and legislation priorities are presented which, if implemented, would result in a significant reduction in the injury mortality and morbidity rates of NZ children.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Summary Understanding how, why, and when individuals create particular self-meanings has preoccupied scholars for decades, leading to an explosion of research on identity work. We conducted a wide-ranging review of this literature with the aim of presenting an overarching framework that comprehensively summarizes and integrates the vast amount of recent research in this domain. Drawing on our analysis of the empirical literature, we present an enhanced conceptual understanding of identity work. We then summarize the four dominant theoretical approaches researchers have used to explain how, when, and why individuals engage in identity work. This side-by-side comparison of these theoretical perspectives allows us to parse out the unique contribution of each theoretical lens and highlights how these theories can be integrated into a holistic view of an inherently multifaceted concept. Lastly, we critically analyze the state of the field and lay a detailed roadmap for future researchers to draw from to expand our current understanding of how individuals work on their identities in occupations and organizations.

AB  - Abstract Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2016 are no-table for (1) the largest total number of transplants performed (7841); (2) the shortest median waiting time in recent history (11.3 months); (3) continued reduction in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis C-related indications; (4) increasing numbers of patients whose clinical profiles are consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and (5) equilibration of transplant rates in patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the increase in the number of available organs, waitlist mortality remained an important concern. Graft survival rates continued to improve. In 2016, 723 new active candidates were added to the pediatric liver transplant waiting list, down from a peak of 826 in 2005. The number of prevalent candidates (on the list on December 31 of the given year) was stable, 408 active and 169 inactive. The number of pediatric living donor liver transplants decreased from a peak of 79 in 2015 to 62 in 2016, with most from donors closely related to the recipients. Graft survival continued to improve over the past decade among recipients of deceased donor and living donor livers.

We undertook a retrospective cohort study of records from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006). Data from 45 hospitals and 48?803 ED patients directly transferred to ICU were included. Patients were divided into ED LOS < 8?h and ED LOS ≥ 8?h. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results:? Median ED LOS was 3.9?h (interquartile range 2.0?6.8). Patients transferred within 8?h (80.9%) were younger (P < 0.001) and more seriously ill (higher mortality and mechanical ventilation rate) than those transferred ≥8?h. There was no clear relationship between ED LOS and hospital survival for patients admitted directly to ICU (odds ratio = 1.01 per hour, 95% confidence intervals 0.99?1.02). Conclusion:? Although 20% of critically ill patients spend more than 8?h in ED before transfer to ICU, we were unable to demonstrate an adverse relationship between time in ED and hospital mortality.

AB  - Abstract A healthy woman sought preconceptional genetic counseling regarding a family history of a mitochondrial myopathy in her brother and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in her two maternal aunts. Several questions were raised: (1) What is the likelihood of a familial mitochondrial condition? (2) What molecular tests or prenatal screening can we offer? (3) How would these tests help assess the likelihood of a familial mitochondrial condition? A mitochondrial mutation previously identified in the brother consisted of a heteroplasmic 2.9 kb deletion. We detected this deletion in the peripheral blood of the brother by PCR amplification of the deletion breakpoint, but not in his mother, the consultand, nor in one of the two aunts affected with RP. Although the molecular analysis was encouraging to the consultand, a familial mitochondrial disorder could not be eliminated with certainty. The pros and cons of prenatal testing for mitochondrial disorders are discussed in general, and as specifically related to this family.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case of 83-year-old woman who brought to the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical services (EMSs) after being found wandering the streets in her nightgown. With the aging of world's population, the prevalence of elder abuse and neglect will increase. Increased educational efforts for healthcare providers, leading to increased awareness of this societal problem, are needed to protect our elderly patients. Treat the presenting condition and then mobilize the support services to ensure that the elderly person will be cared for appropriately when discharged. The difficult part is recognizing that the elderly patient's condition is due to abuse or neglect. One of the important points in the recognition of elder abuse is that there is no stereotypical victim. There are several screening tools to facilitate the detection of elder abuse. One that is easy to complete in the ED is the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI).

AB  - Summary Cyathostomins represent a potential cause of equine morbidity and have become the main focus of endoparasite control in managed horses. All grazing horses are at risk of infection with cyathostomins; therefore, the application of appropriate management measures is essential. Anthelmintics currently comprise the main method of control for equine nematodes and the ready availability of these products in some countries has resulted in their use becoming dissociated from veterinary involvement. This is concerning given the levels of anthelmintic resistance that have been recorded in cyathostomin populations. It is important that veterinarians re-establish control over the implementation of parasite control programmes, a major objective of which should be the preservation of anthelmintic efficacy. This article details the principles of cyathostomin control in horses with particular reference to anthelmintic resistance, and the use and interpretation of diagnostic tests for detecting cyathostomins and identifying anthelmintic resistance.
