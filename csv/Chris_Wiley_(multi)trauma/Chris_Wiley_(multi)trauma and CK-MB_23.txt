AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: There is continuing debate on the clinical benefit of laryngoplasty (LP) in the treatment of equine laryngeal paralysis. In particular, there is little information available on the clinical value of this surgery in older horses, in non-Thoroughbreds or in sports or pleasure horses; nor on the relationship between the degree of LP abduction achieved and the clinical value of LP. Objectives: To evaluate the owner's assessment of the value of LP(and combined ventriculocordectomy) in an older, mixed breed and mixed workload population of horses and to also assess the relationship between the degree of LP abduction present and the clinical value of this surgery. Methods: A study (1986?1998) of 200 horses of mixed breed and workload, median age 6 years (prospective 136 cases and retrospective 64 cases) undergoing LP and ventriculocordectomy was undertaken. The degree of laryngoplasty abduction achieved and maintained was semi-quantitatively evaluated using a 5-grade system. Results: A survey of 198 owners, a median of 19 months after LP surgery, showed that 91% of cases had returned to full work and 3% to reduced work, including 95% of horses with good (Grade 2) laryngoplasty abduction at 6 weeks after surgery, 91% with moderate (Grade 3) abduction, 88% of cases with minsimal (Grade 4) abduction and just 25% of cases with total loss of surgical abduction (Grade 5). Once back in work, 73% of cases were reported to make no abnormal exercise-related noises (?noises?) at exercise, with reduced ?noises? reported in some of the 21% of horses that still made ?noises?. In the other 6% of cases, owners were unsure if ?noises? were present. The absence or presence of ?noises? once back at work correlated significantly with the degree of surgical arytenoid abduction present at 6 weeks after LP. Once back in work, ?noises? were less commonly detected in sports and pleasure horses (absent in 76% of cases) than in racehorses (absent in 60%) of cases. Exercise performance following surgery was reported to be markedly increased in 75% of cases, with 10% showing no difference in exercise performance, 3% showing worse performance, and owners unsure of any effect on exercise performance in 13% of cases. Improved work was reported in 70% of sports and pleasure horses and in 67% of racehorses. Overall, 86% of owners believed LP was worthwhile, 7% believed it was not worthwhile and 6% were unsure of its value. Surgery was reported to be of most benefit to sports horses (e.g. reported worthwhile for 100% of show jumpers) and of least benefit to National Hunt (long distance) racehorses where 71% of owners believed it to be worthwhile. Conclusions and potential relevance: Most horse-owners believe that LP and combined ventriculocordectomy are of clinical value, especially in sports and pleasure horses. Large scale physiological studies on clinical cases, pre- and post operatively, are required to examine more critically the value of such surgery.

AB  - Objectives Change in cognitive functioning is often observed after hip fracture. Different patterns, with both improvement and decline, are expected, depending on premorbid cognitive functioning and events that occur during hospitalization. These patterns are unknown and important for older hip fracture patients with different levels of premorbid cognitive functioning. Design, Setting, Participants, Measurements We conducted a secondary analysis of a multi-center randomized controlled trial. 302 consecutive patients aged 65?102 years old, admitted for hip fracture surgery, were enrolled. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was obtained at hospital admission, at discharge, and at 3 and 12 months after discharge. Cognitive trajectories were identified with Group Based Trajectory Modelling, using the repeated MMSE measurements as outcome variable. To illustrate the specific characteristics of this relative novel methodological approach, it was contrasted with results obtained from linear mixed effects modeling. Results 146 (48.3%) patients had premorbid cognitive impairment and 85 patients (28.1%) experienced delirium during admission. Three distinct cognitive trajectories were identified and labeled based on different MMSE course over time: improvement (57.9%), stable (28.1%), and rapid decline (13.9%), with an annual MMSE change of 1.7, 0.8, and ?3.5 points respectively. With mixed effects modeling an overall annual increase of 0.7 MMSE points was estimated for the group as a whole. Conclusion Three distinct cognitive trajectories were identified in a population of older hip fracture patients. These trajectory groups can be used as a starting point to inform patients and caregivers on the possible prognosis after hip fracture. Group based trajectory modelling is a useful technique when the purpose is to describe patterns of change within a population and a variety of trajectories are expected to exist.

AB  - Abstract There is long-standing debate about whether elevated dissociative symptoms are common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or whether there is a distinct subtype of cases with elevated dissociation. The current investigation examined the latent structure of dissociative symptoms in a sample of 316 male, trauma-exposed Vietnam veterans, 76 of whom were diagnosed with current PTSD. Three taxometric procedures (MAMBAC, MAXEIG, and MAXCOV) were performed on three indicator sets drawn from the Dissociative Experiences Scale. Taxometric analyses consistently revealed a taxon (subtype) of highly dissociative individuals. The taxon members had significantly more severe posttraumatic symptoms and were more often diagnosed with current PTSD than were non-taxon members. Among participants with a current PTSD diagnoses, only 32% belonged to the dissociative taxon, suggesting that there is a subtype of severe PTSD with elevated dissociation.

AB  - The inhibition of microbial growth is the first step toward avoiding the formation of biofilms. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the microbiostatic activity of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) with three commonly used antiseptic agents to find an alternative to or supplementary concept for antiseptic treatment. The efficacy of two CAP generating devices ? the plasma jet kINPen09? and a hollow dielectric barrier electrode (HDBD) ? both working with argon with or without admixture of 1% oxygen, was compared with chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG 0.0001 and 0.00000625%), polyhexanide (PHMB 0.0001 and 0.000025%) and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT 0.0002 and 0.00005%). The antiseptics were added to the planktonic stage of the biofilm-forming strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa SG 81, Staphylococcus epidermidis RP 62A, Streptococcus mutans DSM 20523 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 resp. SC 5314. The antiseptics were present during the subsequent cultivation period (32.5?h), whereas CAP was applied for only 60?s with the same cultivation period after the exposition. During the cultivation period, growth was measured every hour by optical density and analyzed with the calculated area under the curve (AUC) to determine the delay of exponential growth. Except for the higher resistance of C. albicans against PHMB and S. mutans against CHG, P. aeruginosa was the most resistant test organism against the other antiseptic treatments. OCT 0.0002% was the most effective among the tested antiseptic agents. The plasma jet did not differ from OCT in its efficacy against C. albicans and S. mutans. Against P. aeruginosa and both Candida strains, the plasma jet was more effective than against both Gram-positive test strains. In terms of efficacy against Candida spp., the HDBD (dielectric barrier discharge plasma) did not differ significantly from the plasma jet with argon plasma; in contrast, the bacteriostatic efficacy was significantly higher. While the addition of 1% O2 did not change the efficacy of the plasma jet, the efficacy of the HDBD against S. epidermidis increased significantly. The antimicrobial efficacy of CAP as demonstrated in earlier studies was confirmed with planktonic microorganisms showing delayed growth during cultivation for 32.5?h after a single application of CAP for 60?s. Short treatment with CAP could be an effective alternative or supplement to conventional antiseptics, for example, to inhibit the growth of microorganisms in an infected wound. OCT in the concentration used here showed the best microbial growth inhibitory results among the antiseptics.

AB  - Introduction The Accutrend? Lactate (formerly Accusport?) is a low cost point-of-care L-lactate analyser. The analyser is widely used in the training of horses and has been used for research studies and to assist the clinical management of critically ill horses. The analyser is reported to be linear from 0.8?22.0?mmol/L (blood) and 0.7?26.0?mmol/L (plasma); however, test performance at high L-lactate concentrations in equine blood and plasma has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer over a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in paired blood and plasma samples. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected from 8 trained Standardbreds before, during, and after a simulated race on a treadmill into 4?mL partially evacuated tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were measured using a colorimetric lactate-oxidase mediated reaction (BM-Lactate? test strips and Accutrend? Lactate) and the reference enzymatic method (L-lactic dehydrogenase spectrophotometry at 340?nm using samples deproteinized with 8% perchloric acid). Data was analysed using Deming regression and Bland-Altman plots adjusted for repeated measures (P<0.05). Results The reference method measured a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in 128 blood (0.2?23.8?mmol/L) and 127 plasma (0.3?41.1?mmol/L) samples. The Accutrend? Lactate analyzer provided an accurate method of L-lactate measurement, but only when blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were <12.5?mmol/L (79% of samples) and <15.0?mmol/L (64% of samples), respectively. Conclusions Blood L-lactate concentrations >12.5?mmol/L and plasma L-lactate concentrations >15.0?mmol/L measured by the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer underestimate the true value by a variable amount when compared with the enzymatic reference method. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Purdue University.

AB  - Introduction Direct measurement of peak vertical force in equine forelimbs and hindlimbs under training conditions has not been achieved to date. This measurement is possible using dynamometric horseshoes (DHSs). The objectives of this study were to investigate, on a firm surface, the effect of speed on stride parameters and on vertical loading in the forelimb (FL) compared to the hindlimb (HL). Methods Right front and hind hooves of 5 trotters were equipped with a DHS. A linear corridor was delimited on a firm sand training track. Each horse alternately repeated trials (harness trot) at 25, 35 and 40?km/h (4 to 6 times at each speed). For each trial, stride parameters and dynamic variables (peak vertical force and impulse, vertical loading rate) were analysed for 10 successive strides. Correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the association between speed and the studied variables; linear mixed-effects regression models were used to test the significance (P<0.05) of these associations. Results Stance and stride duration, and their ratio (duty factor) were linearly correlated with speed (r<-0.82), both in FL and HL. Peak vertical force was the only variable for which r was higher in HL (r?=?0.80 vs. 0.50 in FL). The relationship between vertical loading rate and speed had the highest r of all dynamic variables (r?=?0.87 and 0.83, respectively in FL and HL; r?=?-0.75 and ?0.60 for vertical impulse). Conclusions The linear relation between peak vertical force and speed demonstrated in the hindlimb differs from previous studies at lower speed. These results stress the necessity of performing biomechanical measurements under real training conditions.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric surgery. Emergent surgical airways in children carry a higher risk of complications compared with adults. These include injury to the airway, tube misplacement or dislodgment, and longer-term risks of subglottic stenosis. A cuffed tube in the trachea is the only ?definitive? airway, although temporary airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway or combined esophageal/tracheal tubes can provide initial airway control and oxygenation/ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. Younger children have a higher incidence of higher level cervical spine injuries. Burn-related injuries are much less common, but are a cause of significant morbidity and often lifelong disability. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population are parenteral nutrition supplementation, central venous catheter, deep sedation, and neuromuscular blockade.

AB  - Introduction Calculating the total plasma concentration of carbon dioxide (ctCO2) from the results of blood gas and pH analysis assumes that the value for pK1? is constant and approximates 6.095. The objective of this study was to verify both assumptions in equine plasma. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected pre-race from 115 trained Standardbreds into 3?mL partially evacuated plastic tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood pH (pHb) and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) were measured in one tube using a blood gas and pH analyser (Radiometer ABL-700). The second tube was anaerobically centrifuged and ctCO2 was measured (Beckman EL-ISE analyser). Plasma pK1? was calculated for each horse using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, measured values for pHb, pCO2, and plasma ctCO2, and the value for the solubility of CO2 in plasma at 37C (S?=?0.0307?{mmol/L}/mmHg) whereby: pK1??=?(pHb?+?0.01)?log10({ctCO2-S???pCO2}/{S???pCO2}), with the term (pHb?+?0.01) representing the pH in plasma. The calculated value for pK1? was standardized to pHb?=?7.40 using the Severinghaus equation such that dpK1?/dpH?=??0.044. Non-parametric statistical procedures were used to determine the median value and 95% confidence interval (CI) for pK1?. Results The median value for pK1? at pHb?=?7.40 was 6.097, and the 95% CI for pK1? was 6.063?6.123. Conclusions The 95% CI for pK1? in equine plasma from trained Standardbreds is narrow and includes the assumed fixed value of 6.095. Our findings support the use of blood gas and pH analysis to calculate plasma ctCO2 in order to detect the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents in horses.

AB  - Abstract Consent is generally required for research and sharing rich individual-level data but presents additional ethical and legal challenges where participants have diminished decision-making capacity. We formed a multi-disciplinary team to develop best practices for consent in data-intensive dementia research. We recommend that consent processes for research and data sharing support decision-making by persons with dementia, protect them from exploitation, and promote the common good. Broad consent designed to endure beyond a loss of capacity and combined with ongoing oversight can best achieve these goals. Persons with dementia should be supported to make decisions and enabled to express their will and preferences about participation in advance of a loss of capacity. Regulatory frameworks should clarify who can act as a representative for research decisions. By promoting harmonization of consent practices across institutions, sectors, and countries, we hope to facilitate data sharing to accelerate progress in dementia research, care, and prevention.

AB  - Introduction Healthy and poorly performing horses can display arrhythmias during exercise and immediately afterwards. The relationship of arrhythmias to exercise intensity or type, and their frequency of recurrence, are poorly understood. Clarification of these issues was the objective of this investigation. Methods Electrocardiograms were recorded on 9 Thoroughbreds during maximal and submaximal exercise on a racetrack (RA) and treadmill (TM). The frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias for RA and TM were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Results 65 workouts (TM?=?46, RA?=?19; median[range]: 4/horse[2?14]) were performed. Exercising arrhythmias were detected in 4/9 horses (12/65 workouts) and there were post-exercise arrhythmias in 7/9 horses (20/65 workouts). A single exercising electrocardiogram per horse often did not display all arrhythmias detected over several workouts. 3/9 horses exhibited arrhythmias during the first and second runs while the other 6 had none. 4/9 had 1 post-exercise arrhythmia. Of 6 horses with >3 runs, 1 displayed arrhythmias each time, 3 never had arrhythmias and 2 sometimes showed arrhythmias during exercise (1/9 and 4/8 workouts, respectively). All 6 intermittently had post-exercise arrhythmias (median[range]: 50% [9?75%] of workouts). Presence of arrhythmias was positively related to intensity and all occurred at ≥94%HRmax. The frequency of arrhythmias following RA (29%) and TM (12.5%) was not statistically different. Conclusions Gallops on TM or RA were equally effective for detecting arrhythmias. The presence/absence of exercising arrhythmias was more repeatable than post-exercise arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are more likely to be detected at maximal or near-maximal intensities. A larger population needs to be studied before firm conclusions are drawn. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.

AB  - Introduction Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Haemorrhage (EIPH) results from hypertensive episodes associated with intense exercise and can negatively impact athletic performance. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) secretion from pulmonary endothelium is increased during pulmonary disease. This study investigated the effects of furosemide administration on ACE activity, and hypothesised a positive association between EIPH and post-race plasma ACE. Methods Blood samples from 73 horses were collected after racing. ACE activity was measured using a fluorometric method. Respiratory endoscopy determined occurrence and grade of EIPH. Comparison of horses treated or not with furosemide before racing and the occurrence of EIPH were conducted by independent sample t-tests. In addition, regression analysis was used to investigate the association between ACE activity and EIPH grade for all horses. Other variables analysed included time to endoscopy and haematocrit. Results Mean ACE activity in horses not treated with furosemide (n?= 47; 91.7?±?15.9) was significantly higher (P?=?0.002) than in treated horses (n?=?26; 79.6?±?13.9). When EIPH positive horses were analysed separately, those treated with furosemide (n?=?20; ACE 78.2?±?11.9) had significantly lower ACE (P?=?0.009) than non-treated horses (n?=?17; ACE 90.9?±?15.9). Regression analysis indicated a polynomial relationship between mean ACE activity and EIPH grade (0, 1, 2 or 3?+?4?+?5; adjusted r2?=?0.99; P<0.001). No other comparisons were statistically significant. Conclusions Results indicated associations between ACE activity, EIPH grade and furosemide administration and investigation of the potential use of ACE as a biomarker for EIPH severity in controlled studies are warranted. Ethical Animal Research This research was conducted with approval from The Animal Ethics Committee at WINTEC, and informed owner consent was obtained for horses included in this study. Sources of funding:?partially funded by a Research Grant from WINTEC. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Purpose To demonstrate the feasibility of spectral imaging using photon-counting detector (PCD) x-ray computed tomography (CT) for simultaneous material decomposition of three contrast agents in vivo in a large animal model. Methods This Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved study used a canine model. Bismuth subsalicylate was administered orally 24?72 h before imaging. PCD CT was performed during intravenous administration of 40?60 ml gadoterate meglumine; 3.5 min later, iopamidol 370 was injected intravenously. Renal PCD CT images were acquired every 2 s for 5?6 min to capture the wash-in and wash-out kinetics of the contrast agents. Least mean squares linear material decomposition was used to calculate the concentrations of contrast agents in the aorta, renal cortex, renal medulla and renal pelvis. Results Using reference vials with known concentrations of materials, we computed molar concentrations of the various contrast agents during each phase of CT scanning. Material concentration maps allowed simultaneous quantification of both arterial and delayed renal enhancement in a single CT acquisition. The accuracy of the material decomposition algorithm in a test phantom was ?0.4 ± 2.2 mM, 0.3 ± 2.2 mM for iodine and gadolinium solutions, respectively. Peak contrast concentration of gadolinium and iodine in the aorta, renal cortex, and renal medulla were observed 16, 24, and 60 s after the start each injection, respectively. Conclusion Photon-counting spectral CT allowed simultaneous material decomposition of multiple contrast agents in vivo. Besides defining contrast agent concentrations, tissue enhancement at multiple phases was observed in a single CT acquisition, potentially obviating the need for multiphase CT scans and thus reducing radiation dose.

AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.
