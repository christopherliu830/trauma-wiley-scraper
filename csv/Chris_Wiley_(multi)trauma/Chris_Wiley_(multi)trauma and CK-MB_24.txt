AB  - ABSTRACT Lungs are allocated to adult and adolescent transplant candidates (aged ? 12 years) on the basis of age, geography, blood type compatibility, and the lung allocation score (LAS), which reflects risk of waitlist mortality and probability of posttransplant survival. In 2013, the most adult candidates, 2394, of any year were added to the list. Overall median waiting time for candidates listed in 2013 was 4.0 months. The preferred procedure remained bilateral lung transplant, representing approximately 70% of lung transplants in 2013. Measures of short-term and longterm survival have plateaued since the implementation of the LAS in 2005. The number of new child candidates (aged 0-11 years) added to the lung transplant waiting list increased to 39 in 2013. A total of 28 lung transplants were performed in child recipients, 3 for ages younger than 1 year, 9 for ages 1 to 5 years, and 16 for ages 6 to 11 years. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was associated with higher survival rates than cystic fibrosis or other diagnosis (pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). For child candidates, infection was the leading cause of death in year 1 posttransplant and graft failure in years 2 to 5.

AB  - Abstract Background The Emergency Medicine (EM) Milestone Project provides guidance for assessment of resident trainee airway management proficiency (PC10). Although milestones provide a general structure for assessment, they do not define performance standards. The objective of this project was to establish comprehensive airway management performance standards for EM trainees at both novice and mastery levels of proficiency. Methods Comprehensive airway management standards were derived using standard-setting procedures. A panel of residency education and airway management experts was convened to determine how trainees would be expected to perform on 51 individual tasks in a standardized airway management simulation encompassing preparation, endotracheal intubation, backup airway use, and ventilation. Experts participated in facilitated exercises in which they were asked to 1) define which items were critical for patient safety, 2) predict the performance of a ?novice? learner, and 3) predict the performance of a ?mastery? learner nearing independent practice. Experts were given a worksheet to complete and descriptive statistics were calculated using STATA 14. Results Experts identified 39 of 51 (76%) airway management items as critical for patient safety. Experts also noted that novice trainees do not need to complete all the items deemed to be critical prior to starting practice since they will be supervised by a board-certified EM physician. In contrast, mastery-level trainees would be expected to successfully complete not only the critical tasks, but also nearly all the items in the assessment (49/51, 96%) since they are nearing independent practice. Conclusion In this study, we established EM resident performance standards for comprehensive airway management during a simulation scenario. Future work will focus on validating these performance standards in current resident trainees as they move from simulation to actual patient care.

AB  - To better assess historical, physical and neurophysiological features of UNE, 20 centers widely distributed in the national country have joined a collaborative study in November 2001. Case recognition was based on clinical ground: symptoms or signs suggestive of ulnar nerve impairment at elbow, as numbness/ paresthesia in the part of ulnar innervated hand with or without sensory loss, elbow pain and weakness of ulnar hand muscles with or without hypotrophy. Electrophysiological examination was performed by a proper protocol according to AAEM/AAN recommendations (1999). Two validated (DASH and BCTQ) and one newly proposed self-administered questionnaires were used for patient-oriented evaluation. Clinical severity was assessed with a 3-stage scale (Antoniadis, 1997) and a 4-stage scale (Giannini, 2001). Electrophysiological severity was quantified using a 5-step neurophysiological classification (Padua, 2001) and a 13-point neurophysiological score (Mondelli, 2000). Two hundred-seven patients (218 limbs affected) were collected until October 2002. The females/males ratio was 1:1.9 and females were younger than males (mean age 44.5 and 52.5?yrs. respectively). Repetitive stress injury was reported as possible pathogenetic factor in 50.5% of cases and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - comorbidity was diagnosed in 22.5% of limbs without gender difference. Reduction of ulnar nerve motor conduction across the elbow was found in 86.2% of limbs. EMG neurogenic pattern in ulnar supplied hand muscles and digit-wrist ulnar SAP abnormalities were respectively observed in 61.5% and 49.1% of cases. Pain (61%), associated with positive provocative test (p?<?0.01), was equally distributed in each clinical classes and was related with higher BCTQ score (p?<?0.001). DASH questionnaire showed the highest relation to clinical scale and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). High relations were found among clinical scales, neurophysiological classification and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). These preliminary results show a very good reliability of most measurements used for multiperspective assessment of UNE syndrome.

AB  - Supported lipid bilayers (SLB) offer unique possibilities for studying cellular membranes and have been used as a synthetic architecture to interact with cells. Here, the state-of-the-art in SLB-based technology is presented. The fabrication, analysis, characteristics and modification of SLBs are described in great detail. Numerous strategies to form SLBs on different substrates, and the means to patteren them, are described. The use of SLBs as model membranes for the study of membrane organization and membrane processes in vitro is highlighted. In addition, the use of SLBs as a substratum for cell analysis is presented, with discrimination between cell?cell and cell?extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicry. The study is concluded with a discussion of the potential for in vivo applications of SLBs.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Debulking is still a technique of choice for in-stent restenosis (ISR). Excimer laser debulking has enabled high procedural success with very low complication rates, but has demonstrated markedly heterogeneous results owing to differences in lazing and laser technology, and selected patient populations. Since new area-ablation technique enables ablation of larger areas than its own device size, we have evaluated their effectiveness and safety in an uncontrolled study. Study Design/Materials and Methods Fifty-three patients with diffuse ISR were treated by laser area ablation, followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty. Primary endpoint was percent of binary stenosis at 6-month follow-up; secondary endpoints were procedural success; target lesion revascularization (TLR); major adverse cardiac events (MACE); diameter stenosis (DS); and minimal lumen diameter (MLD) before and after laser debulking, and at 6-month follow-up. Results Laser debulking was feasible (as defined as ≤30% residual stenosis) in 98.1% of patients. At 6-month follow-up, binary stenosis was 26.4%; angiographic TLR, 20.7%; and MACE, 3.7%. DS decreased from 87±17% to 20?±?9% after laser debulking, and to 9±7% after PTCA; it was 29±14% at follow-up (P-values in comparison to baseline: 0.0047; 0.0036; 0.0064). MLD increased from 0.6±0.3 to 2.4±0.5 mm after laser debulking, to 2.8± 0.6 mm after adjunctive PTCA, and to 1.9?±?0.4 mm at follow-up (P-values in comparison to baseline: 0.0059; 0.0031; 0.0088). Conclusions Owing to a significantly greater MLD, area ablation facilitates significantly enhanced immediate and follow-up results for diffuse ISR, including a simpler and more effective laser-debulking procedure than former lasing techniques.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background: Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) management is now well informed by guidelines extrapolated from clinical trials. However, most of these data have been acquired outside the local context. We sought to describe the current patterns of ACS care in Australia. Methods: The Acute Coronary Syndrome Prospective Audit study is a prospective multi-centre registry of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), high-risk non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS-HR) and intermediate-risk non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS-IR) patients, involving 39 metropolitan, regional and rural sites. Data included hospital characteristics, geographic and demographic factors, risk stratification, in-hospital management including invasive services, and clinical outcomes. Results: A cohort of 3402 patients was enrolled; the median age was 65.5?years. Female and non-metropolitan patients comprised 35.5% and 23.9% of the population, respectively. At enrolment, 756 (22.2%) were STEMI patients, 1948 (57.3%) were high-risk NSTEACS patients and 698 (20.5%) were intermediate-risk NSTEACS patients. Evidence-based therapies and invasive management use were highest among suspected STEMI patients compared with other strata (angiography: STEMI 89%, NSTEACS-HR 54%, NSTEACS-IR 34%, P?<?0.001) (percutaneous coronary intervention: STEMI 68.1%, NSTEACS-HR 22.2%, NSTEACS-IR 8.1%, P?<?0.001). In hospital mortality was low (STEMI 4.0%, NSTEACS-HR 1.8%, NSTEACS-IR 0.1%, P?<?0.001), as was recurrent MI (STEMI 2.4%, NSTEACS-HR: 2.8%, NSTEACS-IR 1.2%, P?=?0.052). Conclusion: There appears to be an ?evidence-practice gap? in the management of ACS, but this is not matched by an increased risk of in-hospital clinical events. Objective evaluation of local clinical care is a key initial step in developing quality improvement initiatives and this study provides a basis for the improvement in ACS management in Australia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To develop a scoring system model that predicts mortality within 30?days of admission of patients older than 80?years admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING A total of 306 ICUs from 24 European countries. PARTICIPANTS Older adults admitted to European ICUs (N?=?3730; median age?=?84?years [interquartile range?=?81-87 y]; 51.8% male). MEASUREMENTS Overall, 24 variables available during ICU admission were included as potential predictive variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Model sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS The 30-day-mortality was 1562 (41.9%). In multivariable analysis, these variables were selected as independent predictors of mortality: age, sex, ICU admission diagnosis, Clinical Frailty Scale, Sequential Organ Failure Score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. The discrimination, accuracy, and calibration of the model were good: the area under the curve for a score of 10 or higher was .80, and the Brier score was .18. At a cut point of 10 or higher (75% of all patients), the model predicts 30-day mortality in 91.1% of all patients who die. CONCLUSION A predictive model of cumulative events predicts 30-day mortality in patients older than 80?years admitted to ICUs. Future studies should include other potential predictor variables including functional status, presence of advance care plans, and assessment of each patient's decision-making capacity.
