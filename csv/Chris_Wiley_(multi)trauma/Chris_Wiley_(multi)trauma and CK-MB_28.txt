AB  - Introduction This study aimed to investigate the possibility of obtaining the beginning and end of stance from a girth-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), by comparing data from the IMU with data from an opto-electronic system. Methods 15 horses were trotted on a treadmill, with markers on hooves and a Girth Marker (GM) on a wireless IMU over the sternum. Proreflex cameras collected 3D marker data. T-tests and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to decipher any difference between diagonally paired limbs; GM and hoof markers; and GM and IMU, the limits of agreement of which were also assessed using a Bland Altman method. Results Timings of diagonally-coupled limbs were not significantly different at beginning (P?=?0.77 and 0.95), or end of stance (P?= 0.60 and 0.46) for right or left diagonal respectively. The diagonal in stance was identifiable from GM y position, with which IMU derived position had 97%, and IMU roll 100% agreement. Stance according to hoof markers did not differ significantly from GM z acceleration at beginning (P?= 0.49?±?0.01, P?= 0.92?±?0.007), or GM z velocity at end (P?= 0.84?±?0.007, P?= 0.83?±?0.007), in right or left diagonal respectively. A strong correlation was seen between beginning and end of stance according to GM and IMU events (each R2>0.99). Relationships between IMU and GM amplitudes were less convincing, with a significant difference at peak acceleration (P<0.05, Standard Deviation?=?2.70?m/s/s, ULOA?=?5.93, LLOA?=??4.66). Conclusions A girth-based IMU can identify temporal stride characteristics in trot on a treadmill, but inferences from amplitude data should be treated with caution until further investigated.

AB  - Introduction Tail deviation in horses is anecdotally viewed as an indicator of lameness. Compensatory mechanisms in lame horses are well documented, however there is no information published on the relationship between lameness and tail carriage in horses. The objectives of this study were to quantify differences in tail carriage in relation to the type of lameness (front/hind, left/right) and to establish a relationship with confounding variables. Methods Videos of 150 horses presented for lameness examination were evaluated. Tail carriage angles were measured in 50 horses and subjectively assessed using a categorical 4-point scale in 100 horses. Lame leg(s), lameness score(s), age, sex, breed, duration and cause of lameness were recorded. Differences in tail carriage between lameness types were assessed using paired T-tests (continuous data) or chi-square tests (categorical data). Logistic regression evaluated the effect of degree and duration of lameness, and age on degree of tail deviation. Results 87.2% of the horses showed some degree of tail deviation. The mean?±?SD tail angle was 92?±?14.5° (90°?=?midsagittal) for forelimb and 87?±?11.2° for hindlimb lameness. The mean?±?SD tail angle was 91.1?±?17.3° for right-sided and 89.5?±?16.9° for left forelimb lameness; 89.8°?±?8.8 for right and 86.5°±?9.8 for left hindlimb lameness with no statistically significant difference between front/hind (P?=?0.52) or left/right lameness (P?=?0.237). No statistically significant correlation was found between degree and duration of lameness, age of horse and presence or degree of tail deviation. Conclusions No significant relationship between tail carriage and lameness was identified in this study and tail carriage should therefore not be considered an indicator for lameness.

AB  - Introduction Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism during muscle contraction and in the balance of anaerobic and aerobic energy production. This study evaluated mitochondrial respirometry in skeletal muscle of eventing horses before and after an intense effort. Methods Fourteen Brazilian Sport Horses 4 to 6 years old performed an incremental velocity test on a high speed treadmill inclined to 3% and galloped at speeds up to 8?m/s until exhaustion. Biopsies from the gluteus medius muscle were obtained before and immediately after the end of the test. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by O2K oxygraph of high resolution (Oroboros). The results were standardized by minute and per gram of wet weight of muscle and expressed as mean?±?SD. Plasma lactate was measured using a spectrophotometer. Results were compared by paired t?test (P<0.05). Results The maximal respiration value of mitochondria did not change in gluteus medius muscle of horses at exhaustion. However, there was an increase in stage 3 mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate/malate substrate, and also an increase of non-mitochondrial respiration after exercise. Lactate values before and after exercise were 0.4?±?0.1?mmol/L and 12.1?±?4.6?mmol/L, respectively. Conclusions There is little change in mitochondrial respirometry in the gluteus medius muscle after intense exercise indicating predominantly anaerobic metabolism in the muscle of the eventing horses, as supported by the high plasma lactate concentrations after the test. The increase of oxidase reactions after intense exercise is related to an increase in non-mitochondrial respiration.

AB  - Introduction Obesity creates many metabolic issues in horses, yet stepwise alterations in mitochondrial capacity and oxidant status during weight loss have not been assessed. Skeletal muscle contains subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM) mitochondria, which respond differently to physiological stimuli, impacting tissue and systemic oxidant status. It was hypothesised that horses would display improved muscle mitochondrial subpopulation function in middle gluteal muscle, and decreases in circulating oxidant status markers during weight loss from an obese (7 to 8) to moderate (5) body condition score (BCS). Methods 8 light-type horses were studied. Mitochondrial subpopulations were isolated through differential centrifugation and all enzymatic activity through colorimetric kinematic assays. Effects of BCS reduction or percent weight loss were evaluated using SAS (mixed procedure with repeated measures). Results Plasma nitrate decreased in response to BCS reduction (P?=?0.06) and percent weight loss (P?=?0.06), whereas erythrocyte total glutathione (P?=?0.06) concentration increased with decreasing BCS. Mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and IV displayed greater activity in SSM than IFM (P≤0.03), while all complexes in IFM had decreased activity due to both weight parameters (P≤0.01). Interactions between subpopulation complex IV activity and weight loss markers (P<0.05) were displayed. Citrate synthase activity, indicating mitochondrial number, was greater in SSM than IFM (P<0.0001) but was unaffected with weight loss. Lipid peroxidation was decreased with BCS change (P?=?0.01) and weight loss (P?=?0.02), displaying greater amounts in SSM than IFM (P≤0.02). Conclusions Alterations in complex activities and lipid peroxidation suggest IFM are more affected by weight loss, with large contributions from complex IV by-products. Mitochondrial component flexibility may contribute individually to disease development and performance of equine athletes.

AB  - Introduction Rider movement may influence horse-rider interaction, yet little is known about what physical attributes affect postural stability. This study aimed to compare pelvic control and postural stability of riders on the floor and whilst riding. Methods 33 riders were assessed by a physiotherapist and subjectively graded according to ability to tilt the pelvis in isolation: 1?=?poor, 2?=?better plus compensations, which were either A?=?lumbar spine inclusion B?=?full body lean, 3?=?good. Riders wore markers on (1) greater trochanter of the femur, (2) iliac crest, (3) greater tubercle of the humerus. A marker was placed over the horse's tuber sacrale (4). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) recorded four strides of collected sitting trot in a straight line from the left side. Distance between markers was measured at midstance, maximum hindlimb protraction and retraction. Synchronisation was determined by the difference in time (secs) between the tuber sacrale of the horse and pelvis of the rider at these stride points. One-way ANOVA was used to compare synchronisation between groups. Student's independent t-test was used to compare marker distance. Results For pelvic tilt, no grade 3 riders were seen. Grade 2 riders were more synchronised with the horse during left hind diagonal suspension phase (P?=?0.011) and had smaller horizontal distances between markers 1?2, 2?3 and 1?3 respectively at all points of the stride (midstance: P<0.042; hindlimb protraction: P<0.049; hindlimb retraction: P<0.013). Comparing compensation types, grade A riders were better synchronised with the horse at midstance phase (P?=?0.014). Conclusions Results suggest that control of pelvic movement may have an impact on horse-rider synchronisation.

AB  - Introduction The muscle fibre type (MFT) of the deep epaxial musculature has not been determined in horses. The objective was to determine the MFT distribution in selected muscles of thoracolumbar and hindlimb region of horses. This included deep epaxial and hypaxial muscles that were hypothesised to have a postural stabilising role. A second objective was to examine differences in MFT distribution between Arabians and Quarter horses. Methods Muscle biopsy samples (114) were obtained from 5 Quarter horses, 4 Arabians, and 2 Thoroughbreds. The myosin heavy chain distribution was determined by gel electrophoresis. Mann-Whitney rank test was used to compare the proportional MFT content and differences between breeds. Results Mm. sacrocaudalis dorsalis medialis and diaphragm had the highest proportion of MFT-I, 84.1% (±18.4) and 72.4% (±12.5), respectively. The remaining deep epaxial muscles and the hypaxial m. psoas minor had approximately equal MFT-I and II proportions. Mm. psoas major, iliocostalis, longissimus dorsi and the hind limb muscles contained mostly MFT-IIX: from 50.5% (±12.8) to 67.9% (±7.3). Quarter horses had significantly more MFT-IIX in m. psoas major 60.8% (±9.1) than Arabians 41.9% (±3.2). Arabians had significantly more MFT-I fibres in m. longissimus dorsi 16.9% (±4.6) than Quarter horses 9.9% (±1.4) (P<0.05). Conclusions The MFT distribution of the deep epaxial muscles, mm. psoas minor and diaphragm, suggest a postural stabilizing role in contrast to the fibre type proportions of the hindlimb muscles. The findings can direct diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscular or neuromotor dysfunction in the thoracolumbar and hind limb area.

AB  - Introduction The most frequently reported causes of gastric ulcers in horses are fasting, type of feed and management, and the administration of some drugs. More recently, physical exercise has also been pointed out as an important factor in the development of gastric lesions in athletic horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether treadmill exercise predisposes to the occurrence of gastric ulcers in horses. Methods Five Arabian horses were exercised on a high-speed treadmill during twelve weeks. The animals were submitted to gastroscopy before the beginning and the end of the training period. The lesions were classified according to the method proposed by Macallister [1] that assigns scores for number and severity of injuries, with modifications to give a total score for the stomach, considering not only the presence and severity of ulcers, but also other findings as gastritis, hyperkeratosis, desquamation of the mucosa. The results obtained in the two periods were compared using the Wilcoxon test, with significance at P<0.05. Results In the first gastroscopy two animals had very low scores for lesion number and severity and three horses had no injury. In contrast, in the second evaluation, all animals had higher scores. A significant difference was observed between the two periods (before and after training) considering both methods of gastric lesion classification. Conclusions We concluded that Arabian horses exercised on a treadmill may develop gastric lesions. The possible influence of these lesions on athletic performance and other parameters should be considered by researchers who study equine exercise physiology.

AB  - Abstract Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health problem, with approximately 2 million incidents occurring annually in the United States, no therapeutic agents to treat TBI have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration despite several clinical trials. It is estimated that 3.5 million Americans now have a lifelong condition that might be termed ?chronic traumatic brain injury disease.? Some health care providers categorize TBI as an ?event? for which patients require brief periods of rehabilitation with no further treatment. On the contrary, TBI should be seen as a chronic disease process that fits the World Health Organization definition as being a non-reversible pathologic condition requiring special rehabilitation training. Among the major obstacles that contribute to this type of misconception is the absence of brain injury?specific diagnostic biomarker(s) that can indicate and monitor the long-term health status of patients with TBI after use of conventional therapeutics and a rehabilitation process. It is of interest that recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology have enabled us to use these high throughput?based approaches in developing biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the area of TBI. One aim of this article is to provide an overview that evaluates the current status of TBI biomarker discovery using neuroproteomics/systems biology techniques, along with their clinical utilization. In addition, we discuss the need for strengthening the role of biomarker-based neuroproteomics/systems biology and its potential utility in the field of rehabilitation, which would lead to the establishment of rehabilomics studies, where biomarkers would indicate and predict the long-term efficacy and health status of patients with chronic TBI conditions.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian sport horse (BH) was specifically developed for jumping competition. Monocarboxylate transporters are key regulators of cell pH and therefore facilitate co-transport of protons and lactate. Lactate transport in red blood cells (RBCs) is bimodal (high [HT] and low transport [LT]) and is related to CD147 levels. This study aimed to quantify MCT1 and CD147 protein levels in BH after an incremental jumping test (IJT). Methods Sixteen horses were distributed into two groups: low-level jumpers (LL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.00?m, and high-level jumpers (HL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.20?m. The IJT consisted of three steps, each with forty jumps at increasing heights (0.40, 0.60, and 0.80?m). Blood samples were collected before and after the IJT. The YSI 2300 method was used to determine plasma lactate concentration [Lac]p. RBC membranes were purified, and MCT1 and CD147 levels were measured by Western blotting. A Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation (P<0.05) were employed. Results The HL group displayed lower [Lac]p, indicating prevalence of the aerobic pathway in this group. The results showed no difference in the expression of the transporters between times or groups and a positive correlation (r?=?0.67, P<0.0001) between MCT1 and CD147. In both groups [Lac]p didn't correlate with the amount of MCT1 or CD147. Most of the horses appeared to have high lactate transport activity. The CD147/MCT1 ratios for LL and HL were equal. Conclusions BH showed no difference in MCT1 and CD147 expression between conditioning levels.

AB  - Introduction Evaluation of the movement during trot in circles is commonly used in clinical equine lameness examinations to exacerbate mild or bilateral lameness. Sound horses trotting in a straight line have a high degree of movement symmetry, which decreases with lameness. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lungeing and circle size on movement symmetry in sound horses. Methods Twenty five riding horses categorized sound by inspection on straight line and lungeing were trotted in a straight line and in circles of 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 metres diameter on both reins. Overall symmetry (S), symmetry of diagonal limb pair loading (A), and symmetry of diagonal limb pair timing (W) were calculated from trunk accelerations measured over the 13th thoracic vertebrae (T13) with a 3-axis accelerometer. Data were analysed via ANOVA with horse as random effect. Results S, A, and W showed high degree of symmetry of straight line trot with mean?±?SE?= ?6.0?±?0.1, 0.01?±?0.02 and ?0.001?±?0.003, respectively, that decreased with circular trot (P<0.02 in pairwise tests). S and A showed decreasing symmetry with decreasing circle size. For 16 and 8 metres, respectively; S?= ?5.2?±?0.1 and ?4.7?±?0.1; A?= 0.10?±?0.01 and 0.16?±?0.01; W?= ?0.009?±?0.002 and ?0.012?±?0.002. Conclusions In sound horses, movement symmetry measured over T13 decreased with circular trot and decreasing circle size as shown in earlier studies of movement of the poll and sacrum. The asymmetry mimicked inside diagonal lameness. Effect of circular movement and circle size should be considered in interpretation of lameness signs and asymmetry measured during circular trot. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the department ethical committee. The horses belonged to the Danish army, who gave their informed consent. As no invasive procedures were applied approval from the Danish Animal Experimental board was not needed. Sources of funding:?Foreningen KUSTOS af 1861. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - The emerging field of soft robotics makes use of many classes of materials including metals, low glass transition temperature (Tg) plastics, and high Tg elastomers. Dependent on the specific design, all of these materials may result in extrinsically soft robots. Organic elastomers, however, have elastic moduli ranging from tens of megapascals down to kilopascals; robots composed of such materials are intrinsically soft ? they are always compliant independent of their shape. This class of soft machines has been used to reduce control complexity and manufacturing cost of robots, while enabling sophisticated and novel functionalities often in direct contact with humans. This review focuses on a particular type of intrinsically soft, elastomeric robot ? those powered via fluidic pressurization.

AB  - Social anxiety is a neurobehavioral trait characterized by fear and reticence in social situations. Twin studies have shown that social anxiety has a heritable basis, shared with neuroticism and extraversion, but genetic studies have yet to demonstrate robust risk variants. We conducted genomewide association analysis (GWAS) of subjects within the Army Study To Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) to (i) determine SNP-based heritability of social anxiety; (ii) discern genetic risk loci for social anxiety; and (iii) determine shared genetic risk with neuroticism and extraversion. GWAS were conducted within ancestral groups (EUR, AFR, LAT) using linear regression models for each of the three component studies in Army STARRS, and then meta-analyzed across studies. SNP-based heritability for social anxiety was significant (h2g?=?0.12, P?=?2.17???10?4 in EUR). One meta-analytically genomewide significant locus was seen in each of EUR (rs708012, Chr 6: BP 36965970, P?=?1.55???10?8; beta?=?0.073) and AFR (rs78924501, Chr 1: BP 88406905, P?=?3.58???10?8; beta?=?0.265) samples. Social anxiety in Army STARRS was significantly genetically correlated (negatively) with extraversion (rg?=??0.52, se?=?0.22, P?=?0.02) but not with neuroticism (rg?=?0.05, se?=?0.22, P?=?0.81) or with an anxiety disorder factor score (rg?=?0.02, se?=?0.32, P?=?0.94) from external GWAS meta-analyses. This first GWAS of social anxiety confirms a genetic basis for social anxiety, shared with extraversion but possibly less so with neuroticism. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction There has been limited evaluation of biomechanical parameters during flight and their relationship to subjective assessments of jumping technique in ridden show-jumping horses. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up and after jumping a 15-fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day one and twice on day two; the second round on day 3 was an 8-fence jump-off. Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to determine limb and back angles at 25%, 50% and 75% of the flight phase over four fences using markers placed at pre-determined locations. Technique grades (1?10) were assigned per fence by an international coach. Technique grades and kinematics were correlated using a Spearman's rank correlation test. Results Forelimb and hindlimb take-off distance and technique grade (4?7/10) were positively correlated (r?=?0.29, 0.27, P≤0.01). Thoracolumbar angle (range 178?184°) at 25% and 75% of flight and neck/trunk angle (NT) at 50% and 75% of flight were negatively correlated with technique grade (r?=?-0.20 {P?=?0.04}, -0.20 {P?=?0.03}, -0.21 {P?=?0.03}, and ?0.28 {P<0.01} respectively). Conclusions Only weak correlations were evident, however, the findings suggest that increased take-off distance may be desirable for improvements in subjectively evaluated technique. The relationship between TL extension and improved technique grades may be explained by improved back stabilisation. Decreased NT and TL extension at 75% flight could suggest that back stabilisation and raising the neck in preparation for landing are associated with better jumping technique. Subjective grading of jumping technique appears to be influenced by kinematic features during flight.

AB  - Introduction Exertional myopathies are a common cause of exercise intolerance in the equine athlete, and Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy (PSSM) is a widely described muscular disease. It is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal glycogen in myofibers due to a genetic defect in the skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1) enzyme. We hypothesized that energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in muscular mitochondria might be impaired in type-1 PSSM-affected horses. Methods Eight horses with a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis were tested for the GYS1 mutation. Muscle biopsies were collected and used for histological analysis and high resolution respirometry (HRR). HRR values from 3 groups of horses (5 PSSM-positive horses, 3 horses with a history of myopathy but PSSM-negative and 16 healthy controls) were compared using a linear mixed model to take into account repeated (2?3 times) measurements made for each horse. Results In 5/8 horses histology revealed an accumulation of abnormal glycogen in myofibers. These 5 horses also tested positive for the GYS1 mutation. A severe depression of maximal OXPHOS capacity was observed by HRR in 7/8 horses with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with lower values in PSSM-positive cases (4/5). Conclusions Our study shows a severely decreased OXPHOS capacity in PSSM-affected horses. PSSM is considered primarily a defect in glycogen synthesis but altered OXPHOS might play a central role in its pathogenesis.

AB  - Introduction Differentiating left ventricular (LV) dilatation caused by aortic regurgitation (AR) from athletic eccentric LV hypertrophy can be challenging. In human medicine, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and 2D speckle tracking (2DST) are used to distinguish ?athlete's heart? from pathological conditions. Methods 40 healthy horses (group 1) were compared to 13 horses with moderate AR (group 2) and 11 horses with severe AR (group 3), all with an end diastolic LV internal diameter (LVIDd) within maximal reference limits (≤14.2?cm). Fractional shortening (FS) was measured from a short-axis M-mode at chordal level. Peak TDI velocities during systole (S), early (E) and late (A) diastole were measured in the LV free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IVS). Global longitudinal strain was measured by 2DST. Groups were compared by a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Results The study included Warmbloods (n?=?52), trotters (n?=?9) and Thoroughbreds (n?=?3), used for jumping, dressage, racing and eventing. Group 2 (15?±?5 years; P<0.001) and 3 (20?±?4 years; P<0.001) were older than group 1 (8?±?4 years). LVIDd in group 3 (13.1?±?0.7 cm) was higher compared to group 1 (11.5?±?0.8?cm; P<0.001) and 2 (12.0?±?0.8?cm; P?=?0.003) but FS was not different. Peak S in IVS was higher in group 2 (6.6?±?1.5?cm/s; P?=?0.001) and 3 (9.0?±?1.7?cm/s; P<0.001) compared to group 1 (4.4?±?1.8?cm/s), indicating hyperkinetic septal motion. Peak E in LVFW was lower in group 2 (18.6?±?5.2?cm/s;P?=?0.001) and 3 (19.3?±?3.9?cm/s; P?=?0.006) compared to group 1 (24.4?±?4.6?cm/s), indicating decreased early filling velocity. Longitudinal strain was not different between groups. Conclusions TDI shows potential for differentiating AR-induced LV remodeling from athletic eccentric hypertrophy in horses.
