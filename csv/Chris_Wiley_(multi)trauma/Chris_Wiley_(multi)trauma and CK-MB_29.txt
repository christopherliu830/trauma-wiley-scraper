AB  - Objective?To investigate the acute effects of functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) on detrusor hyper-reflexia using a multi-pulse magnetic stimulator. Patients and methods?Seven male patients with established and intractable detrusor hyper-reflexia following spinal cord injury were studied. No patient was on medication and none had had previous surgery for detrusor hyper-reflexia. After optimization of magnetic stimulation of S2?S4 sacral anterior roots by recording toe flexor electromyograms, unstable detrusor activity was provoked during cystometry by rapid infusion of fluid into the bladder. The provocation test produced consistent and predictable detrusor hyper-reflexia. On some provocations, supramaximal FMS at 20 pulses/s for 5?s was applied at detrusor pressures which were >15?cmH20. Results?Following FMS there was an obvious acute suppression of detrusor hyper-reflexia. There was a profound reduction in detrusor contraction, as assessed by the area under the curves of detrusor pressure with time. Conclusions?Functional magnetic stimulation applied over the sacrum can profoundly suppress detrusor hyper-reflexia in man. It may provide a non-invasive method of assessing patients for implantable electrical neuromodulation devices and as a therapeutic option in its own right.

AB  - Abstract The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has been instrumental in supporting the development and implementation of systems of care to provide services to children and youth with serious mental health conditions and their families. Since 1993, 173 grants have been awarded to communities in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the District of Columbia, and 21 American Indian/Alaska Native communities. The system of care principles of creating comprehensive, individualized services, family-driven and youth-guided care and cultural and linguistic competence, supported by a well-trained and competent workforce, have been successful in transforming the field of children's mental health and facilitating the integration of child-serving systems. This approach has achieved positive outcomes at the child and family, practice and system levels, and numerous articles have been published using data collected from system of care communities, demonstrating the effectiveness of this framework. This article will describe lessons learned from implementing the system of care approach, and will discuss the importance of expanding and sustaining systems of care across the country.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a leading nosocomial pathogen, infecting a wide range of anatomic sites including the respiratory tract and the bloodstream. In addition to being multi-drug resistant, little is known about the molecular basis of A. baumannii pathogenesis. To better understand A. baumannii virulence, a combination of a transposon-sequencing (TraDIS) screen and the neutropenic mouse model of bacteremia was used to identify the full set of fitness genes required during bloodstream infection. The lytic transglycosylase MltB was identified as a critical fitness factor. MltB cleaves the MurNAc-GlcNAc bond of peptidoglycan, which leads to cell wall remodeling. Here we show that MltB is part of a complex network connecting resistance to stresses, membrane homeostasis, biogenesis of pili and in vivo fitness. Indeed, inactivation of mltB not only impaired resistance to serum complement, cationic antimicrobial peptides and oxygen species, but also altered the cell envelope integrity, activated the envelope stress response, drastically reduced the number of pili at the cell surface and finally, significantly decreased colonization of both the bloodstream and the respiratory tract.

AB  - Abstract Co-creating knowledge takes a new approach to human phenotypic morality as a biologically based, human lineage specific (HLS) trait. Authors from very different backgrounds (anthropology and biology, on the one hand, and astronomy, philosophy, and theology, on the other) first review research on the nature and origins of morality using the social brain network, and studies of individuals who cannot ?know good? or think morally because of brain dysfunction. They find these models helpful but insufficient, and turn to paleoanthropology, cognitive science, and neuroscience to understand human moral capacity and its origins long ago, in the genus Homo. An unusual narrative capturing ?morality in action? takes the reader back 900,000 years, and then the authors analyze the essential features of moral thinking and behavior as expressed by early and later species on our lineage. In what has primarily been the province of philosophers to date, the authors? morality model is presented for further scientific testing.

AB  - Sparganosis is a helminthic infection caused by the migrating larvae of the cestode genus Spirometra. Human infection is most commonly encountered in regions of the Far East where it has been associated with dietary consumption and medicinal usage of raw snake and frog tissue preparations or the drinking of contaminated water. Approximately 63 cases of sparganosis have been reported in the United States and reports of cutaneous sparganosis are very rare within the world literature. A case of cutaneous sparganosis involving the lateral abdominal region of a 54-year-old Filipino American women is discussed. Clinically the lesion presented as a cutaneous nodule. Skin punch biopsy revealed a sparganum possessing an undulating body wall with outermost microvillus layer overlying a thick tegument. Two thin smooth muscle layers and deeper subtegumental cells resided subjacent to the tegument. Calcareous corpuscles and intermixed mesenchymal tissues occupied the central regions of the larval worm. The inflammation consisted of a dense perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and surrounding dermal fibrosis. Cutaneous sparganosis is rarely encountered in dermatology and dermatopathology practice, hence recognition of the clinical, histomorphological and patient history characteristics associated with this helminthic infection will facilitate in diagnosing this entity.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Overcrowding is a serious and ongoing challenge in Canadian hospital emergency departments (EDs) that has been shown to have negative consequences for patient outcomes. The American College of Emergency Physicians recommends observation/short-stay units as a possible solution to alleviate this problem. However, the most recent systematic review assessing short-stay units shows that there is limited synthesized evidence to support this recommendation; it is over a decade old and has important methodologic limitations. The aim of this study was to conduct a more methodologically rigorous systematic review to update the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of short-stay units, compared with usual care, on hospital and patient outcomes. Methods A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Embase, ABI/INFOM, and EconLit databases and gray literature sources. Randomized controlled trials of ED short-stay units (stay of 72 hours or less) were compared with usual care (i.e., not provided in a short-stay unit), for adult patients. Risk-of-bias assessments were conducted. Important decision-making (gradable) outcomes were patient outcomes, quality of care, utilization of and access to services, resource use, health system?related outcomes, economic outcomes, and adverse events. Results Ten reports of five studies were included, all of which compared short-stay units with inpatient care. Studies had small sample sizes and were collectively at a moderate risk of bias. Most outcomes were only reported by one study and the remaining outcomes were reported by two to four studies. No deaths were reported. Three of the four included studies reporting length of stay found a significant reduction among short-stay unit patients, and one of the two studies reporting readmission rates found a significantly lower rate for short-stay unit patients. All four economic evaluations indicated that short-stay units were a cost-saving intervention compared to inpatient care from both hospital and health care system perspectives. Results were mixed for outcomes related to quality of care and patient satisfaction. Conclusions Insufficient evidence exists to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of short-stay units, compared with inpatient care.

AB  - Background Despite calls for integration of neurobiological methods into research on youth resilience (high competence despite high adversity), we know little about structural brain correlates of resilient functioning. The aim of the current study was to test for brain regions uniquely associated with positive functioning in the context of adversity, using detailed phenotypic classification. Methods 1,870 European adolescents (Mage = 14.56 years, SDage = 0.44 years, 51.5% female) underwent MRI scanning and completed behavioral and psychological measures of stressful life events, academic competence, social competence, rule-abiding conduct, personality, and alcohol use. Results The interaction of competence and adversity identified two regions centered on the right middle and superior frontal gyri; grey matter volumes in these regions were larger in adolescents experiencing adversity who showed positive adaptation. Differences in these regions among competence/adversity subgroups were maintained after controlling for several covariates and were robust to alternative operationalization decisions for key constructs. Conclusions We demonstrate structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience, and suggest that right prefrontal structures are implicated in adaptive functioning for youth who have experienced adversity.

AB  - The teaching of anatomy which began unofficially in Melbourne 150 years ago was formally established with the passing of ?An Act for Regulating Schools of Anatomy? in 1862 by the Victorian government. Armed with this Act, the University of Melbourne founded its medical school later that same year. The development of anatomy teaching and the separation of anatomy from pathology one hundred years ago, is a colourful story in which several local personalities played their part. Commencing in an improvised outbuilding of his home, the first professor, George Halford began teaching anatomy in May 1863, the first such course in Australia. He was followed by Allen, Berry, Wood Jones and many others, each of whom was to make their own contribution. The influence of surgeons including George Adlington Syme was paramount from the beginning and frequently the teaching of students only survived through their efforts. It was Wood Jones, who first drew attention to the negative aspects of the preservative formaldehyde and the artificial descriptions of anatomy which resulted. He warned in 1923, that ?students will one day have to readjust their ideas, since they deal with the living but it is only now that living anatomy has fully taken its place in anatomy learning, through the use of telescopic views and the newer imaging techniques of the living body. From simple beginnings, this department has evolved into a world leader in innovation and its award wining multi-media package An@tomedia has brought the teaching and learning of anatomy into a new dawn.

AB  - Abstract Aim Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent commonly used for the prevention and treatment of bleeding disorders. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods From 2005 to 2014, we encountered four CKD patients who experienced severe complications related to TXA. Clinical manifestations and outcome of these patients were recorded. We then performed a qualitative literature review of published cases of TXA toxicity in CKD patients in the PubMed database from 1 January 1972 to 31 December 2015. Results In our centre, two peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients developed neurotoxicity after intravenous TXA use for surgical bleeding and one PD patient developed neurotoxicity after oral TXA use for post-polypectomy colonic bleeding. One kidney transplant recipient developed acute obstructive uropathy due to retention of blood clot at the pelvi-ureteric junction of graft kidney after taking oral TXA for menorrhagia. Dosage of TXA was not adjusted according to renal function in all cases. All of them recovered without permanent disability after TXA was stopped. From our literature search, we identified two cases of neurotoxicity (one PD, one stage 4 CKD patient), one case of retinal toxicity in a haemolysis (HD) patient, one case of ligneous conjunctivitis in a CKD patient, and one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a CKD patient. Conclusion Neurotoxicity is a very common clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in CKD patients. Thrombotic complication is rare. Dosage adjustment of TXA is essential in CKD patients.
