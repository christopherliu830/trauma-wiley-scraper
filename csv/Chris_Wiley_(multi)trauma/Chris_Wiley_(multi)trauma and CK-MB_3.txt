AB  - Abstract Osteoporosis frequently coexists with other chronic diseases and syndromes of aging, and therefore multimorbidity interactions can potentially complicate its evaluation and treatment. This article reviews osteoporosis comorbidity interactions with select common diseases of aging including cardiovascular, neurologic, and geriatric syndromes, and select commonly used medications by older adults. Using depression as a case example, we describe the complex relationship between osteoporosis, mood, and antidepressant medications, and the implications of these interactions for patients and clinicians.

AB  - Background The literature is sparse on written test development in a post-graduate multi-disciplinary setting. Developing and evaluating knowledge tests for use in multi-disciplinary post-graduate training is challenging. The objective of this study was to describe the process of developing and evaluating a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test for use in a multi-disciplinary training program in obstetric-anesthesia emergencies. Methods A multi-disciplinary working committee with 12 members representing six professional healthcare groups and another 28 participants were involved. Recurrent revisions of the MCQ items were undertaken followed by a statistical analysis. The MCQ items were developed stepwise, including decisions on aims and content, followed by testing for face and content validity, construct validity, item?total correlation, and reliability. Results To obtain acceptable content validity, 40 out of originally 50 items were included in the final MCQ test. The MCQ test was able to distinguish between levels of competence, and good construct validity was indicated by a significant difference in the mean score between consultants and first-year trainees, as well as between first-year trainees and medical and midwifery students. Evaluation of the item?total correlation analysis in the 40 items set revealed that 11 items needed re-evaluation, four of which addressed content issues in local clinical guidelines. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 for reliability was found, which is acceptable. Conclusion Content and construct validity and reliability were acceptable. The presented template for the development of this MCQ test could be useful to others when developing knowledge tests and may enhance the overall quality of test development.

AB  - Although the physiological role of beta2-glycoprotein I (B2GPI) is unknown, in vitro evidence indicates that B2GPI may be a natural anticoagulant. In this study we have examined whether fluctuations of plasma B2GPI occur in in vivo coagulation. Serial measurements of B2GPI and other anticoagulant proteins were performed in 51 patients with thrombotic (group 1: six patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), group 2: venous (n=4) or arterial (n=17) thrombosis) and non-thrombotic disease (group 3: 24 patients undergoing elective surgery). Reductions in plasma B2GPI levels were seen in most patients which were roughly proportional to the severity of their illness. Particularly striking reductions of B2GPI, protein C (PC) and antithrombin III (AT-III) (mean ±?95% CI: 42.7?±?8.6%, 42.1?±?14.8%, 39.1?±?28.4% respectively) were seen in group 1. The reductions in plasma B2GPI were significantly greater in group 1 than in the other groups. Dilutional factors explain most of the reductions in B2GPI, PC and AT-III in groups 2 and 3, but contribute little to group 1. In conclusion, although B2GPI behaves as a ?negative acute phase reactant?, the magnitude of reduction of plasma B2GPI levels, accompanied by reductions in other anticoagulant proteins in patients with DIC, suggests specific consumption of B2GPI in in vivo coagulation. This study provides further evidence that B2GPI is an anticoagulant of physiological importance.

AB  - Purpose? To discuss the entire spectrum of injuries seen in lower limb trauma and choice of reconstructive options. Methodology? Retrospective review of 72 consecutive cases in one year. Data collected from individual case records and the department photo data base. Injuries were classified and analyzed based on bone and soft tissue involvement, associated vascular injuries, mechanism of injury as in crush, degloving, and combined. Bony injuries were classified according to Gustilo?s classification. Treatment options and outcome for bone and soft tissue are discussed separately. Results? Total of 72 cases. 95%of cases were two wheeler traffic accidents. Distribution of cases according to site involved: Leg-39; Foot-14; Leg and foot-16; Thigh, leg, and foot-3. 8 of them were of Gustilo?s IIIB and 7 of IIIC. 42 flaps done included Gastrocnemius-4, Soleus-7, reverse sural-7, Cross leg-2, Fasciocutaneous-5 Perforator based local flaps-3Latissimus dorsi-7, Gracilis-6 Lateral thigh-1 Intervention: Immediate: 12%. Early (less than 1 week): 36, Delayed (>1 week): 52% Complications:Wound infection:Minor: 12; Major: 8 (3 Cases ? Clostridia) Partial flap loss: 6; Loss of SSG over flap/donor site: 5; Acute renal failure: 1 Amputations: Above knee: 4; below knee: 2 Conclusions? This series represents the spectrum of high velocity injuries in an overcrowded urban locality of developing country. Significant tissue loss is most often the rule. A judicious execution of reconstructive options can optimize results. Management protocols were adopted to avoid delayed referrals. This audit served as a benchmark to put together a dedicated trauma team in our hospital.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3 years (range: 54?75 years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma n = 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) n = 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma n = 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5 years (range: 51?69 years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

AB  - Objective? To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported. Design? Retrospective/prospective study. Results? Nocardia spp infections were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable, from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1 entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured. Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion? Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of therapy leads to disease recurrence.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether CD34+ purified human muscle-derived cells (hMDCs) are capable of multiple lineage differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The hMDCs were isolated from human skeletal muscle and purified using a CD34+ cell selection system (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Adherent populations of cells were expanded in culture and cell differentiation was induced using different kinds of growth factors and different differentiation-conditional media. The immunohistochemical properties of CD34+ hMDCs were examined after varying periods in culture. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to investigate the gene expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated hMDCs. RESULTS Using special differentiation conditions the CD34+ hMDCs could be differentiated into myogenic cells, adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. The differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR and Western blotting showed multiple-lineage gene-level expression in the different cultivation periods of the differentiated cells. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed the multi-lineage capacity of a population of stem cells, termed CD34+ hMDCs. Our findings showed that CD34+ hMDCs are capable of multiple mesodermal-lineage differentiation, as shown by the expression of several lineage-specific genes. They can be differentiated toward the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. These cells might have potential for use in tissue regeneration.

AB  - Summary Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin (Eze/Simva) 10/40?mg compared with doubling the statin dose upon discharge in patients taking a statin and admitted to the hospital for the investigation of a coronary event. Design:? This phase IV, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel group study enrolled 424 patients (aged?≥?18?years) hospitalised for an acute coronary event and taking a stable dose of a statin (≥?6?weeks) that could be doubled per the product label. Upon discharge from the hospital, patients were stratified by their statin dose/potency (high, medium and low) and randomised 1?:?1 to doubling of the statin dose (n?=?211) or Eze/Simva 10/40?mg (n?=?213) for 12?weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the absolute low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) value (mmol/l) at study end-point. Results:? Mean baseline LDL-C for the two treatment groups were 2.48 and 2.31?mmol/l for the Eze/Simva and statin groups respectively. At study end-point, least squares mean LDL-C values were 1.74?mmol/l in the Eze/Simva group and 2.22?mmol/l in the statin group resulting in a significant between-group difference of ?0.49?mmol/l (p?≤?0.001). Eze/Simva 10/40?mg also produced significantly lower total cholesterol (?0.49?mmol/l), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [(non-HDL-C); ?0.53?mmol/l] and apolipoprotein B (?0.14?mmol/l) values compared with doubling the statin dose (p?≤?0.001 for all). Both treatments produced similar effects on triglycerides, C-reactive protein and HDL-C; the between treatment group differences were not significant (p?≥?0.160). Significantly more patients achieved LDL-C levels <?2.5 (<?100?mg/dl; 86% vs. 72%), <?2.0 (<?77?mg/dl; 70% vs. 42%) and <?1.8?mmol/l (<?70?mg/dl; 60% vs. 31%) with Eze/Simva than statin (all p?≤?0.001). Eze/Simva was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to statin. There were no differences in the incidences of liver transaminases ≥?3???upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatine kinase ≥?10???ULN between the groups. Conclusions:? In patients taking a statin and admitted to the hospital for investigation of a coronary event, treatment with Eze/Simva 10/40?mg for 12?weeks produced greater improvements in lipids with a similar safety profile compared with doubling of the statin dose.
