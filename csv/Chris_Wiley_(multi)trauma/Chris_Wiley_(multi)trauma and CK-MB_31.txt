AB  - Introduction Showjumping (SJ) horses are at increased risk of distal forelimb soft tissue injuries; generally attributed to limb loading on landing. This study investigated relationships between the back, trailing limb angles at take-off, in flight and at landing. Methods Eight showjumpers jumped a 140?cm vertical obstacle (part of a 15-fence course). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to measure limb and regional back kinematics in the dorsoventral plane from markers placed at predetermined locations. Pearson's correlation tests were used to determine associations between limb and back angles at take-off, in flight and upon landing. Results All markers were clearly visible throughout. Greater head-neck ventroflexion at take-off was associated with decreased hock flexion (r?=?-0.81, P?=?0.0141), and decreased neck-trunk angle on landing (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.03). Greater head-neck ventroflexion at landing, 50% and 75% flight was associated with decreased carpal extension on landing (r?=?0.81, 0.84, 0.73; P?=?0.02, 0.01, 0.04 respectively). Increased thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off was associated with decreased metatarsophalangeal joint extension upon landing (r?=?0.78, 0.75; P?=?0.03). Greater lumbosacral flexion at 50 and 75% flight (r?=?-0.73, ?0.77; P?=?0.04, 0.03 respectively) and greater thoracolumbar flexion at 25, 50 and 75% flight was associated with decreased elbow flexion on landing (r?=?-0.87, ?0.78, ?0.76; P?=?0.01, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). Conclusions Decreasing head-neck angle and increasing thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off and in flight appeared to alter peak joint flexion and extension on landing. This suggests that optimising jumping technique in training may be beneficial to reduce the strain placed on the limbs at landing, which could potentially be valuable given the risk of distal limb soft tissue injuries in SJ horses.

AB  - Introduction The evaluation of acid-base balance of horses is important because it detects alterations that affect their performance and health. There are studies relating these changes with endurance type effort, but few regarding sprint exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the fitness level of Quarter Horses performing barrel racing could be differentiated by quantitative acid-base analysis. Methods For this purpose, 10 horses were distributed into two groups: high (HF) and lower (LF) fitness as defined by the trainer. GPS and frequency meter were used for the measurements. Venous blood gas analysis was performed using a portable analyzer (I-stat) before and after exercise. Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and concentration of non-volatile buffers (Atot) were determined. Variables before and after exercise were compared within and between groups by t-test (P<0.05). Results The average track distance was 125?m. There were no differences between maximum or average velocity and heart rate, which were 30.76?±?0.53?km/h, 22.85?±?0.28?km/h, 206?bpm?±?3.91 versus 27.7?±?2.4?km/h, 21.94?±?0.3?km/h and 203?bpm?±?5.77 for the HF and LF groups, respectively. SID values before exercise were significantly lower for the LF group. Both groups showed a significant increase in Atot and AG, while pH, HCO3-, SIG and SID decreased significantly after exercise. Conclusions Metabolic acidosis was observed using both the traditional and the quantitative approach. It was not possible to differentiate the fitness level of horses in the study. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university (CEUA, Process: 008481/11).

AB  - Abstract Preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cysts benefits from integrating the clinical, radiological, and cytological features. As patient management algorithms evolve to increasingly nonsurgical options, accuracy in distinguishing mucinous from nonmucinous and benign from malignant mucinous cysts is important. This review focuses on pseudocysts, serous cystadenomas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and mucinous cystic neoplasms. Patients with pseudocysts almost always present with pancreatitis and are usually medically managed. Radiological studies reveal a unilocular cyst mostly in the pancreatic tail. Cyst fluid is thin, with high amylase but low carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. DNA mutations are absent. Serous cystadenomas are benign and do not require resection. Patients are usually asymptomatic and have microcystic or macrocystic masses anywhere in the pancreas. Cytology is frequently nondiagnostic. CEA and amylase levels are low. DNA analysis may reveal loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p if associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Neoplastic mucinous cysts are highly variable in their presentation. Most are resected. Mucinous cystic neoplasms typically arise in the body or tail of the pancreas of middle-aged women and demonstrate a septated cyst without dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. Branch duct IPMNs are more common in the pancreatic head of elderly men. Main duct dilatation correlates with main duct or combined type IPMN. Both types of mucinous cysts produce variable amounts of mucin. Cytologically nonmalignant but atypical epithelial cells, even when scant, are an indication of a high risk for malignancy. High CEA level supports a mucinous cyst, as do KRAS mutation and good quality DNA levels. KRAS mutation and multiple LOH support malignancy.

AB  - Abstract Torpor during hibernation defines the nadir of mammalian metabolism where whole animal rates of metabolism are decreased to as low as 2% of basal metabolic rate. This capacity to decrease profoundly the metabolic demand of organs and tissues has the potential to translate into novel therapies for the treatment of ischemia associated with stroke, cardiac arrest or trauma where delivery of oxygen and nutrients fails to meet demand. If metabolic demand could be arrested in a regulated way, cell and tissue injury could be attenuated. Metabolic suppression achieved during hibernation is regulated, in part, by the central nervous system through indirect and possibly direct means. In this study, we review recent evidence for mechanisms of central nervous system control of torpor in hibernating rodents including evidence of a permissive, hibernation protein complex, a role for A1 adenosine receptors, mu opiate receptors, glutamate and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Central sites for regulation of torpor include the hippocampus, hypothalamus and nuclei of the autonomic nervous system. In addition, we discuss evidence that hibernation phenotypes can be translated to non-hibernating species by H2S and 3-iodothyronamine with the caveat that the hypothermia, bradycardia, and metabolic suppression induced by these compounds may or may not be identical to mechanisms employed in true hibernation.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Abstract Labeling embryonic cells to trace their motion is a classical experimental approach with a host of techniques being used to mark live cells and tissues. Genetically engineered fluorescent protein vectors (DNA plasmids) are a recent technology well suited to time-resolved studies of cellular motion in live embryos. DNA plasmids encoding fluorescent proteins can be introduced into cells using several methods, including electroporation, a technique used widely for analysis of tissue culture and embryonic cells. Here we describe a technique designed to introduce DNA plasmids into early gastrulation stage quail embryos, ex ovo. The method is effective, and with practice enables an investigator to direct the vectors to relatively confined regions of gastrulating embryos. The required electroporation chamber can be fabricated from common laboratory materials. We anticipate that using this method of labeling cells in a warm-blooded embryo, during gastrulation, will be a fruitful means of studying subsequent embryogenesis.

AB  - Summary Melanocytic tumors of the oral cavity, melanoma and melanocytoma, are frequently diagnosed in the dog and are diagnosed far less often in other species. Melanomas invade soft tissues and bone and may be associated with extensive local tissue destruction. Although fibrous tissue-based lesions can share substantial histological overlap, these lesions can vary in their biological behavior and long-term prognosis. The canine biologically high-grade/histologically low-grade fibrosarcoma (H/L FSA) is an interesting and problematic mesenchymal lesion, first reported in 1994 by Ciekot et al. The chapter discusses the neoplastic entities fibroma and FSA. Some equine oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) lesions are so poorly differentiated, it is difficult to determine if they have an epithelial or mesenchymal histogenesis. As for dogs, investigations have rarely identified papillomavirus DNA sequences in feline OSCC lesions. Although lymphoma occurs in many different veterinary species, oral lymphoma most often occurs in dogs and cats and less often in horses, cattle, and goats.

AB  - Introduction Gastric ulcers are commonly found in equine athletes and there is evidence suggesting phenylbutazone may increase the incidence. In human athletes, gastric permeability has been shown to increase with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use with potential to negatively affect performance and recovery. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phenylbutazone on gastric mucosa and permeability. Methods 18 Arabian horses were examined via gastroscopy on day 0, 42, 49, 56, and 63, with ulceration in both the squamous and glandular regions scored from 0 to 4. For seven days commencing after the day 42 evaluation, horses received 4.4?mg/kg BW phenylbutazone twice daily PO. On day 49, sucrose (1?g/kg bwt) was administered via nasogastric tube, with blood and urine samples collected for 90?min and 4?h, respectively, to assess gastric permeability. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 with Proc MIXED. Results Ulcer scores increased from day 42 to day 49 (P<0.0001) with prevalence of grade 2 or greater ulceration being 33% on day 42 compared with 94% on day 49. Scores decreased from day 49 to 56 and, though continuing to decrease, had not returned to baseline scores by day 63. Squamous scores increased from day 0 to day 49 and remained elevated through day 63, while glandular scores were highest on day 49 but had decreased by day 56 (P<0.05). Sucrose concentration increased (P<0.0001) in both plasma and urine after phenylbutazone administration. Conclusions Besides exacerbating gastric ulcers, phenylbutazone contributes to gastric permeability and, particularly when combined with strenuous exercise, may impair recovery and increase illness susceptibility.

AB  - Combined expander/implants are designed to allow single stage breast reconstruction. This study was designed to assess whether single stage reconstruction is achieved using these devices. A retrospective study was performed of 88 consecutive patients undergoing breast reconstruction with implants at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital over a six year period. A small subset of patients had reconstruction with combined expander/implants. These cases were reviewed to determine the overall explantation rate. A total of nine patients (13 implants) had reconstruction with combined expander/implants (Mentor Becker or Mcghan 150). 10 out of 13 implants were removed at subsequent operations. 2 (15%) were explanted due to infection. 8(62%) were removed for aesthetic reasons including asymmetry, poor shape or poor projection. All were replaced with permanent textured gel implants. The results of this study suggest that in the majority of cases single stage reconstruction is not achieved using these devices. This is in contrast to the results from two recently published studies using these devices. (1,2)

AB  - Abstract Clinical criteria for the classification of symptomatic idiopathic (primary) osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands were developed from data collected in a multi-center study. Patients with OA were compared with a group of patients who had hand symptoms from other causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and the spondylar-thropathies. Variables from the medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiographs were analyzed. All patients had pain, aching, or stiffness in the hands. Patients were classified as having clinical OA if on examination there was hard tissue enlargement involving at least 2 of 10 selected joints, swelling of fewer than 3 metacarpophalangeal joints, and hard tissue enlargement of at least 2 distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. If the patient had fewer than 2 enlarged DIP joints, then deformity of at least 1 of the 10 selected joints was necessary in order to classify the symptoms as being due to OA. The 10 selected joints were the second and third DIP, the second and third proximal interphalangeal, and the trapeziometacarpal (base of the thumb) joints of both hands. Criteria derived using the ?classification tree? method were 92% sensitive and 98% specific. The ?traditional format? classification method required that at least 3 of these 4 criteria be present to classify a patient as having OA of the hand. The latter sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 87%. Radiography was of less value than clinical examination in the classification of symptomatic OA of the hands.

AB  - Abstract Limb/digit amputation is a common event in humans caused by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. Although the loss of a digit is not lethal, it affects quality of life and imposes high costs on amputees. In recent years, the increasing interest in limb regeneration has led to enhanced scientific knowledge. However, the limited ability to develop functional limb regeneration in the clinical setting suggests that a challenging issue remains in limb regeneration. Recently, the emergence of regenerative engineering is a promising field to address this challenge and close the gap between science and clinical applications. Cell signalling and molecular mechanisms involved in the limb regeneration process have been extensively studied; however, there is still insufficient data on cell therapy and tissue engineering for limb regeneration. In this review, we intend to focus on therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration that are closely related to gene, immune, and stem cell therapies, as well as tissue engineering approaches that take into consideration the peculiar developmental properties of the limbs. In addition, we attempt to identify the challenges of these strategies for limb regeneration studies in terms of clinical settings and as a road map to accomplish the goal of functional human limb regeneration.
