AB  - Introduction Training related cardiac adaptation is documented in Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds, including an increased incidence of AV valve regurgitation. In Warmbloods less is known about training effects on cardiac function or subclinical valve regurgitation. Methods Fifteen adult untrained Warmbloods (aged 3.8?±?0.7 years) were compared with fifteen adult Warmblood eventers (aged 11.4?±?0.9 years) competing at CIC2* (group 1, n?=?5) and CCI2*, CIC3*, CCI3* and CCI4*levels (group 2, n?=?9) and fifteen healthy adult Warmbloods competing at advanced dressage (group 3, n?=?5), Prix Saint Georges, Intermediate or Grand Prix (group 4, n?=?10) levels (mean age 10.3?±?0.7 years). The presence of heart murmurs, valve regurgitation and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated, and training intensity was scored. A correlation was found between bodyweight and not height. Differences in cardiac morphology were compared using General Linear Models with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (SPSS version 20), using group and bodyweight as covariates. Significance was set at P<0.05. Prevalence of audible heart murmurs and valvular regurgitation was higher in eventers (0?20% and 29?79%, respectively and dressage horses (7?40% and 7?60%, respectively) than controls (0?20% and 7?20%, respectively). Interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd, left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV mean wall thickness (LVMWT) were greater in groups 2 and 4 than controls; group 4 also had a greater pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and LV posterior wall (LVPWd). Group 1 showed a greater LVMWT; group 4 a greater end point septal separation (EPSS). Training intensity influenced in both categories IVSd and MWT; in eventers also the right ventricular diameter in diastole and in dressage horses also LVPWd, LVM, EPSS and PAD. Elite eventers and dressage horses showed an increased prevalence of audible murmurs and valvular regurgitation. Cardiac adaptations resembled those associated with resistance and endurance training. Increased performance level and training intensity accompanied increased cardiac muscle thickness and volume. These effects should be considered during sales and performance evaluations.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training results in improved mitochondrial efficiency but it is unclear if dietary selenium level can further modify mitochondrial function. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and exercise training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At week 14, all horses underwent a 2?hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Permeabilized muscle fibers obtained from the gluteus medius of horses at rest were analysed for mitochondrial function via high resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity with Complex I substrates was determined using the respiratory control ratio (RCR) of state 3 (with ADP) and state 2 (without ADP; leak respiration). Electron transport system capacity (ETSC) was determined by uncoupling phosphorylation and respiration using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS) activities were assessed in resting muscle samples obtained at week 0 and 14, and in response to the SET. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA. Results Leak, state 3, ETSC, CS and CCO were higher (P<0.05) at wk 14 compared to wk 0 in all horses, but were not affected by training or Se level. Additionally, CS and CCO were unaffected by the SET. Conclusions Mitochondrial number (CS activity) and efficiency were unaffected by training and dietary Se level, but did increase over time, perhaps due to growth of horses. A more strenuous training protocol may be needed to induce mitochondrial adaptations.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Lower airway diseases are common problems in sports and racing horses. In humans, exercise causes increased susceptibility to respiratory infections associated with down-regulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules. Because numerous cell types are implicated in important defense mechanisms against airborne infections, we aimed to assess the effect of training on innate immune responses of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC) and blood monocytes. Methods PAM, EBEC and monocytes were collected at rest and after a standardized exercise test (SET) from eight untrained, trained and deconditioned horses. We compared their respective expression of TLR1-9 by qPCR and their cytokinic responses following exposure to various TLR ligands by ELISA. Data were reported as least square means and analyzed by a global linear mixed model. Results The mRNA expression of TLR3 was down-regulated by training in PAM (P<0.0001) and monocytes (P<0.015), whereas the mRNA expression of TLR4 was up-regulated in monocytes (P?=?0.0004) only. Monocytes stimulated with TLR2- and TLR4-ligands showed increased cytokine secretion after training and deconditioning (P<0.025). EBEC from trained horses produced less TNF-alpha (P<0.05) after treatment with ligands of TLR2 and TLR3 compared with EBEC from untrained horses. The production of TNF-alpha (P<0.001) and IFN-beta (P<0.001) in non-stimulated and stimulated PAM was decreased in trained and deconditioned horses. Conclusions The impaired cytokine production in PAM and EBEC after a training period might explain the increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and is associated with the activation of cells at the systemic level.

AB  - Introduction In equestrian sports where horses exercise at submaximal levels, the identification of some clinical conditions leading to poor performance can remain difficult. The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test.

AB  - Introduction In theory, splenic reserve mobilization should elicit a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor mediated neuroendocrine response (the Gauer-Henry reflex). Six intact (IN) and 5 (SP) splenectomized Standardbred mares (421?491?kg, ?9?yr) performed 10?min of treadmill exercise (80% VO2max) to test the hypothesis that hemodynamic and endocrine responses to exercise would differ between IN and SP horses Methods Blood samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10?min of exertion. Right ventricular pressure (RVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were measured and total peripheral resistance (TPR) calculated. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were measured using RIA. Data analysis used ANOVA for repeated measures and SNK. Significance was set at P<0.05. There were no differences (P>0.05) between IN and SP for any variable at rest. All variables except TPR and RAP increased (P<0.05) during exertion in both IN and SP. Means (±SE) for RAP (18?±?3 vs. 1?±?2?mmHg), CO (255?±?21 vs.177?±?19?L/min), MAP (147?±?3 vs. 116?±?8?mmHg), and ANP (66?±?3 vs. 50?±?8?pg/mL) were greater for IN vs. SP horses at 10?min of exertion. Mean plasma AVP (95?±?19 vs. 23?±?3?pg/mL) was greater (P<0.05) for SP than for IN horses at 10?min of exertion.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador breed is valued for its gait. However few studies have assessed the use of nutritional additives on this breed's performance. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that chelated trivalent chromium and L-carnitine feed supplementation may reduce subcutaneous fat deposition after training. Methods 13 mares (2.5 to 3 years old) were assigned to one of three treatments (T1, 10?mg Cr/day; T2, 10?g LCN/day; T3, control) according to a completely randomized design, with split-plot arrangement. The diet was Panicum maximum cv. Massai and concentrate (50:50 ratio and 2.5% BWT). During 42 days the mares received supplementation and exercised for 50?min on a treadmill and 60?min on an automatic walker every other day, resting on Sundays. Subcutaneous fat was measured with ultrasound before and after training in the back-loin(GDL), croup(GG), and base of the tail(GBC). Results were compared by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results Before training, the variables were similar across the groups (P>0.05). After training, in GDL, T2 (1.76?mm) was 37.37% lower (P<0.05) than control (2.81?mm), while T1 (2.22?mm) was similar to T2 and control. There was no difference between treatments (P>0.05) in GG. In GBC, there was a 24.45% increase from pre (8.59?mm) to post-treatment (10.69?mm) evaluations, regardless of the treatment. Conclusions Supplementation with L-carnitine reduces subcutaneous fat deposition in the lumbar region of Mangalarga Marchador mares after training, which may be indicative of increased use of subcutaneous fat in this region as a substrate for exercise.

AB  - Introduction Kissing Spines Syndrome (KSS) represents a major challenge in equine practice. Radiographic examination of dorsal spinous processes (DSP) is therefore often included in sale and insurance cases and in diagnosis of back problems. Measurement of interspinous spaces (ISS) on radiographs is often used when evaluating DSPs. Radiographic examination of the equine back usually consists of two to four images causing beam angle differences between the image center and image borders. In addition, radiographs are 2D representations of 3D structures causing superimposition of anatomical structures. The aim of this study was to investigate if x-ray beam angle and superimposition affect radiographic evaluation of ISSs. Methods Beam angle effect was investigated using latero-lateral radiographs of the thoracic DSPs. Importance of superimposition of anatomical structures was investigated by comparing radiographic measurements with measurements in comparable CT and MR images. Cadaver backs from six horses were included. Four had a diagnosis of KSS, while two were considered normal. Backs were placed in an upright position on a flat surface for all images. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model with a single random factor, ISS. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results X-ray beam angle significantly influenced measurement of ISS (P<0.02) with differences of up to 2?mm, when measured three positions apart. ISS widths measured in radiographs were significantly lower than in comparable CT (P<0.0001) and MR (P<0.0001) images with differences of up to 3?mm. Conclusions These findings suggest that radiographic assessment may result in incorrect evaluation of ISSs. Ethical Animal Research Cadaver material was included in the study with signed consent from the horse owners.

AB  - Introduction The equestrian arenas at the 2012 Olympic Games were constructed on a unique raised platform. Arena surfaces can be implicated in risk of injury and affect performance, therefore functional properties were examined to ensure preparation was appropriate for this unusual construction. The objective of this work was to assess surface hardness, load carrying capacity and uniformity during the development of a suitable surface for the 2012 Olympic Games. Data were compared from the Olympic site at a test event in 2011, pre-London 2012 and from developmental test arenas on and off a raised platform. Methods In-situ systematic sampling was used across arenas. A biomechanical surface tester quantified load carrying capacity (peak load), a Clegg impact hammer was used to assess hardness (peak deceleration) and moisture data were analysed in the laboratory. Contour maps and GLMs (applying the arena's structural features as explanatory variables where appropriate) were used to highlight surface heterogeneity. Results Significant variation in peak deceleration across the surface was detected at the test event in 2011 (P<0.0001). Peak load (P<0.0001) and peak deceleration (P<0.0001) were higher pre-London 2012, partly due to enhanced stiffness of the base layer. Higher moisture content found pre-London 2012 (P<0.001) was considered beneficial for surface consolidation. There was no significant difference between data collected on or off a raised platform following the developmental work. Results highlight the importance of effective water management and sub-surface construction. Conclusions Findings from this work guided decisions made by the surface providers for the 2012 Olympic Games and advanced understanding of methods most appropriate for assessing arenas in-situ.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred racehorses often experience periods of detraining due to locomotor disorders and subsequent rehabilitation. We hypothesised that regularly exercising horses at different intensities during a period of detraining would differentially maintain their cardiopulmonary and O2 transport capacities. Methods Twenty-seven Thoroughbred horses trained for 18 weeks then underwent 12 weeks of detraining according to one of three protocols: 1) cantering at 70% maximal rate of O2 consumption (VO2max) for 3?min/d for 5?d/wk (C group), 2) walking for 1?h/d for 5?d/wk (W group) and 3) stall rest (S group). Standardised treadmill exercise tests were performed before and after detraining during which cardiopulmonary and O2 transport variables were measured. Data were analysed with two-way ANOVA and pairwise comparisons made with Tukey's test. Significance was defined as P≤0.05. Results Mass-specific VO2max, maximal cardiac output and maximal stroke volume of all groups decreased after detraining with no differences between groups. The run time to exhaustion, speed eliciting VO2max, speed eliciting maximal heart rate and speed at which plasma lactate concentration reached 4?mmol/l of the C group did not change but those of the W and S groups decreased after detraining. Arterial-(mixed-venous) O2 concentration difference did not change after detraining in any group, and maximal heart rate decreased in the W and S groups. Conclusions These results suggest it may be possible to identify a minimum threshold exercise intensity or protocol during detraining in horses that maintains significant elements of performance-related variables and minimises reductions in O2 transport capacity.

AB  - Introduction Muscle conformation is often discussed among practitioners and it is sometimes suggested that specific training strategies affect muscle conformation. This study attempted to investigate; 1) if it is possible for practitioners to judge whether a horse is subjected to pace training or not based on subjective analysis of hind-end muscle conformation and 2) which terminology practitioners would use when doing this. Methods Photos were taken from behind (transverse plane) in 10 Icelandic horses trained for mounted pace racing and 11 used for riding but not pacing. Body condition score was 7.4 and 7.5 (SE 0.3, P>0.05) in pacers and non-pacers, respectively (9 degree scale, ANOVA, Tukey test). Three experienced horse practitioners (A, B, C) were informed that the 21 photos showed horses trained for pace racing and horses not trained as pacers and they were instructed to separate photos into two groups based on their subjective impression of muscle conformation. Results Practitioner A divided horses into groups called ?even? (n?=?13) and ?narrow? (n?=?8); B into groups called ?strong? (n?=?11) and ?weak? (n?=?10); and C into ?high? (n?=?9) and ?wedged? ? (n?=?12). The practitioners assumed that ?even?, ?strong? and ?high? horses were pacers and 10, 10 and 12 observations were correct in practitioner A, B and C, respectively (mean?±?SD: 51?±?5%). The number of cases where all practitioners agreed and grouping also matched pacers and non-pacers were 7. Conclusions It appears not to be possible to judge whether an Icelandic horse is pace trained based on observations of the hind-end musculature. The terminology used appeared to refer either to the conformation or to a presumed strength. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Introduction Fatalities are recognized as a consequence of prolonged endurance exercise but data documenting incidence and causes is limited. Methods Numbers of horse starts and fatalities were obtained from the American Endurance Ride Conference (AERC) website (www.aerc.org) and further details about fatalities were obtained from horse owners and attending veterinarians. Annual incidence rates were calculated and odds ratios for region and ride length were determined. Results From 2002?2013 there were 252,738 horse starts in AERC sanctioned rides and 67 fatalities attributable to the demands of endurance exercise were documented. 46/67 horses were eliminated while 21 successfully completed the ride and were deemed fit to continue. Thirteen horses died while euthanasia was performed in the remaining 54 instances, and 51% had necropsy examinations performed. 81% of the fatalities developed acute abdominal pain and necropsy findings included gastric rupture in 12%. Fatalities were also related to financial constraints as 28% of riders declined fluid therapy, referral to surgical facilities, and/or surgery when recommended. Horses competing in the Central and Midwest regions appeared at lesser risk, while those in the Southwest and Northeast regions appeared at greater risk, but low numbers of fatalities precluded reaching statistical significance. In contrast, the risk of fatality was 2 (1 fatality per 3,711 starts) and 12 (1 fatality per 648 starts) times more likely for participation in 80 and 160?km rides, as compared to competition in Limited Distance (40 to 56?km) rides (1 fatality per 8,057 starts). Conclusions Overall fatality rates were low; however, risk increased with ride distance. Acute abdominal pain was the most common clinical presentation.

AB  - Introduction Human athletes have been characterized as either ?good drinkers? or ?poor drinkers? on the basis of voluntary water intake during and after endurance exercise. Similarly, riders of endurance horses have described some horses to be better drinkers than others; however, there are no data in horses to substantiate these claims. Methods Voluntary fluid intake (FI) by twenty four 2-year-old Arabian horses that performed 45?60?km of treadmill exercise in four experiments was recorded. All horses were raised similarly and had no training except a 12 week conditioning period before each experiment. Mean FI intake (each horse performed three or four exercise tests in each experiment) was subjected to cluster analysis to separate horses into poor, average, and excellent drinking groups. FI was also correlated to body weight (BW) loss at the end of the exercise test. Results Cluster analysis separated horses into poor drinkers (n?=?10, FI 8.7?±?0.7 liters and BW loss of 2.2?±?0.4%); average drinkers (n?=?11, FI 14.1?±?0.6 liters and BW loss of 1.8?±?0.2%); and excellent drinkers (n?=?3, FI 24.9?±?0.2 liters and BW loss of 0.7?±?0.3%). FI was inversely correlated with BW loss (R values between ?0.53 and ?0.87 for all four experiments, P<0.01). Conclusions These data, in groups of young, similarly trained horses, are the first to support that there are innate differences in voluntary drinking during and after endurance exercise in this species.

AB  - Introduction It has been debated which airway sampling method, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspirate (TA), is superior in evaluating equine respiratory disease. Most studies suggest BAL is the best sampling method due to better correlation with lung histopathology. In this study we compared BAL and TA results of athletic non-Thoroughbred horses with chronic respiratory signs or exercise intolerance during 2009?2013. Methods 64 horses, 2?25 years of age (16 Coldbloods, 30 Warmbloods, 11 Standardbreds, 7 ponies) with recurrent or chronic (duration >1 month) respiratory signs or exercise intolerance that were subject to both BAL and TA sampling at rest were included. Neutrophil counts >5% in BAL and >20% in TA were considered abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results Both BAL and TA were abnormal in 29 horses and normal in 26 horses. 7 horses had only abnormal TA and 2 horses only abnormal BAL. Correlation was found between the amount of mucus in the trachea and both BAL (P?=?0.002) and TA (P<0.001) neutrophil percentage. Neutrophil (P<0.001), eosinophil (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P?=?0.008) and macrophage (P?=?0.004) percentages correlated between BAL and TA. Conclusions In our university hospital population, mucus in the trachea was a good indicator of airway neutrophilia. Unlike previous studies, in only 14% of the horses the interpretation of BAL and TA result was different with TA being slightly more sensitive at detecting neutrophilia. However, a gold standard for detecting inflammation in the equine airways is still lacking and the type and severity of the disease may greatly influence the best choice of sampling method.

AB  - Introduction Resistance training provided by underwater (UWT) treadmills may enhance strength and fatigue resistance of superficial digital flexor muscle thereby reducing tendon injury. This study examined effects of UWT and land (LT) treadmill training on SDF and gluteal muscle. Methods Six unfit horses (3???2 crossover design, 60d detraining period) walked on UWT and LT for 5d/week for 8 weeks (up to 40?min/day). A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed 2 weeks before, and after L or UW training, and V180?bpm and La10.5?m/s calculated. Resting and post-SET gluteal and SDF muscle biopsies were obtained. Muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], fiber type composition and min/max fiber diameters were analysed. Comparisons were made using GLM or ANOVA, mean?±?SD and significance of P<0.05. Results Post-exercise SDF muscle lactate increased 3?4 fold to 30?±?12 (UWT) and 41?±?15 (LT) mmol/kg dw post-exercise. Post-exercise gluteal muscle lactate increased 2 fold to 55?±?18 (UWT) and 62?±?18 (LT) mmol/kg. No significant differences were found between UW and L post-exercise muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], V180 or LA10.5 or fiber type composition. Gluteal fiber diameters decreased significantly with UW and L training. Fiber diameters in SDF muscle decreased with training to a significantly lesser extent after UW vs. L training. Conclusions At maximal speed, both SDF and gluteal muscle have a significant anaerobic response which was not impacted by UWT or LT training at a walk. UWT may be of benefit by attenuating the training induced decrease in fiber sizes in SDF muscle thereby enhancing SDF muscle strength.

AB  - Introduction Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in assessing MPS in horses has not been evaluated. Determination of MPS requires steady-state tracer plasma enrichment and serial muscle biopsy. Given that MPS is often assessed in response to exercise and that muscle biopsy in the standing horse typically requires sedation, the influence of exercise and sedation on tracer kinetics was determined. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) IV and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?hrs. Pharmacokinetic modeling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6 hours of infusion after loading. Horses then received the same dose and completed a 12-minute exercise test and were sedated with xylazine 0.4?mg/kg IV. Plasma D5-Phe enrichment was determined every 5?15 minutes for 2 hours after both exercise and sedation. Results The mean rate of phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56?umol/kg/hr (SD 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41?umol/kg (SD 8.8). A loading dose of 3.3?umol/kg and an infusion rate of 4.5?umol/kg/hr D5-phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently, confirmed to achieve steady state tracer concentration at 5.6?9.1% APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). Conclusions D5-phenylalanine is a suitable metabolic tracer in the horse as a steady-state can be achieved, however interventions should be taken into account.
