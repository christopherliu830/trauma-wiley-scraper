AB  - Introduction Evaluating responses of horses to diagnostic analgesia is subject to bias. Pelvic movement symmetry can be measured accurately with inertial sensors, but it is unclear which of the many symmetry measures best reflect changes. It was hypothesised that objective parameters mimicking commonly observed visual parameters used by veterinarians (difference between upward/downward sacral movement and between amplitudes of left and right tuber coxa motion) would show the largest, most consistent responses. Methods 13 horses underwent visual lameness scoring and independent gait assessment with inertial sensors during clinical lameness investigations. Multiple movement symmetry parameters were calculated and changes before/after diagnostic analgesia regressed against change in lameness grade. Confidence intervals of slopes of regression lines were assessed to identify significant changes. Results All parameters showed variation between horses and across lameness grades. Three measures documented a consistent increase in symmetry for each grade of change in lameness score: difference between sacral displacement minima, and upward movement difference and range of motion difference between the tubera coxae. A change in symmetry of 9?13% for each grade of increase in lameness can be expected. Conclusions The three most promising pelvic parameters for consistent quantification of changes due to diagnostic analgesia in the hindlimb of lame horses were identified. Difference in upward movement between left and right tuber coxae is the most sensitive but requires simultaneously focusing on pelvic and limb movements and may therefore be more difficult to assess visually. Showing a similar response to diagnostic analgesia, the difference in movement amplitude between left and right tuber coxae may be more easily perceived since it does not require simultaneous focus on limb movement. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract The Japanese Dermatological Association prepared guidelines focused on the treatment of skin ulcers associated with connective tissue disease/vasculitis practical in clinical settings of dermatological care. Skin ulcers associated with connective tissue diseases or vasculitis occur on the background of a wide variety of diseases including, typically, systemic sclerosis but also systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), various vasculitides and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Therefore, in preparing the present guidelines, we considered diagnostic/therapeutic approaches appropriate for each of these disorders to be necessary and developed algorithms and clinical questions for systemic sclerosis, SLE, dermatomyositis, RA, vasculitis and APS.

AB  - Objective We examined early first deployment and subsequent suicide attempt among U.S. Army soldiers. Method Using 2004?2009 administrative data and person-month records of first-term, Regular Army, enlisted soldiers with one deployment (89.2% male), we identified 1,704 soldiers with a documented suicide attempt during or after first deployment and an equal-probability control sample (n = 25,861 person-months). Results Logistic regression analyses indicated soldiers deployed within the first 12 months of service were more likely than later deployers to attempt suicide (OR = 1.7 [95% CI = 1.5?1.8]). Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, service-related characteristics, and previous mental health diagnosis slightly attenuated this association (OR = 1.6 [95% CI = 1.5?1.8]). Results were not modified by gender, deployment status, military occupation, or mental health diagnosis. The population-attributable risk proportion for deploying within the first 12 months of service was 17.8%. Linear spline models indicated similar risk patterns over time for early and later deployers, peaking at month 9 during deployment and month 5 postdeployment; however, monthly suicide attempt rates were consistently higher for early deployers. Conclusions Enlisted soldiers deployed within the first 12 months of service have elevated risk of suicide attempt during and after first deployment. Improved understanding of why early deployment increases risk can inform the development of policies and intervention programs.

AB  - Abstract Native bone extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by mesenchymal precursors provides an optimal biological framework, comprising structural collagen proteins and a microenvironment niche, which supports cell attachment and differentiation, and bone growth. Inspired by nature, the embryonic-like mineralized ECM/stem cell microspheroids (MECS) are developed, in which self-assembly of the stem cell microspheroids (CS) and mineralization of the self-produced ECM occur simultaneously. The uniform-sized MECS exhibit a solid spherical appearance with stem cells embedded inside, recapitulating the early stage of intramembranous ossification. Compared with pure CS, MECS show enhanced Young's modulus, cell viability, intercellular communication, and osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, the capability of MECS is explored without the use of exogenous scaffolds to substitute and repair lost bone in rat critical-sized defects. It is found that the MECS can achieve excellent bone regeneration outcomes with 97.99 ± 2.28% of the defect area filled with new bony structures and blood vessels, while nearly half or one-third of the defect area is repaired by CS (52.79 ± 4.63%) or ?-tricalcium phosphate (38.09 ± 7.79%), respectively. The study demonstrates that embryonic-like MECS is a novel effective bone graft substitute for bone tissue regeneration.

AB  - Objective To compare sociodemographics, parity and mode of delivery between women diagnosed with vaginismus or localised provoked vestibulodynia (LPV) to women without a diagnosis before first pregnancy. Design Retrospective, population-based register study. Setting Sweden. Sample All women born in Sweden 1973?83 who gave birth for the first time or remained nulliparous during the years 2001?09. Methods Nationally linked registries were used to identify the study population. Women diagnosed with vaginismus or LPV were compared to all other women. Odds ratios for parity and mode of delivery were calculated using multinominal regression analysis and logistic regression. Main outcome measures Parity and mode of delivery. Results Women with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to be unmarried (P = 0.001), unemployed (P = 0.012), have a higher educational level (P < 0.001), a lower body mass index (P < 0.001) and use nicotine during pregnancy (P = 0.008). They were less likely to give birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.56?0.67). Women with vaginismus/LPV more often delivered by caesarean section (P < 0.001) especially for maternal request (adjusted OR 3.48, 95% CI 2.45?4.39). In women having vaginal delivery, those with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to suffer a perineal laceration (adjusted OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.56?2.25). Conclusions Women with vaginismus/LPV are less likely to give birth and those that do are more likely to deliver by caesarean section and have a caesarean section based upon maternal request. Those women delivering vaginally are more likely to suffer perineal laceration. These findings point to the importance of not only addressing sexual function in women with vaginismus/LPV but reproductive function as well.

AB  - Background? It is estimated that skin cancers cost $33 million per annum to the New Zealand healthcare system. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the commonest types of non melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Anecdotal evidence indicates that there has been a doubling in the incidence of NMSCs in New Zealand over the last decade. Because of the high incidence mandatory reporting of NMSCs to the National Cancer Registry is not required. This lack of accurate data has led to poor health care policies and strategies including funding and workforce planning. Aims? The aims of this study are to (1) present the latest statistics on NMSCs in New Zealand, including the incidence across different regions over the last decade, patient demographics, anatomic distribution of NMSCs, incidence and sites of metastasis, and disease-specific survival; to (2) the histopathology of NMSCs, including surgical margins, histologic grade, and perineural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion; and (3) the relative role of different faculties treating NMSCs. Method? This project has been approved by the multi-centre ethics committee. A retrospective review was conducted from patients? histology records from public and private pathology laboratories within defined catchment areas. Criterion for analysis is a confirmed diagnosis of NMSC treated surgically. A Microsoft Access database is created that will facilitate subsequent data retrieval and analysis. Results and Conclusion? It is hoped that this up-to-date data will form the framework for the development of sound and sustainable healthcare policies of management of NMSCs including management strategies and workforce planning, and research direction on this common disease.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.

AB  - Summary Odontogenic cysts occur in tooth-bearing regions of the jaw and are lined by odontogenic epithelium, including residual dental lamina, reduced enamel epithelium, and remnants of the epithelial root sheath. This chapter discusses the specific types of odontogenic cysts. It also discusses specific radiologic features as they pertain to a particular type of odontogenic cyst. Histopathologic examination plays a critical role in the diagnosis of odontogenic cysts. When sampled with the cyst lining as part of a biopsy sample, bone within the cyst wall is usually mildly proliferative, organized woven bone. The pathogenesis is initiated by endodontic disease, which is followed by inflammation at the root apex, bone loss, proliferation of residual epithelium, and fluid transport into the lumen of an epithelium-lined cavity. The risk of tumor development within odontogenic cysts is regularly referenced in both the human and veterinary literature on odontogenic cysts.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? To review the literature on mortality among dependent or regular users of opioids across regions, according to specific causes, and related to a number of demographic and clinical variables. Methods? Multiple search strategies included searches of Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO, consistent with the methodology recommended by the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group; grey literature searches; and contact of experts for any additional unpublished data from studies meeting inclusion criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), with stratified analyses where possible. Meta-regressions examined potentially important sources of heterogeneity across studies. Results? Fifty-eight prospective studies reported mortality rates from opioid-dependent samples. Very high heterogeneity across studies was observed; pooled all-cause CMR was 2.09 per 100 person-years (PY; 95% CI; 1.93, 2.26), and the pooled SMR was 14.66 (95% CI: 12.82, 16.50). Males had higher CMRs and lower SMRs than females. Out-of-treatment periods had higher mortality risk than in-treatment periods (pooled RR 2.38 (CI: 1.79, 3.17)). Causes of death varied across studies, but overdose was the most common cause. Multivariable regressions found the following predictors of mortality rates: country of origin; the proportion of sample injecting; the extent to which populations were recruited from an entire country (versus subnational); and year of publication. Conclusions? Mortality among opioid-dependent users varies across countries and populations. Treatment is clearly protective against mortality even in non-randomized observational studies. Study characteristics predict mortality levels; these should be taken into account in future studies.
