AB  - Abstract The field of physical medicine  (2) focused on recovery or maintenance of any function; and (3) used data repositories or research databases. We identified 398 articles that cited 244 data sources. The data sources included 66 data repositories and 179 research databases. We categorized the data sources based on their purposes and uses, geographic distribution, and other characteristics. This study collates the range of databases, data repositories, and data-sharing mechanisms that have been used in PM&R internationally. In recent years, these data sources have provided significant information for the field, especially at the population-health level. Implications and future directions for data sources also are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To examine the basic premises of gun control and the relationship linking legal firearm ownership to homicide and suicide in Australia. Data sources/ Available data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding firearms ownership, study selection: suicide and homicide in Australia were reviewed. Medline database searches using key words of ?firearms?, ?homicide, statistics, trends?, ?suicide, statistics, trends? and ?violence, prevention and control, statistics? identified English language publications relating to violence prevention and/or firearms from 1966 to 1996. These papers were manually searched to identify additional references. Internet home pages of The Coalition for Gun Control, The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Handgun Control Inc. and The National Rifle Association were reviewed and information that could be independently validated was considered. Results: Few papers approach the subject of violence with the same focus, limiting the ability to perform meta-analysis or direct comparisons of data. Conclusions: Current knowledge is inconclusive, but does not provide strong support for some existing Australian firearm control measures. Evidence suggests that further reducing the levels of firearm ownership in Australia will not cause an overall reduction in rates of homicide or suicide.

AB  - Background Mortality prediction models are applied in the intensive care unit (ICU) to stratify patients into different risk categories and to facilitate benchmarking. To ensure that the correct prediction models are applied for these purposes, the best performing models must be identified. As a first step, we aimed to establish a systematic review of mortality prediction models in critically ill patients. Methods Mortality prediction models were searched in four databases using the following criteria: developed for use in adult ICU patients in high-income countries, with mortality as primary or secondary outcome. Characteristics and performance measures of the models were summarized. Performance was presented in terms of discrimination, calibration and overall performance measures presented in the original publication. Results In total, 43 mortality prediction models were included in the final analysis. In all, 15 models were only internally validated (35%), 13 externally (30%) and 10 (23%) were both internally and externally validated by the original researchers. Discrimination was assessed in 42 models (98%). Commonly used calibration measures were the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (60%) and the calibration plot (28%). Calibration was not assessed in 11 models (26%). Overall performance was assessed in the Brier score (19%) and the Nagelkerke's R2 (4.7%). Conclusions Mortality prediction models have varying methodology, and validation and performance of individual models differ. External validation by the original researchers is often lacking and head-to-head comparisons are urgently needed to identify the best performing mortality prediction models for guiding clinical care and research in different settings and populations.

AB  - Organ donors are sources of physiologically healthy organs and tissues for life-saving transplantation, and have been recently used for human immunology studies which are typically confined to the sampling of peripheral blood. Donors comprise a diverse population with different causes of death and clinical outcomes during hospitalization, and the effects of such variations on immune parameters in blood and tissues are not known. We present here a coordinate analysis of innate and adaptive immune components in blood, lymphoid (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes), and mucosal (lungs, intestines) sites from a population of brain-dead organ donors (2 months-93 years; n = 291) across eight clinical parameters. Overall, the blood of donors exhibited similar monocyte and lymphocyte content and low serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as healthy controls; however, donor blood had increased neutrophils and serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1 which varied with cause of death. In tissues, the frequency and composition of monocytes, neutrophils, B lymphocytes and T cell subsets in lymphoid or mucosal sites did not vary with clinical state, and was similar in donors independent of the extent of clinical complications. Our results reveal that organ donors maintain tissue homeostasis, and are a valuable resource for fundamental studies in human immunology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? Using cross-sectional national survey data, we assessed young peoples' beliefs about the role of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders as well as the predictors of these beliefs. We also compared these findings with those from a similar survey carried out in 2006. Design, setting and participants ? Between January and May 2011, a national computer-assisted telephone survey was conducted on a representative sample of Australian youths aged 15?25 years. A total of 3021 young people were presented with a case vignette portraying depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, psychosis, social phobia, depression with alcohol misuse or post-traumatic stress disorder in a young person. Measurements? Respondents were asked about their beliefs regarding the role of using alcohol, tobacco and marijuana in preventing or dealing with the mental disorders described in the vignettes. Level of psychological distress was assessed by the Kessler 6 scale (K6). Findings? More than 75% of respondents agreed that the three substances were harmful for the young people in the vignettes, and that not using marijuana or drinking alcohol in excess is preventive. Males, young adults and more distressed respondents were less likely to endorse these beliefs. No significant changes were observed between surveys. Conclusions? Most young people in Australia are aware of the negative impact of substance use on mental disorders, but a few high-risk groups remain: males, young adults and those with more psychological distress. Future public health campaigns need to target these groups and focus on translating young people's substance use beliefs into behavioural change.

AB  - Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurological disorder. Mutations in five genes (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1, and MYORG) have been linked to PFBC. Here, we used SYBR green-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis to detect copy number variants (CNVs) in 20 unrelated patients with PFBC, negatively sequenced for the five known genes. We identified three deletions in SLC20A2, including a large de novo full gene deletion and two exonic deletions confined to exon 2 and exon 6, respectively. Subsequent linked-read whole-genome sequencing of the patient with the large deletion showed a 1.7 Mb heterozygous deletion which removed the entire coding regions of SLC20A2 as well as 21 other genes. In the family with a deletion of exon 6, a missense variant of uncertain significance (SLC20A2: p.E267Q) also co-segregated with the disease. Functional assay showed the deletion could result in significantly impaired phosphate transport, whereas the p.E267Q variant did not. Our results confirm that deletion in SLC20A2 is a causal mechanism for PFBC and highlight the importance of functional study for classifying a rare missense variant as (likely) pathogenic.

AB  - Summary Cyathostomins represent a potential cause of equine morbidity and have become the main focus of endoparasite control in managed horses. All grazing horses are at risk of infection with cyathostomins; therefore, the application of appropriate management measures is essential. Anthelmintics currently comprise the main method of control for equine nematodes and the ready availability of these products in some countries has resulted in their use becoming dissociated from veterinary involvement. This is concerning given the levels of anthelmintic resistance that have been recorded in cyathostomin populations. It is important that veterinarians re-establish control over the implementation of parasite control programmes, a major objective of which should be the preservation of anthelmintic efficacy. This article details the principles of cyathostomin control in horses with particular reference to anthelmintic resistance, and the use and interpretation of diagnostic tests for detecting cyathostomins and identifying anthelmintic resistance.

AB  - When elderly patients present with pain and difficulty walking after a fall, hip fracture is often suspected. If the x ray shows no abnormality early mobilisation is encouraged. When these patients continue to experience pain and are unable to walk, bone scintigraphy may reveal pelvic fractures. We present three illustrative cases and a retrospective review of 50 consecutive patients with pelvic fractures diagnosed by bone scintigraphy.
