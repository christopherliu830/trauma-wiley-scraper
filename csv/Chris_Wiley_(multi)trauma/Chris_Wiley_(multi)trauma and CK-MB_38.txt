AB  - Abstract Background: Saphenous vein graft (SVG) intervention is associated with a significant incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) related to distal vessel embolization. The FilterWire? distal embolic protection device has recently been approved as an adjunct to SVG intervention. We report here our initial experience in a single center in 30 consecutive patients using this device in SVG stenting. Hypothesis: This study examined the outcomes and complications associated with these devices, as well as whether proficiency with the devices increased with greater experience and whether there were measurable outcome differences between devices. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients in whom a FilterWire device was placed at our hospital between June 2001 and June 2004. Results: The device was successfully deployed in 29 of 30 patients, and all patients were stented successfully. Overall MACE rate was 6.6%, consistent with reports in larger multi-center clinical trials. Transient decreases in flow were noted while the device was in place in six patients, but improved in five patients with device removal. Conclusions: This early experience in a single center using FilterWire embolic protection indicates that excellent clinical results can be obtained by the adoption of filter protection for SVG intervention, without evidence for a detrimental learning curve.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is a common equine distal axonopathy associated with neurogenic atrophy of intrinsic laryngeal muscles (particularly the left) causing laryngeal paresis and poor performance. An objective, reliable method of assessing changes in structure that correlates with laryngeal muscle function in vivo is necessary to determine response to novel treatments, including functional electrical stimulation. This study aimed to determine whether laryngeal muscle and nerve morphology (determined by CT and histopathology) correlated with laryngeal function. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Resting (grades 1?4) and exercising (grades A?C) laryngeal function was graded in adult Thoroughbred horses. Standing CT of the larynx was performed to compare volume, cross-sectional area (XSA) and tissue density between left and right cricoarytenoideus dorsalis (CAD) muscles in 22 horses. CAD muscles and recurrent laryngeal nerves were collected in a subgroup of 10 horses and analysed for fibrosis, fat infiltration and nerve fibre density (axons/?m2). Results Horses with grade C?RLN on exercising endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles and reduced nerve fibre density than horses with grades A or B. Horses with grade 4?RLN on resting endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles than horses with grades 1 or 2. Left CAD muscles had significantly more collagen than the right in horses with grade C?RLN. CT measurements of the CAD muscles were significantly associated with % collagen/fat and nerve fibre density (P<0.05). Conclusions Laryngeal CT results correlate with laryngeal function at rest and exercise in the horse and provide a noninvasive method of monitoring changes in CAD morphology in response to novel treatments. CAD CT appearance is dependent on % collagen and fat in the muscle and is associated with nerve fibre density. Ethical animal research:?Horses destined for euthanasia were recruited for this study with approval of the Institutional Ethical Committee and under UK Home Office Licence. Sources of funding:?Med-El Elektro-medizinische Geräte GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Summary Parkes SE, Parke S, Manghan DC, Grimer RJ, Davies P, Morland BJ. Fifty years of paediatric malignant bone tumours in the West Midlands, UK, 1957?2006: incidence, treatment and outcome. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010. Malignant bone tumours in the paediatric age group (0?14 years) are uncommon; various aetiological theories exist and few reports of incidence, age and sex distributions have been published. We examined the incidence of childhood malignant bone tumours in one large single region of the UK over an extended period of 50 years. The West Midlands specialist regional children's tumour registry holds data on all malignancies and benign brain tumours in children under 15 years in the West Midlands region, which has a population of around 1 million children. Demographic and clinical data have been abstracted and diagnoses reviewed by a panel of expert pathologists. During the period 1957?2006, 259 cases of malignant paediatric bone tumours were diagnosed. There were 153 osteosarcomas, 78 Ewing sarcomas and 28 other primary bone tumours. The overall age standardised rate was 4.66, with no increase over time, although there was a significant increase in the incidence of Ewing sarcomas in the period 1965?92. Sixty-eight per cent of tumours were in patients over 10 years, whereas the incidence in patients under 10 years showed a non-significant increase. Survival rates increased dramatically post-chemotherapy introduction, with Ewing sarcoma demonstrating better survival overall. This is a large study giving an overview of malignant bone tumours in the childhood population of a single region over an extended period, showing results consistent with national reports. It also examines late effects, which were mostly mobility/orthopaedic, although almost one-fifth of patients had cardiac problems and five went on to develop second malignancies.

AB  - Background Women with intellectual disability are thought to be at increased risk of mental illness, yet little is known about resiliency factors supporting women's mental health. This article reports on such factors drawn from a study that aimed to address how women with intellectual disability experience their mental health and well-being. Materials and Methods Utilizing a broad qualitative approach, 25 New Zealand women, aged 21?65 years were interviewed about their life from childhood to the present, including, where relevant, their experience of mental illness. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. Results Resiliency factors aligned with the theme ?keeping mentally well?, subthemes of which were as follows: the importance of relationships with family and friends; keeping busy; and autonomy and happiness. Challenges for resiliency could be seen in the theme ?mental illness? where subthemes of abuse, long-term stress and medication were identified. Conclusions Many of the women demonstrated remarkable resiliency, despite setbacks and exposure to risks, provided they were nested within a supportive context. Those women who experienced major mental illness shared evidence of both higher risk factors and less support available at crucial times.

AB  - Summary Body fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid) are preferred samples for neurological testing. This chapter focuses on the clinical laboratory examinations used to screen, diagnose, predict, and monitor neurologic disorders in geriatric patients. As the goals of laboratory testing in this population overlap those of general laboratory testing, a brief section on test interpretation and general laboratory considerations precedes the sections devoted to neurologic disorders of geriatric patients. The neurologic disorders for which laboratory investigations are described in the chapter are: dementias (Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease), movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-plus syndromes), cerebrovascular disorders (infarction and hemorrhage), and other disorders such as headache and depression.

AB  - In the three years from 1968 to 1970, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were isolated from 525 patients and members of the staff in a large teaching hospital. There was a progressive increase in the proportion of methicillin-resistant strains among the ?hospital? staphylococci, so that in the last half of 1970, 73% were methicillin-resistant. These organisms were responsible for a number of serious infections, including septicæmia. Some strains were resistant to lincomycin or kanamycin in addition to methicillin.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether preoperative electrocardiographic measurements linked to sympathetic nervous activity could be used to predict recovery quality after general anaesthesia in horses. Study design Prospective, clinical study. Animals Eighteen adult client-owned horses. Methods The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded presurgery in horses under three standard conditions: stabled unattended; with a groom whilst being led along a standard course; alone in the induction box. After surgery, each animal's recovery quality was scored by eight experienced anaesthetists or technicians using Donaldson's scoring system (2000). The digitized ECG recordings were analyzed for T-wave morphology, mean heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV) and HRV derivatives including mean R-R interval, standard deviation of normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive intervals (RMSSD), low (LF) and high frequency (HF) activity and the LF/HF ratio in both fast Fourier transformed and autoregressive spectra. Correlations between ECG variables and recovery score were examined using Spearman's rank correlation. Results There was no significant correlation between preanaesthetic ECG measurements and recovery quality. Conclusions Predictions of recovery quality after general anaesthesia in horses cannot be based on preanaesthetic ECG variables. Clinical relevance Measures other than those based on the ECG should be investigated as predictors of recovery quality.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are essential components of our defense and repair systems but also potentially harmful mediators of infectious and immunoinflammatory reactions. Clinically important cytokines function systemically as pleiotropic hormones with overlapping effects on many cell types. All engage in a complex network of agonists and antagonists. Some immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been found to be potent and specific regulators of cytokines. These antibodies bind interleukin (IL-1)α, IL-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interferon (IFN)-α/? with exceptional force. They neutralize their corresponding cytokines ex vivo and perhaps in vivo, although they may also function as cytokine carriers. The biological role of autoantibodies to cytokines is not yet understood, but they may provide a level of regulation not appreciated at present. Inappropriate production/function of such antibodies could be pathogenetically involved in immunoinflammatory and other diseases. Cytokine antibodies may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of human IgG therapy.

AB  - Forty-eight chronically (>3 months) ?-receptor-blocked patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension were studied on 49 occasions after random distribution to a 4-day, gradual preoperative withdrawal (n = 26) or a continuation (n = 23) of ?-receptor blockers. The patients were scheduled for either a cholecystectomy (n = 28) or a carotid thrombendarterectomy (n = 21) under neurolept anaesthesia. Three patients were excluded from the randomized part of the study due to complications (tachycardia, hypertension, severe angina) after therapy withdrawal. In subgroups, central haemodynamics (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 6, continued n = 8) and creatinine-kinase B (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 9, continued n= 11) were studied. Withdrawal of ?-receptor blockers was associated with high heart rates, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and a hyperkinetic circulation during pain stimuli. Significantly more postoperative ECG changes (p<0.02) indicative of myocardial ischaemia were found than in ?-receptor blocked patients. These patients had low heart rates but also pronounced increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, which in single patients could be associated with myocardial damage. These results imply that ?-receptor blockers should be continued before surgery and that a concomitant vasodilatatory therapy is likely to avoid the drawbacks of an increased cardiac afterload.

AB  - PURPOSE: A prospective cohort study was conducted to test our ability to identify chronically ill patients at near term risk of death by asking their primary care physician (PCP) the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of CHF or COPD?' METHODS: Patients were eligible for inclusion if 1) their clinic chart problem list carried a diagnosis of CHF or COPD, 2) they had been hospitalized within the past two years with primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF or COPD, or 3) direct identification by their PCP. Chart review was used to exclude patients erroneously carrying these diagnoses (e.g. coding errors), inactive patients (deceased or changed providers) and those patients with normal ejection fractions or not requiring scheduled ?-2 agonist and anticholinergic bronchodialator therapy. Patients were then stratified on the basis of their PCP's response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD?' All patients screened and stratified by the question were followed for the primary endpoint of death. RESULTS: The initial data query identified 190 patients with CHF and/or COPD. A chart review excluded eight inactive patients and thirty-one patients who did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria for significant disease. Of the remaining 151 patients, there were 72 whose PCP answered that he/she would not be surprised if the patient died from CHF and/or COPD in the next year. Within nine months, nine of these patients have died from complications of their CHF or COPD. There have been no deaths in the 79 patients whose PCP answered that they would be surprised if their patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD. (p-value < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF and/or COPD at risk of near term death can be differentiated from those who are not at high risk by the PCPs'response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of their CHF and/or COPD?' Such screening may be useful to more efficiently target palliative services and end of life care planning to patients with advanced CHF and/or COPD.

AB  - Although LTP (long-term potentiation) of synaptic transmission has received much attention as a model for learning and memory, its function within a neural circuit context remains poorly understood. To monitor LTP over an extensive circuit, we imaged responses in hippocampal slices using a voltage-sensitive dye. Following theta-burst stimulation, evoked optical signals showed an increase that lasted 40 min or more. Weak stimuli only potentiated the local area around the stimulating electrode, but stronger stimuli induced LTP over a wide area with a complex and non-uniform spatial pattern. The expression of LTP showed distinct peaks and valleys that depended on which axons were activated. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of LTP bore no relation to the spatial distribution of single-shock responses, but closely resembled the distribution of postsynaptic spikes evoked by theta bursts. Thus, postsynaptic spikes during induction constitute a critical determinant for the expression of LTP in intact circuits.

AB  - Abstract Aims: To assess the effects of surgery and ANH on coagulation. Methods: A total of 33 patients randomized to ANH (n = 17)/no ANH (n = 16), undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, were prospectively studied. Coagulation tests included aPTTR, INR, platelets, fibrinogen and thromboelastography (TEG). Results: There was no significant difference between groups at entry. In ?no ANH?, as operation progressed, there was a decrease in platelet count (P < 0.001) and fibrinogen (P = 0.001), and increase in aPTTR (P = 0.002) and INR (P = 0.001). The TEG confirmed this; decrease in alpha angle (P = 0.006), MA (P = 0.003) and G (P = 0.001), increase in K (P = 0.008). Prior to knife to skin, ANH reduced platelet count (P = 0.003) and fibrinogen (P = 0.001), and increased aPTTR (0.003) and INR (P = 0.001). R time was shortened (P = 0.001) but MA (P = 0.001) and G (P < 0.001) decreased. Re-transfusion of autologous blood increased platelet count (P = 0.03) and fibrinogen (P = 0.004), decreased aPTTR (P = 0.017) and INR (P = 0.002), without affecting the TEG. Between the groups, at the time of knife to skin, the ANH group had a lower platelet count (P < 0.001), increased INR (P = 0.006), reduced MA (P = 0.010) and G (P = 0.011), but shortened R time (P = 0.004). At 1 h into operation, the platelet count remained lower (P = 0.002), the INR (P = 0.005) and aPTTR (P = 0.008) significantly prolonged. Immediately prior to re-transfusion the only difference was a prolonged INR (P = 0.023). By the end of the operation there was no difference between groups. In addition there was no difference in estimated blood loss. Conclusions: Coagulation is significantly impaired as operation progresses. Acute normovolaemic haemodilution impairs coagulation; this remains significantly impaired throughout operation.

AB  - Abstract Aim To evaluate the association of house staff training with mortality in children with critical illness. Methods Patients <18 years of age in the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS, LLC) Database (2009?2013) were included. The study population was divided in two study groups: hospitals with residency programme only and hospitals with both residency and fellowship programme. Control group constituted hospitals with no residency or fellowship programme. The primary study outcome was mortality before intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate association of training programmes with ICU mortality. Results A total of 336 335 patients from 108 centres were included. Case-mix of patients among the hospitals with training programmes was complex; patients cared for in the hospitals with training programmes had greater severity of illness, had higher resource utilisation and had higher overall admission risk of death compared to patients cared for in the control hospitals. Despite caring for more complex and sicker patients, the hospitals with training programmes were associated with lower odds of ICU mortality. Conclusion Our study establishes that ICU care provided in hospitals with training programmes is associated with improved adjusted survival rates among the Virtual PICU database hospitals in the United States.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Background: Group B streptococcal disease is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis in the United States. We assessed predictors of compliance with the consensus guidelines for perinatal group B streptococcus disease prevention at two Group Health Cooperative hospitals. Methods: A descriptive and cohort analysis was conducted of failure to comply with the screening-based approach to group B streptococcus prevention among singleton birth pregnancies in two Group Health Cooperative hospitals, September 1, 1996 to December 31, 1997. We studied determinants of failure to screen pregnant women for group B streptococcus at 35 to 37 weeks? gestation and failure to deliver intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to Group B streptococcus-positive women. Results: Nearly 28 percent of 1969 women delivering at two Group Health Cooperative hospitals were not screened appropriately for group B streptococcus. Women who were not screened properly were more likely to be in their teens. A short length of hospital stay before delivery was the strongest predictor of the lack of administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to infected multiparas at delivery. Group B streptococcus-positive women without pregnancy complications were less likely to receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis than infected women with complications. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that to improve group B streptococcus disease prevention, screening efforts should focus on teenage women, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis delivery efforts should be aimed at low-risk women with precipitous labor.
