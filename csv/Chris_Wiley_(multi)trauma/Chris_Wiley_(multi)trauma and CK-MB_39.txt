AB  - Tick-born encephalitis (TBE) is caused by a Flavivirus infection after Ixodes Ricinus bite. Among the 62 cases of TBE virus infection observed in the Belluno General Hospital since January 1994, 4 patients (6,6%) presented also signs of lower motor neuron involvement. One patient exhibited severe tetraplegia with respiratory failure. The clinical picture was monomelic in the remaining 3 patients. In all patients reflexes were absent in the affected limbs; sensations were preserved. Needle EMG revealed signs of acute denervation, prominent in proximal muscles. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits. The outcome was good in the three patients with monoparesis who recovered normal muscle strength. The tetraplegic patient is still wheel-chair bound. Polio-like syndromes due to TBE virus infection have been described either in anecdotal reports or in small series of patients from continental Europe. The pathophysiology of the motor neuron damage is unknown.

AB  - Experimental diabetic neuropathy has a number of features in common with the human disease, including a reduction of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in nerve fibers, and alteration of the essential fatty acid metabolism leading to changes in membrane composition. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial in different pathological conditions including diabetic complications. Since the PUFA composition of cell membranes largely depends on the diet, most studies have supplemented the diet with fish oil (FO), particularly rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, or DHA and EPA ethyl esters. We have prepared a new formulation of n-3 PUFA wax esters (WE) enriched in DHA and EPA that have a bioavailability comparable to oil and esters, are easily digestible and are free from most of the previous drawbacks. The present study was designed to measure Na+, K+-ATPase activity, NCV, and FA content in plasma phospholipids (PL) and to assess the preventive effect of newly formulated n-3 PUFA-WE, and individual EPA and DHA-WE (as compared with standard and FO-supplemented diets) on these abnormalities. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60?mg/kg/ip). After STZ injection, diabetic and non-diabetic control rats were fed the standard diet (St) without supplementation or supplemented with either FO or n-3 PUFA-WE or individual EPA and DHA-WE, to reach a daily dose of 0.15?g/kg, the experiment continued for five weeks. Analysis of the FA composition of plasma PL, which better reflects FA intake and content in biological membranes, showed that the sums of n-3 PUFA were double the St diet after n-3 supplement of independent of the dietary regimen, whereas those of FA of the n-6 family were not affected by n-3 supplementation. Thus, the n-6/n-3 ratios were reduced from 15:1 with the St diet to 7:1 for the FO and WE diets. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly lower in diabetic rats (?30?35%), significantly restored in diabetic rats that received FO, n-3 PUFA and EPA-WE supplementation, and partially restored by DHA-WE (9% lower than with non-diabetic controls). These effects were partially associated with a significant beneficial effect on NCV which was reduced by 20% in diabetic rats. FO protected against this decrease (3%), n-3 PUFA-WE were only partially protective (11%), and EPA and DHA-WE had scant effect. This study indicates that, like FO, n-3 PUFA-EPA and DHA-WE have beneficial effects on diabetic-induced alterations in sciatic nerve ATPase+-ATPase activity and, partially, also on NCV. The newly formulated n-3 PUFA WE offer a potential advantage over products in current use, on account of their greater stability.

AB  - Objective In observational epidemiologic studies, higher plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has been associated with increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). DNA sequence variants that decrease cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene activity increase plasma HDL-C; as such, medicines that inhibit CETP and raise HDL-C are in clinical development. Here, we test the hypothesis that CETP DNA sequence variants associated with higher HDL-C also increase risk for ICH. Methods We performed 2 candidate-gene analyses of CETP. First, we tested individual CETP variants in a discovery cohort of 1,149 ICH cases and 1,238 controls from 3 studies, followed by replication in 1,625 cases and 1,845 controls from 5 studies. Second, we constructed a genetic risk score comprised of 7 independent variants at the CETP locus and tested this score for association with HDL-C as well as ICH risk. Results Twelve variants within CETP demonstrated nominal association with ICH, with the strongest association at the rs173539 locus (odds ratio [OR]?=?1.25, standard error [SE]?=?0.06, p?=?6.0???10?4) with no heterogeneity across studies (I2?=?0%). This association was replicated in patients of European ancestry (p?=?0.03). A genetic score of CETP variants found to increase HDL-C by ?2.85mg/dl in the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium was strongly associated with ICH risk (OR?=?1.86, SE?=?0.13, p?=?1.39???10?6). Interpretation Genetic variants in CETP associated with increased HDL-C raise the risk of ICH. Given ongoing therapeutic development in CETP inhibition and other HDL-raising strategies, further exploration of potential adverse cerebrovascular outcomes may be warranted.

AB  - SUMMARY Decisions concerning the use of allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in the treatment of anemia and hemorrhage require a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of both the condition and its treatment. Although we have developed a much clearer appreciation for the infectious and immunomodulatory risks of RBC transfusion over the past two decades, the risks of anemia in many clinical settings and the benefits of RBC transfusion are still inadequately characterized. Only one large randomized controlled trial has examined red cell administration in the perioperative and in the critical care setting, and high-quality clinical evidence is not yet available for many decisions related to red cell transfusions. Several studies and initiatives to evaluate alternatives to RBC transfusions and to improve current understanding of transfusion practices are underway. It is anticipated that risks and benefits of red cells and alternatives will be elucidated in the coming years.

AB  - Thalidomide seems to be effective in the treatment of cutaneous forms of lupus erythematosus refractory to other therapies. Peripheral neuropathy is the most severe side effect, but the incidence of neuropathy and its relation to thalidomide doses are still unclear. We prospectively monitored 12 patients treated with thalidomide for cutaneous lupus erythematosus in order to estimate the occurrence of side effects, particularly peripheral neuropathy. A total of 12 female patients, median age 38,6 years (range 26?56), with subacute or chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus were considered. The patients were treated with low dose thalidomide (starting dose 100?mg, tapered to 50?mg/day or 50?mg alternative day) for up to 18 months. The average follow-up period was 8,6 months (range 2?18). Prior to, and regularly during treatment patients underwent neurological evaluation and electrophysiological study of at least 8 nerves in the 4 arms (ulnar, median, sural, peroneal nerves). At recruitment, one patient presented a sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy. Of the remaining 11 patients, six did not present electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy, one had a carpal tunnel syndrome and four showed slowing of ulnar nerve velocity at elbow. No patients developed neuropathy neither worsening of electrophysiological parameters during thalidomide treatment. The most common side effect was tremor, always reversible after withdrawing or reducing thalidomide. Paresthesias, somnolence, amenhorrea, constipation were also present. Only one patient had to stop the therapy for the occurrence, 10 days after taking 50?mg of thalidomide, of a severe, stabbing, ?zoster-like? thoracic pain, which disappeared upon withdrawal of the drug. Started again on thalidomide, the symptoms reappeared and the patient definitely interrupted the therapy with benefit. All the 11 patients who continued on the therapy presented a significant improvement or remission of the cutaneous alterations. These preliminary data seem to indicate that low dose thalidomide is efficacious and tolerable for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Peripheral neuropathy seems not to be a major side effect. A longer follow-up and the study of more patients are needed to confirm the results.

AB  - Abstract Background The objective of this work was to determine the effect of both direct force feedback and visual force feedback on the amount of force applied to mitral valve tissue during ex vivo robotics-assisted mitral valve annuloplasty. Methods A force feedback-enabled master?slave surgical system was developed to provide both visual and direct force feedback during robotics-assisted cardiac surgery. This system measured the amount of force applied by novice and expert surgeons to cardiac tissue during ex vivo mitral valve annuloplasty repair. Results The addition of visual (2.16 ± 1.67), direct (1.62 ± 0.86), or both visual and direct force feedback (2.15 ± 1.08) resulted in lower mean maximum force applied to mitral valve tissue while suturing compared with no force feedback (3.34 ± 1.93 N; P < 0.05). Conclusions To achieve better control of interaction forces on cardiac tissue during robotics-assisted mitral valve annuloplasty suturing, force feedback may be required.

AB  - ABSTRACT The spectrum of pulmonary pathology in the Middle East is as versatile as its civilizations and cultures. In this review, we outline the key challenges confronting pulmonologists in the Middle East. We shed light on the diverse conditions commonly encountered in the region, from the centuries-old illnesses of tuberculosis, to contemporary problems such as lung complications from chemical warfare. We specifically highlighted unique aspects related to respiratory illnesses in the Middle East, for example, climate factors in the desert region, cultural habits, for example, water-pipe smoking and disorders unique to the region, such as Behçet's disease. Pulmonologists are also faced with the consequences of modernization, including large immigrant population and associated social and health issues, rising incidence of obesity and sleep apnoea, and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Tackling these health issues will require an integrated approach involving public health, primary care as well as specialist pulmonology input, taking into consideration the unique cultural and environmental factors to ensure effective management and compliance to medical care.

AB  - Abstract Procedures for 131I ablation in renal failure are not known. in one patient receiving dialysis, detailed dosimetry and health safety aspects were obtained. the results showed insignificant contamination of equipment, but a surprisingly significant reduction in biologic half-life of 131I due to efficient dialysis extraction. the data indicate that 131I ablation can be done safely and easily during dialysis but that much higher 131I doses must be used to achieve equivalent results to those obtained in patients with normal renal function.

AB  - We report a case of peripheral both demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy in a patient affected from intestinal aganglionosis with high dose intermittent metronidazole therapy. Intestinal aganglionosis is a myenteric plexus disorder with lack of innervation concerning the whole digestive tract from the rectum to the esophagus. The familial incidence of this condition seems to be high and a recessive autosomal transmission is likely. In the pathogenesis of this disorder aberrant neural crest migration seems to be implicated: indeed frequent neurologic signs resembling dysautonomic ones, deafness and rare peripheral demyelinating or axonal neuropathies are associated. The patient was a 12 years old female child affected by intestinal aganglionosis and underwent to chronic intermittent Metronidazole treatment, with daily doses of 500?mg for 15 day every month. She was admitted to our Hospital for inability to walk, dysesthesias and pain at lower limbs, acutely started and progressively worsening. At the admission neurological examination showed ataxic gait with bilateral foot drop, severe distal weakness, bilateral tibialis anterior muscle atrophy, absent deep tendon reflexes, rapidly worsening. CSF was normal. Antibodies against to peripheral nerve (antigangliosides, sulfatide, MAG, glycosaminoglycans) resulted negative. Spinal cord MRI revealed increased roots size and increased epidural space. EMG showed denervation spontaneous activity with neurogenic MUAP modification on distal muscles. Nerve conduction study showed severe slowing of motor velocity on right and left peroneal nerves with reduced amplitude of CMAP. Sensory conduction was mild slowing on both sural nerves with reduced amplitude of SAP. Metronidazole therapy was discontinued; desametazone, high dose vitamin and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was established in addition to rehydration and parenteral nutrition. Clinical conditions progressively improved and at two months follow up the girl was able to walk with mild ataxia. The authors emphasize in described case the difficulty to differentiate toxic or vitamin deficiency or autoimmune pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been used in various problem-solving areas such as financial forecasting, credit analysis and medical diagnosis. However, conventional CBR has the limitation that it has no criterion for choosing the nearest cases based on the probabilistic similarity of cases. It uses a fixed number of neighbors without considering an optimal number for each target case, so it does not guarantee optimal similar neighbors for various target cases. This leads to the weakness of lowering predictability due to deviation from desired similar neighbors. In this paper we suggest a new case extraction technique called statistical case-based reasoning. The main idea involves a dynamic adaptation of the optimal number of neighbors by considering the distribution of distances between potential similar neighbors for each target case. In order to do this, our technique finds the optimal distance threshold and selects similar neighbors satisfying the distance threshold criterion. We apply this new method to five real-life medical data sets and compare the results with those of the statistical method, logistic regression; we also compare the results with the learning methods C5.0, CART, neural networks and conventional CBR. The results of this paper show that the proposed technique outperforms those of many other methods, it overcomes the limitation of conventional CBR, and it provides improved classification accuracy.

AB  - Purpose To design and validate a radiofrequency (RF) array coil for cervical spinal cord imaging at 7T. Methods A 19-channel receive array with a four-channel transmit array was developed on a close-fitting coil former at 7T. Transmit efficiency and specific absorption rate were evaluated in a B1+ mapping study and an electromagnetic model. Receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise amplification for parallel imaging were evaluated and compared with a commercial 3T 19-channel head?neck array and a 7T four-channel spine array. The performance of the array was qualitatively demonstrated in human volunteers using high-resolution imaging (down to 300 ?m in-plane). Results The transmit and receive arrays showed good bench performance. The SNR was approximately 4.2-fold higher in the 7T receive array at the location of the cord with respect to the 3T coil. The g-factor results showed an additional acceleration was possible with the 7T array. In vivo imaging was feasible and showed high SNR and tissue contrast. Conclusion The highly parallel transmit and receive arrays were demonstrated to be fit for spinal cord imaging at 7T. The high sensitivity of the receive coil combined with ultra-high field will likely improve investigations of microstructure and tissue segmentation in the healthy and pathological spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract Background The medial sural artery perforator (MSAP) flap shows advantages for reconstruction in the foot and ankle, where bulk is a liability. We evaluated the versatility of this flap and provide further evidence on its use for covering small-to-moderate size defects by comparing the outcome depending on the region of reconstruction. Methods Twenty-two patients with variable defects of 4 ? 4 to 18 ? 7 cm underwent MSAP flap reconstruction. Final outcomes of all patients were evaluated 12-months postoperatively using the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot, midfoot and hallux scale for clinical-functional evaluation, and the SF-36 health survey for quality-of-life measurement. The scores were compared in three groups according to the anatomic region of MSAP flap reconstruction. Results The flap size ranged between 6 ? 4 and 21 ? 9 cm. One venous congestion was salvaged by venous thrombectomy and reanastomosis, and one marginal flap necrosis healed by secondary intention. All flaps survived, and all patients returned to ambulation. Patients with reconstruction of the ankle-hindfoot or hallux showed significantly lower AOFAS ankle-hindfoot (P?=?0.021) or hallux scores (P?=?0.034), whereas reconstruction of the midfoot led to equal AOFAS midfoot scores (P?=?0.265) as compared with patients without reconstruction in the respective region. Comparison of SF-36 physical (P?=?0.936) and mental (P?=?0.855) scores of all three regions remained insignificant. Conclusion The MSAP flap provides thin soft tissue coverage, enabling good functional recovery after defect reconstruction all around the foot and ankle, with evident advantages in the midfoot. However, the functional outcomes after reconstruction of the ankle-hindfoot or hallux region depend on the preexistent functional impairment.

AB  - Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy is probably the commonest form of vasculitic neuropathy in Mediterranean countries, as usually related to the widespread hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We describe the spectrum of manifestations in a large series of patients with cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, also analyzing the impact of comorbid factors, which are quite frequent in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia. The cohort included 60 patients (10 men, 50 women) with peripheral neuropathy associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia as main or sole cause (type 2 in 36 cases, type 3 in 4, not typized in 20), HCV-related in all patients but 8 (3 men and 5 women). Median age of patients was 65 years (range 41?85), and median age at onset of neuropathy was 59 (range 40?84). Peripheral neuropathy represented an onset manifestation of mixed cryoglobulinemia in about half patients. The most frequent clinical pattern was pure sensory neuropathy in 40 patients, including 4 patients with prominent ataxia; sensory neuropathy was asymmetrical in distribution in 9 patients, and in 14 patients sensory action potentials (SAPs) of the sural nerve were normal, suggesting selective involvement of the small sensory fibers. The remaining patients had sensorimotor neuropathy (15 cases) and mononeuropathy multiplex (5 cases). Positive sensory symptoms and restless legs syndrome were the most common manifestations. Neurophysiological study showed axonal degeneration of varying severity in all patients. In 20 patients, additional causes of neuropathy were present, including type 2 diabetes (5 patients), glucose intolerance (6 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3 patients), and alcohol (2 patients). With respect with this subset of patients, in ?pure? cryoglobulinemic neuropathy there was more often a pattern of sensory neuropathy (31/40 vs. 6/20; p?=?0.001), with more frequent asymmetrical distribution (9 vs 0; p?=?0.05) and small fiber involvement (11 vs 3). Severity of neuropathy, as judged on the basis of the Rankin scale and of neurophysiological changes, was similar in the two subgroups. Our study confirms that sensory neuropathy, often asymmetrical, is the most common clinical pattern in cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, and is consistently present in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy rather than in patients with other associated causes of neuropathy; in these latter, paradoxically, clinical and neurophysiological impairment seems not greater than in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.

AB  - Study aim: the Ebf gene family has been implicated in several developmental processes, ranging from B-cell development to neuronal differentiation. As the murine Ebf2 gene is expressed in numerous sites of nervous system, Ebf2-null mice develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to defective migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons, and a peripheral neuropathy as well. Therefore, we aimed to study whether electrophysiological tests would be able to detect abnormalities of peripheral nerve function. Methods: 2 groups of mice were studied, which consisted of 8 Ebf2-/- mice and 9 age-matched controls. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the ankle and at the ischiatic notch; the compound motor action potential (cMAP) was recorded from the paw muscles with a pair of needle electrodes to measure the motor conduction velocity (MCV). Results: MCV mean values were lower in Ebf2-/-(21.8?m/sec; SD 2.9) than in controls (35.2?m/sec; SD 2.6) and the difference was significant (p?<?0.001). The mean cMAP amplitude was also decreased in Ebf2-/-(6.2?mV; SD 2.7) as compared to controls (9.3?mV; SD 2.6, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: electrophysiological tests demonstrated a sharp decrease of sciatic MCV in Ebf2-/- mouse, as consequence of defective axon sorting, segmental dysmyelination and axonal damage revealed by pathological study.
