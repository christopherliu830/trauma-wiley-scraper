AB  - ABSTRACT Even though pancreas transplant numbers have steadily declined over the past decade, new listings increased in 2014 compared with the previous year, notably for pancreas transplant alone (PTA) and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant. The number of new PTAs also increased over the past two years. Whether this is a sustainable trend remains to be seen. Significant events in 2014 included implementation of a new pancreas allocation system and development of a proposed uniform definition of pancreas graft failure. Meanwhile, overall pancreas transplant rates and outcomes continued to improve. Substantial decline in pancreas after kidney transplants remains a serious concern. SRTR has not published pancreas graft failure data in the program-specific reports for the past two years. While this will not change in the near future, the acceptance of a uniform definition of graft failure is a crucial first step toward resuming graft failure reporting. Continued improvements and innovation, both surgical and immunological, will be critical to keep pancreas transplant as a viable option for treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes. As alternative therapies for diabetes such as islet transplant and artificial pancreas are evolving, improved outcomes with minimizations of complications are more important than ever.

AB  - Abstract Many positive trends in kidney transplantation were notable in 2017. Deceased donor kidney transplant rates and counts continued to rise, the kidney transplant waiting list declined for the third year in a row after decades of growth, and both short- and long-term allograft survival continued to improve year over year. In total, more than 220,000 patients were living in the United States with a functioning allograft. With 3 years of data available since implementation of the new kidney allocation system, better prediction of longer-term results of the allocation policy changes became possible. The data also reveal several areas in need of improvement and attention. Overall, the challenge of providing adequate access to kidney transplant persisted nationally, with additional dramatic regional variation. The proportion of living donor kidney transplants in both adults and children continued to fall, and racial disparities in living donor kidney transplant grew in the past decade.

AB  - Abstract In mammals, proper storage and distribution of lipids in and between tissues is essential for the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Here, we show that tumour growth triggers hepatic metabolic dysfunction as part of the cancer cachectic phenotype, particularly by reduced hepatic very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion and hypobetalipoproteinemia. As a molecular cachexia output pathway, hepatic levels of the transcription factor transforming growth factor beta 1-stimulated clone (TSC) 22 D4 were increased in cancer cachexia. Mimicking high cachectic levels of TSC22D4 in healthy livers led to the inhibition of hepatic VLDL release and lipogenic genes, and diminished systemic VLDL levels under both normal and high fat dietary conditions. Liver-specific ablation of TSC22D4 triggered hypertriglyceridemia through the induction of hepatic VLDL secretion. Furthermore, hepatic TSC22D4 expression levels were correlated with the degree of body weight loss and VLDL hypo-secretion in cancer cachexia, and TSC22D4 deficiency rescued tumour cell-induced metabolic dysfunction in hepatocytes. Therefore, hepatic TSC22D4 activity may represent a molecular rationale for peripheral energy deprivation in subjects with metabolic wasting diseases, including cancer cachexia.

AB  - Abstract Endothelial metabolism is a key regulator of angiogenesis. Glutamine metabolism in endothelial cells (ECs) has been poorly studied. We used genetic modifications and 13C tracing approaches to define glutamine metabolism in these cells. Glutamine supplies the majority of carbons in the tricyclic acid (TCA) cycle of ECs and contributes to lipid biosynthesis via reductive carboxylation. EC-specific deletion in mice of glutaminase, the initial enzyme in glutamine catabolism, markedly blunts angiogenesis. In cell culture, glutamine deprivation or inhibition of glutaminase prevents EC proliferation, but does not prevent cell migration, which relies instead on aerobic glycolysis. Without glutamine catabolism, there is near complete loss of TCA intermediates, with no compensation from glucose-derived anaplerosis. Mechanistically, addition of exogenous alpha-ketoglutarate replenishes TCA intermediates and rescues cellular growth, but simultaneously unveils a requirement for Rac1-dependent macropinocytosis to provide non-essential amino acids, including asparagine. Together, these data outline the dependence of ECs on glutamine for cataplerotic processes; the need for glutamine as a nitrogen source for generation of biomass; and the distinct roles of glucose and glutamine in EC biology.

AB  - Abstract This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the applications of microelectrodes to detect and monitor targeted analytes in bioelectrochemical processes. Notably, these processes are electrochemically driven reactions that involve the detection of targets from the biological realm. Wide-ranging applications of electrochemical sensors have been reported in the last few decades in various research fields, owing to favorable attributes such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid analysis, simplicity, easy fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Accordingly, in this Minireview, we explore recent advances in bioelectrochemistry based on small detection probes or structures modified for a variety of analytes, exploiting multi-approach advantages of enhanced electrochemical detection surface or targeted analyte pursuit. The target analytes included in this Minireview are neurotransmitters and disease biomarkers detected using enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrode modifications.

AB  - Identifying molecular loci of impaired cutaneous healing in diabetes with an eye towards developing targeted therapy to ameliorate dysrepair continues to evolve as a promising area of study. By using an excisional wound model produced on the dorsum of female diabetic C57BL/KsJ db?+?/db+ mice as well as their normal (WT)  2)Adnull vector; 3)PBS. Postoperatively, wounds were examined & photographed on Days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 & 28. Also, tissue was harvested for histology & immunohistochemistry (PECAM), and snap frozen for protein & RNA analysis. A scoring system was used to grade re-epithelialization, granulation tissue thickness, matrix density, inflammation, vascular density, epithelial maturity. AAV-VEGF exerted minimal effect on repair in WT and HZ mice. However, pronounced neovascularization, thickened granulation tissue & increased matrix deposition was noted after VEGF treatment in the db/db mice compared to those that received PBS or adnull vector at all timepoints. While the induction of angiogenesis in VEGF treated db/db mice lagged behind the unimpaired mice by 5?7 days, a global improvement in wound healng was observed.

AB  - Summary Ageing is usually characterised by a mild chronic proinflammatory state. Despite the tight association between both processes, the phenomenon has recently been termed inflammageing. Inflammation in the male reproductive tract is frequently linked with bacterial or virus infections but also with a broad range of noninfectious processes. Prostatitis, epididymitis and orchitis, among others, can lead to infertility. However, in spite of the inflammation theory of disease, chronic inflammation in male urogenital system does not always cause symptoms. With advancing age, inflammatory processes are commonly observed in the male reproductive tract. Nevertheless, the incidence of inflammation in reproductive organs and ducts varies greatly among elderly men. Inflammageing is considered a predictor of pathogenesis and the development of age-related diseases. This article briefly summarises the current state of knowledge on inflammageing in the male reproductive tract. Yet, the precise aetiology of inflammageing in the male urogenital system, and its potential contribution not only to infertility but most importantly to adverse health outcomes remains almost unknown. Thus, further investigations are required to elucidate the precise cross-links between inflammation and male reproductive senescence, and to establish the impact of anti-inflammatory drug treatments on elder men's general health status.

AB  - Objective?To investigate the acute effects of functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) on detrusor hyper-reflexia using a multi-pulse magnetic stimulator. Patients and methods?Seven male patients with established and intractable detrusor hyper-reflexia following spinal cord injury were studied. No patient was on medication and none had had previous surgery for detrusor hyper-reflexia. After optimization of magnetic stimulation of S2?S4 sacral anterior roots by recording toe flexor electromyograms, unstable detrusor activity was provoked during cystometry by rapid infusion of fluid into the bladder. The provocation test produced consistent and predictable detrusor hyper-reflexia. On some provocations, supramaximal FMS at 20 pulses/s for 5?s was applied at detrusor pressures which were >15?cmH20. Results?Following FMS there was an obvious acute suppression of detrusor hyper-reflexia. There was a profound reduction in detrusor contraction, as assessed by the area under the curves of detrusor pressure with time. Conclusions?Functional magnetic stimulation applied over the sacrum can profoundly suppress detrusor hyper-reflexia in man. It may provide a non-invasive method of assessing patients for implantable electrical neuromodulation devices and as a therapeutic option in its own right.

AB  - Abstract The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has been instrumental in supporting the development and implementation of systems of care to provide services to children and youth with serious mental health conditions and their families. Since 1993, 173 grants have been awarded to communities in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the District of Columbia, and 21 American Indian/Alaska Native communities. The system of care principles of creating comprehensive, individualized services, family-driven and youth-guided care and cultural and linguistic competence, supported by a well-trained and competent workforce, have been successful in transforming the field of children's mental health and facilitating the integration of child-serving systems. This approach has achieved positive outcomes at the child and family, practice and system levels, and numerous articles have been published using data collected from system of care communities, demonstrating the effectiveness of this framework. This article will describe lessons learned from implementing the system of care approach, and will discuss the importance of expanding and sustaining systems of care across the country.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a leading nosocomial pathogen, infecting a wide range of anatomic sites including the respiratory tract and the bloodstream. In addition to being multi-drug resistant, little is known about the molecular basis of A. baumannii pathogenesis. To better understand A. baumannii virulence, a combination of a transposon-sequencing (TraDIS) screen and the neutropenic mouse model of bacteremia was used to identify the full set of fitness genes required during bloodstream infection. The lytic transglycosylase MltB was identified as a critical fitness factor. MltB cleaves the MurNAc-GlcNAc bond of peptidoglycan, which leads to cell wall remodeling. Here we show that MltB is part of a complex network connecting resistance to stresses, membrane homeostasis, biogenesis of pili and in vivo fitness. Indeed, inactivation of mltB not only impaired resistance to serum complement, cationic antimicrobial peptides and oxygen species, but also altered the cell envelope integrity, activated the envelope stress response, drastically reduced the number of pili at the cell surface and finally, significantly decreased colonization of both the bloodstream and the respiratory tract.
