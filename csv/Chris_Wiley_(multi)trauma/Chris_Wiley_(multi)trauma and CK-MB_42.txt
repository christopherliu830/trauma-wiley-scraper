AB  - Introduction? Upper blepharoplasty is performed in order to correct age-related upper lid changes including dermatochalasis and irregular contours due to bulging post-septal fat pads. Additionally, upper lid ptosis can be repaired in an anterior approach through the blepharoplasty incisions when indicated. These procedures are gratifying and have relatively low associated morbidity. Methods/Techniques? Pre-operative assessment includes observation of excess upper eyelid skin, bulging fat pads, lid position, and location of the suprataral crease. Most excess skin is located centrally and laterally. The most common bulging fat pad is the nasal fat pad, however the central fat pad also frequently requires excision. If a combination of procedures is being preformed, upper blepharoplsty follows browlifts and facelifts but precedes lower lid blepharoplasty. Surgical markings are made with the patient prone, under general anesthesia. Local anesthesia is also administered for hemostasis. The lower location of the incision is marked 8?10?mm above the lid margin centrally and 6?mm above the lateral canthus. The upper incision is identified by assessing the amount of excess skin by pinch testing. The upper incision is marked and calipers are used to confirm at least 10?mm of skin will still be present between the upper incision and the lower border of the eyebrow at the mid pupil location. A scalpel is used to make the incisions. A Bovie is used to cut through the orbicularis oculi muscle on cutting current. Westcott scissors are used to excise the skin and muscle. Hemostasis is acheived Gentle pressure is applied to the globe to reveal the excess nasal fat pad. The septum is opened focally and the excess portion of the fat pad is excised using coagulation current with the bovie. The central fat pad is reduced if needed. If ptosis exists, it is repaired using a tarso-levator advancement technique. Often in cases of senile acquired ptosis, a high supratarsal fold exists. While the ptosis repair will partially resolve this cosmetic deformity, the septum is opened and the central fat pad is freed and advanced to further fill the sulcus. A supratarsal fixation stitch using 6-O vicryl is placed in a mid pupil location to prevent postoperative ptosis. The wound is then closed with 6-O nylon using interrupted sutures lateral to the lateral canthus and running sutures medial to the canthus. Results? 527 patients underwent upper blepharoplasty with the technique described over a 12 year period. 10% underwent ptosis repair at the same time and all other patients underwent supratarsal fixation. 90% were satisfied satisfied with there procedure. Acute re-operation for bleeding occurred in less than 1% of patients. The most common acute complication was chemosis occurring in 12% of patients which was far more likely to occur if a upper blepharoplasty was performed in conjunction with lower lid blepharoplasty. All cases of chemosis resolved with non-surgical management including liberal use of ointment and taping the lid shut, and occasionally incision and drainage of the chemosis. The most common indication for re-operation was residual excess skin. Conclusion? Upper lid blepharoplasty is a very gratifying procedure whether preformed alone or in conjunction other procedures for facial rejuvenation. Complications are infrequent and generally minor. Satisfaction is generally very high. The open sky technique was used which includes removal of the skin, muscle, and septal flap with conservative fat removal.

AB  - Combined expander/implants are designed to allow single stage breast reconstruction. This study was designed to assess whether single stage reconstruction is achieved using these devices. A retrospective study was performed of 88 consecutive patients undergoing breast reconstruction with implants at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital over a six year period. A small subset of patients had reconstruction with combined expander/implants. These cases were reviewed to determine the overall explantation rate. A total of nine patients (13 implants) had reconstruction with combined expander/implants (Mentor Becker or Mcghan 150). 10 out of 13 implants were removed at subsequent operations. 2 (15%) were explanted due to infection. 8(62%) were removed for aesthetic reasons including asymmetry, poor shape or poor projection. All were replaced with permanent textured gel implants. The results of this study suggest that in the majority of cases single stage reconstruction is not achieved using these devices. This is in contrast to the results from two recently published studies using these devices. (1,2)

AB  - Abstract Clinical criteria for the classification of symptomatic idiopathic (primary) osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands were developed from data collected in a multi-center study. Patients with OA were compared with a group of patients who had hand symptoms from other causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and the spondylar-thropathies. Variables from the medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiographs were analyzed. All patients had pain, aching, or stiffness in the hands. Patients were classified as having clinical OA if on examination there was hard tissue enlargement involving at least 2 of 10 selected joints, swelling of fewer than 3 metacarpophalangeal joints, and hard tissue enlargement of at least 2 distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. If the patient had fewer than 2 enlarged DIP joints, then deformity of at least 1 of the 10 selected joints was necessary in order to classify the symptoms as being due to OA. The 10 selected joints were the second and third DIP, the second and third proximal interphalangeal, and the trapeziometacarpal (base of the thumb) joints of both hands. Criteria derived using the ?classification tree? method were 92% sensitive and 98% specific. The ?traditional format? classification method required that at least 3 of these 4 criteria be present to classify a patient as having OA of the hand. The latter sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 87%. Radiography was of less value than clinical examination in the classification of symptomatic OA of the hands.

AB  - Abstract Limb/digit amputation is a common event in humans caused by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. Although the loss of a digit is not lethal, it affects quality of life and imposes high costs on amputees. In recent years, the increasing interest in limb regeneration has led to enhanced scientific knowledge. However, the limited ability to develop functional limb regeneration in the clinical setting suggests that a challenging issue remains in limb regeneration. Recently, the emergence of regenerative engineering is a promising field to address this challenge and close the gap between science and clinical applications. Cell signalling and molecular mechanisms involved in the limb regeneration process have been extensively studied; however, there is still insufficient data on cell therapy and tissue engineering for limb regeneration. In this review, we intend to focus on therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration that are closely related to gene, immune, and stem cell therapies, as well as tissue engineering approaches that take into consideration the peculiar developmental properties of the limbs. In addition, we attempt to identify the challenges of these strategies for limb regeneration studies in terms of clinical settings and as a road map to accomplish the goal of functional human limb regeneration.

AB  - Transaxillary endoscopic breast augmentation is a very attractive option for women who desire increased mammary volume and projection but do not want a scar on their breasts. For primary augmentations, the procedure offers advantages over the traditional blunt axillary technique due to direct visualization and precise pectoralis muscle dissection and hemostatis. While the technique has been performed for submuscular and subglandular placement, the procedure has been most commonly used over the past decade with saline implants in the submuscular position. Smooth and textured silicone implants can also be used via transaxillary access into a subpectoral location. The results have been satisfactory with improved placement and a reduction incomplications associated with traditional transaxillary augmentation including hematoma, capsular contracture and implants which are positioned too high. Methods? Transaxillary endoscopic breast augmentation was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in a prone position with arms are abducted to ninty degrees. Local anesthesia with epinephrine was injected into the axillary incision and in the soft tissue overlying the anterior axillary fold for hemostasis. A 2?3?cm incision (4?5?cm when silicone implants are used) was placed in the axilla in one of the natural folds within the hair-baring zone. Dissection was carried out infero-medially until the lateral edge of the pectoralis major was identified. Under direct visualizaion, the pectoralis fascia was divided with scissors and the subpectoral space entered. The subpectoral pocket was initially created bluntly with an Agris Dingman retractor to create a bloodless optical cavity without avulsing any muscle. The endoscope and retractor were inserted and the undersurface of the pectoralis muscle was divided with the Bovie electrocautery. The infero-medial quadrant of pectoralis muscle was partially released from the chest wall. The prepectoral fascia, however was preserved to prevent synmastia, inferior implant migration and palpability. Pocket irrigation and hemostasis were performed. When saline implants were used, the device was rolled, inserted and inflated to the desired volume. When silicone devices were used, the tunnel was bluntly widened with Ashe forceps. A marcaine pain pump can be placed in the pocket for postoperative pain control. Results? Over 12 years 384 primary breast augmentations have been performed using this method by the senior author. Over 90% of the implants were Mentor smooth round saline implants. The average patient age was 30. High or excellent levels of patient and surgeon satisfaction was present in over 95%. Complications requiring re-operation were present in less than 2% of patients. The rate of long-term revision was capsular contracture in 5%. The most common cause of revision was asymmetry or desire to be larger. Conclusions? Transaxillary Endoscopic breast augmentation is an attractive option for the primary breast augmentation patient which avoids placement of a scar directly on the breast. The advantages are for patients with no ptosis or inframammary fold within which to hide the scar or breasts with a small areolar diameter. Additional advantages include controlled and precise surgical dissection and hemostatis which have reduced the complications associated with traditional blunt transaxillary techniques. Potential disadvantages may include the need for a second inframammary scar if reoperative surgery is required, theoretical interference with sentinel lymph node dissection if required in the future, and the additional technical equipment required to perform the procedure.

AB  - Introduction The impact of cervical pathology on performance is of great importance to the equine industry. Accurate diagnosis of cervical disease with imaging modalities, including CT and MRI, requires thorough appreciation of normal cervical anatomy. The objectives of this study were to describe in detail the 3-dimensional anatomy of the equine cervical spine by comparing anatomical sections with corresponding MR and contrast-enhanced CT images in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and to determine the ability of MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging to visualize anatomical structures in the cervical spine. Methods Three cervical spines of young adults (3?8 years), were collected immediately after humane euthanasia. The spine was stabilized on a frame in a natural flexed position with an angle of 20-degrees. MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed within 6 hours after euthanasia. Anatomical sections of 1?cm were made in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and compared with corresponding CT and MR images. The intervertebral disk thickness, facet joint angle, amount of cerebrospinal fluid and amount of synovial fluid within each facet joint were quantified. Results The anatomical locations of clinically important structures including the facet joints, spinal cord, cervical nerve roots and intervertebral disks were reliably identified in the anatomical sections and their corresponding MR images. Contrast-enhanced CT images depicted all osseous borders; MR images were superior for soft tissue structures. Conclusions This study enhances the understanding of normal cervical spine anatomy and the diagnostic usefulness of cervical MRI and contrast-enhanced CT in the horse. Ethical animal research This study was approved by the animal care and use committee of the Mississippi State University, MS, USA. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?Office of Graduate Research and the Department of Clinical Sciences of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State University. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract Many positive trends in kidney transplantation were notable in 2017. Deceased donor kidney transplant rates and counts continued to rise, the kidney transplant waiting list declined for the third year in a row after decades of growth, and both short- and long-term allograft survival continued to improve year over year. In total, more than 220,000 patients were living in the United States with a functioning allograft. With 3 years of data available since implementation of the new kidney allocation system, better prediction of longer-term results of the allocation policy changes became possible. The data also reveal several areas in need of improvement and attention. Overall, the challenge of providing adequate access to kidney transplant persisted nationally, with additional dramatic regional variation. The proportion of living donor kidney transplants in both adults and children continued to fall, and racial disparities in living donor kidney transplant grew in the past decade.

AB  - Abstract Ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and come in a variety of forms, from single premature ventricular complexes to sustained ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Rapid developments have taken place over the past decade in our understanding of these arrhythmias and in our ability to diagnose and treat them. The field of catheter ablation has progressed with the development of new methods and tools, and with the publication of large clinical trials. Therefore, global cardiac electrophysiology professional societies undertook to outline recommendations and best practices for these procedures in a document that will update and replace the 2009 EHRA/HRS Expert Consensus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias. An expert writing group, after reviewing and discussing the literature, including a systematic review and meta-analysis published in conjunction with this document, and drawing on their own experience, drafted and voted on recommendations and summarized current knowledge and practice in the field. Each recommendation is presented in knowledge byte format and is accompanied by supportive text and references. Further sections provide a practical synopsis of the various techniques and of the specific ventricular arrhythmia sites and substrates encountered in the electrophysiology lab. The purpose of this document is to help electrophysiologists around the world to appropriately select patients for catheter ablation, to perform procedures in a safe and efficacious manner, and to provide follow-up and adjunctive care in order to obtain the best possible outcomes for patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

AB  - The tuberous breast deformity is an uncommon congenital breast anomaly which affects young women unilaterally or bilaterally. It is associated with usually a constriction in the lower pole of the breast as a result of the constricting fibrous ring with hypoplasia of the breast gland and pseudo-herniation of breast tissue into an enlarged areola. Several methods have been suggested to correct this deformity. A retrospective analysis has been undertaken of six consecutive patients with tuberous breast deformity using a dual plane breast augmentation via an inferior peri-areolar approach creating a dual plane pocket and using Marionette sutures to control the lower pectoralis major edge. Surgical release of the constricting lower pole glandular tissue was undertaken with excellent aesthetic results. Either immediate or delayed areolar reduction was carried out if required. Results show excellent expansion of the lower pole with good soft tissue coverage of the implant by the pectoralis major in the supero-medial aspect of the breast. The dual plane pocket combined with lower pole release assists lower pole expansion in a one stage procedure without requiring two stage tissue expansion. The results have been uniformly acceptable and compare favourably with those presented in the literature where other methods were used. The dual plane breast augmentation technique is a simple and reliable way to treat tuberous breast deformity.

AB  - Abstract It is recognised that the commonest organic cause for impotence is diabetes. It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.

AB  - Abstract Answer questions and earn CME/CNE To update the melanoma staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) a large database was assembled comprising >46,000 patients from 10 centers worldwide with stages I, II, and III melanoma diagnosed since 1998. Based on analyses of this new database, the existing seventh edition AJCC stage IV database, and contemporary clinical trial data, the AJCC Melanoma Expert Panel introduced several important changes to the Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis (TNM) classification and stage grouping criteria. Key changes in the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual include: 1) tumor thickness measurements to be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm, not 0.01 mm; 2) definitions of T1a and T1b are revised (T1a, <0.8 mm without ulceration; T1b, 0.8-1.0 mm with or without ulceration or <0.8 mm with ulceration), with mitotic rate no longer a T category criterion; 3) pathological (but not clinical) stage IA is revised to include T1b N0 M0 (formerly pathologic stage IB); 4) the N category descriptors ?microscopic? and ?macroscopic? for regional node metastasis are redefined as ?clinically occult? and ?clinically apparent?; 5) prognostic stage III groupings are based on N category criteria and T category criteria (ie, primary tumor thickness and ulceration) and increased from 3 to 4 subgroups (stages IIIA-IIID); 6) definitions of N subcategories are revised, with the presence of microsatellites, satellites, or in-transit metastases now categorized as N1c, N2c, or N3c based on the number of tumor-involved regional lymph nodes, if any; 7) descriptors are added to each M1 subcategory designation for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (LDH elevation no longer upstages to M1c); and 8) a new M1d designation is added for central nervous system metastases. This evidence-based revision of the AJCC melanoma staging system will guide patient treatment, provide better prognostic estimates, and refine stratification of patients entering clinical trials.

AB  - Introduction? Facial nerve paralysis can be a disabling condition functionally, psychologically and aesthetically. When there has been an acquired proximal injury to the facial nerve in the presence of previously functional facial musculature, such as in acoustic neuroma surgery, neurotisation of the distal facial nerve is an appropriate choice of management. The hypoglossal nerve is most commonly used. However this is not without its limitations, notably subsequent hemilingual atrophy and facial synkinesis. We present an alternative technique of facial reinnervation utilising a motor branch of the trigeminal nerve, the nerve to masseter. We believe this technique has the potential to overcome problems encountered with use of other extra-facial nerves. Methods? Three patients with acquired facial nerve palsy following tumour resection underwent transfer of the ipsilateral masseteric nerve to facial nerve. In two patients the nerve was directly coapted to the trunk of the facial nerve while the third patient had transfer to the buccal branch. Results? By twelve months postoperatively all three patients demonstrated significant improvement in facial muscle tone and symmetry at rest. All patients were able to produce a symmetrical smile with minimal synkinesis. Two of the three patients also had evidence of occasional spontaneous movements. Conclusion? Use of the ipsilateral motor nerve to masseter offers an alternative technique for neurotisation of the facial nerve. The advantages of this technique include ease of dissection, constant and reliable anatomy, powerful innervation of the facial muscles, minimal donor site morbidity and the potential for return of spontaneous facial movements.
