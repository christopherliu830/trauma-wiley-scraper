AB  - Reasons for performing study Commingling of horses from various populations, together with stress associated with transport and confinement at a sales complex, may predispose horses to EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Current information on the prevalence and associated risk factors of EHV-1 and -4 in South Africa is limited. Relevant research could enhance scientific-based risk management strategies for horses attending sales events. Objectives Detect nasal shedding of EHV-1 and -4 at a sales event. Identify the temporal pattern of viral shedding. Investigate the association between clinical signs and EHV-1 and -4 shedding. Identify risk factors for EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Data was collected over a 9 day period during August 2013 at the National Two Year Old Sales in Germiston, South Africa. The study population included 90 Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) in their second year of life that originated from 8 studs situated in 3 provinces. Nasal swabs were collected from each horse on arrival and on departure from the event. During their stay horses were monitored twice daily for pyrexia and once daily for nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected daily from any horse with nasal discharge and/or pyrexia. Nasal swabs were submitted for qPCR to detect EHV-1 and -4. Results No EHV-1 shedding was detected; however, 14.4% of the population shed EHV-4. A biphasic shedding pattern with peaks one day post arrival and on the first day of auction was observed. Pyrexia, with or without nasal discharge, was observed prior to first shedding in 61.5% of EHV-4-positive horses. Province, associated longer travel duration and smaller resident horse populations on farms of origin were associated with increased risk of EHV-4 shedding. Conclusions Young Thoroughbreds consigned to a South African sale shed EHV-4. Pyrexia proved useful to identify impending EHV-4 shedding. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of the University of Pretoria (Study V040-13). Informed, written consent for participation was obtained from the owners of each of the studs included in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) can be troublesome, but early recognition and knowledge of risk factors are primordial for prevention and control. Objectives 1) Improvement of early clinical recognition, and 2) identification of factors potentially of importance for spread. Study design Retrospective descriptive study of EHM cases and statistical comparison to acutely neurologically affected horses negative for EHM. Methods Files from a French epidemiosurveillance programme for equine infectious neurological diseases (2008?2011) were reviewed. Cases were considered EHM (n?=?26) based on presence of acute neurological signs and laboratory confirmation. Cases were considered control cases (n?=?29) when reported to be suffering from acute neurological diseases, but negative for EHM. A subgroup of controls was created that excluded cases with peripheral neuromuscular diseases (n?=?21). Univariate and multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree analysis between groups were performed to identify diagnostic markers and risk factors. Results EHM had a fatality rate of 46% and occurred often in isolated cases. They frequently showed ataxia, paresis and cauda equina affection, but the clinical picture was variable. Univariate analysis identified the following variables as more associated to EHM than to control groups: new horse introduced in herd, vaccination, cauda equina affection, larger herd size, and saddle horses. In the multivariate analysis, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection could be retained. CART analyses identified herd size, month of occurrence, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection as main predictors for EHM. Conclusions Isolated EHM cases occur frequently, accentuating the diagnostic difficulty. History and clinical examination of acutely neurologically affected horses can potentially improve early recognition of EHM. Risk factors were in accordance with other studies, although in a different geographic location and study setup, and therefore strengthen their importance for spread of EHM.

AB  - Abstract Ethnic differences and geographic variations affect the frequencies and nature of human mutations. In the literature, descriptions of causative mutations of eye diseases in the Chinese population are few. In this paper we attempt to reveal molecular information on genetic eye diseases involving Chinese patients from published and unpublished works by us and other groups. Our studies on candidate genes of eye diseases in the Chinese population in Hong Kong include MYOC and TISR for primary open angle glaucoma, RHO and RP1 for retinitis pigmentosa, ABCA4 and APOE for age-related macular degeneration, RB1 for retinoblastoma, APC for familial adenomatous polyposis with congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium, BIGH3/TGFBI for corneal dystrophies, PAX6 for aniridia and Reiger syndrome, CRYAA and CRYBB2 for cataracts, and mtDNA for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. We have revealed novel mutations in most of these genes, and in RHO, RP1, RB1, BIGH3, and PAX6 we have reported mutations that contribute to better understanding of the functions and properties of the respective gene products. We showed absence of MYOC does not necessarily cause glaucoma. No disease causative mutations have been identified in MYOC or ABCA4. There are similarities in the patterns of sequence alterations and phenotype?genotype associations in comparison with other ethnic groups, while the MYOC, RB1, APC, and PAX6 genes have more Chinese-specific sequence alterations. Establishment of a mutation database specific for the Chinese is essential for identification of genetic markers with diagnostic, prognostic, or pharmacological values.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Standing magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is commonly used to evaluate the distal aspect of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of lame horses. There is paucity of information comparing interobserver agreement of this imaging modality. Objectives To determine the interobserver agreement for assessment of the DDFT on sMRI using a newly developed grading system. It was hypothesised that different lesion types would be more frequently observed at different anatomical locations of the DDFT, and that interobserver agreement would be better for the presence of a lesion compared to lesion grading. Study design A retrospective study assessing interobserver agreement. Methods sMRI studies of 40 equine front feet were retrospectively graded by 2 observer teams using a newly developed grading system based on previous studies. Individual DDFT parameters and an overall DDFT grade were scored. A Pearson's Chi-square test quantified the association between anatomical location and lesion type and interobserver agreement was quantified by calculating weighted-kappa statistic. Results Observer team B found a statistically significant association between anatomical location and lesion type but observer team A did not. Interobserver agreement was fair to moderate for the majority of individual DDFT parameters. For most parameters, better interobserver agreement was found for presence of a lesion than for lesion grading. Interobserver agreement was fair for the overall DDFT grade. Conclusions Interobserver agreement was acceptable for overall DDFT grade and was better for the presence of an overall grade. Interobserver agreement was also acceptable for most DDFT parameters and was better for assessing whether a lesion was present compared to the grading of lesions. This study highlights the value of a standardised grading system for assessing the DDFT on sMRI, and provides a method to improve the repeatibilty and reliability of future studies using sMRI.

AB  - Abstract Background Incorporation of bone substitute material into the extraction socket could minimize the edentulous ridge volume loss or maximize the bone formation within the healing area. Purpose The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness in maintaining the volumetric contour of fresh extraction sockets grafted with or without 2 types of porcine biomaterials and covered with a resorbable barrier. Materials and Methods In the present multi-center single-blind randomized control trial, 55 patients underwent 1-tooth extraction, were surveyed, and randomly allocated to control- (25 sites, nat-group) or test groups (15 sites grafted with pre-hydrated collagenated cortico-cancellous porcine bone, coll-group, and 15 with cortical porcine bone, cort-group). Before extraction, and then 4 months later, contours of the sockets were acquired through a laser scanner, voxelized, and ghosts of each patient were superimposed with a matrix laboratory. Volumetric and area evaluations of the virtual superimposed models were performed with dentascan tools to create a volume of interest extending between the 2 residual teeth. Intra- and inter-group comparisons of the outcomes were performed. Non-parametric tests were applied with a level of significance set at P?<?.05. Results Intergroup analysis at 4 months' survey revealed that percentage loss of alveolar ridge volume of the coll-group (28.8%?±?8.8%) and of the cort-group (30.2%?±?7.1%) was significantly lower (P?<?.0001) than that of the naturally-healing group (46.4%?±?4.1%). No statistically-significant differences in outcomes were observed between the 2 test groups at any of the observation periods. Moreover, tooth position (bicuspids vs molars) seemed to affect neither volume loss nor basal shrinkage. Conclusion At the 4-month analysis both test groups showed reduced bone loss when compared to naturally healing sockets. However, the 2 grafting materials were not able to preserve the alveolar crest, and a reduction close to 30% in the estimates was registered after healing.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes mellitus, causing severe and prolonged morbidity. However, clinical and experimental studies have reported that careful glucose control may prevent, stabilize, and/or reverse neuropathy and other chronic diabetic complications. Unfortunately, insulin therapy does not prevent the development or progression of chronic lesions in the vessels, kidneys, eyes, or nerves of the diabetic patient. There is great interest in investigating other forms of endocrine replacement therapy, such as transplantation of the pancreas or of the islets of Langerhans (IT). Diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) evolution is characterized by progressive demyelination and axonal loss and is manifested by signs and symptoms on physical examination and abnormalities in nerve conduction studies (NCS). NCS provide reliable, noninvasive, objective measures of peripheral nerve function and constitute the most important technique for the evaluation of the severity of DP in clinical trials. Several research groups have demonstrated that skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is another method minimally invasive and repeatable that provides direct pathologic evidence of axonal damage in diabetic neuropathy. Fifty-one consecutive IDDM patients with or without end stage renal disease were enrolled at the moment of islet (Is), kidney (KD), kidney-pancreas (KP) or kidney-islet (KI) transplantation. Patients underwent skin biopsy punch, neurologic examination and neurophysiological investigation. Particularly, 20?pts underwent KP tx, 16?KD tx, 10 islet tx and 5 KI. The patients were comparable for duration of diabetes, dialysis (when present), age, lipid profile. In half of the patients a follow-up of 2 years has been reached. After KP tx, and partially with KI, a complete normalization of glycometabolic control has been achieved, with statistically lower HbA1c in comparison with KD group (KP?=?6.2; 0.1% vs. KD?=?8.4; 0.5%; p?<?0.01). In the KI/Is group, a long-term restoration of islet endocrine function has been achieved, with insulin independence. When this has been lost, a persistent secretion of C-peptide was shown for a long period of time. This was correlated with a global improvement quality of life and vascular structure. Preliminary results will be presented.

AB  - Abstract We sought to determine temporal changes in COD and identify COD-specific risk factors in pediatric primary HTx recipients. Using the ISHLT registry, time-dependent hazard of death after pediatric HTx, stratified by COD, was analyzed by multiphasic parametric hazard modeling with multivariable regression models for risk factor analysis. The proportion of pediatric HTx deaths from each of cardiovascular cause, allograft vasculopathy, and malignancy increased over time, while all other COD decreased post-HTx. Pre-HTx ECMO was associated with increased risk of death from graft failure (HR 2.43; p < 0.001), infection (HR 2.85; p < 0.001), and MOF (HR 2.22; p = 0.001), while post-HTx ECMO was associated with death from cerebrovascular events/bleed (HR 2.55; p = 0.001). CHD was associated with deaths due to pulmonary causes (HR 1.78; p = 0.007) or infection (HR 1.72; p < 0.001). Non-adherence was a significant risk factor for all cardiac COD, notably graft failure (HR 1.66; p = 0.001) and rejection (HR 1.89; p < 0.001). Risk factors related to specific COD are varied across different temporal phases post-HTx. Increased understanding of these factors will assist in risk stratification, guide anticipatory clinical decisions, and potentially improve patient survival.

AB  - It is well known that exposure to toxic substances may induce peripheral and central neurological complications but no cases of acute cranial nerve involvement are reported after single, although massive, exposure to toxic agents. Cranial multineuropathy is an uncommon occurrence. We observed two atypical cases of multinevritis of cranial nerves with mild sensory symptoms at limbs. Both patients had many common features: acute onset, occurrence of neuropraxic block in cranial nerves, and rapid clinical and neurophysiological recovery after corticosteroid therapy. In both cases, the strict time correlation between substance inhalation and acute onset of symptoms suggested a toxic origin of the disease. We emphasize that multinevritis of cranial nerves could be related to acute exposure of toxic substances. Missing this diagnosis could lead to a delay in treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interferon is regarded as a promising treatment option for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. However, sporadic cases of axonal PNP and one case of CIDP after treatment with Interferon (INF) alfa-2a were reported. The objective of this study was to test the onset of PNP in patients affected by relapsing-remitting MS after treatment with INF beta-1b. METHODS: from the OPTIMS trial we have selected 23 patients (9 males, 14 females; mean age 30.5; range 22?50) with diagnosis of relapsing-remitting SM in treatment with INF beta-1b (8?12.000.000 UI). In these patients bilateral motor nerve conduction study (NCS) of peroneal, tibial, median, ulnar nerves and antidromic sensory NCS of sural, median and ulnar nerves were performed according standard techniques. All patients (23/23) were submitted to neurophysiological tests before the treatment (T0), 16/23 (7 drop out) after six months (T1) and after nine months of therapy (T2). RESULTS: at T0 no patient showed electrophysiological signs indicating PNP; after six and nine months of therapy (T1 and T2) no patient submitted to NCS showed alterations in the PNS either. CONCLUSIONS: all tested patients showed absence of electrophysiological signs of PNP as side effects after one year of treatment with high dose of INF beta-1b.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To determine the effect of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) base of tongue (BOT) reduction on sleep-related outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Data Sources PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Ovid. Review Methods Literature search by two independent authors was conducted using the abovementioned databases. Studies on TORS BOT reduction as part of OSA treatment in adult patients with pre- and postoperative apnea?hypopnea index (AHI) scores were included. Studies on TORS as treatment for diseases other than OSA were excluded. Results A total of six articles with 353 patients treated with TORS BOT reduction met inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses (baseline vs. postsurgery) showed significant improvement in the following: AHI (44.3 ± 22.4 to 17.8 ± 16.5, P < .01), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (12.9 ± 5.4 to 5.8 ± 3.7, P < .01), lowest oxygen saturation (79.0 ± 9.5 to 84.1 ± 6.5, P < .01), and snoring visual analog scale (9.3 ± 0.8 to 2.4 ± 2.43, P < .01). Surgical success rate, defined as a >50% reduction of AHI with a postoperative AHI < 20, was 68.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63.0%-73.5%). Cure rate (postoperative AHI < 5) was 23.8% (95% CI = 19.1%-29.2%). Conclusions TORS BOT reduction decreases AHI and symptoms of sleepiness in adult patients with OSA. It is considered successful in a majority of cases; however, further studies must be performed to optimize patient selection criteria to achieve higher rates of success.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare two methods of measuring physical function in subjects with a broad range of abilities and to evaluate the effects of cognitive, social, educational, and age factors on the relationship between the two methods. DESIGN: Multiple regression analysis was used to compare self-perceived (dependent variables) with performance measures (independent variables). Covariates included age, gender, Mini-Mental State Exam score, education, living status, and depression score. SETTING: Five community-dwelling and two nursing home sites. PARTICIPANTS: 417 community-dwelling subjects and 200 nursing home residents aged 62?98 years. MEASUREMENTS: Self-perceived physical function was assessed with the physical dimension summary score of the Sickness Impact Profile, which comprises three subscales: ambulation, mobility, and body care and movement. Physical performance was evaluated by self-selected gait speed, chairstand time, maximal grip strength, and a balance score. RESULTS: Nursing home residents and community-dwellers were significantly different (P < .0001) in all variables except age and gender. Self-perceived and performance-based measures were moderately correlated, with a range from r = ?.194 to r = ?.625 (P < .05). Gait speed was the strongest independent predictor of self-perceived physical function in both groups. Symptoms of depression were also an independent predictor of self-perceived function in nursing home residents; subjects who had such symptoms report more self-perceived dysfunction than would be predicted based on performance tests. CONCLUSIONS: Self-selected gait speed is a global indicator of self-perceived physical function over a broad range of abilities. External determinants (depressive symptoms, cognitive function, marital status, etc.) affect self-perceived function in both groups, but gait speed is the greatest single predictor of self-perceived function. In nursing home residents depressive symptomatology is related to self-perceived function, but gait speed is not.

AB  - ABSTRACT? Numbers of pancreas transplants have been decreasing over the past decade, but outcomes continue to improve for all types: simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant, pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK), and pancreas transplant alone (PTA). The most notable decrease occurred for PAK transplants, possibly due in part to decreases in numbers of living donor kidney transplants. The number of new candidates on the pancreas transplant waiting list has decreased steadily since 2000; only 1005 active candidates were added in 2011. Transplant rates for all pancreas transplant types reached a low in 2011 of 34.9 transplants per 100 wait-list years. Deceased donation rates have also been decreasing since 2005, but use of donation after circulatory death has been gradually increasing. The discard rate in 2011 was 27.7%, and higher for pancreata recovered from older donors. Improved outcomes during the early posttransplant period largely reflect improved donor and recipient selection and improved technical strategies. Inconsistent definitions of graft failure across reporting centers creates an ongoing challenge in the interpretation of outcome data for pancreas transplants. Rates of posttransplant re-hospitalization are high, most occurring in the first 6 months. Rejection rates are highest for PTA recipients, who also experience higher incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Abstract Background: Saphenous vein graft (SVG) intervention is associated with a significant incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) related to distal vessel embolization. The FilterWire? distal embolic protection device has recently been approved as an adjunct to SVG intervention. We report here our initial experience in a single center in 30 consecutive patients using this device in SVG stenting. Hypothesis: This study examined the outcomes and complications associated with these devices, as well as whether proficiency with the devices increased with greater experience and whether there were measurable outcome differences between devices. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients in whom a FilterWire device was placed at our hospital between June 2001 and June 2004. Results: The device was successfully deployed in 29 of 30 patients, and all patients were stented successfully. Overall MACE rate was 6.6%, consistent with reports in larger multi-center clinical trials. Transient decreases in flow were noted while the device was in place in six patients, but improved in five patients with device removal. Conclusions: This early experience in a single center using FilterWire embolic protection indicates that excellent clinical results can be obtained by the adoption of filter protection for SVG intervention, without evidence for a detrimental learning curve.
