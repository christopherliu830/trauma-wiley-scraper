AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To determine the effect of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) base of tongue (BOT) reduction on sleep-related outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Data Sources PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Ovid. Review Methods Literature search by two independent authors was conducted using the abovementioned databases. Studies on TORS BOT reduction as part of OSA treatment in adult patients with pre- and postoperative apnea?hypopnea index (AHI) scores were included. Studies on TORS as treatment for diseases other than OSA were excluded. Results A total of six articles with 353 patients treated with TORS BOT reduction met inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses (baseline vs. postsurgery) showed significant improvement in the following: AHI (44.3 ± 22.4 to 17.8 ± 16.5, P < .01), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (12.9 ± 5.4 to 5.8 ± 3.7, P < .01), lowest oxygen saturation (79.0 ± 9.5 to 84.1 ± 6.5, P < .01), and snoring visual analog scale (9.3 ± 0.8 to 2.4 ± 2.43, P < .01). Surgical success rate, defined as a >50% reduction of AHI with a postoperative AHI < 20, was 68.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63.0%-73.5%). Cure rate (postoperative AHI < 5) was 23.8% (95% CI = 19.1%-29.2%). Conclusions TORS BOT reduction decreases AHI and symptoms of sleepiness in adult patients with OSA. It is considered successful in a majority of cases; however, further studies must be performed to optimize patient selection criteria to achieve higher rates of success.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Biaxial fracture of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSB) is the leading cause of fetlock failure resulting in euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses in California, Kentucky and Hong Kong. Identifying alterable risk factors to reduce biaxial PSB fractures could have a significant impact on reducing the occurrence of catastrophic failure of the fetlock (CFF). Objectives We hypothesised that standing MRI (sMRI) would identify a greater degree of bone change in Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF from biaxial PSB fracture when compared to controls. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Bone changes from Florida Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF due to biaxial fracture of the PSB (n?=?21) were compared to controls (n?=?53) using the sMRI. Data for control limbs were Florida racehorses that were subjected to euthanasia for reasons other than CFF (enteritis, pneumonitis, etc.). All forelimb fetlocks underwent sMRI imaging within 72?h of euthanasia. Bone scores were assigned to the subchondral bone (SCB) on the distal palmar aspect of the lateral and medial condyle of the third metacarpal bone (McIII) and the lateral and medial PSB. All information for analysis from sMRI images for cases and controls for all Thoroughbred racehorses was reviewed and collected by the lead author. The association between the dichotomous outcomes of PSB fracture with independent variables was assessed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with significance set at P<0.05. Results The proportion of cases with >75% sclerosis of the ipsilateral lateral PSB (43%, 9/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (6%, 3/53). The proportion of cases with SCB lesion grade >3 of the contralateral palmar lateral condyle (29%, 6/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (0%, 0/53). Conclusions The sMRI identified a significantly greater degree of bone change in racehorses with PSB fracture compared to control horses. These identified changes may be useful as a screening tool to identify horses at increased risk of fetlock fracture during racing. Ethical animal research:?Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not given but permission for post mortem examination was given by the Racing Authority. Sources of funding:?None. Competing interests:?No competing interests have been declared.

AB  - In the nervous system nitric oxide (NO) has been involved as a regulatory molecule in several physiological and pathological events, such as cerebral microcirculation, synaptic plasticity, neural damage, and neuroprotection. The activation of the three isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS): neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS), synthesize NO from L-arginine. Moreover, in response to inflammatory stimuli, iNOS can produce copious amounts of NO for prolonged periods that triggers cell death by either necrosis or apoptosis. This has been considered as a key process in demyelination of both CNS and PNS with a destructive and/or protective controversial role. This study shows by Northern blot analysis that during experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), at the beginning of clinical signs, there is a transient extensive iNOS mRNA induction in nerve roots, which morphology is characterized by severe demyelination, but not in sciatic nerve, where scattered axonal degeneration is evident. Immunocytochemistry performed on teased nerve fibers and ultrastructural analysis showed that iNOS was localized in both inflammatory and Schwann cells, and analysis of cell membrane permeability detected with fluorescent dyes showed a diffuse necrotic phenotype in PNS. With EAN clinical spontaneous recovery, endoneurial iNOS was rapidly down-regulated and in nerve roots almost all cells shifted their membrane permeability to an apoptotic phenotype, whilst necrosis persisted in sciatic nerve, until complete clinical recovery, when both root and nerve returned normal. These data support the hypothesis that, during cell-mediated demyelination, iNOS may influence Schwann cell-axon relationship causing axonal damage and regulating endoneurial cell life and death.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study is to construct a new tool for the assessment of sexual dysfunction among men with diabetes that is valid and reliable across different ethnicities, languages and socio-economic backgrounds in South East Asia. Methods Focus group interviews were conducted to determine the construct of the questionnaire. Content and face validity were assessed by a panel of experts. A pilot study was conducted to validate the Sexual Dysfunction in Asian Men with Diabetes (SAD?MEN) questionnaire in English and Malay. The International Index of Erectile Function?5 (IIEF?5) was used for comparison. Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis, reliability was determined using Cronbach's α (> 0.700), and test?retest reliability using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results The SAD?MEN questionnaire yielded moderate face and content validity, with high reliability as shown by Cronbach's α values of 0.949 for sexual performance and 0.775 for sexual desire for the English version. The Malay language questionnaire had a Cronbach's α value of 0.945 for sexual performance and 0.750 for sexual desire. Test?retest reliability using Spearman's test gave correlation coefficients of r = 0.853, P = 0.000 for the English language questionnaire and r = 0.908, P = 0.000 for the Malay language questionnaire. Conclusion The SAD?MEN questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool by which to assess sexual dysfunction in English- and Malay-speaking Malaysian and South East Asian men with diabetes.

AB  - Summary A randomised cross-over study was performed in 34 patients with no evidence of airway difficulties, following induction of general anaesthesia, to compare the efficacy of the Levitan FPS scope? (LFPS) and the single-use bougie for tracheal intubation during simulated grade IIIa laryngoscopy. Success rates for intratracheal placement of the device, and the time required for insertion and tracheal intubation were recorded. Both devices were equally successful (31/34 for the LFPS vs 29/34 for the bougie) for insertion into the glottis. The mean insertion time for the LFPS was statistically longer than that for the bougie (4.4?12.5?s) but this difference was not clinically relevant. Intubation times were similar between the two devices. Major problems hindering successful intubation using the LFPS were the presence of a narrow epiglottic-pharyngeal wall space and copious secretions. An inability to maintain the desired shape was the principal cause of failure with the bougie.

AB  - Purpose:?? To show that ambulatory non-mechanical negative pressure dressing results in equivalent graft take and survival compared with commercially available mechanical vacuum dressings. Methodology:?? Twenty-four patients, both males and female, between 18 and 95?years of age in the Australian population requiring skin grafting of the lower limb from July 2008 were randomized consecutively into commercial vacuum assisted ambulatory dressing group, KCI Freedom VAC, [VAC] and non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressing group using 14 gauge drain [Belovac]. Patients were discharged on the same day of surgery and reviewed at 5 or 6?days post-operatively. Both groups were treated equally in all other facets of care. The dressings remained intact until outpatient review. A photo of the graft was taken upon removal of the dressing. Graft take/survival was measured from these photographs by an experienced plastic surgeon blinded to treatment group. Results:?? Graft take was found to be equivalent in both groups. All twelve patients in the VAC group were judged to have >95% graft take at five/six days post-op. In the Belovac group all twelve were judged to have >95% graft take at 5/6?days. The cost for VAC group was $AUD413.50/478.50 [5/6?days] compared to $AUD55.93 for the Belovac dressing group. Conclusion:?? We conclude that non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressings are equally effective as commercially available VAC dressings in for the treatment of lower limb skin grafts. We recommend that non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressing is an acceptable, cheap and safe alternative to commercially available dressings for day surgery patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare two methods of measuring physical function in subjects with a broad range of abilities and to evaluate the effects of cognitive, social, educational, and age factors on the relationship between the two methods. DESIGN: Multiple regression analysis was used to compare self-perceived (dependent variables) with performance measures (independent variables). Covariates included age, gender, Mini-Mental State Exam score, education, living status, and depression score. SETTING: Five community-dwelling and two nursing home sites. PARTICIPANTS: 417 community-dwelling subjects and 200 nursing home residents aged 62?98 years. MEASUREMENTS: Self-perceived physical function was assessed with the physical dimension summary score of the Sickness Impact Profile, which comprises three subscales: ambulation, mobility, and body care and movement. Physical performance was evaluated by self-selected gait speed, chairstand time, maximal grip strength, and a balance score. RESULTS: Nursing home residents and community-dwellers were significantly different (P < .0001) in all variables except age and gender. Self-perceived and performance-based measures were moderately correlated, with a range from r = ?.194 to r = ?.625 (P < .05). Gait speed was the strongest independent predictor of self-perceived physical function in both groups. Symptoms of depression were also an independent predictor of self-perceived function in nursing home residents; subjects who had such symptoms report more self-perceived dysfunction than would be predicted based on performance tests. CONCLUSIONS: Self-selected gait speed is a global indicator of self-perceived physical function over a broad range of abilities. External determinants (depressive symptoms, cognitive function, marital status, etc.) affect self-perceived function in both groups, but gait speed is the greatest single predictor of self-perceived function. In nursing home residents depressive symptomatology is related to self-perceived function, but gait speed is not.

AB  - ABSTRACT? Numbers of pancreas transplants have been decreasing over the past decade, but outcomes continue to improve for all types: simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant, pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK), and pancreas transplant alone (PTA). The most notable decrease occurred for PAK transplants, possibly due in part to decreases in numbers of living donor kidney transplants. The number of new candidates on the pancreas transplant waiting list has decreased steadily since 2000; only 1005 active candidates were added in 2011. Transplant rates for all pancreas transplant types reached a low in 2011 of 34.9 transplants per 100 wait-list years. Deceased donation rates have also been decreasing since 2005, but use of donation after circulatory death has been gradually increasing. The discard rate in 2011 was 27.7%, and higher for pancreata recovered from older donors. Improved outcomes during the early posttransplant period largely reflect improved donor and recipient selection and improved technical strategies. Inconsistent definitions of graft failure across reporting centers creates an ongoing challenge in the interpretation of outcome data for pancreas transplants. Rates of posttransplant re-hospitalization are high, most occurring in the first 6 months. Rejection rates are highest for PTA recipients, who also experience higher incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Some ponies are predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis, but the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Adipose tissue is a highly metabolically active tissue that secretes mediators which affect vascular function, insulin signalling and inflammation, all of which are potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of laminitis. Objectives To determine whether the gene expression of adipose tissue from previously laminitic ponies (LP) differs from nonlaminitic ponies (NL). Study design Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected by biopsy from the neck region of healthy LP and NL (n?=?6 each group) in the summer and winter. Methods Gene expression was determined using a 44?K equine expression microarray. Data were analysed using GeneSpring and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genes with >2-fold difference, P<0.01 were considered significant using a t test to analyse group and/or season. Results The most significant differences in global gene expression in adipose tissue were observed between summer and winter in both groups, with 244 (NL) and 174 (LP) genes differentially expressed. There was a significant difference between LP and NL groups in the summer (141 genes differentially expressed), whereas the 2 groups were more similar in the winter (40 genes differentially expressed). Eight of the top 10 upregulated genes and 3 of the top 5 canonical pathways that differed between LP and NL in the summer were associated with inflammation and/or immunity. Conclusions Laminitic ponies appear to have a different adipose tissue gene expression profile to NL, particularly in the summer. Inflammatory genes and pathways were significantly upregulated in the LP group suggesting higher levels of inflammation or priming of inflammatory pathways which may contribute to a predisposition to laminitis.

AB  - Abstract Background: Saphenous vein graft (SVG) intervention is associated with a significant incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) related to distal vessel embolization. The FilterWire? distal embolic protection device has recently been approved as an adjunct to SVG intervention. We report here our initial experience in a single center in 30 consecutive patients using this device in SVG stenting. Hypothesis: This study examined the outcomes and complications associated with these devices, as well as whether proficiency with the devices increased with greater experience and whether there were measurable outcome differences between devices. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients in whom a FilterWire device was placed at our hospital between June 2001 and June 2004. Results: The device was successfully deployed in 29 of 30 patients, and all patients were stented successfully. Overall MACE rate was 6.6%, consistent with reports in larger multi-center clinical trials. Transient decreases in flow were noted while the device was in place in six patients, but improved in five patients with device removal. Conclusions: This early experience in a single center using FilterWire embolic protection indicates that excellent clinical results can be obtained by the adoption of filter protection for SVG intervention, without evidence for a detrimental learning curve.

AB  - Abstract A common hallmark of age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases is an impairment of adult neurogenesis. Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt)/?-catenin (W?C) signalling is a vital pathway for dopaminergic (DAergic) neurogenesis and an essential signalling system during embryonic development and aging, the most critical risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, there is no known cause or cure for PD. Here we focus on the potential to reawaken the impaired neurogenic niches to rejuvenate and repair the aged PD brain. Specifically, we highlight W?C-signalling in the plasticity of the subventricular zone (SVZ), the largest germinal region in the mature brain innervated by nigrostriatal DAergic terminals, and the mesencephalic aqueduct-periventricular region (Aq-PVR) Wnt-sensitive niche, which is in proximity to the SNpc and harbors neural stem progenitor cells (NSCs) with DAergic potential. The hallmark of the W?C pathway is the cytosolic accumulation of ?-catenin, which enters the nucleus and associates with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors, leading to the transcription of Wnt target genes. Here, we underscore the dynamic interplay between DAergic innervation and astroglial-derived factors regulating W?C-dependent transcription of key genes orchestrating NSC proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. Aging, inflammation and oxidative stress synergize with neurotoxin exposure in ?turning off? the W?C neurogenic switch via down-regulation of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/Wnt-regulated signalosome, a key player in the maintenance of antioxidant self-defense mechanisms and NSC homeostasis. Harnessing W?C-signalling in the aged PD brain can thus restore neurogenesis, rejuvenate the microenvironment, and promote neurorescue and regeneration.

AB  - Key points We have developed a novel porcine model of high-thoracic midline contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) at the T2 spinal level. We describe this model and the ensuing cardiovascular and neurohormonal responses, and demonstrate the model is efficacious for studying clinically relevant cardiovascular dysfunction post-SCI. We demonstrate that the high-thoracic SCI model, but not a low-thoracic SCI model, induces persistent hypotension along with a gradual reduction in plasma noradrenaline and increases in plasma aldosterone and angiotensin II. We additionally conducted a proof-of-concept long-term (12 weeks) survival study in animals with T2 contusion SCI demonstrating the potential utility of this model for not only acute experimentation but also long-term drug studies prior to translation to the clinic. Abstract Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population, especially in those with high-thoracic or cervical SCI. With this in mind, we aimed to develop a large animal (porcine) model of high-thoracic (T2 level) contusion SCI and compare the haemodynamic and neurohormonal responses of this injury against a low-thoracic (T10 level) model. Ten Yorkshire pigs were randomly subjected to 20 cm weight drop contusion SCI at either the T2 or the T10 spinal level. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored until 4 h post-SCI. Plasma noradrenaline (NA), aldosterone and angiotensin II (ANGII) were measured pre-SCI and at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min post-SCI. Additionally, two Yucatan pigs were subjected to T2-SCI and survived up to 12 weeks post-injury to demonstrate the efficacy of this model for long-term survival studies. Immediately after T2-SCI, SBP, MAP and HR increased (P < 0.0001). Between decompression (5 min post-SCI) and 30 min post-decompression in T2-SCI, SBP and MAP were lower than pre-SCI (P < 0.038). At 3 and 4 h after T2-SCI, SBP remained lower than pre-SCI (P = 0.048). After T10-SCI, haemodynamic indices remained largely unaffected. Plasma NA was lower in T2- vs. T10-SCI post-SCI, whilst aldosterone and ANGII were higher. Both chronically injured pigs demonstrated a vast reduction in SBP at 12 weeks post-SCI. Our model of T2-SCI causes a rapid and sustained alteration in neurohormonal control and cardiovascular function, which does not occur in the T10 model.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is a common equine distal axonopathy associated with neurogenic atrophy of intrinsic laryngeal muscles (particularly the left) causing laryngeal paresis and poor performance. An objective, reliable method of assessing changes in structure that correlates with laryngeal muscle function in vivo is necessary to determine response to novel treatments, including functional electrical stimulation. This study aimed to determine whether laryngeal muscle and nerve morphology (determined by CT and histopathology) correlated with laryngeal function. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Resting (grades 1?4) and exercising (grades A?C) laryngeal function was graded in adult Thoroughbred horses. Standing CT of the larynx was performed to compare volume, cross-sectional area (XSA) and tissue density between left and right cricoarytenoideus dorsalis (CAD) muscles in 22 horses. CAD muscles and recurrent laryngeal nerves were collected in a subgroup of 10 horses and analysed for fibrosis, fat infiltration and nerve fibre density (axons/?m2). Results Horses with grade C?RLN on exercising endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles and reduced nerve fibre density than horses with grades A or B. Horses with grade 4?RLN on resting endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles than horses with grades 1 or 2. Left CAD muscles had significantly more collagen than the right in horses with grade C?RLN. CT measurements of the CAD muscles were significantly associated with % collagen/fat and nerve fibre density (P<0.05). Conclusions Laryngeal CT results correlate with laryngeal function at rest and exercise in the horse and provide a noninvasive method of monitoring changes in CAD morphology in response to novel treatments. CAD CT appearance is dependent on % collagen and fat in the muscle and is associated with nerve fibre density.

AB  - Abstract This randomized trial compared a strategy of direct stenting without predilatation (n = 39) with conventional stenting with predilatation (n = 42) in patients with suitable lesions in native vessels ≥ 2.5-mm diameter to be covered by either a 9- or 16-mm-length NIR Primo stent. Equipment cost [mean (median) ± SD] was less in those with direct stenting [$1,199 (979) ± 526] than in those with predilatation [$1,455 (1,285) ± 401, P < 0.001]. There was no significant difference in contrast use or fluoroscopy time. Procedural time was shorter in the direct stenting group. The clinical outcome at 1 month was satisfactory in both groups. In selected patients, a strategy of direct stenting is feasible, costs less, and is quicker to perform than the conventional strategy of stenting following predilatation. Cathet. Cardiovasc.

AB  - Background There continues to be uncertainty about the optimal approach to documenting bleeding data in platelet transfusion trials, with a desire to apply a common assessment tool across all trials. With this in mind, a consensus bleeding assessment tool (BAT) has been developed by the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) collaborative, based on review of data collection forms used in published randomized trials and following content validation with a range of healthcare professionals at seven haematology centres through BEST members. This study aimed to evaluate reliability and reproducibility of the consensus BAT. Methods Replicated clinical assessments of bleeding were undertaken by participants with haematological malignancies recruited at four haematology centres in an international, multicentred, observational study. Concordance of repeat assessments was calculated for agreement in site and grade of bleeding observed. Results Forty patients consented to participate, and 13 trained bleeding assessors collected these data. Bleeding assessments were carried out on 113 separate days. Of all 225 bleeding assessments, 204 were compared for grade concordance, and 160 were compared for site concordance. There was very good grade concordance (83%, 95% confidence interval 74?93%) and good bleeding site concordance (69%, 95% confidence interval 57?79%) in observations of bleeding. Discordance was primarily in relation to assessing skin bleeding. Conclusions Alongside a structured training programme, levels of concordance for a consensus BAT were high. Researchers using assessment tools for bleeding need to balance comprehensive data collection against potential loss of accuracy for some types of bleeding, such as skin findings.
