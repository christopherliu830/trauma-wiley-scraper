AB  - Abstract This randomized trial compared a strategy of direct stenting without predilatation (n = 39) with conventional stenting with predilatation (n = 42) in patients with suitable lesions in native vessels ≥ 2.5-mm diameter to be covered by either a 9- or 16-mm-length NIR Primo stent. Equipment cost [mean (median) ± SD] was less in those with direct stenting [$1,199 (979) ± 526] than in those with predilatation [$1,455 (1,285) ± 401, P < 0.001]. There was no significant difference in contrast use or fluoroscopy time. Procedural time was shorter in the direct stenting group. The clinical outcome at 1 month was satisfactory in both groups. In selected patients, a strategy of direct stenting is feasible, costs less, and is quicker to perform than the conventional strategy of stenting following predilatation. Cathet. Cardiovasc.

AB  - Background There continues to be uncertainty about the optimal approach to documenting bleeding data in platelet transfusion trials, with a desire to apply a common assessment tool across all trials. With this in mind, a consensus bleeding assessment tool (BAT) has been developed by the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) collaborative, based on review of data collection forms used in published randomized trials and following content validation with a range of healthcare professionals at seven haematology centres through BEST members. This study aimed to evaluate reliability and reproducibility of the consensus BAT. Methods Replicated clinical assessments of bleeding were undertaken by participants with haematological malignancies recruited at four haematology centres in an international, multicentred, observational study. Concordance of repeat assessments was calculated for agreement in site and grade of bleeding observed. Results Forty patients consented to participate, and 13 trained bleeding assessors collected these data. Bleeding assessments were carried out on 113 separate days. Of all 225 bleeding assessments, 204 were compared for grade concordance, and 160 were compared for site concordance. There was very good grade concordance (83%, 95% confidence interval 74?93%) and good bleeding site concordance (69%, 95% confidence interval 57?79%) in observations of bleeding. Discordance was primarily in relation to assessing skin bleeding. Conclusions Alongside a structured training programme, levels of concordance for a consensus BAT were high. Researchers using assessment tools for bleeding need to balance comprehensive data collection against potential loss of accuracy for some types of bleeding, such as skin findings.

AB  - Summary Parkes SE, Parke S, Manghan DC, Grimer RJ, Davies P, Morland BJ. Fifty years of paediatric malignant bone tumours in the West Midlands, UK, 1957?2006: incidence, treatment and outcome. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010. Malignant bone tumours in the paediatric age group (0?14 years) are uncommon; various aetiological theories exist and few reports of incidence, age and sex distributions have been published. We examined the incidence of childhood malignant bone tumours in one large single region of the UK over an extended period of 50 years. The West Midlands specialist regional children's tumour registry holds data on all malignancies and benign brain tumours in children under 15 years in the West Midlands region, which has a population of around 1 million children. Demographic and clinical data have been abstracted and diagnoses reviewed by a panel of expert pathologists. During the period 1957?2006, 259 cases of malignant paediatric bone tumours were diagnosed. There were 153 osteosarcomas, 78 Ewing sarcomas and 28 other primary bone tumours. The overall age standardised rate was 4.66, with no increase over time, although there was a significant increase in the incidence of Ewing sarcomas in the period 1965?92. Sixty-eight per cent of tumours were in patients over 10 years, whereas the incidence in patients under 10 years showed a non-significant increase. Survival rates increased dramatically post-chemotherapy introduction, with Ewing sarcoma demonstrating better survival overall. This is a large study giving an overview of malignant bone tumours in the childhood population of a single region over an extended period, showing results consistent with national reports. It also examines late effects, which were mostly mobility/orthopaedic, although almost one-fifth of patients had cardiac problems and five went on to develop second malignancies.

AB  - Previous investigations have demonstrated that cutaneous healing in red Duroc pigs (RD) differs from healing in Yorkshire pigs (Y). Specifically, RD animals heal with the formation of hypercontracted, hyperpigmented scars, features which are not observed in Y animals. Further, this abnormal scarring may be genetically mediated, as demonstrated by the partial transmission of this phenotype to RD???Y offspring (F1). To further determine the degree of transmission of this phenotype, this study examined the effect of wound depth upon the healing response of F1 animals. Ten full thickness (FT) and ten deep dermal (DD, 1.8?mm) skin wounds (2?cm???2?cm) were created on the backs of juvenile female F1 animals (N?=?8) using previously published procedures. Biopsies (4?mm) were taken from FT and DD wounds on days 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Samples were used for histology and molecular analysis using RT-PCR. There were no detectable differences between the FT and DD wounds on the gross or histologic level. However on a molecular level, there were numerous differences between the FT and DD wounds. Several genes investigated demonstrated increased expression levels in the DD wounds as compared to the FT wounds. Further, DD wounds demonstrated a unique pattern of expression for several other genes that differed from that observed in either the F1 FT wounds or in any RD or Y wounds. Given that previous investigations have shown that FT and DD wounds are nearly identical within each of the RD and Y strains, this represents a novel finding. These results indicate that the healing phenotype of the F1 animals may be regulated both by genetics and by the wound size/depth, suggesting that human wound healing may be similarly influenced by genetics, wound depth and potentially, environmental factors.

AB  - Summary Body fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid) are preferred samples for neurological testing. This chapter focuses on the clinical laboratory examinations used to screen, diagnose, predict, and monitor neurologic disorders in geriatric patients. As the goals of laboratory testing in this population overlap those of general laboratory testing, a brief section on test interpretation and general laboratory considerations precedes the sections devoted to neurologic disorders of geriatric patients. The neurologic disorders for which laboratory investigations are described in the chapter are: dementias (Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease), movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-plus syndromes), cerebrovascular disorders (infarction and hemorrhage), and other disorders such as headache and depression.

AB  - In the three years from 1968 to 1970, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were isolated from 525 patients and members of the staff in a large teaching hospital. There was a progressive increase in the proportion of methicillin-resistant strains among the ?hospital? staphylococci, so that in the last half of 1970, 73% were methicillin-resistant. These organisms were responsible for a number of serious infections, including septicæmia. Some strains were resistant to lincomycin or kanamycin in addition to methicillin.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether preoperative electrocardiographic measurements linked to sympathetic nervous activity could be used to predict recovery quality after general anaesthesia in horses. Study design Prospective, clinical study. Animals Eighteen adult client-owned horses. Methods The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded presurgery in horses under three standard conditions: stabled unattended; with a groom whilst being led along a standard course; alone in the induction box. After surgery, each animal's recovery quality was scored by eight experienced anaesthetists or technicians using Donaldson's scoring system (2000). The digitized ECG recordings were analyzed for T-wave morphology, mean heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV) and HRV derivatives including mean R-R interval, standard deviation of normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive intervals (RMSSD), low (LF) and high frequency (HF) activity and the LF/HF ratio in both fast Fourier transformed and autoregressive spectra. Correlations between ECG variables and recovery score were examined using Spearman's rank correlation. Results There was no significant correlation between preanaesthetic ECG measurements and recovery quality. Conclusions Predictions of recovery quality after general anaesthesia in horses cannot be based on preanaesthetic ECG variables. Clinical relevance Measures other than those based on the ECG should be investigated as predictors of recovery quality.

AB  - Abstract In the last couple of years, more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees have been hosted under the ?temporary protection? scheme in Turkey. Despite these high numbers Turkey did not have a centralized refugee settlement and integration policy. As a result, various stakeholders including local governments have played critical roles in providing refugee assistance services. This research looks at the role of local governments in delivering services evolving from emergency response to local integration. This article argues that this role with respect to the United Nations? Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) has to be further strengthened. The data for this research were collected through a comprehensive study based on interviews and surveys carried out in ?stanbul with local authorities, ?stanbul Metropolitan Municipality, and its 39 district municipalities in 2016-2017. Although this research has its focus on ?stanbul as the selected case study, the findings can reveal conclusions relevant to global implications and perspectives.

AB  - Forty-eight chronically (>3 months) ?-receptor-blocked patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension were studied on 49 occasions after random distribution to a 4-day, gradual preoperative withdrawal (n = 26) or a continuation (n = 23) of ?-receptor blockers. The patients were scheduled for either a cholecystectomy (n = 28) or a carotid thrombendarterectomy (n = 21) under neurolept anaesthesia. Three patients were excluded from the randomized part of the study due to complications (tachycardia, hypertension, severe angina) after therapy withdrawal. In subgroups, central haemodynamics (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 6, continued n = 8) and creatinine-kinase B (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 9, continued n= 11) were studied. Withdrawal of ?-receptor blockers was associated with high heart rates, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and a hyperkinetic circulation during pain stimuli. Significantly more postoperative ECG changes (p<0.02) indicative of myocardial ischaemia were found than in ?-receptor blocked patients. These patients had low heart rates but also pronounced increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, which in single patients could be associated with myocardial damage. These results imply that ?-receptor blockers should be continued before surgery and that a concomitant vasodilatatory therapy is likely to avoid the drawbacks of an increased cardiac afterload.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are essential components of our defense and repair systems but also potentially harmful mediators of infectious and immunoinflammatory reactions. Clinically important cytokines function systemically as pleiotropic hormones with overlapping effects on many cell types. All engage in a complex network of agonists and antagonists. Some immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been found to be potent and specific regulators of cytokines. These antibodies bind interleukin (IL-1)α, IL-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interferon (IFN)-α/? with exceptional force. They neutralize their corresponding cytokines ex vivo and perhaps in vivo, although they may also function as cytokine carriers. The biological role of autoantibodies to cytokines is not yet understood, but they may provide a level of regulation not appreciated at present. Inappropriate production/function of such antibodies could be pathogenetically involved in immunoinflammatory and other diseases. Cytokine antibodies may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of human IgG therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: A prospective cohort study was conducted to test our ability to identify chronically ill patients at near term risk of death by asking their primary care physician (PCP) the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of CHF or COPD?' METHODS: Patients were eligible for inclusion if 1) their clinic chart problem list carried a diagnosis of CHF or COPD, 2) they had been hospitalized within the past two years with primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF or COPD, or 3) direct identification by their PCP. Chart review was used to exclude patients erroneously carrying these diagnoses (e.g. coding errors), inactive patients (deceased or changed providers) and those patients with normal ejection fractions or not requiring scheduled ?-2 agonist and anticholinergic bronchodialator therapy. Patients were then stratified on the basis of their PCP's response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD?' All patients screened and stratified by the question were followed for the primary endpoint of death. RESULTS: The initial data query identified 190 patients with CHF and/or COPD. A chart review excluded eight inactive patients and thirty-one patients who did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria for significant disease. Of the remaining 151 patients, there were 72 whose PCP answered that he/she would not be surprised if the patient died from CHF and/or COPD in the next year. Within nine months, nine of these patients have died from complications of their CHF or COPD. There have been no deaths in the 79 patients whose PCP answered that they would be surprised if their patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD. (p-value < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF and/or COPD at risk of near term death can be differentiated from those who are not at high risk by the PCPs'response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of their CHF and/or COPD?' Such screening may be useful to more efficiently target palliative services and end of life care planning to patients with advanced CHF and/or COPD.
