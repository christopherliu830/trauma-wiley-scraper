AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies allow the assessment of variations in body position during jumping. This study evaluated changes in kinematic variables in horses during a jumping test. Methods Eight horses equipped with reflective skin markers were submitted to a jumping test consisting of 70 jumps in 4 series of 10, 15, 20 and 25 times each over a 1.10?m vertical obstacle. Six jumps per series were recorded; a heart rate of ≤ 90?bpm was the criterion to begin the next series. A 25?Hz calibrated camera was placed 10?m from the fence, and 2D images were analyzed. The variables were: overtracking at jumping; take-off and landing distances; jump length; distance between lowest point of the fore and hind limb and the fence; height of head, withers and croup in relation to the ground when passing the fence; and maximum withers height at jumping. Data were analysed with an ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test (P<0.05). Results There was a reduction in take-off distance (1.65?m to 1.46?m, P?=?0.03), landing distance (1.99?m to 1.71?m, P?=?0.001), jump length (4.51?m to 4.11?m, P?=?0.005), left forelimb distance height above the fence (9.4?cm to 5.1?cm, P?=?0.03) and maximum withers height at jumping (2.0?m to 1.95?m, P?=?0.001) from the first to the third series. Overtracking before jumping increased from 32?cm to 48?cm (P?=?0.003) and there was a reduction of right forelimb height above the fence from 7.3?cm to 2.9?cm (P?=?0.04), and of withers and croup height above the fence from 2.0?m to 1.95?m (P?=?0.001) and 1.93?m to 1.86?m (P<0.0001) respectively from the first to fourth session. Conclusions The increase in the number of jumps resulted in a decrease of take-off and landing distances, and in the distance between forelimb and fence and the withers and croup height, all indicating decreased jumping efficiency.

AB  - Introduction Lungeing is part of the standard lameness examination, however it systematically affects movement symmetry even in sound horses. We evaluated a method for objective lameness detection on the circle accounting for this asymmetry bias. Methods Twenty-six horses undergoing lameness examination were equipped with inertial sensors (Xsens) on head, sacrum and tubera coxae. Asymmetry in vertical displacement was quantified for trot on straight line and circle using multiple measures. Horses were classified lame when falling outside the directional reference range of sound horses (directional?=??normal? margins and lame limb depending on rein and sign of measure). Objective classification on the circle was compared to subjective evaluation, final diagnoses and objective classification on the straight calculating the proportion of matches. Regression analysis evaluated the association of change in asymmetry between straight line and circle and baseline asymmetry on the straight. Results The match between objective classification on the circle and the exact fore-/hindlimb(s) scored lame subjectively was 81% / 79%. The match with the diagnosed limb(s) was 71% / 85%. There was a high frequency of false positives compared to subjective evaluation. Objective evaluation on the circle added new information compared to assessment on the straight line in 70% (forelimb) / 58% (hindlimb) of instances (contralateral limb lame, bilateral lameness, lame on circle but sound on straight). Change in asymmetry was not associated with baseline lameness (P≥0.062). Conclusions Objective lameness evaluation on the circle makes a valuable contribution to patient assessment: e.g. subtle lameness falling within the margins of ?normal? on the straight or bilateral lameness could be identified. In future, the predictive value of the proposed technique should be determined. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

AB  - Introduction To facilitate interpretation of limb loading and hoof balance obtained by pressure plate analysis in lame horses, the effects of handler position and perineural anesthesia in sound horses need investigation. Methods Six sound Warmblood horses were walked and trotted over a pressure plate, with the handler at the left and subsequently the right side, and before and after a bilateral palmar digital nerve block. One week later, this procedure was repeated before and after a bilateral abaxial sesamoid nerve block. Peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI) and stance time (ST) of 5 hoof prints of both forelimbs were obtained (126?Hz). Asymmetry ratios were calculated. Toe-heel and medio-lateral hoof balance curves of the vertical force were calculated. Mixed model ANOVA was used for statistical analysis of asymmetry ratios (α?=?0.05). Hoof balance curves were assessed qualitatively. Results There were no significant effects of handler position and perineural anesthesia on PVF and VI; small but significant effects of perineural anesthesia on ST at walk were associated with variability in horses? speed between sessions at walk (P?=?0.046); no significant differences at trot. Hoof balance curves were not affected by handler position or perineural anesthesia, and were highly repeatable within each individual horse. Conclusions The lack of any effect of handler position or perineural anaesthesia on limb loading and toe-heel and medial-lateral hoof balance in sound horses makes it probable that significant aberrations found using pressure plate analysis are related to abnormalities and hence may be relevant in lameness diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction The navicular bone (NB) and the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) are common sites of lameness. Greater knowledge of foot mechanics will aid in understanding of the aetiopathogenesis and may provide new opportunities for treatment and prevention. It was hypothesised that changes in the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPj) and movement of the NB and DDFT during the stance phase will lead to changes in the moment arm of the DDFT around the DIPj. Methods Internal hoof kinematics were determined using a high-speed fluoroscopy system. Six horses were walked and trotted over a raised platform consisting of four force plates, through the field of view of the fluoroscopy system. The angles of the DIPj and the DDFT around the navicular bone and the moment arm of the DDFT were measured. Changes in these parameters during stance and differences between strides, gaits and horses were assessed using an ANOVA or paired T-test as appropriate (P<0.05). Results The range of motion (ROM, mean?±?SD) during stance of the DIPJ was 28.6?±?4.6° (walk) and 26.5?±?6.3 (trot) with significant differences between gaits, strides and horses (P<0.001). The angle change of the DDFT around the NB was 21.9?±?6.0° in walk and 26.6?±?6.5 in trot. The change in moment arm of the DDFT around the DIPj was 3.7?±?1.3?mm in walk and 4.1?±?2.2?mm in trot. There were no significant differences between the different time points during stance or between gaits. Conclusions High-speed fluoroscopy is a novel method that allows assessment of internal foot kinematics. The observed changes between gaits during stance may result in altered stress distribution in the DDFT. Further studies will evaluate the effect of farriery intervention on internal foot kinematics.

AB  - Introduction The ability to accurately assess equine oxygen consumption (VO2) under field conditions has been limited by the need for unrestricted gas exchange. Methods Two variations of a mask and an associated electronics control module (ECM) were designed to enable breath-by-breath measurement of airflows with two 8.0?cm diameter pneumotachometers located 7.5?cm in front of each narus and connected to differential pressure transducers mounted on the outside of the mask. The ECM was comprised of electronics for signal filtering to the flow transducers, an oxygen sensing cell, and an analog-to-digital converter all powered by a lithium-ion battery. The battery also powered a pump connected to gas sampling ports between the nares and pneumotachometers. Airflow and oxygen content of inspired and expired gases were recorded through the ECM and electronically transferred to a notebook. VO2 was determined from these recordings by an operator using a customized software analysis program. One mask encased the lower head (E). The other left the jaw free so horse could wear a bit and be ridden (R). Multiple treadmill exercise tests were undertaken by 6 horses to measure VO2max and blood gases. Each mask was worn twice and results compared to those from an open flow-through system (O) by 2-way RMANOVA (P<0.05). Utility of the system was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient of 4 independent raters. Results Blood gases and VO2max (152.0?±?4.0 (mean?±?SEM; O), 147.7?±?4.3 (E), 150.7?±?3.3 (R) ml/(kg.min) were not different between masks. VO2 measures were reproducible for each mask. Agreement between the 4 raters was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient?=?0.99). Conclusions Masks capable of measuring VO2 during field exercise were developed, tested and found accurate by multiple users. Ethical Animal Research Studies performed were approved by the Institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #3807). Sources of funding:?Institutional sources. Competing interests:?Washington State University has filed notice of its intent to apply for a patent for facemask used in this study.

AB  - Introduction Acid-base disturbances are frequently assessed using traditional variables PCO2, pH, and bicarbonate. This study aimed to compare the changes in acid-base balance in horses performing a CEI endurance race (160?km) using traditional and quantitative methodologies. Methods Blood samples were drawn before racing, at the vet-gate (66?km), immediately after racing, and 2 and 15?h after racing from 18 participating horses. The mean velocity of the horses was 17?km/h. PCO2 and pH were measured (I-Stat). Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and total volatile buffers (Atot) were calculated using formulas from the literature. Data for finishers (F) and non-finishers (N) was compared with an unpaired test. Data collected for finishers at all time-points was compared by repeated ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results PCO2 was lower in group N at the 66?km time-point. In group F, AG had a bimodal behaviour, declining immediately after exercise and then increasing at 2 and 15 hours. There was a slight increase in pH post-exercise. After 2 hours, Atot increased while PCO2 decreased. Compared to SIG immediately after racing, SIG at 2 and 15 hours after racing was decreased. Traditional methodology suggested mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to hyperventilation of the finishers. Quantitative methodology suggested metabolic acidosis reflected by decreasing SID trend and a significant increase of Atot. Conclusions Acid-base imbalances are present in endurance racing horses and differences were found between the traditional and quantitative methods of assessment.

AB  - Introduction During anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, lactate and H+ ions accumulate in muscle fibers and pass into the bloodstream. Monocarboxylate transporter type 1 and its ancillary protein CD147 transport H+ and lactate ions from the plasma into red blood cells, thereby maintaining acid/base homeostasis and retarding systemic acidosis and fatigue. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of CD147 protein in the red blood cells of Arabian horses with different levels of athletic ability. Methods Blood samples were taken from 12 Arabian horses before exercise. The horses were divided into two groups: untrained horses (UH, n?=?6) and 160-km endurance horses (FEI, n?=?6). The amount of CD147 in the plasma membranes of their red blood cells was determined by Western blotting analysis using a human-specific anti-CD147 antibody previously validated for horses. The medians were compared by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test at 5%. Results CD147 protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45?kDa was found in the red blood cell membranes of the studied horses. The CD147 expression levels of the two groups were not different (P?=?0.065). The observed median values (min?max) were 0.50 (0.37?1.26) and 0.27 (0.09?0.69) arbitrary optical density units for the FEI and UH group respectively. Conclusions Studies must be performed with more horses to determine if a different level of CD147 expression exists in FEI horses related to their intensive training programs or to the genetic traits of each horse.

AB  - Introduction Training related cardiac adaptation is documented in Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds, including an increased incidence of AV valve regurgitation. In Warmbloods less is known about training effects on cardiac function or subclinical valve regurgitation. Methods Fifteen adult untrained Warmbloods (aged 3.8?±?0.7 years) were compared with fifteen adult Warmblood eventers (aged 11.4?±?0.9 years) competing at CIC2* (group 1, n?=?5) and CCI2*, CIC3*, CCI3* and CCI4*levels (group 2, n?=?9) and fifteen healthy adult Warmbloods competing at advanced dressage (group 3, n?=?5), Prix Saint Georges, Intermediate or Grand Prix (group 4, n?=?10) levels (mean age 10.3?±?0.7 years). The presence of heart murmurs, valve regurgitation and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated, and training intensity was scored. A correlation was found between bodyweight and not height. Differences in cardiac morphology were compared using General Linear Models with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (SPSS version 20), using group and bodyweight as covariates. Significance was set at P<0.05. Prevalence of audible heart murmurs and valvular regurgitation was higher in eventers (0?20% and 29?79%, respectively and dressage horses (7?40% and 7?60%, respectively) than controls (0?20% and 7?20%, respectively). Interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd, left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV mean wall thickness (LVMWT) were greater in groups 2 and 4 than controls; group 4 also had a greater pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and LV posterior wall (LVPWd). Group 1 showed a greater LVMWT; group 4 a greater end point septal separation (EPSS). Training intensity influenced in both categories IVSd and MWT; in eventers also the right ventricular diameter in diastole and in dressage horses also LVPWd, LVM, EPSS and PAD. Elite eventers and dressage horses showed an increased prevalence of audible murmurs and valvular regurgitation. Cardiac adaptations resembled those associated with resistance and endurance training. Increased performance level and training intensity accompanied increased cardiac muscle thickness and volume. These effects should be considered during sales and performance evaluations.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training results in improved mitochondrial efficiency but it is unclear if dietary selenium level can further modify mitochondrial function. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and exercise training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At week 14, all horses underwent a 2?hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Permeabilized muscle fibers obtained from the gluteus medius of horses at rest were analysed for mitochondrial function via high resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity with Complex I substrates was determined using the respiratory control ratio (RCR) of state 3 (with ADP) and state 2 (without ADP; leak respiration). Electron transport system capacity (ETSC) was determined by uncoupling phosphorylation and respiration using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS) activities were assessed in resting muscle samples obtained at week 0 and 14, and in response to the SET. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA. Results Leak, state 3, ETSC, CS and CCO were higher (P<0.05) at wk 14 compared to wk 0 in all horses, but were not affected by training or Se level. Additionally, CS and CCO were unaffected by the SET. Conclusions Mitochondrial number (CS activity) and efficiency were unaffected by training and dietary Se level, but did increase over time, perhaps due to growth of horses. A more strenuous training protocol may be needed to induce mitochondrial adaptations.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Lower airway diseases are common problems in sports and racing horses. In humans, exercise causes increased susceptibility to respiratory infections associated with down-regulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules. Because numerous cell types are implicated in important defense mechanisms against airborne infections, we aimed to assess the effect of training on innate immune responses of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC) and blood monocytes. Methods PAM, EBEC and monocytes were collected at rest and after a standardized exercise test (SET) from eight untrained, trained and deconditioned horses. We compared their respective expression of TLR1-9 by qPCR and their cytokinic responses following exposure to various TLR ligands by ELISA. Data were reported as least square means and analyzed by a global linear mixed model. Results The mRNA expression of TLR3 was down-regulated by training in PAM (P<0.0001) and monocytes (P<0.015), whereas the mRNA expression of TLR4 was up-regulated in monocytes (P?=?0.0004) only. Monocytes stimulated with TLR2- and TLR4-ligands showed increased cytokine secretion after training and deconditioning (P<0.025). EBEC from trained horses produced less TNF-alpha (P<0.05) after treatment with ligands of TLR2 and TLR3 compared with EBEC from untrained horses. The production of TNF-alpha (P<0.001) and IFN-beta (P<0.001) in non-stimulated and stimulated PAM was decreased in trained and deconditioned horses. Conclusions The impaired cytokine production in PAM and EBEC after a training period might explain the increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and is associated with the activation of cells at the systemic level.

The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease. Ethical Animal Research This study was based on clinical cases referred to the Equine Sports Medicine Practice. Horse owners referred their horses and consented to all procedures described.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test.

AB  - Introduction In theory, splenic reserve mobilization should elicit a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor mediated neuroendocrine response (the Gauer-Henry reflex). Six intact (IN) and 5 (SP) splenectomized Standardbred mares (421?491?kg, ?9?yr) performed 10?min of treadmill exercise (80% VO2max) to test the hypothesis that hemodynamic and endocrine responses to exercise would differ between IN and SP horses Methods Blood samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10?min of exertion. Right ventricular pressure (RVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were measured and total peripheral resistance (TPR) calculated. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were measured using RIA. Data analysis used ANOVA for repeated measures and SNK. Significance was set at P<0.05. There were no differences (P>0.05) between IN and SP for any variable at rest. All variables except TPR and RAP increased (P<0.05) during exertion in both IN and SP. Means (±SE) for RAP (18?±?3 vs. 1?±?2?mmHg), CO (255?±?21 vs.177?±?19?L/min), MAP (147?±?3 vs. 116?±?8?mmHg), and ANP (66?±?3 vs. 50?±?8?pg/mL) were greater for IN vs. SP horses at 10?min of exertion. Mean plasma AVP (95?±?19 vs. 23?±?3?pg/mL) was greater (P<0.05) for SP than for IN horses at 10?min of exertion. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador breed is valued for its gait. However few studies have assessed the use of nutritional additives on this breed's performance. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that chelated trivalent chromium and L-carnitine feed supplementation may reduce subcutaneous fat deposition after training. Methods 13 mares (2.5 to 3 years old) were assigned to one of three treatments (T1, 10?mg Cr/day; T2, 10?g LCN/day; T3, control) according to a completely randomized design, with split-plot arrangement. The diet was Panicum maximum cv. Massai and concentrate (50:50 ratio and 2.5% BWT). During 42 days the mares received supplementation and exercised for 50?min on a treadmill and 60?min on an automatic walker every other day, resting on Sundays. Subcutaneous fat was measured with ultrasound before and after training in the back-loin(GDL), croup(GG), and base of the tail(GBC). Results were compared by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results Before training, the variables were similar across the groups (P>0.05). After training, in GDL, T2 (1.76?mm) was 37.37% lower (P<0.05) than control (2.81?mm), while T1 (2.22?mm) was similar to T2 and control. There was no difference between treatments (P>0.05) in GG. In GBC, there was a 24.45% increase from pre (8.59?mm) to post-treatment (10.69?mm) evaluations, regardless of the treatment. Conclusions Supplementation with L-carnitine reduces subcutaneous fat deposition in the lumbar region of Mangalarga Marchador mares after training, which may be indicative of increased use of subcutaneous fat in this region as a substrate for exercise.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder predominantly affecting females. Females with the MECP2 mutations exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from classical Rett syndrome to asymptomatic carriers. Mutations of genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) and forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) are also found in early onset RTT variants. Here, we present the first report of a female patient with RTT-like phenotype caused by SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankylin repeat domain 3) mutation, indicating that the clinical spectrum of SHANK3 mutations may extend to RTT-like phenotype in addition to (severe) developmental delay, absence of expressive speech, autistic behaviors and intellectual disability. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
