AB  - Introduction The Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador breed is valued for its gait. However few studies have assessed the use of nutritional additives on this breed's performance. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that chelated trivalent chromium and L-carnitine feed supplementation may reduce subcutaneous fat deposition after training. Methods 13 mares (2.5 to 3 years old) were assigned to one of three treatments (T1, 10?mg Cr/day; T2, 10?g LCN/day; T3, control) according to a completely randomized design, with split-plot arrangement. The diet was Panicum maximum cv. Massai and concentrate (50:50 ratio and 2.5% BWT). During 42 days the mares received supplementation and exercised for 50?min on a treadmill and 60?min on an automatic walker every other day, resting on Sundays. Subcutaneous fat was measured with ultrasound before and after training in the back-loin(GDL), croup(GG), and base of the tail(GBC). Results were compared by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results Before training, the variables were similar across the groups (P>0.05). After training, in GDL, T2 (1.76?mm) was 37.37% lower (P<0.05) than control (2.81?mm), while T1 (2.22?mm) was similar to T2 and control. There was no difference between treatments (P>0.05) in GG. In GBC, there was a 24.45% increase from pre (8.59?mm) to post-treatment (10.69?mm) evaluations, regardless of the treatment. Conclusions Supplementation with L-carnitine reduces subcutaneous fat deposition in the lumbar region of Mangalarga Marchador mares after training, which may be indicative of increased use of subcutaneous fat in this region as a substrate for exercise.

AB  - There is increasing use of CT in intestinal obstruction to delineate those patients requiring expeditious surgical intervention from those in whom conservative management is appropriate. We sought to assess the accuracy of CT in predicting those patients for whom conservative management would suffice. A mixed prospective-retrospective series had 75 patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a CT performed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if there was an immediate indication for surgery eg peritoneal irritation or shock. A positive diagnosis was defined as suitability for conservative management based on CT absence of an obstructing lesion and/or progression of contrast. A negative diagnosis was defined as a high-grade obstruction, signs of strangulation or a lesion requiring operation eg volvulus or tumour. Sixty-two cases (82.7%) had a history of abdominal surgery. Forty-one (54.7%) underwent operative intervention during their index admission. Diagnostic accuracy measures for CT in predicting successful conservative management were: sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 77.5%, positive predictive value 78% and negative predictive value 91.2%. In those with prior abdominal surgery, these results were 96.7%, 71.9%, 76.3% and 95.8% respectively. CT is highly effective in detecting bowel obstruction cases that do not require operation and also in predicting those cases that actually do. These measures are slightly improved when selecting patients with previous abdominal surgery. CT scanning may therefore be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm for acute bowel obstruction. Future studies may benefit from more standardised assessment criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder predominantly affecting females. Females with the MECP2 mutations exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from classical Rett syndrome to asymptomatic carriers. Mutations of genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) and forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) are also found in early onset RTT variants. Here, we present the first report of a female patient with RTT-like phenotype caused by SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankylin repeat domain 3) mutation, indicating that the clinical spectrum of SHANK3 mutations may extend to RTT-like phenotype in addition to (severe) developmental delay, absence of expressive speech, autistic behaviors and intellectual disability. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies, using reflective skin markers, are commonly used to investigate equine neck motion in equitation science and for rehabilitation purposes. In order to interpret the registrations accurately, the degree of skin displacement has been described for the limbs and back, but not for the neck. The aim of the present study was to investigate the degree of skin displacement in the equine neck. Methods Radiopaque skin markers were applied to the skin over the first six cervical vertebrae of six healthy horses. Radiographs were taken in three standardized neck positions in the sagittal plane: control (horizontal neck), ?on the bit? and ?nose to carpus?. The scales of the images were normalized and calculation of skin displacement was performed by use of a coordinate system, dividing the displacement into measurements on an x-axis parallel to the vertebra's longitudinal axis and a y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis. The non-parametric paired Wilcoxon rank test was employed to study the differences in distances in x- and y-directions, and statistical significance was set to P<0.05. Results Between control and ?nose to carpus? positions, there were significant differences in the marker locations, related to the underlying vertebra, in x-line for C1?6, and in y-line for C3?6. The differences in marker locations were between 3?±?9 and 44?±?14?mm, depending on the marker. Conclusions The outcome of this study indicates that skin displacement is an important factor to consider when investigating equine neck motion with skin marker methodology. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by a local Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments (Uppsala, Sweden), with written consent from the horse owners. Sources of funding:?none.

AB  - Introduction Rider preference appears to be a large factor determining the selection of an arena surface. The negative reaction of the competitors to the surface used for the Olympic test event in 2011 was sufficient to initiate a change in the surface composition used for the Olympic equestrian events in 2012. The aim of this study was to quantify surface characteristics that riders perceive to be the most favoured in a training and competition venue. Methods A survey was used to ask riders (n?=?342) to describe characteristics that they liked about their favourite venue across Northern England. The two most popular surfaces (both well-established wax, sand and fibre) were harrowed before being measured at several plots. An Orono Biomechanical Surface Tester and traction device were used to compare the functional properties of the two surfaces. The respondent's reasons for choosing their favourite venue were associated with specific surface measures including peak load, rebound timing and traction. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to establish differences between venues. Results The favourite venue was selected because the surface was not too deep or slippery and provided good support, spring and cushioning. The peak load (P?=?0.002) and traction (P>0.001) were significantly higher on the favourite surface compared to the second favourite (18.99?kN vs.17.29?kN and 20?Nm vs.19?Nm respectively). Conclusions Higher peak load values may be responsible for supporting a good performance and higher traction values could explain why riders felt that the surface was not ?slippery?, although this may have negative effects on the horse. The results suggest there is potential to quantify rider preferences. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an ethics committee at the University of Central Lancashire (reference number: BuSH 057).

AB  - Introduction The biomechanical effects of training on gait in the Thoroughbred are not fully understood. We aimed to assess the effect of training, surface and incline on stride parameters. Methods 40 two-year-old Thoroughbred racehorses entering training were recruited and followed from December 2012 until September 2013. Gait analysis was performed at eleven time points by equipping each horse with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with inbuilt GPS, mounted on the dorsum immediately caudal to the most caudal palpable lumbar dorsal spinous process. Horses were exercised as per their regular training regimen on a variety of training surfaces and inclines. Data were analysed using custom software written in Matlab (Mathworks, UK), and statistical analysis was performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Austria). A linear mixed model was used, with horse as a random effect and weeks in training, training surface, curve and incline as fixed effects. Results A total of 85,497 strides at speeds of between 6.00 and 19.03?ms-1 were analysed. Stride length increased by 0.33?m ±?4.3?x?104 with each 1?ms-1 increase in velocity. Training causes a reduction in stride length of 0.004?±?0.0001?m per week and an increase in stride frequency of 1.29?x?103?± 4.1?x?105 per week. Shallow inclines, steep inclines and declines cause a decrease in stride length of 0.07?±?0.003?m, 0.10?±?0.005?m and 0.04?±?0.004?m respectively. Turf and peat moss training surfaces caused an increase in stride length of 0.03?±?0.004?m and 0.06?±?0.007?m respectively. Conclusions This study provides an insight into the effects of external factors on the gait of young Thoroughbreds in training. Ongoing research will further investigate these effects and interactions. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

AB  - Introduction Ultrasonography is used for functional assessment of deep peri-vertebral muscles in people with neck pain. This study evaluated intra-operator and inter-operator reliability and repeatability of ultrasound image acquisition (US) and muscle cross-sectional area measurement (CSA) of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the equine cervical spine. Methods Two US operators independently acquired 60 unilateral US images per horse from 5 standing horses (mean?±?SD: age: 12.1?±?10.5 years) at spinal levels C3-C6 (m. multifidus) and C2-C5 (m. longus colli). Each operator traced each image blindly three times (n?=?360 per operator) to calculate CSA. ANOVA analysis compared CSA across all subjects within and between operators for effects of vertebral level, reliability of image acquisition and repeatability of CSA calculation. Results Intra-operator results for m. multifidus were 72% (ICC) and 5% (CV), and 90% (ICC) and 4% (CV) between operators. Image acquisition was unreliable at C6. Intra-operator results for m. longus colli were 100% (ICC) and 0% (CV), and 77% (ICC) and 0% (CV) between operators. Image acquisition was unreliable at C2. CSA for both muscles was largest at C4 and C5. Conclusions Ultrasonography could be used reliably and repeatably for CSA measurement of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the mid-cervical spine of the horse. Further studies will determine reliability across time and CSA side-side symmetry in horses with neck pain.

AB  - Introduction Hydrotherapy is increasingly applied within the equine industry for rehabilitation and therapy. Substantial anecdotal evidence exists suggesting the benefits of its application but while there is extensive literature on the use of aqua-treadmills in humans and canines there is comparatively little in equines. Therefore, limited research exists supporting the role of the aqua-treadmill in current therapy practices. This study aimed to investigate the effect of water depth on pelvic movement during aqua-treadmill exercise. Methods Eight horses were trotted on an aqua-treadmill at four water depths specifically measured to individual horses (P3, fetlock, MC3, carpus). Pelvic displacement was recorded using an optical motion capture system to collect coordinates from markers placed on the tuber sacrale, tuber coxae, withers and lumbar spine. Data were processed using custom written scripts (Matlab?) and ANOVA was performed. Results All subjects demonstrated a significant increase in vertical displacement of the pelvis as water depth increased from P3 to carpus while displacement symmetry was not significantly altered with a change in water depth. Conclusions The common practice of increasing water depth to intensify the physical demands of the exercise while maintaining the desired movement symmetry is supported. Having knowledge of how a horse moves on an aqua-treadmill is vital for tailoring specific therapy in order to most successfully rehabilitate the horse from injury. Investigation of the effects of increasing water depth on asymmetric horses should be carried out to further support its application as a tool for rehabilitation.

Owner consent was granted for all subjects and all horses were handled in compliance with British Horse Society standards throughout the trials.

AB  - Introduction Exercising horses one, two, or three times per week during 6 weeks using two intervals with near-maximal speed over 100?m elicited a decrease of VLa4, a widely accepted parameter of fitness and competitive success of horses (speed at which, under defined conditions, the blood lactate concentration reaches 4?mmol/l). Therefore, two field studies were performed to examine the possibility of avoiding decline in VLa4 with this type of exercise. Methods Study 1) 6 horses were submitted to the same exercise as above once per week during the first 2 weeks of a conditioning period (CP) adding one interval in each exercise session every 2 weeks for the following 6 weeks. Study 2) 6 horses did the same as horses in study 1 plus once per week an exercise bout at their individual VLa2 during 35 minutes. Before, every 2 weeks during, and 2 weeks after the CP, horses were subjected to standardized exercise tests to determine their VLa4 (and VLa2 where convenient) and maximal speed (speedmax). The effect of conditioning on VLa4 and speedmax was examined using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Fisher's test. Results In study 1 mean VLa4 declined during the first 4 weeks of CP but increased to the initial level thereafter (P<0.05) while speedmax remained the same over time. In study 2 VLa4 decreased continuously (P<0.01) while speedmax increased (P<0.01). Conclusions The results might be important to train horses racing over different distances.

AB  - Introduction Polo is a popular sport; teams compete in matches comprising 4?6 chukkas, each between 7?10 minutes. Players commonly change ponies between chukkas, but changing within a chukka, known as ?half-chukkering? is permitted. This is believed to ?save? the horse by preventing fatigue and facilitating recovery. This study evaluated the impact of half versus full chukka playing strategies in low goal polo; team handicap 0?4 goals. Methods Resting heart rates (HR) were established for 48 polo-ponies deemed of comparable fitness by riders, competing in low-goal tournaments; riders selected their playing strategy either full-chukka (n?=?32) or half-chukkering (n?=?16). HR was recorded at the end of play and during recovery; for the full-chukka and 2nd half-chukka period at +2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 minutes, and until ponies returned to play after the 1st half-chukka, >6 minutes. ANOVA analyses investigated HR variation during recovery between ponies playing full-chukkas and the 2nd half-chukka period, and within the two half-chukkas played. Results At the end of play, full-chukka horses? mean HR were 95?±?13.1?bpm, compared to their 2nd half-chukka counterparts at 103?±?7.7?bpm, which was not significant. Significant differences in HR did occur throughout the subsequent recovery period: at 2 minutes (P<0.003) and between 4?20 minutes (P<0.0001), with full-chukka ponies recovering faster. No differences occurred during recovery between the two half-chukka periods although mean HR differed at the end of play (1st: 100?±?7.7?bpm; 2nd: 103?±?7.8?bpm). Conclusions Playing strategies influence cardiovascular recovery; full-chukka ponies recover faster than those playing in consecutive half-chukkas. Preparation of half-chukka ponies may predispose to reduced fitness levels compared to full-chukka ponies. Implementing a full-chukka playing strategy is advocated to optimise pony welfare and performance in low-goal polo.

AB  - Introduction In an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) for Icelandic horses, gaits are scored from 5?10 and there is an option for judges to add standardized comments on the gaits. The aim of this study was to test if comments given on pace were related to horses? plasma lactate concentration (Lac) post BEFT, with the hypothesis that some of the comments would be related to Lac. Methods Data was collected from 157 horses (age 4?11 years) at a BEFT in Iceland in 2011. Venous blood samples were obtained after exercise and lactate concentration determined. Judges? comments were obtained from Worldfengur. The comments that could be given were: ?good speed?, ?clear beat?, ?sure?, ?big movements?, ?good suspension?, ?long strides? (positive comments); and ?lack of speed?, ?unsure?, ?four-beat?, ?short strides?, ?changing gait? and ?jumping out of gait? (negative comments). Results were separated into two groups (within each comment); horses/pace with the comment and horses/pace without the comment. Data were analysed via ANOVA (Proc GLM, SAS) including sex, age group, comment, average speed and distance (P<0.05). Results Lac was higher when pace had comments ?good speed? and ?sure? than when no comment was given (23.6?±?1.2 vs. 17.9?±?0.5, P<0.001; and 20.2?±?0.9 vs. 18.1?±?0.6, P<0.05) and was lower when pace had comments ?lack of speed? and ?unsure? (16.8?±?1.0 vs. 19.2?±?0.6; and 16.2?±?1.0 vs. 19.3?±?0.5, P<0.05). No other significant effects on Lac were observed. Conclusions Horses with pace subjectively judged as fast and ?sure? had higher blood lactate concentration indicating that successful pace is more anaerobic than less successful pace.

AB  - Introduction In chuckwagon racing, dubbed the ?half-mile of hell?, teams often race multiple consecutive days. Horses are in peak condition, however rare cases of sudden death attributed to cardiovascular failure occur. There are concerns regarding cumulative racing and its impact on the risk of sudden death. The objective was to determine if cumulative exercise affects integrity of the myocardium, assessed by high-sensitivity troponin-T (cTnT), and if the presence of arrhythmias during race or recovery affects plasma cTnT concentrations. Methods Heart rate and electrical activity were recorded on 148 horses (9?±?2.7 years) during racing days 1 and 2. 750 plasma samples were analysed (374 pre-exercise, 376 post-exercise) comparing cTnT before and after activity (paired t-test). Associations between consecutive racing days, age and cTnT were analysed (ANOVA, Pearson Correlation). The relationship between arrhythmias and cTnT was also examined. Results cTnT increased significantly with exercise (pre: 4.52?ng/L?±?0.17, post: 5.20?ng/L?±?0.23, P<0.001). However cTnt was not affected by cumulative exercise. A correlation between age and cTnT was found. 4235 arrhythmic events were recorded. No association existed between cTnT (post-exercise) and the presence of arrhythmias during exercise and recovery. Conclusions This is the first study examining the effect of exercise on high-sensitivity cTnT in horses and first large-scale study on chuckwagon horses. Racing increases cTnT, however values remain low, suggesting myocardial damage of little clinical significance. Chuckwagon horses have long careers therefore age and cTnT could be further examined. cTnT was not affected by the presence of arrhythmias during exercise, indicating chuckwagon racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction Heart rate (HR) and blood lactate (LAC) are biomarkers whose responses to exercise are related to physical fitness. This study evaluated the cost of transport (CT) by assessing the cardiovascular and metabolic efficiency of jumping horses using an incremental jumping test. Methods Sixteen Brazilian Sport horses of two fitness levels were used: high-level jumpers (HL, n?=?8) and low-level jumpers (LL, n?=?8). Tests were performed in a sandy jumping arena at a mean velocity of 18?km/h; the tests were distributed into three steps of 4?laps of 74?m, each with 10 obstacles. Each stage consisted of simple obstacles that were 0.40, 0.60 and 0.80?m high. The costs of transport were determined as (HRstep-HRrest/speed) and (LACstep-LACrest/speed). During intervals between each stage, blood samples were drawn to determine LAC (mmol/L). Student's t-test was used for the unpaired samples (P<0.05). Results There was no difference in the stage 0.40?m for HR. There were differences in the HL and LL groups, respectively, in the HR related to the effort in the obstacle series 0.60?m [1.7?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) and 2.0?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) (P?=?0.02)]; 0.80?m [1.5?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) and 1.7?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h); (P?=?0.04)], and in the LAC for the 0.40?m obstacle [0.05?±?0.04?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.10?±?0.03?mmol/L/(km/h); P?=?0.04]; 0.60?m [0.07?±?0.06?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.14?±?0.03?mmol/L/(km/h); (P?=?0.006)] and 0.80?m [0.11?±?0.04?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.19?±?0.05?mmol/L/(km/h); P?=?0.009]. Conclusions The CT differentiated horses of high and low level jumping fitness. The HR method (rather than LAC) is particularly useful because it is simple, inexpensive and accessible to trainers and veterinarians.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Combinations of α2-adrenoceptor and opioid agonists are commonly used in equines, but there is little scientific information on this topic in donkeys. Objectives To compare the sedative and hypoalgesic effects of 4 dosages of butorphanol in xylazine-premedicated donkeys. Study design In vivo experiment. Methods Six donkeys received intravenous treatments: saline and saline (S-S); xylazine (0.5?mg/kg bwt) and saline (X-S); xylazine and butorphanol 10??g/kg bwt (X-B10); xylazine and butorphanol 20??g/kg bwt (X-B20); xylazine and butorphanol 30??g/kg bwt (X-B30); and xylazine and butorphanol 40??g/kg bwt (X-B40). Sedation score (0?3), head height above ground (HHAG), and mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNT) of the left metacarpus were assessed before and for 120?min after treatment. Areas under the curve (AUC) for 0?30, 30?60 and 60?120?min post treatment were computed for sedation scores (SS-AUC), HHAG (HHAG-AUC) and MNT (MNT-AUC). Differences between treatments were analysed using the Friedman test followed by Dunn's test and repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results All treatments except S-S induced sedation. Butorphanol treatments induced significantly greater SS-AUC0?30 values than those for S-S (P<0.05), but S-S and X-S SS-AUC0?30 values were not significantly different. The HHAG-AUC0?30 values for all treatments were smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.001). For HHAG-AUC30-60, only X-B40 values were significantly smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.05). Compared to S-S, all treatments increased MNT and yielded significantly higher MNT-AUC0?30 values (P<0.001). Treatment X-S yielded significantly lower MNT-AUC0?30 values than those for X-B30 and X-B40 (P<0.05). Only MNT-AUC30?60 values for X-B30 and X-B40 were higher than those for S-S and X-S (P<0.05). Conclusions Xylazine induced sedation and mechanical hypoalgesia that were enhanced by adding butorphanol at 40??g/kg bwt. This drug combination may be suitable for chemical restraint of donkeys undergoing clinical procedures.

AB  - Peripheral neurotoxicity is a severe side effect of several effective antineoplastic drugs. Different attempts have been previously performed in order to reduce the neurotoxicity of antineoplastic compounds, but so far an effective neuroprotective treatment is not available. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) is a natural occurring compound with a neuroprotective activity in several experimental paradigms and in clinical use for the treatment of painful neuropathies. In this study we have tested in two rat models the hypothesis that ALC may have a protective role on cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments in different tumor systems indicated the lack of interference of ALC in the antitumor effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel. ALC co-treatment was able to significantly reduce the neurotoxicity of both cisplatin and paclitaxel in well-established rat models and this effect was correlated with a modulation of the plasma levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the cisplatin model. The protective effect of ALC was confirmed also in in vitro studies on differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, where ALC treatment counteracted the paclitaxel and cisplatin-induced cell damage, as measured by reduction of neurite elongation. In a search for the mechanism(s) of ALC neuroprotection, the transcriptional profile of gene expression in PC12 cells determined by microarray analysis indicated that ALC, in the presence of NGF, was able to modulate various genes relevant in the tissue-specific toxicity, such as NGFI-A. Moreover, we observed that labeled acetyl groups derived from ALC were transferred into histones and that cells co-treatment with NGF and ALC increased the level of histones H4 acetylation. These findings suggest that up-regulation of genes implicated in the protection against specific damage induced by neurotoxic agent may be the result of modulation of histone acetylation mediated by transfer of ALC acetyl groups. Overall, these results provide the first evidence that ALC is a neuroprotective agent acting through a novel mechanism that appears to be important for counteracting the chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity secondary to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment.
