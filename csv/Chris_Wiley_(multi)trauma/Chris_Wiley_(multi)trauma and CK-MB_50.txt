AB  - Summary Odontogenic cysts occur in tooth-bearing regions of the jaw and are lined by odontogenic epithelium, including residual dental lamina, reduced enamel epithelium, and remnants of the epithelial root sheath. This chapter discusses the specific types of odontogenic cysts. It also discusses specific radiologic features as they pertain to a particular type of odontogenic cyst. Histopathologic examination plays a critical role in the diagnosis of odontogenic cysts. When sampled with the cyst lining as part of a biopsy sample, bone within the cyst wall is usually mildly proliferative, organized woven bone. The pathogenesis is initiated by endodontic disease, which is followed by inflammation at the root apex, bone loss, proliferation of residual epithelium, and fluid transport into the lumen of an epithelium-lined cavity. The risk of tumor development within odontogenic cysts is regularly referenced in both the human and veterinary literature on odontogenic cysts.

AB  - Inclusion body myopathy (IBM) is a myopathy causing asymmetric proximal and distal limb muscle involvement in patients over 50 years. Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving upper and lower motor neuron in the spinal cord and brainstem, characterized by progressive muscle weakness resulting in paralysis. The pathogenesis of cell injury in both diseases is still unknown: several hypothesis have been proposed addressing viral, autoimmunity, genetic and oxidation stress factors. We report on 2 cases with clinical presentation of upper and/or lower motor neuron involvement and histopathological diagnosis of IBM. Case 1: a 68 years old man with an 18-month history of progressive weakness, spasticity, dysarthria, dysphagia. Neurological examination showed generalized muscle weakness, wasting of the finger flexors and quadriceps, fasciculations, deep tendon hyperreflexia. Electromyography (EMG) showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at limbs and tongue muscles. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced cMAP amplitude at the legs, Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) revealed marked pyramidal tract involvement. Blood examination showed increased E.S.R. with normal level of serum creatinine kinase, copper, ceruloplasmin, and iron. Antiganglioside antibodies titer was normal and blood lactate analysis showed normal values during exercise. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed increased protein level. Brain magnetic resonance imaging disclosed of involvement of the cortico-spinal tract and deposits of paramagnetic material in the basal ganglia with normal dopaminergic receptorial SPECT binding. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with ?rimmed vacuoles?. Case 2: a 64 years old woman with 20 month history of muscle weakness slowly progressing from upper to lower limbs. Neurological examination showed distal muscle weakness and wasting at the upper limbs, deep tendon hypo-areflexia. EMG showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at four limbs. MEP and nerve conduction studies were normal but H reflex and F late responses were absent. E.S.R. was increased, while antiganglioside antibodies titer, thyroid hormones dosage and CSF examination were normal. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with rare ?rimmed vacuoles?. These case reports, although not nosologically defined, confirm the clinical variability of the IBM and rise questions on the possible mechanisms of neuronal damage in motor neuron syndromes.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Since 2010, the OIE expert surveillance panel (ESP) recommends that EI vaccines contain representative equine influenza virus (EIV) strains from the Florida clade 1 and 2 sub-lineages for optimal protection against EIV currently circulating worldwide. To date, no EI vaccine commercially available in the EU meets this recommendation. Objectives This report summarises the development process of a fully updated recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, including clinical efficacy results against EIV strain A/eq/Richmond/1/07. Study design The EI vaccine ProteqFlu containing 2 recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin of EIV strains was updated by replacing the A/eq/Newmarket/2/93 strain with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 isolate (Florida clade 2 sub-lineage) and keeping A/eq/Ohio/03 (Florida clade 1 sub-lineage), to meet the last OIE recommendations. The updated EI vaccine was tested for efficacy in the Welsh mountain pony model. Methods The mode of action, production steps and efficacy of the updated EI vaccine will be presented. Efficacy was tested in a group of 7 ponies vaccinated twice, 5 weeks apart. Protective antibody response were measured and challenged by experimental infection with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 EIV strain. Clinical signs of disease and virus shedding were compared with control unvaccinated ponies (n?=?7). Results Significant protection was measured in vaccinated ponies, which supports the vaccine registration. Conclusions The recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine was already the first EI vaccine to meet the 2004 OIE ESP recommendations and was successfully used in Australia during the 2007 EI outbreak. This new version will be the first fully updated EI vaccine available in the EU, which will help to minimise the increasing risk of vaccine breakdown due to constant EIV evolution through antigenic drift. EI vaccination remains one of the most effective tools to prevent or limit the impact of EI, as clearly illustrated by the limited frequency and scale of EI outbreaks.

AB  - Abstract Background: Surgical repair of critical coarctation can be problematic in premature, critical, complex, or early postoperative neonates. Objectives: We aimed to review our experience with stent implantation to defer urgent surgery to an elective time. Methods: Fifteen neonates with severe aortic coarctation: five premature-hypotrophic (1,400?2,000 g), six critical and complex cardiac malformation, four early (1 day [0?2 days]; median [range]) after surgical coarctectomy or complex arch reconstruction. Bare coronary stents (diameter 4.0 [3.5?5.0] mm; length 10 [8?16] mm) were used. Stents were removed surgically depending on clinical needs. Results: Adequate aortic flow was obtained in 15 patients. The femoral artery was preserved in 13/15 patients. Two deaths occurred before stent removal and were nonprocedure related. In patients with simple stented coarctation, the stent was removed after 2.8 [0.2?5.0] months. In complex cardiac malformation, stents were finally removed 3.0 [0.2?78] months after implantation. Surgical technique: simple coarctectomy end-to-end in eight, extensive arch patch reconstruction in four. One patient is awaiting stent removal. The final maximum systolic velocity (cw-Doppler) across the aortic arch was 1.7 [1.2?2.5] m/sec. Conclusions: In premature/critical/complex neonates with severe coarctation, bailout stenting followed by early or late surgical coarctectomy appears a promising concept. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Commingling of horses from various populations, together with stress associated with transport and confinement at a sales complex, may predispose horses to EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Current information on the prevalence and associated risk factors of EHV-1 and -4 in South Africa is limited. Relevant research could enhance scientific-based risk management strategies for horses attending sales events. Objectives Detect nasal shedding of EHV-1 and -4 at a sales event. Identify the temporal pattern of viral shedding. Investigate the association between clinical signs and EHV-1 and -4 shedding. Identify risk factors for EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Data was collected over a 9 day period during August 2013 at the National Two Year Old Sales in Germiston, South Africa. The study population included 90 Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) in their second year of life that originated from 8 studs situated in 3 provinces. Nasal swabs were collected from each horse on arrival and on departure from the event. During their stay horses were monitored twice daily for pyrexia and once daily for nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected daily from any horse with nasal discharge and/or pyrexia. Nasal swabs were submitted for qPCR to detect EHV-1 and -4. Results No EHV-1 shedding was detected; however, 14.4% of the population shed EHV-4. A biphasic shedding pattern with peaks one day post arrival and on the first day of auction was observed. Pyrexia, with or without nasal discharge, was observed prior to first shedding in 61.5% of EHV-4-positive horses. Province, associated longer travel duration and smaller resident horse populations on farms of origin were associated with increased risk of EHV-4 shedding. Conclusions Young Thoroughbreds consigned to a South African sale shed EHV-4. Pyrexia proved useful to identify impending EHV-4 shedding. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of the University of Pretoria (Study V040-13). Informed, written consent for participation was obtained from the owners of each of the studs included in the study. Sources of funding:?Funding for this study was provided by Racing South Africa and the Departments of Companion Animal Clinical Studies and Production Animal Clinical Studies, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria.

AB  - Abstract We report a case of a 76-year-old man presenting with a 12-month history of a solitary lesion on his scalp. The histopathology was consistent with a grade 2/3 osteosarcoma extending to the subcutis. Full-body imaging excluded any involvement of the underlying bony tissue or solid organ malignancy, thus a diagnosis of primary cutaneous osteosarcoma (PCO) was made. Given the exceedingly rare nature of PCO, we discuss the clinico-pathological features of this case and those previously reported in the literature.

AB  - The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on soft tissue are not well characterized. This study utilized a diabetic wound model to examine the effects of PEMF effects on soft tissue healing. Methods: Wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db and wild type C57BL6 mice. Mice were exposed to PEMF (4.5?ms pulse/15?hz) for 8?hrs/day for 14 days. Gross closure was assessed with digital analysis of area changes over time. Histological examination assessed granulation and epithelial gap, cell proliferation (BrdU), and endothelial cell density (CD31). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in the presence or absence of PEMF for 8?hrs and VEGF/FGF2 was measured in culture supernatants by ELISA. Results: Mice exposed to PEMF had accelerated wound closure at day 7 (wound area as % of original, db/db: 60%(PEMF) vs. 78%(control), C57BL6: 15% vs. 42%, p?<?0.05) and day 14 (db/db: 21% vs. 55%, C57BL6: 8% vs. 28%, p?<?0.05), with increased granulation and cell proliferation (db/db day 7: 52?±?8 vs. 31?±?5 cells/HPF (200x)). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly higher CD31 density in wounds exposed to PEMF at day 7 (vessels/HPF, db/db: 28?±?4 vs. 17?±?4, C57BL6: 41?±?7 vs. 28?±?6) and day 14 (db/db: 32?±?6 vs. 21?±?5, C57BL6: 48?±?5 vs. 40?±?5). HUVECs in PEMF exhibited 5-fold higher levels of FGF2 compared to controls after 30?min (20.50?pg/ml?±?6.75 vs. 4.25?pg/ml?±?0.75), with no change in VEGF through 8?hrs. Conclusions: PEMF accelerates closure time and endothelial cell proliferation in wound healing. Upregulation of FGF2 in HUVECs exposed to PEMF suggests that release of angiogenic growth factors may explain increased vascular density and accelerated wound closure. Clinical uses include treatment for diabetic ulcers and other non-healing wounds. This work is supported in part by the Alumni Fund, Alumni Association of SUNY Downstate College of Medicine (MJC).

AB  - A 60?y.o. female was investigated for progressive distal paresthesias, which had started a few years before. Neurological examination revealed mild sensory ataxia, areflexia in lower limbs with normal motor function. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable; autoantibodies to non-organ-specific, extractable nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were absent and CSF was normal; neurophysiologic findings showed absent sural sensory responses. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a complete depletion of large and small myelinated fibers without aspects of regeneration; no vascular or perivascular inflammation nor changes suggestive of vasculitis were detected. Salivary gland biopsy showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Late systemic manifestations included dry skin, xerophtalmia and arthralgias. Severe sensory neuropathy is rarely associated with Sjögren syndrome. It occurs more frequently in female patients and its major pathologic process is believed to be a dorsal root ganglionitis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) can be troublesome, but early recognition and knowledge of risk factors are primordial for prevention and control. Objectives 1) Improvement of early clinical recognition, and 2) identification of factors potentially of importance for spread. Study design Retrospective descriptive study of EHM cases and statistical comparison to acutely neurologically affected horses negative for EHM. Methods Files from a French epidemiosurveillance programme for equine infectious neurological diseases (2008?2011) were reviewed. Cases were considered EHM (n?=?26) based on presence of acute neurological signs and laboratory confirmation. Cases were considered control cases (n?=?29) when reported to be suffering from acute neurological diseases, but negative for EHM. A subgroup of controls was created that excluded cases with peripheral neuromuscular diseases (n?=?21). Univariate and multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree analysis between groups were performed to identify diagnostic markers and risk factors. Results EHM had a fatality rate of 46% and occurred often in isolated cases. They frequently showed ataxia, paresis and cauda equina affection, but the clinical picture was variable. Univariate analysis identified the following variables as more associated to EHM than to control groups: new horse introduced in herd, vaccination, cauda equina affection, larger herd size, and saddle horses. In the multivariate analysis, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection could be retained. CART analyses identified herd size, month of occurrence, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection as main predictors for EHM. Conclusions Isolated EHM cases occur frequently, accentuating the diagnostic difficulty. History and clinical examination of acutely neurologically affected horses can potentially improve early recognition of EHM. Risk factors were in accordance with other studies, although in a different geographic location and study setup, and therefore strengthen their importance for spread of EHM.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes mellitus, causing severe and prolonged morbidity. However, clinical and experimental studies have reported that careful glucose control may prevent, stabilize, and/or reverse neuropathy and other chronic diabetic complications. Unfortunately, insulin therapy does not prevent the development or progression of chronic lesions in the vessels, kidneys, eyes, or nerves of the diabetic patient. There is great interest in investigating other forms of endocrine replacement therapy, such as transplantation of the pancreas or of the islets of Langerhans (IT). Diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) evolution is characterized by progressive demyelination and axonal loss and is manifested by signs and symptoms on physical examination and abnormalities in nerve conduction studies (NCS). NCS provide reliable, noninvasive, objective measures of peripheral nerve function and constitute the most important technique for the evaluation of the severity of DP in clinical trials. Several research groups have demonstrated that skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is another method minimally invasive and repeatable that provides direct pathologic evidence of axonal damage in diabetic neuropathy. Fifty-one consecutive IDDM patients with or without end stage renal disease were enrolled at the moment of islet (Is), kidney (KD), kidney-pancreas (KP) or kidney-islet (KI) transplantation. Patients underwent skin biopsy punch, neurologic examination and neurophysiological investigation. Particularly, 20?pts underwent KP tx, 16?KD tx, 10 islet tx and 5 KI. The patients were comparable for duration of diabetes, dialysis (when present), age, lipid profile. In half of the patients a follow-up of 2 years has been reached. After KP tx, and partially with KI, a complete normalization of glycometabolic control has been achieved, with statistically lower HbA1c in comparison with KD group (KP?=?6.2; 0.1% vs. KD?=?8.4; 0.5%; p?<?0.01). In the KI/Is group, a long-term restoration of islet endocrine function has been achieved, with insulin independence. When this has been lost, a persistent secretion of C-peptide was shown for a long period of time. This was correlated with a global improvement quality of life and vascular structure. Preliminary results will be presented.

AB  - Abstract Background Incorporation of bone substitute material into the extraction socket could minimize the edentulous ridge volume loss or maximize the bone formation within the healing area. Purpose The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness in maintaining the volumetric contour of fresh extraction sockets grafted with or without 2 types of porcine biomaterials and covered with a resorbable barrier. Materials and Methods In the present multi-center single-blind randomized control trial, 55 patients underwent 1-tooth extraction, were surveyed, and randomly allocated to control- (25 sites, nat-group) or test groups (15 sites grafted with pre-hydrated collagenated cortico-cancellous porcine bone, coll-group, and 15 with cortical porcine bone, cort-group). Before extraction, and then 4 months later, contours of the sockets were acquired through a laser scanner, voxelized, and ghosts of each patient were superimposed with a matrix laboratory. Volumetric and area evaluations of the virtual superimposed models were performed with dentascan tools to create a volume of interest extending between the 2 residual teeth. Intra- and inter-group comparisons of the outcomes were performed. Non-parametric tests were applied with a level of significance set at P?<?.05. Results Intergroup analysis at 4 months' survey revealed that percentage loss of alveolar ridge volume of the coll-group (28.8%?±?8.8%) and of the cort-group (30.2%?±?7.1%) was significantly lower (P?<?.0001) than that of the naturally-healing group (46.4%?±?4.1%). No statistically-significant differences in outcomes were observed between the 2 test groups at any of the observation periods. Moreover, tooth position (bicuspids vs molars) seemed to affect neither volume loss nor basal shrinkage. Conclusion At the 4-month analysis both test groups showed reduced bone loss when compared to naturally healing sockets. However, the 2 grafting materials were not able to preserve the alveolar crest, and a reduction close to 30% in the estimates was registered after healing.

AB  - Abstract Ethnic differences and geographic variations affect the frequencies and nature of human mutations. In the literature, descriptions of causative mutations of eye diseases in the Chinese population are few. In this paper we attempt to reveal molecular information on genetic eye diseases involving Chinese patients from published and unpublished works by us and other groups. Our studies on candidate genes of eye diseases in the Chinese population in Hong Kong include MYOC and TISR for primary open angle glaucoma, RHO and RP1 for retinitis pigmentosa, ABCA4 and APOE for age-related macular degeneration, RB1 for retinoblastoma, APC for familial adenomatous polyposis with congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium, BIGH3/TGFBI for corneal dystrophies, PAX6 for aniridia and Reiger syndrome, CRYAA and CRYBB2 for cataracts, and mtDNA for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. We have revealed novel mutations in most of these genes, and in RHO, RP1, RB1, BIGH3, and PAX6 we have reported mutations that contribute to better understanding of the functions and properties of the respective gene products. We showed absence of MYOC does not necessarily cause glaucoma. No disease causative mutations have been identified in MYOC or ABCA4. There are similarities in the patterns of sequence alterations and phenotype?genotype associations in comparison with other ethnic groups, while the MYOC, RB1, APC, and PAX6 genes have more Chinese-specific sequence alterations. Establishment of a mutation database specific for the Chinese is essential for identification of genetic markers with diagnostic, prognostic, or pharmacological values.
