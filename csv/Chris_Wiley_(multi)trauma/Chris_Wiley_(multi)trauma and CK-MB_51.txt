AB  - Key points We have developed a novel porcine model of high-thoracic midline contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) at the T2 spinal level. We describe this model and the ensuing cardiovascular and neurohormonal responses, and demonstrate the model is efficacious for studying clinically relevant cardiovascular dysfunction post-SCI. We demonstrate that the high-thoracic SCI model, but not a low-thoracic SCI model, induces persistent hypotension along with a gradual reduction in plasma noradrenaline and increases in plasma aldosterone and angiotensin II. We additionally conducted a proof-of-concept long-term (12 weeks) survival study in animals with T2 contusion SCI demonstrating the potential utility of this model for not only acute experimentation but also long-term drug studies prior to translation to the clinic. Abstract Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population, especially in those with high-thoracic or cervical SCI. With this in mind, we aimed to develop a large animal (porcine) model of high-thoracic (T2 level) contusion SCI and compare the haemodynamic and neurohormonal responses of this injury against a low-thoracic (T10 level) model. Ten Yorkshire pigs were randomly subjected to 20 cm weight drop contusion SCI at either the T2 or the T10 spinal level. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored until 4 h post-SCI. Plasma noradrenaline (NA), aldosterone and angiotensin II (ANGII) were measured pre-SCI and at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min post-SCI. Additionally, two Yucatan pigs were subjected to T2-SCI and survived up to 12 weeks post-injury to demonstrate the efficacy of this model for long-term survival studies. Immediately after T2-SCI, SBP, MAP and HR increased (P < 0.0001). Between decompression (5 min post-SCI) and 30 min post-decompression in T2-SCI, SBP and MAP were lower than pre-SCI (P < 0.038). At 3 and 4 h after T2-SCI, SBP remained lower than pre-SCI (P = 0.048). After T10-SCI, haemodynamic indices remained largely unaffected. Plasma NA was lower in T2- vs. T10-SCI post-SCI, whilst aldosterone and ANGII were higher. Both chronically injured pigs demonstrated a vast reduction in SBP at 12 weeks post-SCI. Our model of T2-SCI causes a rapid and sustained alteration in neurohormonal control and cardiovascular function, which does not occur in the T10 model.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is a common equine distal axonopathy associated with neurogenic atrophy of intrinsic laryngeal muscles (particularly the left) causing laryngeal paresis and poor performance. An objective, reliable method of assessing changes in structure that correlates with laryngeal muscle function in vivo is necessary to determine response to novel treatments, including functional electrical stimulation. This study aimed to determine whether laryngeal muscle and nerve morphology (determined by CT and histopathology) correlated with laryngeal function. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Resting (grades 1?4) and exercising (grades A?C) laryngeal function was graded in adult Thoroughbred horses. Standing CT of the larynx was performed to compare volume, cross-sectional area (XSA) and tissue density between left and right cricoarytenoideus dorsalis (CAD) muscles in 22 horses. CAD muscles and recurrent laryngeal nerves were collected in a subgroup of 10 horses and analysed for fibrosis, fat infiltration and nerve fibre density (axons/?m2). Results Horses with grade C?RLN on exercising endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles and reduced nerve fibre density than horses with grades A or B. Horses with grade 4?RLN on resting endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles than horses with grades 1 or 2. Left CAD muscles had significantly more collagen than the right in horses with grade C?RLN. CT measurements of the CAD muscles were significantly associated with % collagen/fat and nerve fibre density (P<0.05). Conclusions Laryngeal CT results correlate with laryngeal function at rest and exercise in the horse and provide a noninvasive method of monitoring changes in CAD morphology in response to novel treatments. CAD CT appearance is dependent on % collagen and fat in the muscle and is associated with nerve fibre density. Ethical animal research:?Horses destined for euthanasia were recruited for this study with approval of the Institutional Ethical Committee and under UK Home Office Licence.

AB  - Abstract A common hallmark of age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases is an impairment of adult neurogenesis. Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt)/?-catenin (W?C) signalling is a vital pathway for dopaminergic (DAergic) neurogenesis and an essential signalling system during embryonic development and aging, the most critical risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, there is no known cause or cure for PD. Here we focus on the potential to reawaken the impaired neurogenic niches to rejuvenate and repair the aged PD brain. Specifically, we highlight W?C-signalling in the plasticity of the subventricular zone (SVZ), the largest germinal region in the mature brain innervated by nigrostriatal DAergic terminals, and the mesencephalic aqueduct-periventricular region (Aq-PVR) Wnt-sensitive niche, which is in proximity to the SNpc and harbors neural stem progenitor cells (NSCs) with DAergic potential. The hallmark of the W?C pathway is the cytosolic accumulation of ?-catenin, which enters the nucleus and associates with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors, leading to the transcription of Wnt target genes. Here, we underscore the dynamic interplay between DAergic innervation and astroglial-derived factors regulating W?C-dependent transcription of key genes orchestrating NSC proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. Aging, inflammation and oxidative stress synergize with neurotoxin exposure in ?turning off? the W?C neurogenic switch via down-regulation of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/Wnt-regulated signalosome, a key player in the maintenance of antioxidant self-defense mechanisms and NSC homeostasis. Harnessing W?C-signalling in the aged PD brain can thus restore neurogenesis, rejuvenate the microenvironment, and promote neurorescue and regeneration.

AB  - Abstract This randomized trial compared a strategy of direct stenting without predilatation (n = 39) with conventional stenting with predilatation (n = 42) in patients with suitable lesions in native vessels ≥ 2.5-mm diameter to be covered by either a 9- or 16-mm-length NIR Primo stent. Equipment cost [mean (median) ± SD] was less in those with direct stenting [$1,199 (979) ± 526] than in those with predilatation [$1,455 (1,285) ± 401, P < 0.001]. There was no significant difference in contrast use or fluoroscopy time. Procedural time was shorter in the direct stenting group. The clinical outcome at 1 month was satisfactory in both groups. In selected patients, a strategy of direct stenting is feasible, costs less, and is quicker to perform than the conventional strategy of stenting following predilatation. Cathet. Cardiovasc.

AB  - Background There continues to be uncertainty about the optimal approach to documenting bleeding data in platelet transfusion trials, with a desire to apply a common assessment tool across all trials. With this in mind, a consensus bleeding assessment tool (BAT) has been developed by the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) collaborative, based on review of data collection forms used in published randomized trials and following content validation with a range of healthcare professionals at seven haematology centres through BEST members. This study aimed to evaluate reliability and reproducibility of the consensus BAT. Methods Replicated clinical assessments of bleeding were undertaken by participants with haematological malignancies recruited at four haematology centres in an international, multicentred, observational study. Concordance of repeat assessments was calculated for agreement in site and grade of bleeding observed. Results Forty patients consented to participate, and 13 trained bleeding assessors collected these data. Bleeding assessments were carried out on 113 separate days. Of all 225 bleeding assessments, 204 were compared for grade concordance, and 160 were compared for site concordance. There was very good grade concordance (83%, 95% confidence interval 74?93%) and good bleeding site concordance (69%, 95% confidence interval 57?79%) in observations of bleeding. Discordance was primarily in relation to assessing skin bleeding. Conclusions Alongside a structured training programme, levels of concordance for a consensus BAT were high. Researchers using assessment tools for bleeding need to balance comprehensive data collection against potential loss of accuracy for some types of bleeding, such as skin findings.

AB  - Abstract Background: Saphenous vein graft (SVG) intervention is associated with a significant incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) related to distal vessel embolization. The FilterWire? distal embolic protection device has recently been approved as an adjunct to SVG intervention. We report here our initial experience in a single center in 30 consecutive patients using this device in SVG stenting. Hypothesis: This study examined the outcomes and complications associated with these devices, as well as whether proficiency with the devices increased with greater experience and whether there were measurable outcome differences between devices. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients in whom a FilterWire device was placed at our hospital between June 2001 and June 2004. Results: The device was successfully deployed in 29 of 30 patients, and all patients were stented successfully. Overall MACE rate was 6.6%, consistent with reports in larger multi-center clinical trials. Transient decreases in flow were noted while the device was in place in six patients, but improved in five patients with device removal. Conclusions: This early experience in a single center using FilterWire embolic protection indicates that excellent clinical results can be obtained by the adoption of filter protection for SVG intervention, without evidence for a detrimental learning curve.

AB  - Summary Parkes SE, Parke S, Manghan DC, Grimer RJ, Davies P, Morland BJ. Fifty years of paediatric malignant bone tumours in the West Midlands, UK, 1957?2006: incidence, treatment and outcome. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010. Malignant bone tumours in the paediatric age group (0?14 years) are uncommon; various aetiological theories exist and few reports of incidence, age and sex distributions have been published. We examined the incidence of childhood malignant bone tumours in one large single region of the UK over an extended period of 50 years. The West Midlands specialist regional children's tumour registry holds data on all malignancies and benign brain tumours in children under 15 years in the West Midlands region, which has a population of around 1 million children. Demographic and clinical data have been abstracted and diagnoses reviewed by a panel of expert pathologists. During the period 1957?2006, 259 cases of malignant paediatric bone tumours were diagnosed. There were 153 osteosarcomas, 78 Ewing sarcomas and 28 other primary bone tumours. The overall age standardised rate was 4.66, with no increase over time, although there was a significant increase in the incidence of Ewing sarcomas in the period 1965?92. Sixty-eight per cent of tumours were in patients over 10 years, whereas the incidence in patients under 10 years showed a non-significant increase. Survival rates increased dramatically post-chemotherapy introduction, with Ewing sarcoma demonstrating better survival overall. This is a large study giving an overview of malignant bone tumours in the childhood population of a single region over an extended period, showing results consistent with national reports. It also examines late effects, which were mostly mobility/orthopaedic, although almost one-fifth of patients had cardiac problems and five went on to develop second malignancies.

AB  - Background Women with intellectual disability are thought to be at increased risk of mental illness, yet little is known about resiliency factors supporting women's mental health. This article reports on such factors drawn from a study that aimed to address how women with intellectual disability experience their mental health and well-being. Materials and Methods Utilizing a broad qualitative approach, 25 New Zealand women, aged 21?65 years were interviewed about their life from childhood to the present, including, where relevant, their experience of mental illness. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. Results Resiliency factors aligned with the theme ?keeping mentally well?, subthemes of which were as follows: the importance of relationships with family and friends; keeping busy; and autonomy and happiness. Challenges for resiliency could be seen in the theme ?mental illness? where subthemes of abuse, long-term stress and medication were identified. Conclusions Many of the women demonstrated remarkable resiliency, despite setbacks and exposure to risks, provided they were nested within a supportive context. Those women who experienced major mental illness shared evidence of both higher risk factors and less support available at crucial times.

This chapter focuses on the clinical laboratory examinations used to screen, diagnose, predict, and monitor neurologic disorders in geriatric patients. As the goals of laboratory testing in this population overlap those of general laboratory testing, a brief section on test interpretation and general laboratory considerations precedes the sections devoted to neurologic disorders of geriatric patients. The neurologic disorders for which laboratory investigations are described in the chapter are: dementias (Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease), movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-plus syndromes), cerebrovascular disorders (infarction and hemorrhage), and other disorders such as headache and depression.

AB  - Objective We examined early first deployment and subsequent suicide attempt among U.S. Army soldiers. Method Using 2004?2009 administrative data and person-month records of first-term, Regular Army, enlisted soldiers with one deployment (89.2% male), we identified 1,704 soldiers with a documented suicide attempt during or after first deployment and an equal-probability control sample (n = 25,861 person-months). Results Logistic regression analyses indicated soldiers deployed within the first 12 months of service were more likely than later deployers to attempt suicide (OR = 1.7 [95% CI = 1.5?1.8]). Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, service-related characteristics, and previous mental health diagnosis slightly attenuated this association (OR = 1.6 [95% CI = 1.5?1.8]). Results were not modified by gender, deployment status, military occupation, or mental health diagnosis. The population-attributable risk proportion for deploying within the first 12 months of service was 17.8%. Linear spline models indicated similar risk patterns over time for early and later deployers, peaking at month 9 during deployment and month 5 postdeployment; however, monthly suicide attempt rates were consistently higher for early deployers. Conclusions Enlisted soldiers deployed within the first 12 months of service have elevated risk of suicide attempt during and after first deployment. Improved understanding of why early deployment increases risk can inform the development of policies and intervention programs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether preoperative electrocardiographic measurements linked to sympathetic nervous activity could be used to predict recovery quality after general anaesthesia in horses. Study design Prospective, clinical study. Animals Eighteen adult client-owned horses. Methods The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded presurgery in horses under three standard conditions: stabled unattended; with a groom whilst being led along a standard course; alone in the induction box. After surgery, each animal's recovery quality was scored by eight experienced anaesthetists or technicians using Donaldson's scoring system (2000). The digitized ECG recordings were analyzed for T-wave morphology, mean heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV) and HRV derivatives including mean R-R interval, standard deviation of normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive intervals (RMSSD), low (LF) and high frequency (HF) activity and the LF/HF ratio in both fast Fourier transformed and autoregressive spectra. Correlations between ECG variables and recovery score were examined using Spearman's rank correlation. Results There was no significant correlation between preanaesthetic ECG measurements and recovery quality. Conclusions Predictions of recovery quality after general anaesthesia in horses cannot be based on preanaesthetic ECG variables. Clinical relevance Measures other than those based on the ECG should be investigated as predictors of recovery quality.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are essential components of our defense and repair systems but also potentially harmful mediators of infectious and immunoinflammatory reactions. Clinically important cytokines function systemically as pleiotropic hormones with overlapping effects on many cell types. All engage in a complex network of agonists and antagonists. Some immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been found to be potent and specific regulators of cytokines. These antibodies bind interleukin (IL-1)α, IL-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interferon (IFN)-α/? with exceptional force. They neutralize their corresponding cytokines ex vivo and perhaps in vivo, although they may also function as cytokine carriers. The biological role of autoantibodies to cytokines is not yet understood, but they may provide a level of regulation not appreciated at present. Inappropriate production/function of such antibodies could be pathogenetically involved in immunoinflammatory and other diseases. Cytokine antibodies may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of human IgG therapy.
