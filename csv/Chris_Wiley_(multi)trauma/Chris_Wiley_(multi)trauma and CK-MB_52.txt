AB  - Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for the treatment of gouty arthritis, Behçet's disease and amyloidosis. Reported side effects, such as blood dyscrasias and gastroenteritis, are probably ascribed to its antimitotic properties. Colchicine-induced myopathy with vacuolar changes and frequently associated sensory-motor axonal neuropathy have also been described. A 52-yr-old woman, previously treated for gouty arthritis, persisted in self-administering colchicine intermittently for three years, in order to reduce body weight by inducing diarrhea. The patient had weakness and hypotrophy in upper and lower girdles and proximal muscles, ?stocking and glove? hypoesthesia and loss of deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. EMG examination showed a neurogenic/myogenic mixed pattern and nerve conduction studies were consistent with sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy, with autophagic vacuoles and associated neurogenic changes. A moderate loss of myelinated fibers and some degenerating axons were observed in sural nerve biopsy. There were neither demyelinating changes nor autophagic vacuoles within axons. Muscle and nerve findings were thus suggestive of colchicine neuromyopathy. The drug was withdrawn and clinical-electrophysiological data improved. Colchicine muscular toxicity is presumably due to inhibition of tubulin monomer polymerization. The microtubular network destabilization might cause cytoplasmic deposits of autophagic debris in skeletal muscle. We thus evaluated number, density and spatial array of microtubules in myelinated and unmyelinated axons by transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis was carried out on high magnification photographs in our patient biopsy and in control nerves (normal and with axonal loss). Decrease of microtubular density and increase of tangentially oriented microtubules were observed both in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. No neural deposits of tubulin-like material, as described in some cases of colchicine myopathy, were found. As in experimental vincristine neuropathy, cytoskeletal damage induced by colchicine seems related to effects of primary microtubular disarray on axonal transport and caliber, rather than to the extent of axonal loss.

AB  - Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for schizophrenia (Sz) and bipolar disorder (BP). Putative mechanisms include heritable genetic factors, de novo mutations, and epigenetic mechanisms. Few studies have explored phenotypic features associated with APA. The Genomic Psychiatry Cohort established a clinically characterized repository of genomic samples from subjects with a Sz-BP diagnosis or unaffected controls, 12,975 with parental age information. We estimated relative risk ratios for Sz, schizoaffective depressed and bipolar types (SA-D, SA-B), and BP with and without history of psychotic features (PF) relative to the control group, comparing each paternal age group to the reference group 20?24 years. All tests were two-sided with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Subjects with fathers age 45+ had significantly higher risk for all diagnoses except for BP w/o PF. APA also bore no significant relation to family psychiatric history. In conclusion, we replicated APA as a risk factor for Sz. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of APA in a BP sample stratified by psychosis history, extending this association only in BP w/PF. This suggests that phenotypic expression of the APA effect in Sz-BP spectrum is psychosis, per se, rather than other aspects of these complex disorders. The lack of a significant relationship between paternal age and familial disease patterns suggests that underlying mechanisms of the paternal age effect may involve a complex interaction of heritable and non-heritable factors. The authors discuss implications and testable hypotheses, starting with a focus on genetic mechanisms and endophenotypic expressions of dopaminergic function. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection there is high prevalence of numerous extrahepatic manifestations. Peripheral neuropathy (PN), in the form of symmetric polyneuropathy, asymmetric polyneuropathy, and multineuropathy, may be associated also with HCV infection and is usually related to mixed cryoglobulinemia (CG). However, some HCV+ patients with PN without CG were recently reported, suggesting a possible direct role of HCV in the pathogenesis of PN. From January 2000 to December 2002 we studied 50 HCV+ patients: 21 with symptomatic CG and 29 with chronic HCV without symptomatic CG (23 without CG, 5 with asymptomatic CG). Particular care was taken to exclude other possible causes of PN. Patients without symptomatic CG were examined before starting combined therapy with interferon-alpha and ribavirin, if needed. Fifteen patients with symptomatic CG had axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, 6 axonal sensorimotor multineuropathy or asymmetric polyneuropathy. Six HCV+ patients had other causes of PN (1 CIDP, 2 diabetes, 1 CIDP and diabetes, 1 alcoholism, 1 paraneoplastic with anti-Hu antibodies). No HCV+ patients without (symptomatic) CG or other possible causes of PN showed clinical and electrophysiological evidence of PN. Our study casts doubts on the existence of a PN directly caused by HCV and suggests that finding a PN in a HCV+ patient without CG should prompt to search for a different cause of PN.

AB  - Summary The Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family plays a central role in the generation and regulation of inflammatory responses, in both innate and adaptive immunity. Although the IL-1 molecules are traditionally considered to be classical proinflammatory cytokines, their functions are not restricted to inflammation, and they have also been shown to play a key role in a wide range of additional physiological and pathological functions, including learning modulation, sleep, pregnancy, depression, appetite, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and many others. Since their effect as cytokines and regulators of inflammation is so pleiotropic, any shift of the biological balance between agonistic and antagonistic signals has the potential to cause disease. Here, we consider the genetic influence of interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in the context of susceptibility to human diseases. We review known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-1 genes linked to human diseases, and suggest how exploring biological effects of IL-1 gene cluster polymorphism may lead to new directions in understanding and diagnostic of disease and effective treatment.

AB  - Abstract Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP or oxytocinase) is a membrane-bound zinc-metallopeptidase that cleaves neuroactive peptides in the brain and produces memory enhancing effects when inhibited. We have determined the crystal structure of human IRAP revealing a closed, four domain arrangement with a large, mostly buried cavity abutting the active site. The structure reveals that the GAMEN exopeptidase loop adopts a very different conformation from other aminopeptidases, thus explaining IRAP's unique specificity for cyclic peptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin. Computational docking of a series of IRAP-specific cognitive enhancers into the crystal structure provides a molecular basis for their structure?activity relationships and demonstrates that the structure will be a powerful tool in the development of new classes of cognitive enhancers for treating a variety of memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims The long-term clinical outcomes in initial survivors with acute liver failure (ALF) are not well known. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the 2-year clinical outcomes among initial survivors and liver transplant (LT) recipients that were alive 3 weeks after enrolment in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG). Methods Outcomes in adult ALFSG patients that were enrolled between 1998 and 2010 were reviewed. Results Two-year patient survival was significantly higher in the 262 LT recipients (92.4%) compared to the 306 acetaminophen (APAP) spontaneous survivors (SS) (89.5%) and 200 non-APAP SS (75.5%) (P < 0.0001). The causes of death were similar in the three groups but the time to death was significantly longer in the LT recipients (P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of 2-year mortality in the APAP group were a high serum phosphate level and patient age (c-statistic = 0.65 (0.54, 0.76)), patient age and days from jaundice to ALF onset in the non-APAP group (c-statistic = 0.69 (0.60, 0.78)), and patient age, days from jaundice, and higher coma grade in the LT recipients (c-statistic = 0.74 (0.61, 0.87)). The LT recipients were significantly more likely to be employed and have a higher educational level (P < 0.05). Conclusions Two-year outcomes in initial survivors of ALF are generally good but non-APAP patients have a significantly lower survival which may relate to pre-existing medical comorbidities. Spontaneous survivors with APAP overdose experience substantial morbidity during follow-up from ongoing psychiatric and substance abuse issues.

AB  - Unclassified neuropathies still represent a challenge for neurologists, since in about 20?30% of patients no cause can be identified after extensive investigations. In this context, some patients sharing peculiar features have been reported as to be grouped in a single entity termed Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy (CIAP). The onset occurs in middle to late adulthood, there is a predominant sensory involvement and progression is slow, usually not disabling. Electrophysiologic and pathological studies are consistent with a primary axonal injury. We describe five patients affected by adult-onset chronic ?idiopathic? axonal neuropathy with an unusual course characterized by severe disability. Onset occurred in the fifth-seventh decades with sensorimotor symptoms and signs involving both lower and upper limbs with a distal distribution. Over a 2?14 year follow-up, the disease showed a progressive course with severe muscle weakness and atrophy of semi-distal and distal muscles in all patients, and involvement of proximal muscles in four of them. Two patients died because of respiratory and heart failure. All five patients were sporadic. Extensive laboratory examination excluded identifiable causes of neuropathy. Nerve biopsy was carried out in all patients and showed an axonal neuropathy. Amyloid deposits were not observed in nerve sections nor in abdominal fat aspirate. In four patients, treatment with steroids and IVIg was unsuccessful. The nosology of acquired adult-onset axonal polyneuropathies is difficult to be drawn, since in most cases the etiology remains obscure. Our findings suggest that, in this not yet well defined group of neuropathies, different subtypes may exist and represent distinct entities.

AB  - Transthyretin-derived familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is the most common form of hereditary amyloidosis, often associated with multisystemic involvement and a poor prognosis. We studied four patients, aged between 43 and 68?yrs, with TTR-FAP. A severe somatic and autonomic polyneuropathy was seen in three patients, whereas one was at onset of the disease. In addition 2/4, aged 43 and 63 years old, had a mild central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Neurophysiological studies showed an axonal polyneuropathy and amyloid deposits were found in all sural nerve biopsies. Combined conventional MRI and proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) were performed in our patients and in 14 age-matched normal controls. Conventional MRI was normal in two patients and showed minimal white matter and subcortical lesions in the other two, who were 63 and 68 years old. Proton MRSI of the periventricular brain regions showed a large reduction in N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) resonance intensity (mean NAA/Cr in patients: 2.45?±?0.04; mean NAA/Cr in normal controls: 2.9?±?0.1; p?<?0.003). Our findings suggest that, despite minimal or no abnormalities on conventional MRI, evidence of diffuse axonal damage can be demonstrated in brain of patients with TTR-FAP by proton MRSI examination, even in patients with no or mild CNS involvement.

AB  - We describe a 75-year-old woman affected by ichthyosis since childhood who developed bilateral lower limb distal muscle weakness resulting in foot deformities and gait disturbances during the last decade. Neurological examination showed equinovarus deformity with pied en griffe, distal motor and sensory impairment and areflexia at lower limbs. On upper limbs mild distal motor impairment and atrophy were present. EMG study revealed an axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe, predominantly axonal, neuropathy with many clusters of small myelinated fibers and some degree of chronic demyelination with small onion bulbs. Both her sister and the mother have a clinically similar peripheral neuropathy, but in the absence of ichtyosis. Familial history, prevalent motor lower limbs involvement, middle life onset with slow evolution, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT 2). Nevertheless, biochemistry and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were performed to rule out known causes of axonal peripheral neuropathy. Ichthyosis has been reported to be associated with some neurological disorders characterized by the presence of peripheral neuropathy such as Krabbe leucodystrophy, Refsum disease, and Rud syndrome. To our knowledge no association has been described between CMT2 and ichthyosis. We believe interesting to point out the presence in our family of CMT2 and ichthyosis. Further studies are ongoing to better elucidate this association.

AB  - Intro: Pathophysiology of hypertrophic scar formation remains unclear, potentially involving mechanical strain, burns, or infection. We sought to specifically examine the role of mechanical strain in hypertrophic scars. To do so, we developed and characterized a novel murine model which uses mechanical strain to produce hypertrophic scars in mice. Methods: Paired incisions were created on C57BL6 mice (n?=?20). After closure, mechanical strain was applied across one wound using a novel device; the other wound was a control. Starting at day 3, mechanical strain was increased every other day over 4?wks. Wounds were harvested each week, and examined histologically using Sirius red, DAPI, BrdU for proliferation, and caspase 3 for apoptosis. Results: Strained wounds showed features of hypertrophic scars: raised borders, loss of rete pegs and adnexal structures in the epidermis overlying scars, blood vessels that were perpendicular and fibrillary collagen that was parallel to skin surface. Features persisted beyond 6 months. Wound collagen deposition in strained wounds increased 6-fold at 1 wk and over 12-fold at 2?4?wks, in parallel to an increase in number of stromal cells within scar (28-fold). This resulted in an increase in number of cells per unit area of collagen (over 42%). In all wounds, there was no significant difference in proliferation. There was a significant reduction in blood vessel (4-fold) and fibroblast (3-fold) apoptosis at 1?4?wks in strained wounds. Conc: Mechanical strain alone is sufficient to produce hypertrophic scars in this model that are indistinguishable from human scars. Notably, hypertrophic scars appear to result from a marked reduction in apoptosis, rather than from a significant proliferation and upregulation of cellular collagen deposition, validating previous in vitro studies.

AB  - Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a late onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, characterized by rimmed vacuoles and cytoplasmic or nuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions. Clinical features are proximal and/or distal weakness, frequent muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia and poor responsiveness to steroid treatment. The involvement of peripheral nerve in both sporadic and familial IBM is a debated issue. Among six cases (five men; age range: 65?82?yrs.) of muscle biopsy proven sporadic IBM, we found variable neuropathic changes. Myogenic/neurogenic mixed EMG pattern was detected in four patients. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies showed abnormalities consistent with axonal multiple mononeuropathy in three and with axonal polyneuropathy in two patients, whereas one subject had no neurogenic findings. However, the degree of peripheral nerve impairment was usually mild and not related to severity of myopathy. Sural nerve biopsy was performed in the case with more prominent clinical and electrophysiological polyneuropathy. Moderate homogeneous loss of myelinated fibers, with recurrent regeneration clusters and atrophic/degenerating axons were observed. No segmental demyelination was present. In spite of marked inflammatory changes in muscle, neither mononuclear cell infiltrates nor filamentous inclusions were detected in nerve. Similarly, whereas paracrystalline mitochondrial inclusions were observed in muscle, minor but recurrent mitochondrial changes were detected in nerve. Muscle mitochondrial abnormalities have been reported about twice in IBM compared with other inflammatory myopathies. A relation of this finding with high incidence of associated peripheral neuropathy in IBM and mitochondrial myopathies has been hypothesized. On the other hand, the follow-up of our patients shows improvement of nerve conduction values in clinically responders to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, suggesting a significant role of immune processes for the pathogenesis of nerve damage in IBM.

AB  - Aim Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is considered as a key prognostic variable in psychosis. Yet, it is unclear whether a longer DUP causes worse outcomes or whether reported associations have alternative explanations. Methods Data from 2 cohorts of patients with first episode psychosis were used (n =?2134). Measures of DUP were assessed at baseline and outcomes at 12?months. Regression models were used to investigate the associations between DUP and outcomes. We also investigated whether any associations were replicated using instrumental variables (IV) analysis to reduce the effect of residual confounding and measurement bias. Results There were associations between DUP per 1-year increase and positive psychotic symptoms (7.0% in symptom score increase 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0%, 10.0%, P <?.001), worse recovery (risk difference [RD] 0.78, 95%, CI 0.68, 0.83, P <?.001) and worse global functioning (0.62 decrease in functioning score 95% CI ?1.19, ?0.04, P =?.035). There was no evidence of an association with negative psychotic symptoms (1.0%, 95%, CI ?2.0%, 5.0%, P =?.455). The IV analysis showed weaker evidence of associations in the same direction between DUP per 1-year increase and positive psychotic symptoms, recovery and global functioning. However, there was evidence of an inverse association with negative psychotic symptoms (decrease of 15.0% in symptom score 95% CI ?26.0%, ?3.0%, P =?.016). Conclusions We have confirmed previous findings of a positive association between positive psychotic symptoms, global functioning and recovery and DUP using regression analysis. IV analysis shows some support for these findings. Future investigation using IV analysis should be repeated in large data sets.

AB  - Abstract Erythrocytes must maintain a biconcave discoid shape in order to efficiently deliver oxygen (O2) molecules and to recycle carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules. The erythrocyte is a small toroidal dielectrophoretic (DEP) electromagnetic field (EMF) driven cell that maintains its zeta potential (?) with a dielectric constant (?) between a negatively charged plasma membrane surface and the positively charged adjacent Stern layer. Here, we propose that zeta potential is also driven by both ferroelectric influences (chloride ion) and ferromagnetic influences (serum iron driven). The Golden Ratio, a function of Phi offers a geometrical mathematical measure within the distinct and desired curvature of the red blood cell that is governed by this zeta potential and is required for the efficient recycling of CO2 in our bodies. The Bio-Field Array (BFA) shows potential to both drive/fuel the zeta potential and restore the Golden Ratio in human erythrocytes thereby leading to more efficient recycling of CO2. Live Blood Analyses and serum CO2 levels from twenty human subjects that participated in immersion therapy sessions with the BFA for 2 weeks (six sessions) were analyzed. Live Blood Analyses (LBA) and serum blood analyses performed before and after the BFA immersion therapy sessions in the BFA pilot study participants showed reversal of erythrocyte rheological alterations (per RBC metric; P = 0.00000075), a morphological return to the Golden Ratio and a significant decrease in serum CO2 (P = 0.017) in these participants. Immersion therapy sessions with the BFA show potential to modulate zeta potential, restore this newly defined Golden Ratio and reduce rheological alterations in human erythrocytes.
