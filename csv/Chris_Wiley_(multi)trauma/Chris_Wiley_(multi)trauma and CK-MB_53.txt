AB  - Introduction There are no published studies that characterize the different myofiber types of Mangalarga (ML) horses and hybrids. This study aimed to characterize and compare muscle fibers of the gluteus medius of ML mares and young and inactive mules resulting from the breeding of these mares with a Brazilian donkey. Methods Percutaneous biopsies were performed in 11 mares and their foals (10 mules), at a depth of 60?mm. Fiber types were determined by comparing identical images using both the staining techniques of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR). Stains for mATPase were pre-incubated in acid medium followed by alkaline incubation. The frequency (F%) and relative total area (RTA%) of fiber types I, IIA and IIX were analysed. The cross-sectional area (CSA, ?m2) was quantified by the NADH-TR technique. The means were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results The frequency of type IIA fibers was greater than types I and IIX. Type IIX fibers had higher CSA than I and IIA. The RTA of type IIX fibers was greater than type IIA fibers followed by type I. The higher RTA value of IIX fibers resulted from higher CSA. There was no difference between the variables for mares compared to the mules. Conclusions ML mares and mules that resulted from breeding with the Brazilian donkey have a high prevalence of type IIA fibers in the gluteus medius. This fatigue-resistant fiber uses both metabolic pathways, glycolytic and oxidative, to obtain energy during muscle contraction, thus giving the ML mares and mules good performance in horseback riding, marching contests and endurance rides.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training results in improved mitochondrial efficiency but it is unclear if dietary selenium level can further modify mitochondrial function. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and exercise training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At week 14, all horses underwent a 2?hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Permeabilized muscle fibers obtained from the gluteus medius of horses at rest were analysed for mitochondrial function via high resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity with Complex I substrates was determined using the respiratory control ratio (RCR) of state 3 (with ADP) and state 2 (without ADP; leak respiration). Electron transport system capacity (ETSC) was determined by uncoupling phosphorylation and respiration using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS) activities were assessed in resting muscle samples obtained at week 0 and 14, and in response to the SET. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA. Results Leak, state 3, ETSC, CS and CCO were higher (P<0.05) at wk 14 compared to wk 0 in all horses, but were not affected by training or Se level. Additionally, CS and CCO were unaffected by the SET. Conclusions Mitochondrial number (CS activity) and efficiency were unaffected by training and dietary Se level, but did increase over time, perhaps due to growth of horses. A more strenuous training protocol may be needed to induce mitochondrial adaptations.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Lower airway diseases are common problems in sports and racing horses. In humans, exercise causes increased susceptibility to respiratory infections associated with down-regulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules. Because numerous cell types are implicated in important defense mechanisms against airborne infections, we aimed to assess the effect of training on innate immune responses of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC) and blood monocytes. Methods PAM, EBEC and monocytes were collected at rest and after a standardized exercise test (SET) from eight untrained, trained and deconditioned horses. We compared their respective expression of TLR1-9 by qPCR and their cytokinic responses following exposure to various TLR ligands by ELISA. Data were reported as least square means and analyzed by a global linear mixed model. Results The mRNA expression of TLR3 was down-regulated by training in PAM (P<0.0001) and monocytes (P<0.015), whereas the mRNA expression of TLR4 was up-regulated in monocytes (P?=?0.0004) only. Monocytes stimulated with TLR2- and TLR4-ligands showed increased cytokine secretion after training and deconditioning (P<0.025). EBEC from trained horses produced less TNF-alpha (P<0.05) after treatment with ligands of TLR2 and TLR3 compared with EBEC from untrained horses. The production of TNF-alpha (P<0.001) and IFN-beta (P<0.001) in non-stimulated and stimulated PAM was decreased in trained and deconditioned horses. Conclusions The impaired cytokine production in PAM and EBEC after a training period might explain the increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and is associated with the activation of cells at the systemic level.

AB  - Introduction In equestrian sports where horses exercise at submaximal levels, the identification of some clinical conditions leading to poor performance can remain difficult. The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease. Ethical Animal Research This study was based on clinical cases referred to the Equine Sports Medicine Practice. Horse owners referred their horses and consented to all procedures described.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test.

AB  - Introduction In theory, splenic reserve mobilization should elicit a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor mediated neuroendocrine response (the Gauer-Henry reflex). Six intact (IN) and 5 (SP) splenectomized Standardbred mares (421?491?kg, ?9?yr) performed 10?min of treadmill exercise (80% VO2max) to test the hypothesis that hemodynamic and endocrine responses to exercise would differ between IN and SP horses Methods Blood samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10?min of exertion. Right ventricular pressure (RVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were measured and total peripheral resistance (TPR) calculated. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were measured using RIA. Data analysis used ANOVA for repeated measures and SNK. Significance was set at P<0.05. There were no differences (P>0.05) between IN and SP for any variable at rest. All variables except TPR and RAP increased (P<0.05) during exertion in both IN and SP. Means (±SE) for RAP (18?±?3 vs. 1?±?2?mmHg), CO (255?±?21 vs.177?±?19?L/min), MAP (147?±?3 vs. 116?±?8?mmHg), and ANP (66?±?3 vs. 50?±?8?pg/mL) were greater for IN vs. SP horses at 10?min of exertion. Mean plasma AVP (95?±?19 vs. 23?±?3?pg/mL) was greater (P<0.05) for SP than for IN horses at 10?min of exertion.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador breed is valued for its gait. However few studies have assessed the use of nutritional additives on this breed's performance. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that chelated trivalent chromium and L-carnitine feed supplementation may reduce subcutaneous fat deposition after training. Methods 13 mares (2.5 to 3 years old) were assigned to one of three treatments (T1, 10?mg Cr/day; T2, 10?g LCN/day; T3, control) according to a completely randomized design, with split-plot arrangement. The diet was Panicum maximum cv. Massai and concentrate (50:50 ratio and 2.5% BWT). During 42 days the mares received supplementation and exercised for 50?min on a treadmill and 60?min on an automatic walker every other day, resting on Sundays. Subcutaneous fat was measured with ultrasound before and after training in the back-loin(GDL), croup(GG), and base of the tail(GBC). Results were compared by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results Before training, the variables were similar across the groups (P>0.05). After training, in GDL, T2 (1.76?mm) was 37.37% lower (P<0.05) than control (2.81?mm), while T1 (2.22?mm) was similar to T2 and control. There was no difference between treatments (P>0.05) in GG. In GBC, there was a 24.45% increase from pre (8.59?mm) to post-treatment (10.69?mm) evaluations, regardless of the treatment. Conclusions Supplementation with L-carnitine reduces subcutaneous fat deposition in the lumbar region of Mangalarga Marchador mares after training, which may be indicative of increased use of subcutaneous fat in this region as a substrate for exercise.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder predominantly affecting females. Females with the MECP2 mutations exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from classical Rett syndrome to asymptomatic carriers. Mutations of genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) and forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) are also found in early onset RTT variants. Here, we present the first report of a female patient with RTT-like phenotype caused by SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankylin repeat domain 3) mutation, indicating that the clinical spectrum of SHANK3 mutations may extend to RTT-like phenotype in addition to (severe) developmental delay, absence of expressive speech, autistic behaviors and intellectual disability. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Peripheral neurotoxicity is a severe side effect of several effective antineoplastic drugs. Different attempts have been previously performed in order to reduce the neurotoxicity of antineoplastic compounds, but so far an effective neuroprotective treatment is not available. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) is a natural occurring compound with a neuroprotective activity in several experimental paradigms and in clinical use for the treatment of painful neuropathies. In this study we have tested in two rat models the hypothesis that ALC may have a protective role on cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments in different tumor systems indicated the lack of interference of ALC in the antitumor effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel. ALC co-treatment was able to significantly reduce the neurotoxicity of both cisplatin and paclitaxel in well-established rat models and this effect was correlated with a modulation of the plasma levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the cisplatin model. The protective effect of ALC was confirmed also in in vitro studies on differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, where ALC treatment counteracted the paclitaxel and cisplatin-induced cell damage, as measured by reduction of neurite elongation. In a search for the mechanism(s) of ALC neuroprotection, the transcriptional profile of gene expression in PC12 cells determined by microarray analysis indicated that ALC, in the presence of NGF, was able to modulate various genes relevant in the tissue-specific toxicity, such as NGFI-A. Moreover, we observed that labeled acetyl groups derived from ALC were transferred into histones and that cells co-treatment with NGF and ALC increased the level of histones H4 acetylation. These findings suggest that up-regulation of genes implicated in the protection against specific damage induced by neurotoxic agent may be the result of modulation of histone acetylation mediated by transfer of ALC acetyl groups. Overall, these results provide the first evidence that ALC is a neuroprotective agent acting through a novel mechanism that appears to be important for counteracting the chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity secondary to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies, using reflective skin markers, are commonly used to investigate equine neck motion in equitation science and for rehabilitation purposes. In order to interpret the registrations accurately, the degree of skin displacement has been described for the limbs and back, but not for the neck. The aim of the present study was to investigate the degree of skin displacement in the equine neck. Methods Radiopaque skin markers were applied to the skin over the first six cervical vertebrae of six healthy horses. Radiographs were taken in three standardized neck positions in the sagittal plane: control (horizontal neck), ?on the bit? and ?nose to carpus?. The scales of the images were normalized and calculation of skin displacement was performed by use of a coordinate system, dividing the displacement into measurements on an x-axis parallel to the vertebra's longitudinal axis and a y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis. The non-parametric paired Wilcoxon rank test was employed to study the differences in distances in x- and y-directions, and statistical significance was set to P<0.05. Results Between control and ?nose to carpus? positions, there were significant differences in the marker locations, related to the underlying vertebra, in x-line for C1?6, and in y-line for C3?6. The differences in marker locations were between 3?±?9 and 44?±?14?mm, depending on the marker. Conclusions The outcome of this study indicates that skin displacement is an important factor to consider when investigating equine neck motion with skin marker methodology. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by a local Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments (Uppsala, Sweden), with written consent from the horse owners. Sources of funding:?none.

AB  - Introduction Rider preference appears to be a large factor determining the selection of an arena surface. The negative reaction of the competitors to the surface used for the Olympic test event in 2011 was sufficient to initiate a change in the surface composition used for the Olympic equestrian events in 2012. The aim of this study was to quantify surface characteristics that riders perceive to be the most favoured in a training and competition venue. Methods A survey was used to ask riders (n?=?342) to describe characteristics that they liked about their favourite venue across Northern England. The two most popular surfaces (both well-established wax, sand and fibre) were harrowed before being measured at several plots. An Orono Biomechanical Surface Tester and traction device were used to compare the functional properties of the two surfaces. The respondent's reasons for choosing their favourite venue were associated with specific surface measures including peak load, rebound timing and traction. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to establish differences between venues. Results The favourite venue was selected because the surface was not too deep or slippery and provided good support, spring and cushioning. The peak load (P?=?0.002) and traction (P>0.001) were significantly higher on the favourite surface compared to the second favourite (18.99?kN vs.17.29?kN and 20?Nm vs.19?Nm respectively). Conclusions Higher peak load values may be responsible for supporting a good performance and higher traction values could explain why riders felt that the surface was not ?slippery?, although this may have negative effects on the horse. The results suggest there is potential to quantify rider preferences. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an ethics committee at the University of Central Lancashire (reference number: BuSH 057). Sources of funding:?A student internship was awarded by the University of Central Lancashire. Competing interests:?none.
