AB  - Abstract Preferential usage of JH-proximal VH genes has been demonstrated in immature murine B cell repertoires. To determine whether this phenomenon is also evident in human repertoires, we studied utilization of VH6, the most JH-proximal human VH gene. Examination of VH gene usage in a panel of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples indicated that 15% of the IgH rearrangements utilized VH6. VH6 is a single-member family in a total repertoire of 100?200 VH genes; thus, if usage were purely random, one would expect VH6 rearrangement frequency to be < 1%. Analysis of VH gene usage in normal lymphoid tissues also revealed biased usage of VH6. VH6 was preferentially utilized in 16- to 24-week-old fetal liver as compared to adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells or spleen. Possible implications of the conservation of preferential usage of JH-proximal genes in both immature murine and human repertoires are discussed.

AB  - Background:? Platelets are a rich source of proteins and growth factors that are instrumental in the initiation and modulation of tissue repair. The clinical use of crude platelet preparations has been around for decades. However, the use of autologous platelet gel (APG) for the treatment of wounds has become familiar practice in only the past 10 years. Platelet gels have been associated with accelerated vascular ingrowth, increased fibroblastic proliferation, and accelerated collagen production.x3 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of APG using a porcine wound healing model. Methods:? Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained using a fully automated, easy-to-use devise. APG was created from PRP and autologous thrombin. Deep partial thickness wounds were created on specific pathogen-free pigs. Wounds were either treated with APG and covered with a polyurethane dressing, were treated only with a polyurethane dressing, or were left untreated. Wounds were assessed for epithelization using a well-established salt-split technique. Results:? Wounds treated with APG enhanced the rate of epithelization as compared to both polyurethane and untreated controls. Conclusions:? This study shows that an autologous platelet rich gel can stimulate and enhance epithelization of deep partial thickness wounds. Additional preclinical and clinical studies that examine mechanisms of action are warranted.

AB  - The Ehlers?Danlos syndromes comprise a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders, which are characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue friability. In the Villefranche Nosology, six subtypes were recognized: The classical, hypermobile, vascular, kyphoscoliotic, arthrochalasis, and dermatosparaxis subtypes of EDS. Except for the hypermobile subtype, defects had been identified in fibrillar collagens or in collagen-modifying enzymes. Since 1997, a whole spectrum of novel, clinically overlapping, rare EDS-variants have been delineated and genetic defects have been identified in an array of other extracellular matrix genes. Advances in molecular testing have made it possible to now identify the causative mutation for many patients presenting these phenotypes. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the current knowledge on the rare EDS subtypes and highlight areas for future research. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective There is a widely recognised need to develop effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers to aid the development of disease-modifying treatments, to facilitate early diagnosis and to improve clinical care. This overview aims to summarise the utility of key neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD, before focusing on the latest efforts to identify informative blood biomarkers. Design A literature search was performed using PubMed up to September 2011 for reviews and primary research studies of neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography and amyloid imaging), CSF and blood-based (plasma, serum and platelet) biomarkers in AD and mild cognitive impairment. Citations within individual articles were examined to identify additional studies relevant to this review. Results Evidence of AD biomarker potential was available for imaging techniques reflecting amyloid burden and neurodegeneration. Several CSF measures are promising, including 42 amino acid ?-amyloid peptide (A?42); total tau (T-tau) protein, reflecting axonal damage; and phosphorylated tau (P-tau), reflecting neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Studies of plasma A? have produced inferior diagnostic discrimination. Alternative plasma and platelet measures are described, which represent potential avenues for future research. Conclusions Several imaging and CSF markers demonstrate utility in predicting AD progression and determining aetiology. These require standardisation before forming core elements of diagnostic criteria. The enormous potential available for identifying a minimally-invasive, easily-accessible blood measure as an effective AD biomarker currently remains unfulfilled.

AB  - Tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters are frequently used as long-term vascular access in children due to the technical difficulties in constructing a fistula. Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is still a major complication contributing to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Objective:?To investigate the microbiological characteristics of CRB in children on hemodialysis. Methods:?Chart review of 63 children who received hemodialysis with a tunneled-cuffed catheter between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. CRB was diagnosed when positive blood cultures were obtained in patients with symptoms of bacteremia, and without an identifiable source. Results:?During the 5 year period, a total of 251 CRB were detected with 313 bacterial and 2 candidal growths in the blood cultures. The distribution of gram positive (Gr+) and gram negative (Gr?) microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns are shown in the table. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common microorganism, and constituted 62% of all bacterial isolates. All Gr+ microorganisms were sensitive to vancomycin except one isolate of Enterococcus fecalis. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common Gr? microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. The sensitivity of Gr? microorganisms to levofloxacin was 100%. The treatment course was complicated by the growth of a second microorganism in subsequent blood cultures in 24% of infections; 54% of these consisted of both Gr+ and Gr? isolates. The etiology of ESRD or the use of immunosuppressive agents had no effect on the occurrence of CRB. The average number of infections were 5.8/1000 catheter days, and the recurrence of CRB was more likely in patients who had two or more CRB in a year. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gr+ growth 80% 88% 87% 85% 73% Oxacillin resistance 84% 73% 82% 68% 75% Gr? growth 20% 12% 13% 15% 27% Tobramycin resistance 21% 50% 25% 20% 13% Conclusions: Empiric initial treatment for CRB should include both Gr+, and Gr? coverage. Oxacillin and first generation cephalosporins are not good choices due to high incidence of resistance. Levofloxacin is a good alternative for Gr CRB. Novel preventive measures should be sought in patients who have a tendency to have recurrent CRB.

AB  - Abstract The correlation and the interactions between neuronal activity and underlying metabolic dynamics are still a matter of debate, especially in pathological conditions. This study reports findings obtained on a subject suffering from fixation-off sensitivity (FOS) epilepsy, exploited as a model system of triggerable anomalous electrical activity. Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy was used to investigate the metabolic response to visual spike-inducing stimuli in a single voxel placed in the temporo-occipital lobe of a FOS epilepsy patient. MRS measurements were additionally performed on a control group of five healthy volunteers. The FOS patient also underwent an EEG session with the same stimulus paradigm. Uniquely in the FOS patient, glutamate and glutamine concentration increased during the first 10?min of stimulation and then returned to baseline. On the other hand, FOS-induced epileptic activity (spiking) endured throughout all the stimulation epoch. The observed metabolic dynamics may be likely linked to a complex interplay between alterations of the metabolic pathways of glutamate and modulation of the neuronal activity.

AB  - The most common complication of tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters is catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), which contributes to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Gram positive microorganisms are the most common etiologic agents; coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species are the two most prevalent strains in our center. These are the common inhabitants of skin flora, suggesting that infection of catheters occur through the exit site. The Biopatch is a chlorhexidine impregnated dressing designed to keep the exit site from colonization with skin flora. This may decrease the incidence of CRB due to organisms from the skin. Objective:?To investigate whether the application of the biopatch at the exit site has any effect on the incidence and the etiology of CRB. Methods:?Chart review of 63 pediatric chronic hemodialysis patients who were dialysed between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. The mean age at start of hemodialysis was 13.9?±?4.6 years. The pre-Biopatch era started in January 1999 till the end of June 2001, and the Biopatch era started in July 2001 to December 2003. Biopatch was applied at the beginning of every dialysis week after Betadine cleansing of the exit site, which was then covered with a transparent dressing. In the pre-Biopatch era, the exit site was cleansed with Betadine at every dialysis session and then covered with a transparent dressing. Results:?The use of the Biopatch at the exit site caused a significant decrease in the exit site infections. However, contrary to what was expected, there was no decrease in the incidence of CRB. Pre-Biopatch Era Biopatch Era p value Gram positive infections % 76% 76% NS Gram negative infections % 10% 14% NS Polymicrobial infections % 14% 10% NS Total number of infections 108 (19 patients) 143 (29 patients) NS Exit site infections-number 20 (9 patients) 5 (3 patients) p?<?0.05 Conclusion:? The use of the Biopatch decreases exit site infections. However, it fails to decrease the incidence of CRB. It has no effect on the etiologic agent of the bacterial infection.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To explore factors associated with high psychological distress among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and their contribution to the elevated distress prevalence among Aboriginal people. Methods: Questionnaire data from 1,631 Aboriginal and 233,405 non-Aboriginal 45 and Up Study (NSW, Australia) participants aged ≥45 years were used to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios for high psychological distress (Kessler-10 score ≥22) for socio-demographic, health and disability-related factors, and to quantify contributions to differences in distress prevalence. Results: While high-distress prevalence was increased around three-fold in Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal participants, distress-related risk factors were similar. Morbidity and physical disability had the strongest associations; high distress affected 43.8% of Aboriginal and 20.9% of non-Aboriginal participants with severe physical limitations and 9.5% and 3.9% of those without limitations, respectively. Differences in distress prevalence between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants were essentially attributable to differences in SES, morbidity, disability/functional limitations and social support (fully-adjusted PR 1.19 [95% 1.08, 1.30]); physical morbidity and disability explained the bulk. Conclusions: The markedly elevated prevalence of high distress among older Aboriginal Australians appears largely attributable to greater physical morbidity and disability. Implications for public health: Addressing upstream determinants of physical morbidity and improved integration of social and emotional wellbeing care into primary care and chronic disease management are essential.

AB  - Abstract The extent and potential dangerousness of the problem of domestic violence warrants systematic screening and assessment in all mental health settings. Few empirical studies have approached the question of domestic violence with the aim of identifying risk markers, making it impossible to identify a particular characteristic or set of characteristics that can be used to identify individuals at risk for perpetrating or becoming the victims of domestic violence. However, there are a number of factors that have been identified as correlates of domestic violence that may eventually prove useful for identifying individuals at risk, but the extant literature does not provide the empirical support at this time. Because many of these correlates may be brought to the attention of mental health and medical professionals (e.g., depression, substance use/abuse, physical injuries) and given the absence of established risk factors for domestic violence, there is a need for clinicians to systematically assess for violence among all of their patients. By identifying factors that might help clinicians realize that many of their patients are at risk for domestic violence, we hope to encourage them to attend to this potentially dangerous problem. Ongoing assessment in the context of knowledge regarding correlates of domestic violence can provide important information for evaluating risk of a particular violent incident. In addition, we outline strategies for assessing violence and violence risk in both perpetrators and victims in order to assist clinicians in approaching this difficult topic in a clinical setting. A careful assessment of the potential for violence within clients' ongoing relationships is necessary for clinicians to provide appropriate clinical care. ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Optic nerve atrophy represents the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathies leading to vision impairment. The recently described Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy (BBSOA) syndrome denotes an autosomal dominant genetic form of neuropathy caused by mutations or deletions in the NR2F1 gene. Herein, we describe a mouse model recapitulating key features of BBSOA patients?optic nerve atrophy, optic disc anomalies, and visual deficits?thus representing the only available mouse model for this syndrome. Notably, Nr2f1-deficient optic nerves develop an imbalance between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes leading to postnatal hypomyelination and astrogliosis. Adult heterozygous mice display a slower optic axonal conduction velocity from the retina to high-order visual centers together with associative visual learning deficits. Importantly, some of these clinical features, such the optic nerve hypomyelination, could be rescued by chemical drug treatment in early postnatal life. Overall, our data shed new insights into the cellular mechanisms of optic nerve atrophy in BBSOA patients and open a promising avenue for future therapeutic approaches.
