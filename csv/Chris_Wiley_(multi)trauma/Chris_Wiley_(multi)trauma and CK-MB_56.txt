AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case of the patient (Pt) who was a 42-year-old male who had hypertension and was at the time on Hydrochlorothiazide/Valsartan 160 mg/12 mg per os per day. The Pt reported that tooth #19 had received a porcelainfused-to-metal (PFM) crown approximately two years previously. Pt started experiencing pain the previous day, and the pain rapidly intensified overnight. The extra-oral exam can reveal facial swelling with asymmetry and swollen nodes in the affected area. During the intra-oral exam, the clinical crown can present with an existing restoration, caries, traumatic pulpal exposure or fracture. Through this case, the chapter helps the readers to properly diagnose a necrotic pulp case based on clinical and radiographic criteria. It also helps them to understand the etiology of infection and pain in a necrotic pulp case. Through this case, dentists can effectively address and provide relief in a necrotic case, on an emergency basis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Cervical spine lesions are often suspected in horses with neurological signs, abnormal head/neck position and obscure forelimb lameness. Computed tomography (CT) has the potential to image the cervical spine in 3 dimensions in superior anatomical detail; e.g. lesions that cause compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, small fragments, and osteoarthritis of the articular process joints may be more easily detected. Objectives To investigate if CT and CT myelography of the entire cervical spine is possible in horses, describe the technique used, the type of horses and distribution of cervical lesions detected. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Horses undergoing cervical CT and CT myelography from June 2013 to February 2014 were reviewed. The horses were anaesthetised in left lateral recumbency using continuous intravenous anaesthesia. A Philips Brilliance Big Bore 16 slice scanner and a custom made equine CT table (Solving, Finland) were used. Results Cervical CT was performed on 16 horses, 11 of which also had CT myelography: 12 Warmblood, 2 ponies, 1 Standardbred and 1 Paint Horse. Horses ranged in age from 1 to 21 years, and in weight from 406 to 670?kg. Presenting complaints were: neurological symptoms (n?=?8), abnormal head/neck position (n?=?5), forelimb lameness (n?=?4), Horners syndrome (n?=?1). In all cases (n?=?16) the cervical spine from the skull to C7 could be imaged, in 3 cases T1 was imaged and in one case T3. Significant lesions were detected in 14 horses. The sites of the most significant lesions were: C4?C5 (n?=?3), C5?C6 (n?=?2), C6?C7 (n?=?5) and C7?T1 (n?=?2), cervical stenosis C5?T2 (n?=?1) and muscle injury (n?=?1). Length of anaesthesia ranged from 35 to 70?min (median 60?min), with one complicated recovery. Conclusions Cervical CT and CT myelography can be performed in large adult horses. CT may be the future gold standard to evaluate equine cervical lesions. Further studies are needed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Interpretation of clinical diagnostic imaging of the equine musculoskeletal system requires accurate reference anatomical materials. In the case of MRI, this includes images acquired from low and high field systems. Using ultra-high field MRI, higher resolution images with small slice thickness and gap suitable for reconstruction in any anatomical plane can be produced. Objectives To describe the normal equine metacarpophalangeal joint using ultra-high field MRI and compare ultra-high and high field MR images. Study design Limbs (n?=?14) from horses (n?=?5) with no history of orthopaedic disease were frozen at -20°C until imaging. Fetlock joints were scanned using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI unit. T1 (280 slices, thickness?=?0.356?mm) and T2 (140 slices, thickness?=?0.713?mm) weighted sequences were acquired. Limbs were scanned using a 1.5T MRI unit in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes using T1 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) and T2 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) sequences. Images were analysed using OsiriX software. Results Ultra-high field MR images visualised the fine detail of trabecular and subchondral bone, the articular cartilage surface of P1 and McIII, the short, oblique, straight and oblique sesamoidean ligaments including origins and insertions, the fasicular structure of superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon and ligaments and the regional neurovascular structures. Whilst T1 high field images visualised the majority of tissues, structural detail was reduced compared to ultra-high field imaging, margins were less well defined in some instances, e.g. articular cartilage, and a number of smaller structures were indistinct, e.g. short and cruciate sesamoidean ligaments. Conclusions 7T MRI produced images of the fetlock with excellent anatomical detail. Future publication of open-source ultra-high field MRI files could aid the interpretation of 0.3T and 1.5T field MR images, especially with the capacity to reconstruct image slices orientated exactly to match those of interest.

AB  - The eight FICSIT (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques) sites test different intervention strategies in selected target groups of older adults. To compare the relative potential of these interventions to reduce frailty and fall-related injuries, all sites share certain descriptive (risk-adjustment) measures and outcome measures. This article describes the shared measures, which are referred to as the FICSIT Common Data Base (CDB). The description is divided into four sections according to the four FICSIT committees responsible for the CDB: (1) psychosocial health and demographic measures; (2) physical health measures; (3) fall-related measures; and (4) cost and cost-effectiveness measures. Because the structure of the FICSIT trial is unusual, the CDB should expedite secondary analyses of various research questions dealing with frailty and falls.

AB  - Summary Between March 2012 and August 2013, 591 quality forms were filled out for abdominal organs in the Netherlands. In 133 cases (23%), there was a discrepancy between the evaluation from the procuring and transplanting surgeons. Injuries were seen in 148 (25%) organs of which 12 (2%) led to discarding of the organ: one of 133 (0.8%) livers, five of 38 (13%) pancreata and six of 420 (1.4%) kidneys (P < 0.001). Higher donor BMI was a risk factor for procurement-related injury in all organs (OR: 1.06, P = 0.011) and donor after cardiac death (DCD) donation in liver procurement (OR: 2.31, P = 0.034). DCD donation is also associated with more pancreata being discarded due to injury (OR: 10.333, P = 0.046). A higher procurement volume in a centre was associated with less injury in pancreata (OR = ?0.95, P = 0.013) and kidneys (OR = ?0.91, P = 0.012). The quality form system efficiently monitors the quality of organ procurement. Although there is a relatively high rate of organ injury, the discard rate is low and it does not significantly affect 1-year graft survival for any organ. We identified higher BMI as a risk factor for injury in abdominal organs and DCD as a risk factor in livers. A higher procurement volume is associated with fewer injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1991, five sets of electrophysiological criteria for CIDP have been reported. However, until now, receiver operator characteristic (ROC), such as sensitivity and specificity, of only AAN criteria were investigated, showing a high specificity, but intermediate sensitivity. The application of these criteria may be useful in clinical trials, but is inadequate in clinical practice, since they preclude immunomodulating treatment in patients who do not meet them. OBJECTIVE: 1) to evaluate the ROC and predictive value of five different electrophysiological criteria for CIDP (AAN, INCAT, Rotta et?al, Nicholas et?al. and Saperstein et?al.); 2) to identify the most informative electrophysiological features indicative of demyelination by mean of the likelihood ratio; 3) to determine, in our series of cases, a set of minimal electrophysiological criteria (albeit aspecific) enough sensitive for CIDP diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 patients with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, progressive for at least 2 months, with weakness in least two limbs and documented improvement in strength in response to immunotherapy. Other potential causes were excluded, including diabetes and IgM paraproteinemia with or without anti-MAG reactivity. Twelve patients with axonal polyneuropathy associated with diabetes and 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were included as controls. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated according to all five sets of NCS criteria and ROC was calculated. Likelihood ratio for CIDP was evaluated for each set of NCS criteria and for presence of each of the following features in different number of nerves: motor conduction velocities (MCV), conduction blocks/temporal dispersion, distal motor (DML) and F-wave latencies (FWL). MCV, DML and FWL were considered indicative of demyelination if decreased or increased as suggested by AAN criteria. Results will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Importance Reduction of intraoperative complications in phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Background To assess practicability of a risk stratification system, the New Zealand Cataract Risk Stratification (NZCRS) system, in a major teaching hospital service, without investigator oversight, to ascertain whether benefits identified in research studies are maintained in busy clinical practice. Design Prospective cohort study in a major public teaching hospital. Participants Five hundred cases of phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Methods NZCRS system inserted into 621 consecutive preoperative cataract patient files. Recommendation to allocate higher-risk cases to experienced surgeons. Main Outcome Measures NZCRS system uptake and adherence, appropriate identification of high risk cases and intraoperative complication rates. Results NZCRS scores calculated in 500 of 621 (80.5%) cases and 98 (19.6%) scored as ?high risk.? Cataract surgery (N = 500) performed by: 12 Registrars (20%), 4 Fellows (7.2%), 26 Consultants (72.8%). Risk scores adhered to in 99%. Overall intraoperative complications (3.0%) included iris prolapse 1.6% and posterior capsule tear 0.8%. No statistical difference in complication rates identified between surgeon grades. Mean best-corrected visual acuity was 6/10 (20/32). Postoperatively, cystoid macular oedema occurred in 3.2%. Rescoring by an experienced investigator noted a greater number of ?high risk scores? (31.6% vs 19.6%) related to differences in subjective scoring of anterior chamber depth and cataract density. Conclusions and Relevance Practical uptake of cataract risk stratification was promising in this study with NZCRS calculated in 80.5% with 99% adherence to scoring recommendations. Compared to baseline studies, in the day-to-day clinical setting, a continued, decreasing trend in frequency and severity of intraoperative complications was noted. Subjective variability of risk scoring may be further improved by better, objective, standardization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with both IgM paraproteinemia and anti-MAG antibody (MAG-PN) is regarded as a clinical entity distinct from chronic inflammatory demyelinating PN (CIDP) even in association with paraproteinemia. MAG-PN satisfy current electrophysiological criteria for CIDP and 18 to 37 % of patients fulfilling these criteria have high titers of IgM anti-MAG antibody (Ab). Anti-MAG Ab assay is rather expensive and time consuming, thus resulting sometimes in delaying the appropriate treatment in patients without these Ab. On the contrary, patients with MAG-PN may be treated inappropriately before anti-MAG Ab detection. OBJECTIVE: Determining the predictive value of clinical and electrophysiological features of patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN for the presence of anti-MAG Ab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 49 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CIDP established by Rotta et?al. (2001) were prospectively included. All of them were submitted to anti-MAG Ab assay and research of paraproteinemia. The following features at the initial evaluation were considered for the analysis: presence of distal or proximal weakness at limbs, asymmetry of motor deficit, presence of sensory ataxia, presence of vibration or pinprick sense deficit, presence of conduction blocks, low terminal latency index (TLI) in at least two nerves at upper limbs, absence of M-response (CMAP) at lower limbs. A discriminative analysis method was used to determine which features were significantly associated with the presence of anti-MAG Ab, then sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio of these features were calculated. RESULTS: Low TLI, absence of CMAP at lower limbs, absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs, were the features significantly associated with the presence of anti-;MAG Ab. The combination of low TLI in two nerves and absence of CMAP at lower limbs or low TLI and absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs had the greatest sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio, resulting in a very high increase in probability that a patient had MAG-PN. DISCUSSION: Low TLI value in at least two upper limb nerves, absence of CMAP and of proximal weakness at lower limbs are the most informative features indicating the presence of anti-MAG Ab in patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The maxillary first premolar (wolf tooth) is present in a significant proportion (13?40%) of horses and is frequently extracted. The size of these teeth has been reported to vary but the authors are not aware of published descriptions of the dimensions of these teeth. Objectives To measure the dimensions of a sample of equine first premolar teeth and to seek correlations between dimensions of the crown and the root. Study design A retrospective descriptive study. Methods Calipers were used to measure total length, root length, crown height, and crown width of 65 first premolar teeth extracted in their entirety from 2 populations of horses (UK population: n?=?30, USA population: n?=?35). Most of the variables were not normally distributed so nonparametric statistics (Spearman correlation coefficients) were used to describe tooth size and seek correlations between different measurements. Results Dimensions expressed as median (range) were total length: 21 (12?34) mm; root length: 13.2 (0?19.6) mm; crown height 7 (2?20) mm; and crown width 7 (2.6?16) mm. Root length was longer than crown height in 61/65 teeth. Total length was poorly correlated with crown height (r?=?0.443) but had a good correlation with root length (r?=?0.799). Crown height and crown width were poorly correlated with root length (r?=?-0.093 and r?=?0.463), respectively. Conclusions The dimensions of 65 first premolar teeth indicate that the root is usually longer than the crown but that the dimensions of the clinical crown of the tooth do not provide a good estimate of the length of the root.

AB  - Basil Kilvington, son of the Rev. James Kilvington, was born in Hartlepool in the North of England on August 6th. 1877. His schooling began in Greenock but in 1888, when he was eleven, the family migrated to Victoria where he attended Camberwell Anglican Boys? Grammar School which had been founded just two years earlier. He must have been a bright and capable student because in 1893, when barely sixteen, he matriculated in the Faculty of Medicine of Melbourne University and graduated M.B., B.S. in 1898 at aged 21. He became a resident medical officer at the Royal Melbourne Hospital but retained an interest in teaching and research as a tutor at Trinity College. His academic leaning is reflected in his being awarded M.D. in 1901 and M.S. in 1902. Thereafter he had a distinguished career as both a surgeon and researcher particularly in the field of neurology and nerve regeneration. When he died in 1947 aged 70 the obituaries by Sir Albert Coates and others all bear fulsome testimony to a remarkable man. Above all he was a thinker and a man of great compassion and gentleness both in his surgical technique as well as his dealings with his fellow man. He was one of the College?s Founding Fathers and perhaps deserves better recognition.
