AB  - Public management is a domain of research that is now roughly three decades old. Researchers in this area have made important advances in understanding about the performance of public organizations. But questions have been raised about the scope and methods of public management research (PMR). Does it neglect important questions about the development of major institutions of the modern state? Has it focused unduly on problems of the advanced democracies? Has it made itself irrelevant to public debates about the role and design of government, and the capacity of public institutions to deal with emerging challenges? This set of eight short essays were prepared for a roundtable held at the research conference of the PMR Association at the University of Aarhus in June 2016. Contributors were asked to consider the question: Is PMR neglecting the state?

AB  - Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is an ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in a wide variety of cells and involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Many recent data suggest his important role in human inflammatory neuropathies. The present study investigated expression and activation of NF-kB in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a clinical and histopathological model of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. EAN was induced in 11 Lewis rats by injection of peripheral bovine myelin. 4 animals, two immunized with complete Freund's adjuvant and two normal, were used as controls. The clinical course was assessed. Immunohistochemistry, western blot of nuclear extract proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed in the sciatic nerves removed at different times of the disease. Immunoreactivity for the activated form p65 of NF-kB was found in the endoneurial vessel walls, in the external myelin of some nerve fibers and at level of some endoneurial infiltrating cells 14 and 21 days after immunization. No immunoreactivity was found after 7 days as well as in controls. A single band corresponding to NF-kB p65 was detected in all animals, except for the normal controls. EMSA analysis showed a complex binding band in all EAN rats, which was stronger in peak and recovery phase of disease. Our results strongly suggest a crucial role of NF-kB in the genesis of inflammatory demyelination in the peripheral nervous system occurring in EAN.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Abstract Intra-portal islet transplantation is usually performed by cannulation of a mesenteric vein during laparotomy or through percutaneous trans-hepatic cannulation of a portal branch. In this study, we describe a new laparoscopic technique for intra-portal islet transplantation in a defined liver segment, as an alternative to the current procedures. Eighteen type-1 diabetic patients underwent laparoscopic re-permeabilisaton of the umbilical vein, followed by catheterization of the left branch of the portal vein. The catheter was guided under fluoroscopic control into a chosen liver segment. It was then secured to the skin or connected to an implantable venous access device. Thereafter, the islet preparation was slowly injected. There was no rise in portal pressure. The median duration of the procedure was 85 min. The procedure was successful in 17 of 18 cases. There were no surgical complications. We conclude that this laparoscopic procedure is a feasible, convenient, and safe alternative method of islet transplantation. Moreover, it allows multiple deliveries of islets into the same liver segment.

AB  - Abstract Background:? We aimed to evaluate the ascorbic acid concentration in secondary aqueous humour (AH) from glaucomatous patients and to compare it with primary AH from primary open-angle glaucoma patients and non-glaucomatous patients. Methods:? Primary AH samples were prospectively obtained from clinically uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma patients and senile cataract patients (controls) prior to trabeculectomy and cataract surgery. Secondary AH samples were obtained from eyes with previous intraocular surgery, prior to trabeculectomy or cataract surgery. AH (0.1?mL) was aspirated by inserting a 26-gauge needle into the anterior chamber just before surgery and then immediately stored at ?80°C. The ascorbic acid concentration was determined in a masked fashion by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results:? A total of 18 patients with senile cataract, 16 glaucomatous patients with primary AH (no previous intraocular surgery) and 11 glaucomatous patients with secondary AH (previous intraocular surgery) were included. There was no difference in mean age between groups (P?=?0.15). The mean?±?standard deviation concentration of ascorbic acid in the secondary AH from glaucomatous patients (504?±?213?µmol/L [95% confidence interval {CI}, 383?624]) was significantly lower than the concentration of ascorbic acid found in the primary aqueous of primary open-angle glaucoma (919?±?427?µmol/L [95% CI, 709?1128]) and control patients (1049?±?433?µmol/L [95% CI, 848?1249]; P?<?0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test). Conclusions:? The ascorbic acid concentration in secondary AH of glaucomatous patients was approximately twofold lower in comparison with primary AH of glaucomatous and cataract patients. The implications of a reduced concentration of ascorbic acid in the secondary AH deserve further investigation.

AB  - Background Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal skin disease of cats and dogs. The most common pathogens of small animals belong to the genera Microsporum and Trichophyton. It is an important skin disease because it is contagious, infectious and can be transmitted to people. Objectives The objective of this document is to review the existing literature and provide consensus recommendations for veterinary clinicians and lay people on the diagnosis and treatment of dermatophytosis in cats and dogs. Methods The authors served as a Guideline Panel (GP) and reviewed the literature available prior to September 2016. The GP prepared a detailed literature review and made recommendations on selected topics. The World Association of Veterinary Dermatology (WAVD) provided guidance and oversight for this process. A draft of the document was presented at the 8th World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology (May 2016) and was then made available via the World Wide Web to the member organizations of the WAVD for a period of three months. Comments were solicited and posted to the GP electronically. Responses were incorporated by the GP into the final document. Conclusions No one diagnostic test was identified as the gold standard. Successful treatment requires concurrent use of systemic oral antifungals and topical disinfection of the hair coat. Wood's lamp and direct examinations have good positive and negative predictability, systemic antifungal drugs have a wide margin of safety and physical cleaning is most important for decontamination of the exposed environments. Finally, serious complications of animal?human transmission are exceedingly rare.

AB  - A 41-year-old man suffered for 1 year of severe progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy that rendered him bedridden in few months. Routine laboratory investigations, including serum protein immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation, were normal. Electrophysiological studies and sural nerve biopsy showed a severe mixed axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy. X-ray showed multiple osteosclerotic lesions in the spine. MRI disclosed pachymeningeal thickening of the brain and meningeal infiltration at cauda equina level with gadolinium enhancement. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 12% of plasma cells with a monotypic immunocytochemical profile for lambda light chain. A diagnosis of osteosclerotic myeloma (OM) was done. He received two courses of IVIg followed by melphalan and prednisone without any benefit. Very recently he underwent a bone marrow autotransplantation. OM is a rare variant of multiple myeloma, representing less than 3% of all myeloma cases. In contrast to multiple myeloma, in OM half of patients have a peripheral neuropathy similar to CIDP, with or without features of POEMS syndrome. MRI meningeal involvement, concomitant with a severe neuropathy, was not yet described in OM. A paraneoplastic process in addition to a direct neoplastic infiltration may account for the severity of the disease in our patient, despite different therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Mortality rates associated with postoperative peritonitis or haemorrhage secondary to pancreatic fistula (PF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remain high. This study analysed the results of an alternative management strategy for these life-threatening complications. Methods:? All patients undergoing PD between January 2004 and April 2011 were identified. Patients who underwent further laparotomy for failure of the pancreatico-digestive anastomosis were identified. Since 2004, this problem has been managed by dismantling the pancreatico-digestive anastomosis and canulating the pancreatic duct remnant with a thin polyethylene tube (Escat tube), which is then passed through the abdominal wall. Main outcome measures were mortality, morbidity and longterm outcome. Results:? From January 2004 to April 2011, 244 patients underwent a PD. Postoperatively, 21 (8.6%) patients required re-laparotomy to facilitate a wirsungostomy. Two patients were transferred from another hospital with life-threatening PF after PD. Causes of re-laparotomy were haemorrhage (n= 12), peritonitis (n= 4), septic shock (n= 4) and mesenteric ischaemia (n= 1). Of the 21 patients who underwent wirsungostomy, six patients subsequently died of liver failure (n= 3), refractory septic shock (n= 2) or mesenteric ischaemia (n= 1) and nine patients suffered complications. The median length of hospital stay was 42 days (range: 34?60 days). The polyethylene tube at the pancreatic duct was removed at a median of 4 months (range: 2?11 months). Three patients developed diabetes mellitus during follow-up. Conclusions:? These data suggest that preservation of the pancreatic remnant with wirsungostomy has a role in the management of patients with uncontrolled haemorrhage or peritonitis after PF.

AB  - Abstract Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is likely involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction in people with obesity and diabetes. Although tissue biopsy is often used to evaluate the presence and severity of ER stress, it is not known whether acute tissue injury-induced by percutaneous muscle biopsy causes ER stress and its potential downstream effects on markers of inflammation and metabolic function. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that percutaneous biopsy-induced tissue injury causes ER stress and alters inflammatory and metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. Vastus lateralis muscle tissue was obtained by percutaneous biopsy at 0600 h and 12 h later from either the contralateral leg (Group 1, n = 6) or at the same site as the initial biopsy (Group 2, n = 6) in women who were overweight. Muscle gene expression of selected markers of ER stress, inflammation, and regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism were determined. Compared with Group 1, muscle gene expression in the second biopsy sample obtained in Group 2 demonstrated marked increases in markers of ER stress (GRP78, XBP1, ATF6) and inflammation (IL6, TNF), and alterations in metabolic regulators (decreased expression of GLUT4 and PPARGC1A and increased expression of FASN). Our results suggest that acute tissue injury induced by percutaneous muscle biopsy causes an integrated local response that involves an induction of ER stress and alterations in markers of inflammation and regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Objectives To investigate clinical oral disease and its association with cognitive function and dependency among older New Zealanders in residential aged care. Material and methods National survey of oral health in aged residential care throughout New Zealand. We classified residents into 1 of 3 levels of care: ?low dependency care (or assisted living)?; ?high dependency care?; or ?specialist dementia care/psychogeriatric care.? The Abbreviated Mental Test characterised cognitive function as ?unimpaired? (scores of 7-10), ?moderately impaired? (4-6) or ?severely impaired? (0-3). Intra-oral examinations were conducted, along with a computer-assisted personal interview. Results Most of the 987 clinically examined participants were either at low or high dependency care level, with another 1 in 6 in psychogeriatric care. Almost half overall had severely impaired cognitive function. Just under half of the sample had 1 or more natural teeth remaining. Negative binomial regression modelling showed that the number of carious teeth was lower among women and higher among those who were older, those with more teeth and in those with severely impaired cognitive function. Oral debris scores (representing plaque biofilm and other soft deposits on teeth) were higher in men, those with more teeth, and in those with severely impaired cognitive function. Conclusions Impaired cognitive function is a risk indicator for both dental caries and oral debris in aged residential care.

AB  - The disaster clearinghouse concept originates with the earthquake community as an effort to coordinate research and data collection activities. Though prior earthquake clearinghouses are small in comparison to what was needed in response to Hurricane Katrina, these seminal structures are germane to the establishment of our current model. On 3 September 2005, five days after Katrina wrought cataclysmic destruction along the Gulf Coast, FEMA and Louisiana State University personnel met to establish the LSU GIS Clearinghouse Cooperative (LGCC), a resource for centralization and dissemination of geospatial information related to Hurricane Katrina. Since its inception, the LGCC has developed into a working model for organization, dissemination, archiving and research regarding geospatial information in a disaster. This article outlines the formation of the LGCC, issues of data organization, and methods of data dissemination and archiving with an eye towards implementing the clearinghouse model as a standard resource for addressing geospatial data needs in disaster research and management.

AB  - Abstract M?ori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, have the highest crude population-based rate of seclusion events reported internationally (McLeod et al. ). This qualitative study explored M?ori clinical, cultural and consumer perspectives on potential strategies and initiatives considered likely to facilitate prevention of, and reduction in, the use of seclusion, with t?ngata whai i te ora (M?ori mental health service users) in mental health inpatient services. A hui (gathering) over 2 days was held with 16 M?ori participants with high levels of clinical, cultural and consumer expertise. The gathering was taped and the tapes transcribed. A thematic analysis of the hui data generated three key categories: Te Ao M?ori (access to a M?ori worldview); Te Ao Hurihuri (transforming practice); and Rangatiratanga (leadership, power, and control). The findings of this study align with the ?six core strategies? for best practice to reduce the use of seclusion (Huckshorn ). A comprehensive approach to the reduction of the use of seclusion with t?ngata whai i te ora is required, which is clearly based on a M?ori model of care and a vision for transformation of practice in mental health inpatient services, which involves M?ori leadership.
