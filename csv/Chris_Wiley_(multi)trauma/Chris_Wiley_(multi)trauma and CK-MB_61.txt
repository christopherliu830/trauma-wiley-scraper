PY  - 2019
AB  - Summary The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status is a tool commonly used to classify a patient's physical fitness before surgery. Since its introduction in 1941 it has undergone very few modifications to improve its reliability and to eliminate subjectivity, despite vast changes in both surgical and anaesthetic technique. We present the history of the ASA physical status and review the literature on its applicability to contemporary anaesthetic practice.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to facilitate the comparison of magnetic resonance (MR) spectra acquired from unknown brain lesions with published spectra in order to help identify unknown lesions in clinical settings. The paper includes lists of references for published MR spectra of various brain diseases, including pyogenic abscesses, encephalitis (herpes simplex, Rasmussen's and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), neurocysticercosis, tuberculoma, cysts (arachnoid, epidermoid and hydatid), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), Alexander disease, Canavan's disease, Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy), Leigh's disease, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with cysts, metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Pelizaeus?Merzbacher disease, Zellweger syndrome, HIV-associated lesions [cryptococcus, lymphoma, toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)], hydrocephalus and tuberous sclerosis. Each list includes information on the echo time(s) (TE) of the published spectra, whether a control spectrum is shown, whether the corresponding image and voxel position are shown and the patient ages if known. The references are listed in the approximate order of usefulness, based on spectral quality, number of spectra, range of echo times and whether the voxel positions are shown. Spectra of Zellweger syndrome, cryptococcal infection, toxoplasmosis and lymphoma are included, along with a spectrum showing propanediol (propylene glycol). Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background Mortality prediction models are applied in the intensive care unit (ICU) to stratify patients into different risk categories and to facilitate benchmarking. To ensure that the correct prediction models are applied for these purposes, the best performing models must be identified. As a first step, we aimed to establish a systematic review of mortality prediction models in critically ill patients. Methods Mortality prediction models were searched in four databases using the following criteria: developed for use in adult ICU patients in high-income countries, with mortality as primary or secondary outcome. Characteristics and performance measures of the models were summarized. Performance was presented in terms of discrimination, calibration and overall performance measures presented in the original publication. Results In total, 43 mortality prediction models were included in the final analysis. In all, 15 models were only internally validated (35%), 13 externally (30%) and 10 (23%) were both internally and externally validated by the original researchers. Discrimination was assessed in 42 models (98%). Commonly used calibration measures were the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (60%) and the calibration plot (28%). Calibration was not assessed in 11 models (26%). Overall performance was assessed in the Brier score (19%) and the Nagelkerke's R2 (4.7%). Conclusions Mortality prediction models have varying methodology, and validation and performance of individual models differ. External validation by the original researchers is often lacking and head-to-head comparisons are urgently needed to identify the best performing mortality prediction models for guiding clinical care and research in different settings and populations.

AB  - Abstract This is a longitudinal study exploring self-reported health status and physical symptoms of Russian-speaking migrants (n = 307) from the states formed after the break up of the Soviet Union. These health status reports were compared with Russians in Russia (n = 300) and non-immigrant native German test subjects (n = 310). Focus was on the change in subjective evaluation of physical health and adaptation to a new medical health care system as part of the acculturation process following migration. Migrants have more health problems than both the Russians and the native population. In addition to the stress triggered by the critical life event of migration, this finding may also reflect the poorer health status and health care in the countries of origin. In particular, immigrants suffer from headaches and symptoms of exhaustion, which are interpreted as physical correlates of the cognitive overload caused by migration. The subjective state of health of the migrants within the first 18?24 months after arrival (N = 138) showed hardly any changes. However, a high degree of satisfaction with life in the adopted country and an acculturation style distinguished by contact with the host culture correlate to a low level of health problems. The social implications of these findings are discussed. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Emerging evidence highlights the role of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) KCNQ1OT1 in fracture healing. Osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival are pivotal during this process. In this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the regulatory role of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 during osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival. We searched the gene expression omnibus databases and LncBase Experimental V.2 to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) targets of KCNQ1OT1. MiR-701-3p was selected as a differentially expressed miRNA and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify its interaction with KCNQ1OT1. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) was also identified as a target of miR-701-3p. We further identified KCNQ1OT1 as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-701-3p that could influence osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that the KCNQ1OT1/miR-701-3p/FGFR3 axis is an important regulator of osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, and provide a new therapeutic avenue for fracture healing.

AB  - To better assess historical, physical and neurophysiological features of UNE, 20 centers widely distributed in the national country have joined a collaborative study in November 2001. Case recognition was based on clinical ground: symptoms or signs suggestive of ulnar nerve impairment at elbow, as numbness/ paresthesia in the part of ulnar innervated hand with or without sensory loss, elbow pain and weakness of ulnar hand muscles with or without hypotrophy. Electrophysiological examination was performed by a proper protocol according to AAEM/AAN recommendations (1999). Two validated (DASH and BCTQ) and one newly proposed self-administered questionnaires were used for patient-oriented evaluation. Clinical severity was assessed with a 3-stage scale (Antoniadis, 1997) and a 4-stage scale (Giannini, 2001). Electrophysiological severity was quantified using a 5-step neurophysiological classification (Padua, 2001) and a 13-point neurophysiological score (Mondelli, 2000). Two hundred-seven patients (218 limbs affected) were collected until October 2002. The females/males ratio was 1:1.9 and females were younger than males (mean age 44.5 and 52.5?yrs. respectively). Repetitive stress injury was reported as possible pathogenetic factor in 50.5% of cases and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - comorbidity was diagnosed in 22.5% of limbs without gender difference. Reduction of ulnar nerve motor conduction across the elbow was found in 86.2% of limbs. EMG neurogenic pattern in ulnar supplied hand muscles and digit-wrist ulnar SAP abnormalities were respectively observed in 61.5% and 49.1% of cases. Pain (61%), associated with positive provocative test (p?<?0.01), was equally distributed in each clinical classes and was related with higher BCTQ score (p?<?0.001). DASH questionnaire showed the highest relation to clinical scale and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). High relations were found among clinical scales, neurophysiological classification and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). These preliminary results show a very good reliability of most measurements used for multiperspective assessment of UNE syndrome.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of colic can be expensive and may exceed the owners? financial limitations. This may result in premature euthanasia prior to treatment on rectifiable financial grounds rather than for welfare reasons. It is therefore important to ensure appropriate business model auditing to identify where costs may limit expected treatment options. Objectives This study investigated how the costs of treatment for equine colic at a single university referral hospital have changed over a 10-year period between 2003 and 2013. The aim was to analyse which costs have changed excessively or disproportionately between different treating services, consumables and professional fees, which may render treatment of colic financially prohibitive. Study design Retrospective study. Methods All charges billed against cases undergoing treatment for colic between 2003 and 2013 were accessed from hospital records. Horses were identified as having surgery or purely medical management. Charges were categorised by service (medicine, surgery, anaesthesia), type (consumable, livery, professional fee), and consumable type (e.g. NSAID, opiate, antibiotic, fluid therapy, lab fee, surgery consumables). Results There was a significant association between year and the frequency of medically and surgically treated colic (Chi-square test, P<0.001). Between 2003 and 2012, median total treatment costs increased in both medically (42%) and surgically treated (46%) cases. Costs attributable to consumables increased (surgical cases 28%, medical cases 14%), while those attributable to livery (surgical -19%, medical -21%) and professional fees decreased (surgical -22%, medical -8%). The greatest increase in consumable cost was attributable to fluids (surgical 94%, medical 182%). Conclusions This study demonstrates areas where the cost of colic treatment are disproportionately changing and thus highlights potential targets where business models may be optimised in the interest of patient survival. The substantial increase in costs attributable to fluids correlates with increasing emphasis on fluid therapy in the management of colic.
