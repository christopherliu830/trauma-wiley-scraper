AB  - Reasons for performing study We have already demonstrated that vaccination with empty BPV1 capsids termed virus-like particles (VLP) protects horses from experimental infection with BPV1 virion. Long-term monitoring of antibody titres in experimental horses and data from other species suggest that this protection is long lasting. Objectives To test protection against experimental infection with BPV-1 virion in horses that were vaccinated with BPV-1 L1 VLP approximately 5 years earlier. Study design Controlled experiment. Methods Seven horses, vaccinated 3 times (boosters after 4 weeks and 6 months) in 2007/2008 with doses of BPV1 L1 VLP ranging from 50??g to 150??g/dose and 3 unvaccinated control horses were challenged by intra-dermal inoculation with cow wart derived BPV1 virion (5???107 BPV-1 virions per wheal, 10 wheals per horse). Inoculation sites were monitored for 10 weeks. Blood for serum antibody titre determination by pseudovirion neutralisation assay was taken on the day of challenge and after 6 months. Results Six of 7 vaccinated horses had measurable serum antibody titres (1:50 to 1:400). These titres were boosted by inoculation (about one step of dilution). Two of 3 unvaccinated controls remained sero-negative. One control horse showed sero-conversion. All control horses developed tumours at all 10 inoculation sites. Tumours appeared approximately 2 weeks after inoculation and reached maximum sizes of up to 8?mm. Regression was complete by 8 weeks after their first appearance in all horses. All vaccinated horses remained completely free from tumours. No influence of dose rate or antibody titre on the level of protection could be determined. Conclusions BPV-1 L1 VLP vaccination proves to be fully effective in protecting horses from experimental infection and tumour formation 5 years post immunisation. The protection was complete even in horses with low or unmeasurable antibody titres. This is another step towards establishing a vaccination against equine sarcoids.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Most complications in equine castrations result from insufficient ligation and contamination. Objectives Stapling instruments reduce tissue handling, decrease surgical time, minimise contamination and provide secure visceral and vascular closure when used correctly. Using a stapler device might therefore increase ligation security and decrease contamination, and by this, reduce the complication rate seen in routine castration. Study design The applicability and safety of a TA-30 premium stapler as a ligation method in castration of the horse was tested in 15 horses under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency. Three horses were cryptorchids, one horse suffered a scirrous chord, and one horse suffered an infectious orchitis. Methods The vaginal process was approached inguinally. A noncutting emasculator was applied to compress the closed vaginal process. Consecutively a TA-30 Premium stapler was applied to the compressed site. The distal part of the vaginal process was then removed, the stapler device was released and the incision was closed. The TA-30 stapler accommodates 3 different staple cartridges of 30?mm width, accommodating 1.0 to 2.5?mm tissue thickness. The thickness of the vaginal process after compression was measured to be 1.0?mm (0.9?1.1?mm) in 10 fresh specimens. The 30-V3 cartridges (triple row, 1?mm closed diameter) were chosen in 9 horses with smaller vaginal processes and the 30-3.5 cartridges (double row 1.5?mm closed diameter) in 6 other horses with larger vaginal processes. Results All horses recovered without intra- or post operative complications. Conclusions A TA-30 stapler is a safe ligation instrument in equine castrations. The use of titanium staples may reduce infection rate in routine castrations, even more in ligation of precontaminated vaginal processes in cases of post operative haemorrhage control after practice castrations or in closing the vaginal process after the removal of an infected testis or scirrous chord.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It is unknown how students develop lameness assessment skills. Objectives To quantify student performance, visual approaches and attitudes to lameness evaluation. Study design Comparison of student cohorts. Methods Twenty 3rd year (inexperienced cohort) and thirteen 4th to 5th year (experienced cohort) students evaluated 30 video clips showing horses on the straight line or circle, followed by a general questionnaire. Eyetracking records (Tobii X102) were collected in parallel. The percentage of correctly evaluated horses was calculated based on verified expert opinion. From the eyetracking records on the straight line, the percentage time spent on different regions on the horse was calculated and compared between cohorts. Results For both cohorts, while the correct detection of lameness per se was high (median ≥92%), detection of the correct limb was lower (median 40?80% depending on quarters and cohort) and detection of sound horses was at chance level (median?=?50%). The correct limb was indicated significantly more often by the experienced cohort (P?≤?0.032) except for forelimb lameness on the circle (P?=?0.053). The inexperienced cohort dedicated more time to looking at limb movement, while the experienced cohort focused on head and pelvis movement. Students judged their expected task performance realistically, on average underestimating themselves slightly by around 8%. The task difficulty was rated as a mean (s.d.) of 4.10 (0.48) out of 5 by the inexperienced and 3.35 (0.47) by the experienced cohort. Conclusions Lameness detection skills evolve and improve over the course of the curriculum, with a shift from limb assessment to upper body assessment. Students must learn to reliably determine soundness, and hindlimb lameness proved more difficult than forelimb lameness. Students find lameness detection comparatively difficult, but have a realistic understanding of their skill level, suggesting that they can determine their needs for further practice.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in horses has not been evaluated. Objectives 1) To establish a technique for measuring MPS?in vivo in the horse using a labelled amino acid tracer and 2) to determine basal MPS in the horse using this technique. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg bwt D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) i.v. and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?h. Pharmacokinetic modelling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% plasma enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6?h of infusion and the effect of treadmill exercise and sedation (0.4?mg/kg bwt) were also determined. Horses subsequently received the calculated D5-Phe infusion rate and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were collected after 1 and 3?h, allowing basal MPS to be calculated. Precursor intramuscular phe labelling was measured by GC-MS and tracer phe incorporation into muscle myofibrillar protein was determined using GC-pyrolysis-IRMS to calculate fractional synthetic rate. Results The mean rate of whole body phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56??mol/kg bwt/h (s.d. 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41??mol/kg bwt (s.d. 8.8). From this a priming dose of 3.3??mol/kg bwt and an infusion rate of 4.5??mol/kg bwt/h D5-Phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently confirmed to achieve steady state tracer enrichment from 5.6?9.1 APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). D5-Phe incorporation revealed a basal FSR of 0.029%/h (s.d. 0.013) in the horse. Conclusions D5-Phenylalanine is a suitable amino acid tracer for measurement of MPS in the horse yielding rates of MPS in line with other large mammals.

AB  - Abstract Emerging evidence highlights the role of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) KCNQ1OT1 in fracture healing. Osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival are pivotal during this process. In this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the regulatory role of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 during osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival. We searched the gene expression omnibus databases and LncBase Experimental V.2 to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) targets of KCNQ1OT1. MiR-701-3p was selected as a differentially expressed miRNA and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify its interaction with KCNQ1OT1. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) was also identified as a target of miR-701-3p. We further identified KCNQ1OT1 as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-701-3p that could influence osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that the KCNQ1OT1/miR-701-3p/FGFR3 axis is an important regulator of osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, and provide a new therapeutic avenue for fracture healing.

AB  - To better assess historical, physical and neurophysiological features of UNE, 20 centers widely distributed in the national country have joined a collaborative study in November 2001. Case recognition was based on clinical ground: symptoms or signs suggestive of ulnar nerve impairment at elbow, as numbness/ paresthesia in the part of ulnar innervated hand with or without sensory loss, elbow pain and weakness of ulnar hand muscles with or without hypotrophy. Electrophysiological examination was performed by a proper protocol according to AAEM/AAN recommendations (1999). Two validated (DASH and BCTQ) and one newly proposed self-administered questionnaires were used for patient-oriented evaluation. Clinical severity was assessed with a 3-stage scale (Antoniadis, 1997) and a 4-stage scale (Giannini, 2001). Electrophysiological severity was quantified using a 5-step neurophysiological classification (Padua, 2001) and a 13-point neurophysiological score (Mondelli, 2000). Two hundred-seven patients (218 limbs affected) were collected until October 2002. The females/males ratio was 1:1.9 and females were younger than males (mean age 44.5 and 52.5?yrs. respectively). Repetitive stress injury was reported as possible pathogenetic factor in 50.5% of cases and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - comorbidity was diagnosed in 22.5% of limbs without gender difference. Reduction of ulnar nerve motor conduction across the elbow was found in 86.2% of limbs. EMG neurogenic pattern in ulnar supplied hand muscles and digit-wrist ulnar SAP abnormalities were respectively observed in 61.5% and 49.1% of cases. Pain (61%), associated with positive provocative test (p?<?0.01), was equally distributed in each clinical classes and was related with higher BCTQ score (p?<?0.001). DASH questionnaire showed the highest relation to clinical scale and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). High relations were found among clinical scales, neurophysiological classification and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). These preliminary results show a very good reliability of most measurements used for multiperspective assessment of UNE syndrome.

AB  - The safety and liver utilization with prerecovery liver biopsy (PLB) in extended criteria liver donors are unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 1323 brain death donors (PLB?=?496) from 3 organ procurement organizations (OPOs). Outcomes were complications, preempted liver recovery (PLR), and liver transplantation (LT). Additional analyses included liver-only and propensity score?matched multiorgan donor subgroups. PLB donors were older (57 versus 53 years; P?<?0.001). Hepatitis C antibody positivity (14.3% versus 9.6%, P?=?0.01) and liver-only donors (42.6% versus 17.5%; P?<?0.001) were more prevalent. The PLB cohort had fewer complications (31.9% versus 42.3%; P?<?0.001). In the PLB cohort, PLR was significantly higher (odds ratio [OR], 3.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.42-4.92) and LT lower (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.91). In liver-only and propensity score?matched multiorgan donor subgroups, PLR was significantly higher (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.94 and OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.37-3.82, respectively) without a decrease in LT (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.43-1.18 and OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.63-1.33, respectively) in PLB subgroups. In conclusion, in extended criteria liver donors, PLB is safe and decreases futile liver recovery without decreasing LT. Increased use of PLB, especially in liver-only donors, is likely to save costs to OPOs and transplant centers and improve efficiencies in organ allocation.

AB  - Abstract In mammals, proper storage and distribution of lipids in and between tissues is essential for the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Here, we show that tumour growth triggers hepatic metabolic dysfunction as part of the cancer cachectic phenotype, particularly by reduced hepatic very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion and hypobetalipoproteinemia. As a molecular cachexia output pathway, hepatic levels of the transcription factor transforming growth factor beta 1-stimulated clone (TSC) 22 D4 were increased in cancer cachexia. Mimicking high cachectic levels of TSC22D4 in healthy livers led to the inhibition of hepatic VLDL release and lipogenic genes, and diminished systemic VLDL levels under both normal and high fat dietary conditions. Liver-specific ablation of TSC22D4 triggered hypertriglyceridemia through the induction of hepatic VLDL secretion. Furthermore, hepatic TSC22D4 expression levels were correlated with the degree of body weight loss and VLDL hypo-secretion in cancer cachexia, and TSC22D4 deficiency rescued tumour cell-induced metabolic dysfunction in hepatocytes. Therefore, hepatic TSC22D4 activity may represent a molecular rationale for peripheral energy deprivation in subjects with metabolic wasting diseases, including cancer cachexia.

AB  - Despite improvements in outcomes for kidney transplant recipients in the past decade, graft failure continues to impose substantial burden on patients. However, the population-wide economic burden of graft failure has not been quantified. This study aims to fill that gap by comparing outcomes from a simulation model of kidney transplant patients in which patients are at risk for graft failure with an alternative simulation in which the risk of graft failure is assumed to be zero. Transitions through the model were estimated using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data from 1987 to 2017. We estimated lifetime costs, overall survival, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for both scenarios and calculated the difference between them to obtain the burden of graft failure. We find that for the average patient, graft failure will impose additional medical costs of $78 079 (95% confidence interval [CI] $41 074, $112 409) and a loss of 1.66 QALYs (95% CI 1.15, 2.18). Given 17 644 kidney transplants in 2017, the total incremental lifetime medical costs associated with graft failure is $1.38B (95% CI $725M, $1.98B) and the total QALY loss is 29 289 (95% CI 20 291, 38 464). Efforts to reduce the incidence of graft failure or to mitigate its impact are urgently needed.
