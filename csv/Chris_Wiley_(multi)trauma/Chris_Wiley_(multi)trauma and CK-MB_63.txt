AB  - Abstract Objectives:Recent fMRI studies have shown that it is possible to reliably identify the default-mode network (DMN) in the absence of any task, by resting-state connectivity analyses in healthy volunteers. We here aimed to identify the DMN in the challenging patient population of disorders of consciousness encountered following coma. Experimental design: A spatial independent component analysis-based methodology permitted DMN assessment, decomposing connectivity in all its different sources either neuronal or artifactual. Three different selection criteria were introduced assessing anticorrelation-corrected connectivity with or without an automatic masking procedure and calculating connectivity scores encompassing both spatial and temporal properties. These three methods were validated on 10 healthy controls and applied to an independent group of 8 healthy controls and 11 severely brain-damaged patients [locked-in syndrome (n = 2), minimally conscious (n = 1), and vegetative state (n = 8)]. Principal observations: All vegetative patients showed fewer connections in the default-mode areas, when compared with controls, contrary to locked-in patients who showed near-normal connectivity. In the minimally conscious-state patient, only the two selection criteria considering both spatial and temporal properties were able to identify an intact right lateralized BOLD connectivity pattern, and metabolic PET data suggested its neuronal origin. Conclusions: When assessing resting-state connectivity in patients with disorders of consciousness, it is important to use a methodology excluding non-neuronal contributions caused by head motion, respiration, and heart rate artifacts encountered in all studied patients.

AB  - Abstract Clinical criteria for the classification of symptomatic idiopathic (primary) osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands were developed from data collected in a multi-center study. Patients with OA were compared with a group of patients who had hand symptoms from other causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and the spondylar-thropathies. Variables from the medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiographs were analyzed. All patients had pain, aching, or stiffness in the hands. Patients were classified as having clinical OA if on examination there was hard tissue enlargement involving at least 2 of 10 selected joints, swelling of fewer than 3 metacarpophalangeal joints, and hard tissue enlargement of at least 2 distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. If the patient had fewer than 2 enlarged DIP joints, then deformity of at least 1 of the 10 selected joints was necessary in order to classify the symptoms as being due to OA. The 10 selected joints were the second and third DIP, the second and third proximal interphalangeal, and the trapeziometacarpal (base of the thumb) joints of both hands. Criteria derived using the ?classification tree? method were 92% sensitive and 98% specific. The ?traditional format? classification method required that at least 3 of these 4 criteria be present to classify a patient as having OA of the hand. The latter sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 87%. Radiography was of less value than clinical examination in the classification of symptomatic OA of the hands.

AB  - EB is a recessive condition caused by a defect in collagen 7 production, such that epithelial cells do not adhere adequately to the underlying basement membranes. Minor mechanical trauma and stress forces will cause recurrent blistering of the skin and mucosal surfaces, which heal by scarring. The hand suffers particularly badly, and a characteristic mitten deformity of scar tissue is a common stigmata of the disease. We report a 51 year old survivor of EB with a bilateral mitten hand deformity that had been present since the age of 6 years. Extensive surgical release of the dominant left hand was undertaken, resurfacing the created defects with split skin grafts under regional anaesthesia. Fingers that had been buried for 45 years were straightened and held in place with k wires whilst the grafts were vascularising. Extensive post operative physiotherapy and splinting were undertaken, with functional improvement to the extent that the patient was able to hold a pen and write. Skin graft donor sites healed uneventfully. Extensive release of mitten hand deformity in long term survivors of EB is a worthwhile surgical procedure with good functional results. The problems of surgery and anaesthesia in this condition are discussed. Release of the second hand is planned.
