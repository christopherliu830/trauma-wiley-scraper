AB  - Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy is probably the commonest form of vasculitic neuropathy in Mediterranean countries, as usually related to the widespread hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We describe the spectrum of manifestations in a large series of patients with cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, also analyzing the impact of comorbid factors, which are quite frequent in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia. The cohort included 60 patients (10 men, 50 women) with peripheral neuropathy associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia as main or sole cause (type 2 in 36 cases, type 3 in 4, not typized in 20), HCV-related in all patients but 8 (3 men and 5 women). Median age of patients was 65 years (range 41?85), and median age at onset of neuropathy was 59 (range 40?84). Peripheral neuropathy represented an onset manifestation of mixed cryoglobulinemia in about half patients. The most frequent clinical pattern was pure sensory neuropathy in 40 patients, including 4 patients with prominent ataxia; sensory neuropathy was asymmetrical in distribution in 9 patients, and in 14 patients sensory action potentials (SAPs) of the sural nerve were normal, suggesting selective involvement of the small sensory fibers. The remaining patients had sensorimotor neuropathy (15 cases) and mononeuropathy multiplex (5 cases). Positive sensory symptoms and restless legs syndrome were the most common manifestations. Neurophysiological study showed axonal degeneration of varying severity in all patients. In 20 patients, additional causes of neuropathy were present, including type 2 diabetes (5 patients), glucose intolerance (6 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3 patients), and alcohol (2 patients). With respect with this subset of patients, in ?pure? cryoglobulinemic neuropathy there was more often a pattern of sensory neuropathy (31/40 vs. 6/20; p?=?0.001), with more frequent asymmetrical distribution (9 vs 0; p?=?0.05) and small fiber involvement (11 vs 3). Severity of neuropathy, as judged on the basis of the Rankin scale and of neurophysiological changes, was similar in the two subgroups. Our study confirms that sensory neuropathy, often asymmetrical, is the most common clinical pattern in cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, and is consistently present in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy rather than in patients with other associated causes of neuropathy; in these latter, paradoxically, clinical and neurophysiological impairment seems not greater than in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.

AB  - Study aim: the Ebf gene family has been implicated in several developmental processes, ranging from B-cell development to neuronal differentiation. As the murine Ebf2 gene is expressed in numerous sites of nervous system, Ebf2-null mice develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to defective migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons, and a peripheral neuropathy as well. Therefore, we aimed to study whether electrophysiological tests would be able to detect abnormalities of peripheral nerve function. Methods: 2 groups of mice were studied, which consisted of 8 Ebf2-/- mice and 9 age-matched controls. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the ankle and at the ischiatic notch; the compound motor action potential (cMAP) was recorded from the paw muscles with a pair of needle electrodes to measure the motor conduction velocity (MCV). Results: MCV mean values were lower in Ebf2-/-(21.8?m/sec; SD 2.9) than in controls (35.2?m/sec; SD 2.6) and the difference was significant (p?<?0.001). The mean cMAP amplitude was also decreased in Ebf2-/-(6.2?mV; SD 2.7) as compared to controls (9.3?mV; SD 2.6, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: electrophysiological tests demonstrated a sharp decrease of sciatic MCV in Ebf2-/- mouse, as consequence of defective axon sorting, segmental dysmyelination and axonal damage revealed by pathological study.

AB  - Introduction: Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC) is a safe and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in HIV infected patients. Its efficacy is focused on its role in modulating TNF-alpha expression and on the restoration of endogenous acetylcarnitine. Peripheral nervous system is frequently involved during HIV infection and distal sensitive polyneuropathy is one of the most common neurological complications (up to 30% of AIDS patients). Etiology is still unknown. One of the pathogenetic hypotheses is the role of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) in causing neuropathic pain. Method: Twenty HIV- positive patients affected by neuropathic pain with EMG-evidence of axonal alterations were enrolled; we excluded patients with mini-mental test score <?24, acute CMV infection, chronic demyelinating neuropathies. All patients were treated with ALC at the dose of 1 gram t.i.d. for 4 weeks. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate characteristics of patient's pain before, during, and after treatment. EMG and neurographic assessment was performed before and after treatment. To evaluate changes in VAS score we used non-parametric Friedman's test (F). Wilcoxon's test (W) was performed to timing the appearance of pain improvement, and to evaluate neurophysiological data. Results: The changes in VAS score were statistically significant during ALC treatment (mean score: before 6.7?±?2.1 ? after treatment 5.0?±?2.1)(F?=?P?<?0.001). The appearance of therapeutic effect was reached during the first week (W?=?P?<?0.03) and during the fourth week (W?=?P?<?0.05) of treatment. Analysis of neurophysiological data showed a statistically significant improvement of peroneal nerve motor parameters: reduced motor distal latency (W?=?P?<?0.02), increased amplitude of the compound motor action potential at distal (W?=?P?<?0.02) and proximal (W?=?P?<?0.05) site of stimulation. Conclusions: Our data show the efficacy of ALC in the treatment of neuropathic pain, confirming previous results. Moreover, the analgesic effects appear during the first week of treatment according with pre-clinical data in different experimental models of pain. Among mechanisms for ALC efficacy in patients with HIV-related polyneuropathy, there is a neurotrophic effect as evidenced from patch-skin biopsy evaluation.

AB  - Objective To provide a strategic framework for the prevention of bipolar disorder (BD) that incorporates a ?Big Data? approach to risk assessment for BD. Methods Computerized databases (e.g., Pubmed, PsychInfo, and MedlinePlus) were used to access English-language articles published between 1966 and 2012 with the search terms bipolar disorder, prodrome, ?Big Data?, and biomarkers cross-referenced with genomics/genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, inflammation, oxidative stress, neurotrophic factors, cytokines, cognition, neurocognition, and neuroimaging. Papers were selected from the initial search if the primary outcome(s) of interest was (were) categorized in any of the following domains: (i) ?omics? (e.g., genomics), (ii) molecular, (iii) neuroimaging, and (iv) neurocognitive. Results The current strategic approach to identifying individuals at risk for BD, with an emphasis on phenotypic information and family history, has insufficient predictive validity and is clinically inadequate. The heterogeneous clinical presentation of BD, as well as its pathoetiological complexity, suggests that it is unlikely that a single biomarker (or an exclusive biomarker approach) will sufficiently augment currently inadequate phenotypic-centric prediction models. We propose a ?Big Data?- bioinformatics approach that integrates vast and complex phenotypic, anamnestic, behavioral, family, and personal ?omics? profiling. Bioinformatic processing approaches, utilizing cloud- and grid-enabled computing, are now capable of analyzing data on the order of tera-, peta-, and exabytes, providing hitherto unheard of opportunities to fundamentally revolutionize how psychiatric disorders are predicted, prevented, and treated. High-throughput networks dedicated to research on, and the treatment of, BD, integrating both adult and younger populations, will be essential to sufficiently enroll adequate samples of individuals across the neurodevelopmental trajectory in studies to enable the characterization and prevention of this heterogeneous disorder. Conclusions Advances in bioinformatics using a ?Big Data? approach provide an opportunity for novel insights regarding the pathoetiology of BD. The coordinated integration of research centers, inclusive of mixed-age populations, is a promising strategic direction for advancing this line of neuropsychiatric research.

AB  - Background and Objectives Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler?Weber?Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. Study Design/Materials and Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. ?2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Results Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P?=?0.005; intensity: P?=?0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P?=?0.012; intensity: P?=?0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P?=?0.434) or intensity (P?=?0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P?<?0.001) and Nd:YAG (P?<?0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P?=?0.061; intensity: P?=?0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P?=?0.040) and intensity (P?=?0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. Conclusions HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A 38-year-old man begun to have paresthesias in the last three fingers of the left hand followed in few months by paresthesias in the right hand, weakness of distal muscles in upper limbs and paresthesias of lower limbs. HCV positivity was discovered by routine blood test. Neurological examination, 18 months after onset, showed asymmetric weakness and sensory loss with a nerve distribution more on the right side. Electrophysiological examination showed a sensory-motor demyelinating neuropathy with motor conduction blocks and or excessive temporal dispersion of proximal compound muscle action potential in five nerves. Coexistence of focal motor and sensory conduction blocks at the same sites was demonstrated in three nerves. CSF examination showed increased protein content (66?mg/dl) and no cells. Cryoglobulins were absent. Active HCV-RNA replication was detected in the serum by RT-PCR. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis. Sural nerve biopsy showed fiber loss, prevalently of large diameter fibers, asymmetrical between fascicles and few clusters of regeneration. There were no demyelinating features, onion bulbs or inflammatory infiltrates. Weakness and electrophysiological findings worsened after high doses intravenous immunoglobulins but improved after intravenous methylprednisolone and interferon alpha treatment with resolution of conduction blocks in two months. Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), as in the patient we describe, is a rare disorder considered an asymmetric variant of chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP). HCV infection is usually associated with a multineuropathy due to vasculitis or a symmetric sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. CIDP has been described but never MADSAM. It is difficult to be sure of a pathogenetic link between a dysimmune demyelinating neuropathy and HCV infection, nonetheless the coexistence of hepatitis makes the choice of treatment problematic in these patients.

AB  - We report a case of a 50- year-old patient, diagnosed as having mycosis fungoides since 1 year, was admitted to our Hospital for progressive weakness and sensory loss in upper and lower limbs. On neurological examination, moderate weakness of the distal muscles of upper and lower limbs, ataxia, loss of proprioceptive and tactile sensation of the hands and foot and diffuse areflexia were noticed. The electrophysiological evaluation revealed signs of prevalent axonal sensory-motor polyradiculoneuropathy and the cerebrospinal fluid showed a marked increase of proteins and a mild increase of cells. A biopsy of the sural nerve revealed a severe axonal loss with preservation of myelin. The possible pathogenetic mechanism of this extremely rare peripheral neuropathy and the differences from previous reports are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Research in the last decades shows that common mental disorders may be long-term and severely disabling, resulting in severe mental illness (SMI). The percentage of Dutch SMI-patients with common mental disorders receiving mental health services is estimated at 65?70%. However, it is unclear which patients in fact become SMI-patients. We need to know more about the possible course of common mental disorders, understand the origins of chronicity in more detail, and have more insight in related care processes and care use of patients with common mental disorders. The MATCH cohort study is a four-year multicentre naturalistic cohort study, with yearly assessments in primary, secondary, and tertiary services in three large Dutch mental health services. Socio-demographics, mental disorders, course and severity of psychopathology, physiological health indicators, neurocognitive functioning, past and present life events, health care use and contact with mental health services, social functioning and quality of life, and recovery and well-being are assessed. Baseline findings of 283 participating individuals and their key clinicians are described. The sample appears to appropriately represent the distribution of individuals across diagnostic categories in services, and level of care (outpatient, day treatment, inpatient) in the Netherlands and other developed nations.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated a decrease in intestinal healing in intra-abdominal infection. Currently, the effect of localized intra-abdominal infection on anastomotic healing and strength is not known. This study was designed to evaluate anastomotic wound healing in the presence of intra-abdominal abscess. 30 male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 270?300 grams were used for this experiment. 20 animals underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with 16 gauge needle. They were followed for 14 days. 9 of them died in the first week. The CLP animals had an initial 20% weight loss; however by day 10 they had a gradual return toward control weight. At the end of 14 days, rats from CLP group (n?=?11) and control group (n?=?10) underwent laparotomy and single-layer left colonic anastomosis. Blood cultures and abdominal swab cultures were sent from both groups. Post-operatively, animals were allowed to recover, food and water were offered ad libitum. At post-operative day five, animals were euthanized by thiopental overdose. Following anastomotic bursting pressure measurements, two samples were taken from the anastomotic line for subsequent determination of hydroxyproline content. Groups were compared with Students?t test. Data were expressed as means?±?SEM. In the post-operative period, all rats lost 10% to 12% of their body weight. No bacterial growth was detected in cultures. Hydroxyproline content measurements were significantly higher in the CLP group (11.2?±?0.3 vs. 9.8?±?0.5?ug HPO/mg dry tissue weight. P?<?0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in bursting pressure measurements between the groups (177?±?6.3 vs. 164?±?10.4?mmHg. P?>?0.05). These findings suggest that localized intra-abdominal infection without sepsis doesn?t inhibit intestinal anastomotic healing.

AB  - ABSTRACT The number of pancreas transplants has decreased over the past decade, most notably numbers of pancreas after kidney (pak) and pancreas transplant alone (pta) procedures. This decrease may be mitigated in the future when changes to national pancreas allocation policy approved by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Board of Directors in 2010 are implemented. The new policy will combine waiting lists for pak, pta, and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (spk) transplants), and give equal priority to candidates for all three procedures. This policy change may also eliminate geographic variation in waiting times caused by geographic differences in allocation policy. Deceased donor pancreas donation rates have been declining since 2005, and the donation rate remains low. The outcomes of pancreas grafts are difficult to describe due to lack of a uniform definition of graft failure in the transplant community. However long-term survival is better for spk versus pak and pta transplants. This may represent the difficulty of detecting rejection in the absence of a simultaneously transplanted kidney. The challenges of pancreas transplant are reflected in high rates of rehospitalization, most occurring within the first 6 months posttransplant. Pancreas transplant is associated with higher incidence of rejection compared with kidney transplant.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects and its efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in patients with ischemic stroke. We investigated its efficacy in preventing and reversing established nerve disorders in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes. After STZ injection (60?mg/kg/ip), EPO (5000 units/kg b.w. i.p. three times a week) was started in a group of rats and continued for five weeks (prevention schedule). In another group of diabetic rats, EPO was started six weeks after STZ, continued for five weeks (therapeutic schedule). Groups of non-diabetic control rats were similarly treated. Antidromic nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in the tail was assessed at five weeks for all groups and at 11 weeks for the therapeutic schedule. Compared to non-diabetic rats, NCV was 21% lower (P?<?0.001) at five weeks in the STZ group, EPO partially prevented this decrease (14% lower than with non-diabetic controls), with a significant difference from the untreated-diabetic group (P?<?0.01). After six weeks of uncontrolled diabetes, at the beginning of therapeutic EPO, NCV was reduced by 23% and after 11 weeks by 40%, EPO efficacy was confirmed. Thermal (hot plate method) and mechanical (Randall-Selitto method) nociceptive thresholds were monitored weekly throughout the study. In addition, in all groups, the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers, which reflects possible degeneration of somatic unmyelinated fibers, was assessed in the hindpaw using protein-gene-product 9.5 immunostaining. Rats developed mechanical hyperalgesia within two weeks after STZ injection. Both the prevention and therapeutic schedules of EPO reduced diabetic hyperalgesia after two weeks of treatment, reaching statistical significance at fur, and five weeks of treatment, with no such effect in non-diabetic controls. Hindpaw thermal response latencies were significantly (P?<?0.001) increased in untreated diabetic rats compared with untreated controls. EPO had no effect on these latencies in control rats but partially prevented the increase in diabetic rats, so the values were still different from controls, but significantly different from untreated diabetics at four and five weeks in both the prevention and therapeutic studies (P?<?0.05). These observations extend the therapeutic utility of EPO and highlight its potential for treating established diabetic neuropathies.

AB  - Prolonged urinary cannabinoid excretion in chronic frequent cannabis users confounds identification of recent cannabis intake that may be important in treatment, workplace, clinical, and forensic testing programs. In addition, differentiation of synthetic ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intake from cannabis plant products might be an important interpretive issue. THC, 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH) urine concentrations were evaluated during previous controlled cannabis administration studies following tandem alkaline/E. coli ?-glucuronidase hydrolysis. We optimized recombinant ?-glucuronidase enzymatic urinary hydrolysis before simultaneous liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC?MS/MS) quantification of THC, 11-OH-THC, THCCOOH, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THCV (THCVCOOH) in urine. Enzyme amount, incubation time and temperature, buffer molarity and pH were optimized using pooled urine samples collected during a National Institute on Drug Abuse, Institutional Review Board-approved clinical study. Optimized cannabinoid hydrolysis with recombinant ?-glucuronidase was achieved with 2000 IU enzyme, 2 M pH 6.8 sodium phosphate buffer, and 0.2 mL urine at 37°C for 16 h. The LC?MS/MS quantification method for hydrolyzed urinary cannabinoids was validated per the Scientific Working Group on Toxicology guidelines. Linear ranges were 1?250 ?g/L for THC and CBG, 2?250 ?g/L for 11-OH-THC, CBD, CBN, THCV and THCVCOOH, and 1?500 ?g/L for THCCOOH. Inter-batch analytical bias was 92.4?112.4%, imprecision 4.4?9.3% CV (n = 25), extraction efficiency 44.3?97.1% and matrix effect ?29.6 to 1.8% (n = 10). The method was utilized to analyze urine specimens collected during our controlled smoked, vaporized, and edible cannabis administration study to improve interpretation of urine cannabinoid test results.

AB  - ABSTRACT Neurological disorders have emerged as a predominant healthcare concern in recent years due to their severe consequences on quality of life and prevalence throughout the world. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these diseases and the interactions between different brain cell types is essential for the development of new therapeutics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are invaluable tools for neurological disease modeling, as they have unlimited self-renewal and differentiation capacity. Mounting evidence shows: (i) various brain cells can be generated from iPSCs in two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures; and (ii) further advances in 3D culture systems have led to the differentiation of iPSCs into organoids with multiple brain cell types and specific brain regions. These 3D organoids have gained widespread attention as in vitro tools to recapitulate complex features of the brain, and (iii) complex interactions between iPSC-derived brain cell types can recapitulate physiological and pathological conditions of blood-brain barrier (BBB). As iPSCs can be generated from diverse patient populations, researchers have effectively applied 2D, 3D, and BBB models to recapitulate genetically complex neurological disorders and reveal novel insights into molecular and genetic mechanisms of neurological disorders. In this review, we describe recent progress in the generation of 2D, 3D, and BBB models from iPSCs and further discuss their limitations, advantages, and future ventures. This review also covers the current status of applications of 2D, 3D, and BBB models in drug screening, precision medicine, and modeling a wide range of neurological diseases (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders, brain injury, and neuropsychiatric disorders). ? 2019 American Physiological Society.
