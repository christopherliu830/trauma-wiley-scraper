AB  - Objective The contributions of disorder severity, comorbidity and interpersonal variables to therapists' adherence to a cognitive?behavioural treatment (CBT) manual were tested. Method Thirty-eight patients received panic control therapy (PCT) for panic disorder. Trained observers watching videotapes of the sixth session of a 24-session protocol rated therapists' adherence to PCT and their use of interventions from outside the CBT model. Different observers rated patients' behavioural resistance to therapy in the same session using the client resistance code. Interview measures obtained before treatment included the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, the anxiety disorders interview schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, Axis II. Questionnaire measures were the anxiety sensitivity index at intake, and, at session 2, the therapist and client versions of the working alliance inventory?short form. Results The higher the patients' resistance and the more Axis II traits a patient had, the less adherent the therapist. Moreover, the more resistant the client, the more therapists resorted to interventions from outside the CBT model. Stronger therapist and patient alliance was also generally related to better adherence, but these results were somewhat inconsistent across therapists. Pretreatment disorder severity and comorbidity were not related to adherence. Conclusions Interpersonal variables, particularly behavioural resistance to therapy, are related to therapists' ability to adhere to a treatment manual and to their use of interventions from outside of the CBT model. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner message Patients' behavioural resistance to therapy may make it more difficult for cognitive?behavioural clinicians to adhere to a structured treatment protocol and more likely for them to borrow interventions from outside the CBT model. Patients' Axis II traits may make adherence to treatment CBT protocol more difficult, although whether this is true varies across therapists. Therapists' adherence to a structured protocol and borrowing from outside of the CBT model do not appear to be affected by disorder severity or Axis I comorbidity.

AB  - Abstract The Department of Health has placed great importance on evidence-based purchasing rooted in the assessment and measurement of health outcomes. This paper critically examines the conventional clinical effectiveness approach and argues for the integration of a user perspective in defining and determining health outcomes. Some conceptual issues around user involvement in mental health are considered first. Then we draw upon research with users and carers of a community orientated acute mental health service to examine users conceptions of outcomes. It is argued that incorporating a user perspective on outcomes has to involve a consideration of the entire course and experience of mental illness, i.e. the meaning to users and significant others of ?becoming? and ?being ill?. The paper relates users' perceptions of positive outcomes to their sense of self-management of their illness. Thus, a positive user-centred service response, when help is sought from mental health professionals, is one which both acknowledges that self-managing strategies are no longer sufficient, while also seeking to understand the user (and carer) perspective of the onset, course and meaning of the illness. Moreover, it conceptualizes outcome not as a single entity, e.g. changes in behaviour, but in relation to needs viewed holistically and whose specific features change with the course of the illness. Finally, it challenges the over-simplistic concept of consumerism in health, based on securing feedback about patient satisfaction with services. Rather, it argues for an approach to service provision which combines user understandings of illness and coping strategies with the skills and interventions of professionals. Thus, it is not simply a question of professionals keeping users informed about treatment options but of actively seeking and taking into account the user perspective on their illness.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Abstract Solid-organ transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage organ failure. Parents of pediatric transplant recipients who reported a lack of readiness for discharge had more difficulty coping and managing their child's medically complex care at home. In this paper, we describe the protocol for the pilot study of a mHealth intervention (myFAMI). The myFAMI intervention is based on the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory and focuses on family self-management of pediatric transplant recipients at home. The purpose of the pilot study is to test the feasibility of the myFAMI intervention with family members of pediatric transplant recipients and to test the preliminary efficacy on postdischarge coping through a randomized controlled trial. The sample will include 40 family units, 20 in each arm of the study, from three pediatric transplant centers in the United States. Results from this study may advance nursing science by providing insight for the use of mHealth to facilitate patient/family?nurse communication and family self-management behaviors for family members of pediatric transplant recipients.

AB  - Abstract Two hundred thirty four participants in the DSM-IV Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Field Trial who reported sexual and/or physical abuse were evaluated. Participants were categorized according to type of abuse (physical, sexual, both), duration of abuse (acute versus chronic), and onset of abuse (early versus late). Separate logistic regression analyses examined the relationship between age of onset, duration, abuse type, and the complex PTSD (CP) lifetime diagnosis for women and men. Sexually abused women, especially those who also experienced physical abuse, had a higher risk of developing CP, although CP symptoms occurred at a high base rate among physically abused women. The theoretical implications and incremental clinical usefulness of targeting CP symptoms with abused populations are discussed.

AB  - Summary Despite current recommendations on the management of severe peri-operative bleeding, there is no pragmatic guidance for the peri-operative monitoring and management of cardiac surgical patients taking direct oral anticoagulants. Members of the Transfusion and Haemostasis Subcommittee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology, of their own volition, performed an independent systematic review of peer-reviewed original research, review articles and case reports and developed the following consensus statement. This has been endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology. In our opinion, most patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy presenting for elective cardiac surgery can be safely managed in the peri-operative period if the following conditions are fulfilled: direct oral anticoagulants have been discontinued two days before cardiac surgery, corresponding to five elimination half-live periods; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or a high risk of bleeding, a pre-operative plasma level of direct oral anticoagulants has been determined and found to be below 30 ng.ml?1 (currently only valid for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban). In cases where plasma level monitoring is not possible (e.g. assay was not available), discontinuation for 10 elimination half-live periods (four days) is required. For FXa inhibitors, a standard heparin-calibrated anti-Xa level of < 0.1 IU.ml?1 should be measured, indicating sufficient reduction in the anticoagulant effect. Finally, short-term bridging with heparin is not required in the pre-operative period.

AB  - The Ehlers?Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Over the past two decades, the Villefranche Nosology, which delineated six subtypes, has been widely used as the standard for clinical diagnosis of EDS. For most of these subtypes, mutations had been identified in collagen-encoding genes, or in genes encoding collagen-modifying enzymes. Since its publication in 1998, a whole spectrum of novel EDS subtypes has been described, and mutations have been identified in an array of novel genes. The International EDS Consortium proposes a revised EDS classification, which recognizes 13 subtypes. For each of the subtypes, we propose a set of clinical criteria that are suggestive for the diagnosis. However, in view of the vast genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability of the EDS subtypes, and the clinical overlap between EDS subtypes, but also with other HCTDs, the definite diagnosis of all EDS subtypes, except for the hypermobile type, relies on molecular confirmation with identification of (a) causative genetic variant(s). We also revised the clinical criteria for hypermobile EDS in order to allow for a better distinction from other joint hypermobility disorders. To satisfy research needs, we also propose a pathogenetic scheme, that regroups EDS subtypes for which the causative proteins function within the same pathway. We hope that the revised International EDS Classification will serve as a new standard for the diagnosis of EDS and will provide a framework for future research purposes. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective To compare hysterectomy by transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) versus total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) as a day-care procedure. Design Parallel group, 1:1 randomised single-centre single-blinded trial, designed as a non-inferiority study with a margin of 15%. Setting Belgian teaching hospital. Population Women aged 18?70 years scheduled to undergo hysterectomy for benign indications. Methods Randomisation to TLH (control group) or vNOTES (experimental group). Stratification according to uterine volume. Blinding of participants and outcome assessors. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was hysterectomy by the allocated technique. We measured the proportion of women leaving within 12 hours after hysterectomy and the length of hospital stay as secondary outcomes. Results We randomly assigned 70 women to vNOTES (n = 35) or TLH (n = 35). The primary endpoint was always reached in both groups: there were no conversions. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome, assuming one conversion in the vNOTES group and no conversions in the TLH group: the one-sided 95% upper limit for the differences in proportions of conversion was estimated as 7.5%, which is below the predefined non-inferiority margin. More women left the hospital within 12 hours after surgery after vNOTES: 77 versus 43%, difference 34% (95% CI 13?56%), P = 0.007. The hospital stay was shorter after vNOTES: 0.8 versus 1.3 days, mean difference ?0.5 days, (95% CI ?0.98 to ?0.02), P = 0.004. Conclusions vNOTES is non-inferior to TLH for successfully performing hysterectomy without conversion. Compared with TLH, vNOTES may allow more women to be treated in a day-care setting. Tweetable abstract RCT: vNOTES is just as good as laparoscopy for successful hysterectomy without conversion but allows more day-care surgery.
