AB  - Background.?Laser resurfacing with high-energy, short-pulsed lasers is generally a safe and cosmetically rewarding procedure. Nevertheless, the aggressive use of these instruments has the potential for unpredictable, undesirable complications. It has long been held that multiple passes are needed to achieve dermal tightening (collagen shrinkage), which will result in a cosmetically desirable appearance. The observation of skin tightening after one general pass has not been previously reported. Objective.?To look at the long-term results after only one general pass and of focal multiple passes over lines, with particular attention to the degree of tightening and quality of the skin. Methods.?Fifteen patients with varying degrees of photodamage and resulting skin laxity, and with at least eighteen months follow-up, were evaluated. High quality photographic records were compared between pre- and postoperative pictures at three different angles on each. Results.?Cosmetically significant dermal tightening was observed in all of these patients. This was noted in some patients after six months and continued for several months after. All patients were pleased with the cosmetic improvement obtained. Of note were fast healing and the absence of significant complications in these patients. Conclusions:?The appearance of dermal tightening as a late occurrence in the postoperative course after one single general pass has not been previously reported. When numerous general passes are done, dermal tightening is quite impressive and appears much sooner; however, much of this result is due to edema and the resulting skin quality in these patients is different. A more natural look is achieved if only one pass is done. The procedure is safer and has a faster recovery period.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are approximately 100 million working equids in developing countries worldwide. These animals? role in impoverished communities is generally unrecognised by national and international policy makers and their needs are overlooked in national animal health systems. Additionally, despite increased international development attention on women and livestock, the specific contributions of equids to poor womens? lives are also unquantified and overlooked. Objectives This study aimed to document the relationship between working equids and women in equine owning communities in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and Pakistan. Study design Qualitative semi-structured focus group discussions elicited opinions from small groups of women (up to 12/group) in selected rural and peri-urban areas in each country. Methods An experienced local language-speaking community facilitator guided each discussion using a standardised questionnaire based on UK Department for International Development sustainable livelihoods framework asset categories. Women's experiences of working equids? roles in their lives were audio-recorded, transcribed in local language and key themes summarised in English. Results Twenty-two discussions (7 in India, 5 each in Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan) comprising 259 women took place between February and October 2013. When asked to rank their livestock, all 12 groups in India and Kenya and 17 out of 22 groups overall ranked equids most important, due to their income generation and contribution to household chores, including transporting feedstuffs and water for other livestock species. Whilst specific responsibilities varied between communities, women reported undertaking many equine husbandry activities but lacked access to equine-specific knowledge and skills training. Conclusions The study findings can inform development of targeted training interventions for female working equid owners and users. Further work is required to quantify the contribution to livelihoods of working equids in developing countries to underpin engagement with government stakeholders on the benefit of providing for their needs in animal health and welfare systems.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Real-time tissue elastography (RTE) can provide objective information associated with mechanical properties of tendon tissue and add value to the structural information obtained by greyscale ultrasound. Serial RTE assessment would be useful for monitoring and optimising safe rehabilitation for horses with tendon injury. Objectives To test the hypothesis that RTE could measure change in tissue stiffness in the healing process of injured superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) of horses. Study design Prospective field study. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses with SDFT injury and standardised rehabilitation were used. Both greyscale and RTE images were recorded approximately every 4 weeks up to 40 weeks from occurrence. Greyscale ratio (GR: dividing the grey-value of injured area by it of surrounding noninjured area) and strain ratio (SR: dividing the strain value of stand-off gel pad, which can be a standard, by it of injured area) was calculated at each examination. Tissue strain is displayed by colour which suggests hard (blue), intermediate (yellow), soft (red) on RTE image. Strain of injured area was evaluated by colour-scale grade (CSG) of 1 to 3 (1; blue to green, 2; yellow and 3; red) by 3 veterinarians who didn't know the case history. Results GR was returned to nearly 1 quickly within 8 weeks and it was unchanged thereafter. This continuous change of GR was best-fitted to logarithmic trendline (r2?=?0.66). SR increased gradually up to the last examination and was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.89). CSG was decreased gradually and it was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.84). Both change of SR and CSG suggested that an injured tissue would gradually increase in stiffness. Conclusions RTE could provide useful information regarding monitoring and optimising restoration of the tissue stiffness of tendon, even if GR was unchanged by progress of scar formation, for safer and more effective rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract Emerging evidence highlights the role of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) KCNQ1OT1 in fracture healing. Osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival are pivotal during this process. In this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the regulatory role of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 during osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival. We searched the gene expression omnibus databases and LncBase Experimental V.2 to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) targets of KCNQ1OT1. MiR-701-3p was selected as a differentially expressed miRNA and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify its interaction with KCNQ1OT1. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) was also identified as a target of miR-701-3p. We further identified KCNQ1OT1 as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-701-3p that could influence osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that the KCNQ1OT1/miR-701-3p/FGFR3 axis is an important regulator of osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, and provide a new therapeutic avenue for fracture healing.

AB  - Abstract We report a case of a 76-year-old man presenting with a 12-month history of a solitary lesion on his scalp. The histopathology was consistent with a grade 2/3 osteosarcoma extending to the subcutis. Full-body imaging excluded any involvement of the underlying bony tissue or solid organ malignancy, thus a diagnosis of primary cutaneous osteosarcoma (PCO) was made. Given the exceedingly rare nature of PCO, we discuss the clinico-pathological features of this case and those previously reported in the literature.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There have been no detailed descriptions of the radiological appearance of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament in horses with and without distal hock joint pain. Objectives 1) To describe the normal radiological appearance of the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament; 2) to determine the frequency of occurrence of mineralisation or ossification of the interosseous ligament and to describe radiological abnormalities surrounding the interosseous space; 3) to describe concurrent radiological abnormalities in the tarsus. It was hypothesised that ossification of the interosseous ligament will be associated with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint. Study design Systematic radiological analysis using a predefined grading system, after a repeatability study, and descriptive statistics. Methods Case records and radiographs of all horses which underwent radiographic examination of one or both tarsi over 7 years were reviewed. Results There were 700 horses, including 470 examined bilaterally. The normal interosseous space was an oval-shaped radiolucent area surrounded by subchondral bone of uniform opacity and thickness. Changes in the region of the interosseous ligament of the centrodistal joint were evident in 190/1170 (16.2%) tarsi, including 50 horses examined bilaterally. In 33/190 (17.4%) tarsi there was complete loss of the oval-shaped radiolucent area, together with increased thickness of the adjacent subchondral bone, endosteal irregularity and increased opacity of the adjacent trabecular bone. In addition 157/190 tarsi had patchy increased opacity within the interosseous space and alterations of the adjacent subchondral and trabecular bone. There was radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint in 27/33 (81.8%) of tarsi with complete ossification of the centrodistal interosseous ligament, 17 of which (51.5%) had distal tarsal pain, and in 29/157 (18.5%) tarsi with other abnormalities of the centrodistal interosseous ligament. Conclusions When evaluating the tarsus radiologically the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament should be assessed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are no reports of proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) and concurrent injuries of the proximal aspect of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (ALDDFT). Objectives To describe clinical features, response to local analgesia and ultrasonographic features. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Review of case records, January 2009?2014. Results There were 8 horses with forelimb lameness, 4 unilateral and 4 bilateral (2 with bilateral injuries of the suspensory ligament [SL] and ALDDFT and 2 with PSD and injury of the ALDDFT in one limb and injury of the ALDDFT alone in the other). One horse had pain on palpation of the proximal aspect of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by palmar metacarpal (subcarpal) nerve blocks in 10/12 limbs; in 2 limbs an ulnar nerve block was required to abolish lameness. There were 5 horses with bilateral hindlimb lameness; concurrent desmopathy of the ALDDFT and PSD was identified in one horse. In the other 4 horses there was a history of bilateral PSD which had undergone treatment. Recurrent lameness was associated with unilateral (n?=?3) or bilateral (n?=?1) PSD and desmopathy of the ALDDFT. In 2 horses there was soft tissue swelling in the proximomedial aspect of the metatarsus in the region of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by local infiltration of mepivacaine in the proximoplantar aspect of the metatarsus in 3 limbs; in one limb a tibial nerve block was required to eliminate lameness. In all horses lesions were characterised ultrasonographically by enlargement of both the ALDDFT and the proximal aspect of the SL and a diffuse decrease in echogenicity. There was echogenic material between the SL and ALDDFT in 5 limbs. Conclusions All soft tissue structures in the proximal aspect of the metacarpus/metatarsus should be evaluated ultrasonographically if pain is localised to this area.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Advanced imaging modalities enable assessment of the equine skull and brain. Horses are susceptible to neurological dysfunction of the cranial nerves; however, our understanding of these structures? imaging anatomy is limited. Hypothesis Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be superior to computed tomography (CT) for the identification of cranial nerves, but optimal assessment may depend on both modalities. Objectives Identify cranial nerves and compare and contrast the utility of MRI and CT images of cadaver and clinical material. Interpret images from both modalities and determine the cranial nerve imaging anatomy. Study design Prospective cadaver anatomical study combined with retrospective clinical case study. Methods The head of a neurologically normal 9-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was scanned immediately following euthanasia (performed for reasons unrelated to this study). High resolution MRI (1.5 Tesla) and CT examinations were conducted over a 12?h interval following euthanasia. Images obtained were compared with selected clinical cases which were scanned during anaesthesia (MRI; approximately 30?60?min) or standing sedation (CT; approximately 30?s). Results On a high resolution MRI scan of a cadaver equine skull, each of the 12 cranial nerves and their topographic location was readily appreciated. Cranial nerves 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more easily identified in clinically relevant MRI scans. CT allowed visualisation of the stylomastoid foramen, the inner and middle ear and cranial nerves 2, 3, 5 and 7. Conclusions High field MRI allows for excellent visualisation of equine cranial nerves. CT allows for detailed visualisation of the osseous canals and foramina. This study advances anatomical knowledge of the normal equine cranial nerves to aid interpretation in horses that display neurological dysfunction localising to the brain and brainstem.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Despite ongoing advances in diagnostic imaging, ?wind-testing? remains the most common screening test for upper respiratory tract obstructions and is an important condition of sale at Thoroughbred public auctions in UK/Europe. Correlations between abnormal respiratory noise and resting laryngeal function have been incompletely investigated to date. Objectives To determine whether associations exist between respiratory noise at lunge and subsequent diagnosis of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Study design Retrospective analysis of records for all post sale wind-testing undertaken by a single veterinary practice at Tattersalls Newmarket yearling, breeze-up and horse-in-training sales between 2009 and 2013. Methods Descriptions of abnormal respiratory noise were categorised as ?inspiratory whistle?, ?inspiratory harsh? or ?pan-respiratory harsh?, and included lunge direction during which noise was evident. Concurrent examination by 2 veterinary surgeons was a criterion for inclusion of cases. All horses making abnormal respiratory noises underwent resting endoscopy with a consensus score (Lane scale) given for laryngeal function. Results 2972 horses underwent post sale wind-testing and 418 horses (14.1%) underwent resting endoscopic examination due to abnormal respiratory noise. Likelihood of making an abnormal respiratory noise differed significantly between groups (yearlings 10.8%, ?breeze-up? 2-year-olds 20.6%, horses-in-training 30.1%). Yearlings were significantly more likely (P<0.0001, Chi-squared/Bonferroni test) to make a ?harsh? respiratory noise than horses-in-training. Type of noise (whistle) was significantly associated with resting endoscopic evidence of RLN in yearlings (P?=?0.009); specificity of ?whistle? for RLN in this group was 38.6%. There was no association between lunge direction noise (left, right or both) and RLN. Conclusions These results support the widespread belief that harsh respiratory noise when lunged of presumed ?palatal/pharyngeal? origin is more likely in yearlings than horses-in-training, possibly due to upper respiratory inflammation or immaturity. Inspiratory whistle in both lunge directions is no stronger an indicator of RLN than unidirectional whistle.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry in the equine hindlimb are poorly defined. Little research has been carried out into the potential interactions between these variables despite the commonality of hindlimb lameness in sports and leisure horses. Objectives To determine hind foot placement and describe the relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry. Study design Observational study. Methods Overall foot placement of 43 horses was determined from simultaneous orthogonal filming at walk and trot, foot conformation was measured from digital photographs and motion symmetry data was collected using horse mounted inertial sensors. Results Left and right hind foot conformation differed significantly (P?=?0.001?0.036). Foot placement was not significantly different between left and right feet, despite these conformational differences. Foot placement was significantly different between walk and trot (P<0.001). Lateral heel landing was the most common landing pattern observed at walk (55.81%) and trot (43.12%). Lateral and lateral toe landings were more common at trot, though relatively uncommon at both gaits. Foot conformation was significantly associated with motion symmetry (P<0.001?0.007) and with placement at trot (P?=?0.002?0.005) but not walk. Conclusions Hind feet land preferentially laterally and heel first at both the walk and trot. Foot conformation appeared to be associated with landing patterns at the trot but not walk. Foot conformation was also associated with motion symmetry, although it is difficult to say whether conformation affects symmetry or vice versa. Multiple factors contribute to equine locomotion, foot conformation, landing patterns and the maintenance of orthopaedic health.

AB  - The MRL mouse is the only known strain of mouse that can regenerate cardiac lesions and completely heal ear punches without scarring. To determine if the MRL also has greater regeneration capabilities in amputated digit tips, right paw digit tips of neonatal mice were dissected, with the left front paws as uncut controls. Controls used for regeneration comparison were the DBA, B6, C3H, and 129 inbred mouse strains. Consecutive X-ray images were captured of the left and right paws at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postamputation. MRL mouse digit tips regenerated greater in comparison to all strains tested (p?<?0.05). We next undertook whole genome microarray analysis to identify the genetic mechanisms that contribute to differences in digit tip regeneration. Over 400 genes out of 15,000 were significantly differentially expressed (p?<?0.05) in MRL and DBA mice at day 4 in comparison to day 0 control tissue. Of these, 170 genes were upregulated and 280 were downregulated in both mouse strains. Pathway analysis reveals that genes in the BMP/TGF pathway are differentially expressed in both mouse strains (p?<?0.05). Multiple differences between MRL and DBA strains were found in transcription factors that are implicated in gastrulation, including FMN2 and SHRM. Additional differentially expressed genes include NET1 in the WNT signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry indicates that these proteins are highly expressed in the nuclei of chondrocytes in regenerating digits. We conclude that MRL mice show greater regenerative capacity to heal digit tips and that the increased regenerative capacity of MRL mice may be due to strain specific increased expression of genes involved in the WNT pathway and genes involved in embryonic pattern formation.

AB  - Objectives? In this study the frequency of inherited thrombophilic risk factors in a population of German CVT patients and their influence on clinical outcome were evaluated. Material and methods? Twenty-five patients (age 37.1±16.3 years) with CVT were screened for inherited coagulation disorders. All participants received a full clinical follow-up (mean follow-up period 4.8±6.4 years). Results? Inherited thrombophilic risk factors were identified in 9 (36%) of the 25 patients studied. Four were found positive for the heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, 2 were heterozygous carriers of the prothrombin-G20210A-polymorphism. APC resistance proved to be a reliable screening method for factor V Leiden mutation, whereas genetic evaluation for protein S and C deficiencies failed to demonstrate any mutations despite the identification of 1 patient with a protein C and protein S deficiency each. One patient suffered from a familial plasminogen deficiency. These 9 patients had a less favorable outcome (P<0.05). Conclusion? Our results demonstrate that screening for inherited thrombophilia should be an integral part in the diagnostic work up of CVT patients. Patients with inherited coagulopathies tended to have a less favorable outcome, corroborating recommendations for a longer period of oralanticoagulation.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.
