AB  - Summary Purpose Survey data indicate that continuous electroencephalography (EEG) (CEEG) monitoring is used with increasing frequency to identify electrographic seizures in critically ill children, but studies of current CEEG practice have not been conducted. We aimed to describe the clinical utilization of CEEG in critically ill children at tertiary care hospitals with a particular focus on variables essential for designing feasible prospective multicenter studies evaluating the impact of electrographic seizures on outcome. Methods Eleven North American centers retrospectively enrolled 550 consecutive critically ill children who underwent CEEG. We collected data regarding subject characteristics, CEEG indications, and CEEG findings. Key Findings CEEG indications were encephalopathy with possible seizures in 67% of subjects, event characterization in 38% of subjects, and management of refractory status epilepticus in 11% of subjects. CEEG was initiated outside routine work hours in 47% of subjects. CEEG duration was <12 h in 16%, 12?24 h in 34%, and >24 h in 48%. Substantial variability existed among sites in CEEG indications and neurologic diagnoses, yet within each acute neurologic diagnosis category a similar proportion of subjects at each site had electrographic seizures. Electrographic seizure characteristics including distribution and duration varied across sites and neurologic diagnoses. Significance These data provide a systematic assessment of recent CEEG use in critically ill children and indicate variability in practice. The results suggest that multicenter studies are feasible if CEEG monitoring pathways can be standardized. However, the data also indicate that electrographic seizure variability must be considered when designing studies that address the impact of electrographic seizures on outcome.

AB  - Shortcomings of approaches to classifying psychopathology based on expert consensus have given rise to contemporary efforts to classify psychopathology quantitatively. In this paper, we review progress in achieving a quantitative and empirical classification of psychopathology. A substantial empirical literature indicates that psychopathology is generally more dimensional than categorical. When the discreteness versus continuity of psychopathology is treated as a research question, as opposed to being decided as a matter of tradition, the evidence clearly supports the hypothesis of continuity. In addition, a related body of literature shows how psychopathology dimensions can be arranged in a hierarchy, ranging from very broad ?spectrum level? dimensions, to specific and narrow clusters of symptoms. In this way, a quantitative approach solves the ?problem of comorbidity? by explicitly modeling patterns of co-occurrence among signs and symptoms within a detailed and variegated hierarchy of dimensional concepts with direct clinical utility. Indeed, extensive evidence pertaining to the dimensional and hierarchical structure of psychopathology has led to the formation of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) Consortium. This is a group of 70 investigators working together to study empirical classification of psychopathology. In this paper, we describe the aims and current foci of the HiTOP Consortium. These aims pertain to continued research on the empirical organization of psychopathology; the connection between personality and psychopathology; the utility of empirically based psychopathology constructs in both research and the clinic; and the development of novel and comprehensive models and corresponding assessment instruments for psychopathology constructs derived from an empirical approach.

AB  - This paper reviews the clinical features of lymphatic malformations and the molecular basis of embryonic lymphangiogenesis. Lymphatic malformations are classified as microcystic, macrocystic, or combined. Most commonly found in the axilla/chest and cervicofacial region, they can be localised or diffuse. The commonest complications are intralesional bleeding and infection. Other significant complications are due mainly to their mass effect on nearby anatomic structures including the airway and eyeball, and soft tissue and skeletal overgrowth including macrocheilia, macroglossia, macrotia, macromala and mandibular prognathism, resulting in functional problems in feeding, speech, occlusion, oral hygiene, and disfigurement. The characteristic radiological finding of a LM on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI is a low-density lesion with septation or rim enhancement. Histologically, LMs are cystic lesions that contain eosinophilic proteinaceous fluid whose walls are composed of smooth and skeletal muscle fibres, collagen and lymphocytes. Management options range from observation, comfort cares, empirical antibiotic treatment for LM cellulitis to sclerotherapy, surgical excision and Nd:YAG laser for selected cases. Lymphangiogenesis is believed to occur in four sequential but overlapping stages: lymphatic endothelial cell competence, bias and specification, and finally lymphatic vessel terminal differentiation and maturation. Multiple genes are involved in this process including Lyve1, Nrp2, podoplanin, Prox1, VEGFR3, VEGFC and Ang2. Developmental defects during embryonic lymphangiogenesis result in lymphatic malformations.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a comprehensive summary of the basic criteria that are critical to the histologic diagnosis of melanoma. It focuses on the clinical features of the prototypic subgroups of melanoma such as lentiginous melanoma. After a consideration of the clinical features, the histology of the radial growth phase as it relates to specific subtypes of melanoma is addressed followed by a discussion on the recognition of the vertical growth phase. Five-year survival rates according to measured Breslow thickness are given in the chapter for patients with stage I lesions, where the tumor is confined to the primary site of the melanoma without regional lymph node involvement or distant metastatic disease. Unusual forms of melanoma are discussed at the end of the chapter.

AB  - This report is the outcome of an EFSA procurement (NP/EFSA/GMO/2016/01) reviewing relevant scientific information on ncRNA and on RNA interference(RNAi) that could support the food and feed risk assessment of ncRNA-based genetically modified (GM) plants. Information was retrieved through key words and key questions covering the stability and degradation of ncRNAs after oral ingestion, the passage of ncRNAs from food and feed to human and animal organs and tissues via the gastrointestinal tract and other barriers, as well as the potential effects on the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system or the entire organism.Full description of the strategy used for the literature search and for studies selectionis provided and the number of retrieved publications is reported. This report is divided into four partsdiscussing the kinetics of exogenous ncRNAs in humans and animals, with focus on ingested ncRNAs (Part 1); the possible effects of ncRNAs on the gastrointestinal tract (Part 2), systemically(Part 3)and on the immune system (Part 4). This report suggests that some plant ncRNAs (e.g miRNAs and siRNAs) show higher stability as compared to other ncRNAs due to peculiar chemical characteristics (2?-O-methylation at 3? end).However, ingested or administered ncRNA must overcome many extracellular and cellular barriers to reach the intended target tissue or functional location in sufficient amount to exert any biological effect. Literature data indicate that chemically unmodified and unformulated ncRNAs exhibit very low stability in the gastrointestinal tract and in biological fluids and, in general, do not elicit major biological effects.This report also provides an overview of the RNA content in plant-derived foods and diets and discusses the controversies on the presence of dietary exogenous RNAs in the biological fluids of humans and animals and their effects. Finally, gaps in the scientific literature are highlighted and recommendations provided

AB  - Reliable, clinically useful, and globally applicable diagnostic classification of mental disorders is an essential foundation for global mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) is nearing completion of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The present study assessed inter-diagnostician reliability of mental disorders accounting for the greatest proportion of global disease burden and the highest levels of service utilization ? schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically associated with stress ? among adult patients presenting for treatment at 28 participating centers in 13 countries. A concurrent joint-rater design was used, focusing specifically on whether two clinicians, relying on the same clinical information, agreed on the diagnosis when separately applying the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. A total of 1,806 patients were assessed by 339 clinicians in the local language. Intraclass kappa coefficients for diagnoses weighted by site and study prevalence ranged from 0.45 (dysthymic disorder) to 0.88 (social anxiety disorder) and would be considered moderate to almost perfect for all diagnoses. Overall, the reliability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines was superior to that previously reported for equivalent ICD-10 guidelines. These data provide support for the suitability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for implementation at a global level. The findings will inform further revision of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines prior to their publication and the development of programs to support professional training and implementation of the ICD-11 by WHO member states.

AB  - Abstract Purpose We examined how heterogeneity in the patterns of adolescent experiences of different types and severity of peer victimization is associated with concurrent and longitudinal mental health, substance use, and physical health. Method Data come from a randomly recruited community-based sample of youth (T1 ages 12?18; N = 662; 52% female) followed biennially across 10 years (T6 ages 22?29; n = 478; 55% female). Results Using latent class analysis, we identified four classes of adolescent peer victimization: Low victimization (63%), Physical victimization only (15%), Relational victimization only (17%), and Poly-victimization (6%). Youth in the Poly-victimization class reported the most detrimental health consequences in adolescence (e.g., internalizing and externalizing symptoms, illicit drug use, physical symptoms, poor physical self-concept, physical activity) and in young adulthood (e.g., depressive symptoms, sleep problems). Youth in the Relational and Physical victimization classes also reported health problems, some of which persisted into young adulthood. Youth in the Low victimization class reported the fewest health concerns. Conclusions Findings add to our understanding of how different types of adolescent victimization are related to mental health, substance use, and physical health problems both within adolescence and long-term.

AB  - Combined expander/implants are designed to allow single stage breast reconstruction. This study was designed to assess whether single stage reconstruction is achieved using these devices. A retrospective study was performed of 88 consecutive patients undergoing breast reconstruction with implants at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital over a six year period. A small subset of patients had reconstruction with combined expander/implants. These cases were reviewed to determine the overall explantation rate. A total of nine patients (13 implants) had reconstruction with combined expander/implants (Mentor Becker or Mcghan 150). 10 out of 13 implants were removed at subsequent operations. 2 (15%) were explanted due to infection. 8(62%) were removed for aesthetic reasons including asymmetry, poor shape or poor projection. All were replaced with permanent textured gel implants. The results of this study suggest that in the majority of cases single stage reconstruction is not achieved using these devices. This is in contrast to the results from two recently published studies using these devices. (1,2)
