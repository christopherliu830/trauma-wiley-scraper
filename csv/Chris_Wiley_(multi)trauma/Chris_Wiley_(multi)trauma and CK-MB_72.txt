AB  - Summary Objective Fracture risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance is increased, despite relatively preserved bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and composite indices of femoral neck strength in Koreans. Design A population-based, cross-sectional study from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Participants About 1243 men and 1433 women Measurements Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Femoral neck width and axis length were measured from hip dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and combined with BMD, weight and height to calculate composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load: compression (CSI), bending (BSI) and impact strength indices (ISI). Results HOMA-IR showed an inverse relationship with CSI, BSI and ISI in both genders before and after adjusting for confounders (P < 0·001?0·029). CSI was more strongly associated with HOMA-IR than BSI and/or ISI in both genders (P < 0·001?0·013). When men were stratified according to HOMA-IR quartiles, all strength indices decreased as the quartile increased, after adjusting for all potential confounders (P for trend <0·001?0·001), whereas CSI and ISI did in women (P for trend = 0·012 and 0·002, respectively). Fasting insulin levels, but not glucose levels, were negatively associated with all strength indices regardless of confounders (P < 0·001?0·044). Conclusions Insulin resistance is associated with low femoral neck strength, particularly against the compressive load. These findings suggest a better approach to evaluate bone health in insulin-resistant individuals.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? The overall aim of this systematic review was to identify the best available evidence on the relationship between the knowledge, competencies and behaviours of nurses exhibiting professional practice in their workplace; and the development of a healthy work environment. Search strategy? The search strategy sought to find both published and unpublished studies written in the English language. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases was undertaken to identify optimal search terms. A second extensive search using all identified key words and index terms was then undertaken. Methodological quality? Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality of retrieved papers using the corresponding checklist from the System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information (SUMARI) package. Results? Of the 4238 papers found in the search: 219 were selected for full paper retrieval; 19 of these papers were unable to be located; 200 full papers were assessed for methodological quality; 181 studies were excluded; and 19 were included in the review. Of these 19, four quantitative studies evaluated a professional nursing practice model and its impact on a variety of outcomes; five descriptive studies examined elements of nurses? professional practice and the impact these elements had on specified outcomes; and 10 qualitative papers examined varying behaviours, competencies and knowledge levels of nurses. Various methods were used, such as focus groups and open-ended interviews. Overall, the evidence suggests that professional practice has a positive impact on the work environment in terms of nurses? role satisfaction and patient outcomes. The evidence is, however, equivocal in many areas and the impact of the professional practice of the nurse requires further investigation. Conclusion? The results of the review suggest a number of recommendations for practice and research on creating a healthy work environment.

AB  - Background: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alters both specific and nonspecific immune functions, resulting in immunosuppression. Short-chain fatty acids have been shown to improve the adaptive responses of the gut after surgery. The following study investigates the effects of adding short-chain fatty acids to TPN on the immune system after an 80% small bowel resection. Methods: Rats (237 ± 3 g) were infused with either TPN (n = 25) or TPN supplemented with short-chain fatty acids (n = 26) for 3 or 7 days. Hematologic analysis was performed on peripheral blood and splenocytes were isolated to characterize cell phenotypes, natural killer cell cytotoxicity and to estimate proliferative response. Results: The relative percent of T (CD3+) cells increased (p <.05) and the relative percent of macrophages decreased (p <.001, n = 13) in the spleens of the 3-day TPN-fed rats. By day 7, these differences disappeared. The natural killer cells from rats that were supplemented with short-chain fatty acids had higher (p <.0001) cytotoxic activity than the TPN groups at day 3. Mitogenic response did not differ between groups but were depressed compared with sham-treated rats. By day 7, rats on standard TPN had larger (p <.0001) spleens than all other groups. This group also had a higher total white blood cell count because of increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils (p <.02). Conclusion: Short-chain fatty acids improve components of nonspecific immune responses and may be beneficial in reducing certain aspects of TPNassociated immunosuppression after major surgery.

AB  - Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, neuroinflammatory, and -degenerative disease that affects the brain's neurophysiological functioning through brain atrophy, a reduced conduction velocity and decreased connectivity. Currently, little is known on how MS affects the fast temporal dynamics of activation and deactivation of the different large-scale, ongoing brain networks. In this study, we investigated whether these temporal dynamics are affected in MS patients and whether these changes are induced by the pathology or by the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs), an important symptomatic treatment that aims at reducing insomnia, spasticity and anxiety and reinforces the inhibitory effect of GABA. To this aim, we employed a novel method capable of detecting these fast dynamics in 90 MS patients and 46 healthy controls. We demonstrated a less dynamic frontal default mode network in male MS patients and a reduced activation of the same network in female MS patients, regardless of BZD usage. Additionally, BZDs strongly altered the brain's dynamics by increasing the time spent in the deactivating sensorimotor network and the activating occipital network. Furthermore, BZDs induced a decreased power in the theta band and an increased power in the beta band. The latter was strongly expressed in those states without activation of the sensorimotor network. In summary, we demonstrate gender-dependent changes to the brain dynamics in the frontal DMN and strong effects from BZDs. This study is the first to characterise the effect of multiple sclerosis and BZDs in vivo in a spatially, temporally and spectrally defined way.

AB  - Esophageal cancer has a poor prognosis, with little improvement in outcomes in recent years. Surgery maintains its pivotal role in cure, but this involves two or three compartment dissection with associated high risks. Chiefly, pulmonary complications following surgery are most common, and can be life-threatening. As a consequence, minimally invasive and robotic esophagectomy have been performed with improving efficacy and equivalent oncological outcomes. This is a review of the pertinent literature regarding these techniques. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:731?735. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Shortcomings of approaches to classifying psychopathology based on expert consensus have given rise to contemporary efforts to classify psychopathology quantitatively. In this paper, we review progress in achieving a quantitative and empirical classification of psychopathology. A substantial empirical literature indicates that psychopathology is generally more dimensional than categorical. When the discreteness versus continuity of psychopathology is treated as a research question, as opposed to being decided as a matter of tradition, the evidence clearly supports the hypothesis of continuity. In addition, a related body of literature shows how psychopathology dimensions can be arranged in a hierarchy, ranging from very broad ?spectrum level? dimensions, to specific and narrow clusters of symptoms. In this way, a quantitative approach solves the ?problem of comorbidity? by explicitly modeling patterns of co-occurrence among signs and symptoms within a detailed and variegated hierarchy of dimensional concepts with direct clinical utility. Indeed, extensive evidence pertaining to the dimensional and hierarchical structure of psychopathology has led to the formation of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) Consortium. This is a group of 70 investigators working together to study empirical classification of psychopathology. In this paper, we describe the aims and current foci of the HiTOP Consortium. These aims pertain to continued research on the empirical organization of psychopathology; the connection between personality and psychopathology; the utility of empirically based psychopathology constructs in both research and the clinic; and the development of novel and comprehensive models and corresponding assessment instruments for psychopathology constructs derived from an empirical approach.

AB  - This paper reviews the clinical features of lymphatic malformations and the molecular basis of embryonic lymphangiogenesis. Lymphatic malformations are classified as microcystic, macrocystic, or combined. Most commonly found in the axilla/chest and cervicofacial region, they can be localised or diffuse. The commonest complications are intralesional bleeding and infection. Other significant complications are due mainly to their mass effect on nearby anatomic structures including the airway and eyeball, and soft tissue and skeletal overgrowth including macrocheilia, macroglossia, macrotia, macromala and mandibular prognathism, resulting in functional problems in feeding, speech, occlusion, oral hygiene, and disfigurement. The characteristic radiological finding of a LM on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI is a low-density lesion with septation or rim enhancement. Histologically, LMs are cystic lesions that contain eosinophilic proteinaceous fluid whose walls are composed of smooth and skeletal muscle fibres, collagen and lymphocytes. Management options range from observation, comfort cares, empirical antibiotic treatment for LM cellulitis to sclerotherapy, surgical excision and Nd:YAG laser for selected cases. Lymphangiogenesis is believed to occur in four sequential but overlapping stages: lymphatic endothelial cell competence, bias and specification, and finally lymphatic vessel terminal differentiation and maturation. Multiple genes are involved in this process including Lyve1, Nrp2, podoplanin, Prox1, VEGFR3, VEGFC and Ang2. Developmental defects during embryonic lymphangiogenesis result in lymphatic malformations.
