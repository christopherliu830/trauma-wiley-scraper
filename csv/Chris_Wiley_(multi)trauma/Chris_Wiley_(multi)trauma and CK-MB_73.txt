AB  - Introduction? Upper blepharoplasty is performed in order to correct age-related upper lid changes including dermatochalasis and irregular contours due to bulging post-septal fat pads. Additionally, upper lid ptosis can be repaired in an anterior approach through the blepharoplasty incisions when indicated. These procedures are gratifying and have relatively low associated morbidity. Methods/Techniques? Pre-operative assessment includes observation of excess upper eyelid skin, bulging fat pads, lid position, and location of the suprataral crease. Most excess skin is located centrally and laterally. The most common bulging fat pad is the nasal fat pad, however the central fat pad also frequently requires excision. If a combination of procedures is being preformed, upper blepharoplsty follows browlifts and facelifts but precedes lower lid blepharoplasty. Surgical markings are made with the patient prone, under general anesthesia. Local anesthesia is also administered for hemostasis. The lower location of the incision is marked 8?10?mm above the lid margin centrally and 6?mm above the lateral canthus. The upper incision is identified by assessing the amount of excess skin by pinch testing. The upper incision is marked and calipers are used to confirm at least 10?mm of skin will still be present between the upper incision and the lower border of the eyebrow at the mid pupil location. A scalpel is used to make the incisions. A Bovie is used to cut through the orbicularis oculi muscle on cutting current. Westcott scissors are used to excise the skin and muscle. Hemostasis is acheived Gentle pressure is applied to the globe to reveal the excess nasal fat pad. The septum is opened focally and the excess portion of the fat pad is excised using coagulation current with the bovie. The central fat pad is reduced if needed. If ptosis exists, it is repaired using a tarso-levator advancement technique. Often in cases of senile acquired ptosis, a high supratarsal fold exists. While the ptosis repair will partially resolve this cosmetic deformity, the septum is opened and the central fat pad is freed and advanced to further fill the sulcus. A supratarsal fixation stitch using 6-O vicryl is placed in a mid pupil location to prevent postoperative ptosis. The wound is then closed with 6-O nylon using interrupted sutures lateral to the lateral canthus and running sutures medial to the canthus. Results? 527 patients underwent upper blepharoplasty with the technique described over a 12 year period. 10% underwent ptosis repair at the same time and all other patients underwent supratarsal fixation. 90% were satisfied satisfied with there procedure. Acute re-operation for bleeding occurred in less than 1% of patients. The most common acute complication was chemosis occurring in 12% of patients which was far more likely to occur if a upper blepharoplasty was performed in conjunction with lower lid blepharoplasty. All cases of chemosis resolved with non-surgical management including liberal use of ointment and taping the lid shut, and occasionally incision and drainage of the chemosis. The most common indication for re-operation was residual excess skin. Conclusion? Upper lid blepharoplasty is a very gratifying procedure whether preformed alone or in conjunction other procedures for facial rejuvenation. Complications are infrequent and generally minor. Satisfaction is generally very high. The open sky technique was used which includes removal of the skin, muscle, and septal flap with conservative fat removal.

AB  - Introduction? Augmentation-Mastopexy is a more complex procedure than either breast augmentation or mastopexy performed individually. Since the operation both increases breast size and corrects ptosis in one surgical procedure, the combination has been considered to be associated with increased risk of complications. Complications most commonly include ischemic related complications of the breast flaps or nipple areolar complex and loss of sensibility. While some authors have suggested a staged approach with augmentation followed by mastopexy, I prefer to perform augmentation mastopexy as a single technique which is an attractive alternative to two operations. The principles include initial insertion of the implant in either the subglandular or submuscular position followed by mastopexy which can be periareolar, vertical, or inverted-T scar based on the degree of ptosis and size of the breast. Methods/Technique? Augmentation is performed first so the amount of ptosis can be evaluated after the augmentation in order determine the type of mastopexy performed. The implant is placed through a periareolar incision or a vertical lower pole incision if one anticipates a vertical mastopexy scar. Implant placement is generally subglandular when sufficient soft tissue exits to provide adequate implant coverage. Care should be taken to preserve a dermal pedicle for blood supply to the nipple since subglandular dissection reduces the blood supply to the nipple areolar complex. When the breast soft tissue envelope is thin, submuscular placement is preferred for additional implant coverage. Since submuscular placement provides better coverage, there is generally less palpability and rippling. Furthermore, submuscular dissection preserves better blood supply exits to the NAC. A disadvantage of submuscular placement is increased risk of a high riding implant. The mastopexy should adequately elevate the breast to avoid a double bubble deformity is performed. Results? Over the past 12 years, 98 augmentation mastopexies were performed. The average pre-operative bra size was B-cup and the average degree of ptosis was Grade II. The mean patient age was 55. Smooth round gel implants were used for 90% of the patients. 80% were placed submuscular and 20% were placed subglandular. A Periareolar mastopexy was performed in 25% of patients and an inverted T mastopexy was performed 75% patients. Periareolar augmentation mastopexy was performed commonly for the correction of tubular breast deformity.Generally, most patients were satisfied with their procedure as only 5% underwent revision for aesthetic indications. 2% patients suffered acute complications including hematoma and loss of nipple sensation. 9% suffered subacute and chronic complications including delayed wound healing, loss or partial loss of the NAC, and loss of nipple sensation. 5% patients required revisions surgery to correct the sequelae of delayed wound healing or NAC tissue loss. Conclusions? Augmentation-mastopexy is one of the most complex and technically demanding procedures performed in aesthetic breast surgery. Nonetheless, there is a role for the procedure due to its ability to reduce the number of procedures and provide improved breast shape. The key to success is to be aware of the most common complications and to proceed in a stepwise in order to minimize the risk of complications and maximize patient satisfaction.

AB  - Introduction? Breast reduction is one of the most gratifying procedures preformed by plastic surgeons. While moderate sized breast reduction is often considered an aesthetic surgery procedure by third party payers, all patients ultimately care about the aesthetic outcome. While the medical indications for breast reduction include neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain, and intertrigo, patients, especially those with less pronounced macromastia, are focused on breast-body disproportion, asymmetry, and excessive ptosis. The wise surgeon treats breast reduction as an aesthetic surgery case and focuses not only on the functional issues but on the aesthetic shape contour of the resultant breast. The Wise pattern/central mound technique constantly meets the aesthetic demands of reduction patients. Technique/Methods? The predominant method of breast reduction in my practice is a central mound parenchymal dissection with hand shaping of the breast mound independent of predrawn patterns. This method is preferred because it preserves the ability to breast-feed, can be free-hand optimized on the table, has a robust blood supply, permits the correction of late bottoming-out with simple skin tightening, and can be performed independent of sternal notch to nipple distance. The limitation of this technique is the inability to reduce most breasts smaller than a C or large B. The markings are made with the patient in an upright position. The new NAC position is determined with a bimanual palpation at the IMF. The remainder of the markings are made by an inverted T-shape to elevate the skin and 3?4?cm flaps off the central breast mound. The inferior vertical markings are located by the lateral/medial displacement method. The NAC is incised as a circle with a diameter of 42?mm. The central mound is then sculpted from the surrounding parenchyma. The superior tissue is raised as a flap of progressively increased thickness to preserve superior fullness and is elevated off the pectoralis major muscle to the clavicle. The majority of the parenchymal resection occurs in the infero-lateral region. The central mound parynchema and nipple are shaped like a living breast implant and sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 vicryl. Following the previously planned excision of skin, staples are used to close the wounds. Tailor taking staples are then used to optimize shape and contour with patient is the sitting position. The distance from the inferior areaola to the inframammary incision is generally 6?7?cm. The lateral infra-axillary area is reduced with SAL if indicated. The wounds are then closed in multiple layers. Drains are not used routinely. Results? The Central mound technique was performed in 162 patients over a 12 year period. Other techniques used much less frequently include: superior medial pedicles, vertical reduction, and free nipple grafts. The average age of the patients was 48 years. The average pre-operative bra size was full C or small D cup. The average reduction weight was 500?gm per side. The average time per procedure was 3 hours and the average blood loss was 150?cc with no cases requiring transfusion. The most common acute complication was hematoma which occurred in less than 2% of patients. Subacute complications included: temporary loss of nipple sensation, delayed wound healing, and seroma requiring drainage. The most common long-term complications were: failure to produce adequate reduction, asymmetry, and permanent hypesthesia of the NAC. Total loss of nipple sensation was not observed. 5% of the patients underwent revision surgery most commonly for scar revision or bottoming out. Conclusions? Central mound breast reduction reliably produces gratifying results. It is a flexible technique that can be employed in almost any patient desiring breast reduction. Complications are rare and usually minor. The only true limitation is the inability to produce breast smaller than a full B cup. The advantages include the wide application with no breast too large. The Tailor tacking method allows you to individualize the shape and no preconceived patterns are required. Nipple sensibility is preserved as well as the ability to breast feed since the breast ducts are not divided.

AB  - Introduction? Lower lid blepharoplasty traditionally is considered a more complex procedure than upper lid blepharoplasty. More factors effect the success of the procedure and complications are more frequent. In lower lid blepharoplasty the following anatomic features are observed pre-operatively and are often modified surgically: Lateral canthus position, interpalpebral slant, lower lid position, size and shape of the lateral scleral triangle, lower lid fat pad buldes, lower lid tone, lid-cheek junction, and tear trough deformity. The following findings significantly effect surgical execution but are not modified surgically: presense of dry eyes/tear quality and the presence of relative enophthalmos or exopthalmos. Methods/Techniques? Lower lid blepharoplasty is performed with the patient in a supine position and with conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Corneal protection lenses are placed. Local anesthesia is injected for hemostasis in the lower lid, along the infraorbial rim, and at the lateral orbital rim. A scalpel is used to make an incision from the lateral canthus in a lateral direction one cm long. The angel in changed infero-obliquely to travel in a subcilliary location for one cm. The bovie is used to incise to that lateral orbial rim taking care to preserve the periosteum. Scissors are used to create a plane in the subcilliary location between the muscle and the skin. A subcilliary skin incision is made with the scissors. An incision is then made in the orbicularis oculi muscle inferior to the skin incision in order to preserve at least 4?mm of pre-tarsal muscle. A skin muscle flap is then raised in the pre-septal plane. The orbito-malar ligament released and small portion of the lateral superior cheek is raised in a pre-periosteal plane. Scissors are used to perform a septectomy. If the preoperative inspection demonstrated fat bulges and an absent tear trough, a conservative amount of fat is resected at the level of the orbital rim. If a prominent lid cheek junction is present and if a medial tear trough is present the fat is reposition over the infra-orbital rim. In the case of medial tear trough correction, the medial origin of the levator labii superioris alaque nasae is elevated. Fat pads are repositioned beneath the tear trough and sutured in place to the periosteum of the superior maxilla using 6-O vicryl. Attention is then turned to the lateral canthus. A canthopexy or lateral canthoplasty is performed in almost every lower lid blepharoplasty in order to shape the lower lid margin and the lateral scleral triangle. If the lower lid has minimal laxity defined by less than 6?mm of lid distraction from the globe with forcep retraction, a canthopexy is attempted in order to avoid a lateral canthotomy and the potential associated morbidity. If there is significant lower lid laxity, a lateral canthotomy and lateral canthoplasty is performed. 4-O mersiline suture is used to the suture the lateral canthus to the lateral orbital rim. If lid tightening does not occur sufficiently, the lower lid is too long. In this case a lower cantholysis in performed and the lid is shortened laterally using scissors. 4-O mersiline is used to re-construct the lateral canthus by suturing the lower lid lateral cut margin to the lateral orbital rim in a posterior position. The vertical position and the depth of the canthoplasty or canthopexy suture placement is determined by the preoperative assessment of globe prominence using a Hertel exophthalmeter. Subsequent to management of the lateral canthus, skin-muscle flap is redraped, trimmed and fixed in place at and lateral to the lateral orbital rim. Conservative resection of skin in important for the avoidance of complications. Results? 485 patients underwent lower blepharoplasty with the technique described. The average age of the patient was 52 years. 90% patients were women and 10% were men. 73%% underwent canthopexy and 27% underwent canthoplasty. 185 were secondary lower bleaphroplasties. Satisfaction rates were high. Minor complications included chemosis, lateral canthal webbing, and excess skin requiring revision. Major complications included hematoma, lid malposition or ectropion. 3% required re-operation for lower lid retraction. Conclusions? Lower lid belpharoplasty is an important procedure in order to achieve a balanced natural appearance. Complications, while more common than those in upper lid belpahroplasty, occur at relatively low rates. Satisfaction rates are generally high. The keys to success are proper canthal positioning for lid shape and support bolstered by an orbicularis flap properly placed and firmly fixed to the lateral orbital periosteum in order to correct lower lid laxity.

AB  - Transaxillary endoscopic breast augmentation is a very attractive option for women who desire increased mammary volume and projection but do not want a scar on their breasts. For primary augmentations, the procedure offers advantages over the traditional blunt axillary technique due to direct visualization and precise pectoralis muscle dissection and hemostatis. While the technique has been performed for submuscular and subglandular placement, the procedure has been most commonly used over the past decade with saline implants in the submuscular position. Smooth and textured silicone implants can also be used via transaxillary access into a subpectoral location. The results have been satisfactory with improved placement and a reduction incomplications associated with traditional transaxillary augmentation including hematoma, capsular contracture and implants which are positioned too high. Methods? Transaxillary endoscopic breast augmentation was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in a prone position with arms are abducted to ninty degrees. Local anesthesia with epinephrine was injected into the axillary incision and in the soft tissue overlying the anterior axillary fold for hemostasis. A 2?3?cm incision (4?5?cm when silicone implants are used) was placed in the axilla in one of the natural folds within the hair-baring zone. Dissection was carried out infero-medially until the lateral edge of the pectoralis major was identified. Under direct visualizaion, the pectoralis fascia was divided with scissors and the subpectoral space entered. The subpectoral pocket was initially created bluntly with an Agris Dingman retractor to create a bloodless optical cavity without avulsing any muscle. The endoscope and retractor were inserted and the undersurface of the pectoralis muscle was divided with the Bovie electrocautery. The infero-medial quadrant of pectoralis muscle was partially released from the chest wall. The prepectoral fascia, however was preserved to prevent synmastia, inferior implant migration and palpability. Pocket irrigation and hemostasis were performed. When saline implants were used, the device was rolled, inserted and inflated to the desired volume. When silicone devices were used, the tunnel was bluntly widened with Ashe forceps. A marcaine pain pump can be placed in the pocket for postoperative pain control. Results? Over 12 years 384 primary breast augmentations have been performed using this method by the senior author. Over 90% of the implants were Mentor smooth round saline implants. The average patient age was 30. High or excellent levels of patient and surgeon satisfaction was present in over 95%. Complications requiring re-operation were present in less than 2% of patients. The rate of long-term revision was capsular contracture in 5%. The most common cause of revision was asymmetry or desire to be larger. Conclusions? Transaxillary Endoscopic breast augmentation is an attractive option for the primary breast augmentation patient which avoids placement of a scar directly on the breast. The advantages are for patients with no ptosis or inframammary fold within which to hide the scar or breasts with a small areolar diameter. Additional advantages include controlled and precise surgical dissection and hemostatis which have reduced the complications associated with traditional blunt transaxillary techniques. Potential disadvantages may include the need for a second inframammary scar if reoperative surgery is required, theoretical interference with sentinel lymph node dissection if required in the future, and the additional technical equipment required to perform the procedure.

AB  - The existence of seasonal patterns to patch test reactions has been described, but with conflicting causal interpretations. The potential seasonality of patch tests may be due to irritation, changes to skin barrier or changes to immunological functions caused by meteorological fluctuations. For example, increased skin irritability due to cold winter weather and low humidity may cause an increase in irritative/doubtful and weak positive (false positive) reactions. To investigate the extent of the association between weather and patch test results, consecutive patients (N?=?73691) patch tested with the standard series of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) at German or Austrian IVDK (http://www.ivdk.de) centres were matched with weather data collected at a nearby (30?km radius) weather station. Temperature and absolute humidity (AH) on the day of patch test application and the two preceding days were averaged to represent the environment most likely to have influenced the skin condition at the time of testing. The results of 24 standard series substances were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression. Half of the standard series substances examined, including fragrance mix, nickel sulphate, and formaldehyde, exhibited evidence of a relationship with meteorological conditions. Fragrance mix and p-Phenylene diamine exhibited the strongest evidence of an association to weather, with the odds of the reactions in all three reaction categories (ir/?, +, ++/+++) increasing during winter conditions. Due to the association between weather and patch test reactivity, the potential effect of meteorological conditions should be considered in the interpretation of patch test reactions.

AB  - Summary Ferrets are commonly used as an animal model for influenza virus research, as well as other disease conditions, such as Helicobacter-induced gastropathy. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a distinct idiopathic inflammatory condition of young adult ferrets. Affected animals may present with vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, and a marked eosinophilia may be noted during routine hematologic evaluation. Hematologic changes may include nonregenerative anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnoses for hypergammaglobulinemia and/or abdominal masses include Aleutian disease, lymphosarcoma, chronic infection (e.g., proliferative colitis, helicobacteriosis), idiopathic splenomegaly, multiple myeloma, other neoplasms, and inflammatory bowel disease. Hepatic coccidiosis and toxoplasmosis are seen sporadically in ferrets. Similarly, systemic viral disease caused by infection with canine distemper virus, influenza virus, Aleutian disease (a parvovirus infection), and coronavirus may induce foci of hepatic necrosis and inflammation. Nonspecific lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis may be seen with moderate regularity in surgical biopsies or tissue sections from adult ferrets as an extension of gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Evidence from Europe suggests establishing out-of-hospital, uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (UDCDD) protocols has potential to substantially increase organ availability. The study objective was to derive an out-of-hospital UDCDD protocol that would be acceptable to New York City (NYC) residents. Participatory action research and the SEED-SCALE process for social change guided protocol development in NYC from July 2007 to September 2010. A coalition of government officials, subject experts and communities necessary to achieve support was formed. Authorized NY State and NYC government officials and their legal representatives collaboratively investigated how the program could be implemented under current law and regulations. Community stakeholders (secular and religious organizations) were engaged in town hall style meetings. Ethnographic data (meeting minutes, field notes, quantitative surveys) were collected and posted in a collaborative internet environment. Data were analyzed using an iterative coding scheme to discern themes, theoretical constructs and a summary narrative to guide protocol development. A clinically appropriate, ethically sound UDCDD protocol for out-of-hospital settings has been derived. This program is likely to be accepted by NYC residents since the protocol was derived through partnership with government officials, subject experts and community participants.

AB  - The neuropilins, NP-1 and NP-2, are co-receptors for Sema3A and Sema3F, respectively, both of which are repulsive axonal guidance molecules. NP-1 and NP-2 are also co-receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The neuropilins and their ligands are known to play prominent roles in axonal pathfinding, fasciculation, and blood vessel formation during peripheral nervous system (PNS) development. To screen for additional molecular mechanisms by which Schwann cells and fibroblasts contribute to successful PNS axonal regeneration, we used cDNA microarrays (Clontech) to compare expression profile of multiple messenger RNAs in sciatic nerves distal to transection with their levels in normal sciatic nerves. An evocative result of this screen was a 14-fold increase in NP-2 mRNA in the axotomized nerve segments 4 days post-transection. We verified that NP-2 is induced in transected as well as crushed nerve segments by quantitative PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting, and examined the distribution of NP-2 expressing cells in injured sciatic nerves by in situ hybridization. Then, we sought evidences of induction in the injured nerves of the NP-2 ligands, Sema3F and VEGF, and widened our survey to determine whether expression of the functionally related genes, neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and its class 3 semaphorin ligand, Sema3A are also induced in PNS following injury. We showed by in situ hybridization induction of all those genes at four days post-crushed, distally to the lesion. Our results suggest the possibility that the neuropilins and their semaphorin ligands serve to guide, rather than to impede, regenerating axons in the adult PNS.

AB  - CMT4B1 is an autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy characterized by severe progressive muscular atrophy with childhood onset, decreased conduction velocities, demyelination with myelin outfolding, and subsequently axonal loss. The disease gene has been recently identified as myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2), encoding a protein phosphatase (Bolino et?al., Nature Genetics 25: 17?19; 2000). Although this phosphatase is widely expressed, the disorder is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, just as mutations to the related and broadly expressed phosphatase MTM1 produce only myotubular myopathy. The function of MTMR2 and the pathogenetic mechanism of CMT4B are still unknown. We produced several new polyclonal antibodies to MTMR2 in order to better dissect the expression and potential function of MTMR2 in the peripheral nervous system. Although CMT4B manifests primarily as demyelinating neuropathy, our expression data show that MTMR2 protein is present in both Schwann cells and axons in peripheral nerve. In Schwann cells, MTMR2 is localized in the cytoplasm and, at lower level, in the nucleus, while no major differences were observed between non-myelin forming and myelin-forming Schwann cells. DRG sensory neurons and motor neurons, as well as their axons, show MTMR2 expression in their cytoplasm. Thus, it remains unclear whether demyelination in CMT4B is the consequence of a cell-autonomous or a cell-extrinsic defect, the latter possibly due to a defective interaction between Schwann cells and axons.

AB  - Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. An important dose limiting side-effect of long term thalidomide treatment is peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide induces mainly an axonal sensory neuropathy whose incidence is scarcely known. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using neurological examination and neurophysiological studies. 50 patients with diagnosed Multiple Myeloma were studied. Thalidomide was given at a dosage ranging from 100 to 400?mg/die, orally. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated prior and at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Neurological examination included Neurological Symptom Score and Neurological Disability Score. For NCS, amplitude of sensory and motor action potentials (SNAP and MAP) and conduction velocities of median, peroneal and sural nerves, with F wave recording, were evaluated. All patients were asymptomatic at baseline, with a normal neurological examination and NCS. A decline of the SNAP index of 40 % or more (SNAP amplitude at first examination was considered 100 %) was set as the diagnostic marker of axonal neuropathy. Out of 50 patients, 15 discontinued thalidomide for lack of therapeutic response, 15 remained on therapy for 3 months and 20 completed the treatment at 12 months. Incidence of neuropathy, as judged by clinical and neurophysiological criteria, was high (90%) in the group of patients with a 12 months follow up. On the contrary, the incidence of neuropathy in the group of patients with a 3 months follow up and in those treated with a lower dosage, was low (10?20%). In all the patients, who developed a neuropathy, the subjective symptoms preceded NCS abnormalities. Most common symptoms were paresthesias and reduced sensation with a stock and glove distribution. Our data support the view that thalidomide induces very frequently a dose-dependent axonal neuropathy with only a partial reversibility, and that NCS findings lack of a predictive value.

AB  - The vanilloid receptor VR-1 is a non-selective ligand-gated channel, structurally related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It responds to noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heating in the noxious range, and extracellular acidification. It is able to integrate simultaneous exposure to these stimuli and is involved in different forms of tissue hypersensitivity. VR-1 is predominantly expressed in small-diameter neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which give rise to unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, but its immunoreactivity in human nerve fibers is not known. We assessed the expression of VR-1 in human intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of hairy and glabrous skin and in sural nerve biopsy. Skin biopsies were taken from proximal thigh, distal leg, trunk, arm, and fingertip in 10 healthy subjects. Immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies using polyclonal anti-PGP 9.5 (PGP), monoclonal anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), and polyclonal anti-human VR-1 antibodies were performed. Double staining studies were carried out in the following combinations: PGP-TuJ1 and TuJ1-VR-1. In each site, PGP-positive IENF showed TuJ1 labeling and, most interestingly, VR-1 diffusely co-localized with all TuJ1-positive IENF. These findings indirectly demonstrated the co-localization between VR-1 and the panaxonal marker PGP in IENF. VR-1 immunoreactivity was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve sections from a patient without morphological signs of sensory involvement. Almost 2/3 of unmyelinated fibers showed an intense VR-1 immunoreactivity, which was present also in smooth muscle cells of perineurial and epineurial arterioles. VR-1 immunolabeling was absent in myelinated fibers and in part of unmyelinated fibers, which possibly represented autonomic fibers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that VR-1 is widely expressed in somatic human unmyelinated nerve fibers. Particularly, the diffuse immunoreactivity of IENF, which are naked terminals of small-diameter DRG sensory neurons, suggests that they are essential for selective modalities of nociception and primarily involved in neuropathic hyperalgesia.

AB  - Abstract Aims The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the bioactive compound of Micromonospora auratinigra, HK-10 and its antibacterial inhibitory mechanism. Methods and Results An oily bioactive compound was extracted from HK-10 (GenBank accession no. JN381554) and found to have promising antibacterial activity. The compound was characterized as 2-methylheptylisonicotinate (1) by 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectroscopy. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this molecule was tested by micro broth dilution method and was found to be 70, 40, 80, 60, 60 and 50 ?g for Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus vulgaris, Echerichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium abscessus respectively. The effects of compound 1 were studied on bacterial membrane structure using scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated a membrane-disrupting mechanism, resulting in the dysfunction of the cytoplasmic membrane structure and cell death of the pathogenic bacterial strains. Kinetics of growth of the test organisms was also analysed and indicated 2-methylheptylisonicotinate 1 as a bactericidal agent. Furthermore, we have studied the binding affinity of 1 towards different membrane proteins of pathogenic bacteria by in silico analysis. Conclusions 2-methylheptylisonicotinate was isolated from M. auratinigra, a rare actinobacterial strain possessing antibacterial activity through a membrane-disrupting mechanism, and has MICs similar to standard antibiotic neomycin sulphate. It is the first report about a strain of M. auratinigra, isolated from Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot of North-east India with new antimicrobial activities. In silico studies have also supported these results performed on various membrane targets of pathogenic bacteria. Significance and Impact of the Study The antibacterial potential of M. auratinigra is reported for the first time. The results indicate the possible use of 2-methylheptylisonicotinate as a source of antibacterial agent against dreaded human pathogens.
