AB  - Fibrin Sealant products such as TisseelR have been used over the last 25 years to reach hemostasis during surgery or to seal tissues. Moreover, there were many studies on the use of fibrin sealant in cell and bioactive substance delivery. Our In Vitro and In Vivo studies, over the last 2 years, have focused on the use of fibrin sealant to deliver human fibroblasts or keratinocytes to overcome the healing deficiency in chronic wounds. We have shown that some fibrin formulations supported a high fibroblast proliferation and other fibrin formulations supported a high proliferation of human keratinocytes. In this study, we examined the use of fibrin sealant in the co-delivery of both human ? derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The study report examined the cell proliferation of these two cell types in various formulations of fibrin sealant. Fibroblasts and keratinocytes were mixed with various dilutions of the Sealer Protein solution and added to culture plates before adding the Thrombin solution to form fibrin clots containing both cell types. We found that a low to medium sealer protein concentration (1?34?mG/mL) and a very low thrombin concentration (1?U/mL) in the final fibrin clots provided for an optimal cell proliferation for both cell types within these fibrin clots. This profile of proliferation was different from that seen when keratinocytes alone or fibroblasts alone were incorporated in the fibrin clots. Morphologically, it was difficult to determine the cell type from examining cell morphology, thus, it was difficult to determine the cell distribution. In conclusion, we found that various modified formulations of fibrin sealant may be chosen when co- delivering fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Moreover, there seems to be a positive feedback between keratinocytes and fibroblasts when they were co ? introduced in the fibrin clots. This feedback could be carried by growth factors. Future studies will determine his signaling process.

AB  - Objective:? To perform detailed assessments of craniofacial dysmorphology in individuals with schizophrenia and controls in Sweden, in order to further elucidate the neurodevelopmental origins of schizophrenia. Method:? We performed detailed, anthropometric assessments of craniofacial dysmorphology in male patients with schizophrenia (n?=?24), healthy controls (n?=?16), and patients? siblings with schizophrenia (n?=?2) in Sweden, while remaining as blind as possible to schizophrenia/control status. Results:? Individuals with schizophrenia evidenced significantly more craniofacial dysmorphology than controls, especially in the ears and mouth. At a group level, there was a dose?response type relationship between total dysmorphology score and patient/control status. Conclusion:? The consistency of results across multiple studies supports the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia have increased rates of prenatal developmental disturbances. The presence of a dose?response type relationship between total dysmorphology score and patient/control status supports the importance of neurodevelopmental disturbance as a contributory cause of schizophrenia.

AB  - Summary We report on a 30-year-old man with azoospermia, primary hypogonadism and minor dysmorphic features who carried a balanced insertional chromosome translocation inv ins (2p24;4q28.3q31.22)de novo. Molecular cytogenetic analyses of the chromosome breakpoints revealed the localization of the breakpoint in 4q28.3 between BACs RP11-143E9 and RP11-285A15, an interval that harbours the PCDH10 gene. In 4q31.22, a breakpoint-spanning clone (RP11-6L6) was identified which contains the genes LSM6 and SLC10A7. On chromosome 2, BACs RP11-531P14 and RP11-360O18 flank the breakpoint in 2p24, a region void of known genes. In conclusion, the chromosome aberration of this patient suggests a gene locus for primary hypogonadism in 2p24, 4q28.3 or 4q31.2, and three possible candidate genes (LSM6, SLC10A7 and PCDH10) were identified by breakpoint analyses.

AB  - Abstract Scientific applications like neuroscience data analysis are usually compute and data-intensive. With the use of the additional capacity offered by distributed resources and suitable middlewares, we can achieve much shorter execution time, distribute compute and storage load, and add greater flexibility to the execution of these scientific applications than we could ever achieve in a single compute resource. In this paper, we present the processing of image registration (IR) for functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on Global Grids. We characterize the application, list its requirements and then transform it to a workflow. We use Gridbus Broker and Gridbus Workflow Engine technologies for executing the neuroscience application on the Grid. We developed a complete web-based portal integrating GUI-based workflow editor, execution management, monitoring and visualization of tasks and resources. We describe each component of the system in detail. We then execute the application on Grid'5000 platform and present extensive performance results. We show that the IR application can have (1) significantly improved makespan, (2) distribution of compute and storage load among resources used, and (3) flexibility when executing multiple times on Grid resources.

AB  - Current clinical practice permits the use of single chamber ventricular or dual chamber pacemakers. However, it is not known which type of pacemaker results in superior clinical and patient outcomes. This is of growing importance because of the higher costs and increased risk of technical failures of dual chamber pacemakers. Patient outcomes can be assessed with quality of life questionnaires, but it is unclear which questionnaires are valid for use in pacemaker patients. This article reappraises studies on quality of life instruments for pacemaker patients. We searched MEDLINE (1985?1998) for studies assessing quality-of-life in general and in pacemaker patients. The SF-36 appeared to be the best among generic questionnaires because of its psychometric characteristics and experience of use. Concerning disease specific instruments, the Karolinska quality of life questionnaire has desirable content validity but lacks more rigorous psychometric validation, which constitutes a serious limitation. Previous studies suggested that implantation of atrioventricular pacemakers improves quality-of-life compared to ventricular pacemakers, but since no well-designed and validated questionnaire exists, these results should be interpreted with caution. The best outcome measure to evaluate quality-of-life in pacemaker patients would be a combination of a generic health profile with established reliability and validity supplemented with a cardiovascular assessment adjusted to suit pacemaker patients. By doing so, individual scores can be compared within a disease cohort and to same-aged, nondiseased persons, as well as other diseased populations. The development and validation of such an instrument is currently needed.

AB  - ABSTRACT The peripheral dialects of Arabic tend to differ from the core dialects by having an important component derived from anther languages or language group. In the case of Maltese this non-Arabic component has been alost entirely of Romance origin until comparative recently, when English began to play a part. The Romance component is frequently more closely defined by stating that it is Italian, or Sicilian, or Siculo-Italian. It is the purpose of this paper to examine this component and try and understand the role that it has played in the formation of moderbn Maltese.

AB  - Summary Disposable bronchoscopes such as the Ambu aScopeTM 3 are marketed as ?single use? The risks of contamination from prolonged device storage before possible re-use are unknown. Following clinical bronchoscopy in patients whose lungs were mechanically ventilated, 20 aScopeTM 3's bronchoscopes received a standard ?social clean? and were then stored. Subsequent paired saline flush and swab samples were taken at time zero, and at 24 h and 48 h. Positive microbiological cultures were obtained from at least one time point from 16 of the 20 bronchoscopes. Pathogens considered at high risk of causing pneumonia were isolated from seven bronchoscopes, with significant quantities from six of them. Our study demonstrates that aScopeTM 3's should not be re-used on the same patient, as clinically significant growth of micro-organisms occurs frequently, despite adequate social cleaning. Culture of bronchoscopes themselves may be a potentially useful diagnostic tool in the context of pulmonary infection. Our data make it clear that these devices are single use and not single patient use.

AB  - ABSTRACT The past 10 years have witnessed more significant changes in the art and science of endodontics than the previous 100 years. This observation is no surprise, given that change is our only constant. The rate of change, however, has been anything but constant. The rate has accelerated so fast that all clinicians in the field of dentistry need a reliable source to guide us in what works. What works today in endodontics is the theme of this update. The discoveries and advancements in endodontic technology, instruments, and materials enable practitioners to achieve treatment outcomes that were previously considered unattainable. For example, in nonsurgical endodontic treatment, nickel titanium technology consistently can produce predictable radicular preparations that can be easily obturated. In nonsurgical re-treatment, the previous endodontic obturation attempt frequently can be removed and successfully re-treated largely because of enhanced vision and coaxial lighting from the operating microscope. Importantly, careful nonsurgical re-treatment usually can be accomplished without disruption to the existing restorations and without risk to ferrule integrity. In endodontic surgery underfilled foramina, and the isthmi between them, predictably can be connected and obturated with state-of-the-art miniature instruments. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This article reviews the clinical endodontic breakthroughs encountered during the last decade and focuses on three primary topics: (1) finding canals; (2) following canals; and (3) finishing canals. Every day, dentists are faced with the interdisciplinary treatment planning question of to ?save or not to save a tooth?? Dentists must routinely make the decision of whether to remove or restore the tooth based on biology, structure, function, esthetics, and value.1 Occasionally, the endodontically treated tooth can be the weakest link in the restorative and esthetic sequence. This article examines the current state of endodontic technology, as well as the fundamentals of endodontic mechanics needed to achieve the most predictable endodontic outcome with the highest degree of success.

AB  - Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a descriptor for the clinical finding of congenital fixation of multiple joints. We present a consanguineous healthy couple with two pregnancies described with AMC due to characteristic findings on ultrasonography of fixated knee extension and reduced fetal movement at the gestational age of 13 weeks?+?2 days and 12 weeks?+?4 days. Both pregnancies were terminated and postmortem examinations were performed. The postmortem examinations confirmed AMC and suggested a diagnosis of centronuclear myopathy (CNM) due to characteristic histological findings in muscle biopsies. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on all four individuals and the outcome was filtered by application of multiple filtration parameters satisfying a recessive inheritance pattern. Only one gene, ECEL1, was predicted damaging and had previously been associated with neuromuscular disease or AMC. The variant found ECEL1 is a missense mutation in a highly conserved residue and was predicted pathogenic by prediction software. The finding expands the molecular basis of congenital contractures and the phenotypic spectrum of ECEL1 mutations. The histological pattern suggestive of CNM in the fetuses can expand the spectrum of genes causing CNM, as we propose that mutations in ECEL1 can cause CNM or a condition similar to this. Further investigation of this is needed and we advocate that future patients with similar clinical presentation or proven ECEL1 mutations are examined with muscle biopsy. Secondly, this study illustrates the great potential of the clinical application of WES in couples with recurrent abortions or stillborn neonates. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
