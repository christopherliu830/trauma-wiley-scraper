AB  - Study Type ? Diagnostic (exploratory cohort)?Level of Evidence?2b INTRODUCTION To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of transvesical contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as an alternative method for the detection of anastomotic leakage after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) in comparison with the current standard method of conventional retrograde cystography (CG). PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-three patients underwent RRP for histologically proven localized prostate cancer. The vesico-urethral anastomosis was evaluated 8 days after RRP by CG and CEUS. Any peri-anastomotic leakage was assessed and determined in CG and CEUS as follows: no extravasation (EV), small leakage (≤0.5?cm), moderate leakage (>0.5?cm to ≤2?cm), large leakage (>2?cm diameter of EV seen). RESULTS In total, 21 (49%) patients showed a watertight anastomosis. Ten (23%), two (4.7%) and ten (23%) patients showed a small, intermediate and large EV, respectively. In 31 cases (72%) there was 100% agreement of CG and CEUS for detection of no, moderate and large EV, respectively. In nine cases a small and in two cases a moderate EV was categorized as watertight anastomosis by CEUS. Only in one case did CG detect a small EV where a large EV was detected in CEUS. The agreement between both methods was 95% for detecting absence or large leakages. CONCLUSION CEUS is a promising imaging modality that seems to be equivalent to CG for detecting the presence of a large anastomotic leakage that is clinically relevant for postoperative persistence of the indwelling catheter. CEUS could be a cheap and time-saving alternative to the CG without exposure of the patient to radiation.

AB  - The tuberous breast deformity is an uncommon congenital breast anomaly which affects young women unilaterally or bilaterally. It is associated with usually a constriction in the lower pole of the breast as a result of the constricting fibrous ring with hypoplasia of the breast gland and pseudo-herniation of breast tissue into an enlarged areola. Several methods have been suggested to correct this deformity. A retrospective analysis has been undertaken of six consecutive patients with tuberous breast deformity using a dual plane breast augmentation via an inferior peri-areolar approach creating a dual plane pocket and using Marionette sutures to control the lower pectoralis major edge. Surgical release of the constricting lower pole glandular tissue was undertaken with excellent aesthetic results. Either immediate or delayed areolar reduction was carried out if required. Results show excellent expansion of the lower pole with good soft tissue coverage of the implant by the pectoralis major in the supero-medial aspect of the breast. The dual plane pocket combined with lower pole release assists lower pole expansion in a one stage procedure without requiring two stage tissue expansion. The results have been uniformly acceptable and compare favourably with those presented in the literature where other methods were used. The dual plane breast augmentation technique is a simple and reliable way to treat tuberous breast deformity.

AB  - Summary Objective To examine the consistency of applying the Nashef et al (2012) criteria to classify sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Methods We reviewed cases from the North American SUDEP Registry (n = 250) and Medical Examiner Offices (n = 1301: 698 Maryland, 457 New York City, 146 San Diego). Two epileptologists with expertise in SUDEP and epilepsy-related mortality independently reviewed medical records, scene investigation, autopsy, and toxicology and assigned a SUDEP class. Results Major areas of disagreement arose between adjudicators concerned differentiating (1) Definite SUDEP Plus Comorbidity from Possible SUDEP and (2) Resuscitated (Near) SUDEP from SUDEP. In many cases, distinguishing between contributing and competing causes of death when trying to classify Definite SUDEP Plus Comorbidity versus Possible SUDEP is ambiguous and relies on judgement. Similarly, determining if an intervention was lifesaving or not (Resuscitated SUDEP or Not SUDEP), or if resuscitation merely delayed SUDEP (Resuscitated SUDEP or SUDEP) is often a judgement call and can differ between experienced adjudicators. Given these persisting ambiguities, we propose more explicit criteria for distinguishing these categories. Significance Accurate and consistent classification of cause of death among individuals with epilepsy remains a dire public health concern. SUDEP is likely underestimated in national health statistics. Greater standardization of criteria among epilepsy researchers, medical examiners, and epidemiologists to determine cause and classify death will lead to more accurate tracking of SUDEP and other epilepsy-related mortalities.

AB  - Objective:? To assess occupational dermal exposure to permanent hair dyes in hairdressers. Methods:? Dermal exposure was assessed in 31 hairdressers using a previously evaluated method, hand wash sampling with bag rinsing. The measurements were performed in hairdressing saloons during working hours. Hand wash samples were collected from each hand before start of the hair dyeing process, after application of the hair dye and after cutting the newly dyed hair. 13 of the hairdressers did not use gloves during application of the hair dye, and during cutting of the dyed hair no one used gloves. The samples were analysed for aromatic amines and resorcinol using an HPLC-method. Results:? After application of the hair dye PPD (p-phenylenediamine) was found in samples from 1 hairdressers (148?185?nmol/hand), TDA (toluenediamine) in samples from 12 hairdressers (range 10?735?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 22 individuals (range 19?769?nmol/hand). In the samples taken after cutting the dyed hair PPD was found in 2 hairdressers (range 36?358?nmol/hand), TDA in 14 (range 8?361?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 20 (range 10?725?nmol/hand. Conclusion:? Skin exposure to aromatic amines and resorcinol was detected in more than half of the hairdressers after application of hair dye and also after cutting newly dyed hair. To reduce exposure improved skin protection is important.

AB  - No consensus yet exists on how to handle incidental fnd-ings (IFs) in human subjects research. Yet empirical studies document IFs in a wide range of research studies, where IFs are fndings beyond the aims of the study that are of potential health or reproductive importance to the individual research participant. This paper reports recommendations of a two-year project group funded by NIH to study how to manage IFs in genetic and genomic research, as well as imaging research. We conclude that researchers have an obligation to address the possibility of discovering IFs in their protocol and communications with the IRB, and in their consent forms and communications with research participants. Researchers should establish a pathway for handling IFs and communicate that to the IRB and research participants. We recommend a pathway and categorize IFs into those that must be disclosed to research participants, those that may be disclosed, and those that should not be disclosed.
