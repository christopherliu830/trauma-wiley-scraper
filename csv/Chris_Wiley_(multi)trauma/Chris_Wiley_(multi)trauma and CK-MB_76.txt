AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? To review the literature on mortality among dependent or regular users of opioids across regions, according to specific causes, and related to a number of demographic and clinical variables. Methods? Multiple search strategies included searches of Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO, consistent with the methodology recommended by the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group; grey literature searches; and contact of experts for any additional unpublished data from studies meeting inclusion criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), with stratified analyses where possible. Meta-regressions examined potentially important sources of heterogeneity across studies. Results? Fifty-eight prospective studies reported mortality rates from opioid-dependent samples. Very high heterogeneity across studies was observed; pooled all-cause CMR was 2.09 per 100 person-years (PY; 95% CI; 1.93, 2.26), and the pooled SMR was 14.66 (95% CI: 12.82, 16.50). Males had higher CMRs and lower SMRs than females. Out-of-treatment periods had higher mortality risk than in-treatment periods (pooled RR 2.38 (CI: 1.79, 3.17)). Causes of death varied across studies, but overdose was the most common cause. Multivariable regressions found the following predictors of mortality rates: country of origin; the proportion of sample injecting; the extent to which populations were recruited from an entire country (versus subnational); and year of publication. Conclusions? Mortality among opioid-dependent users varies across countries and populations. Treatment is clearly protective against mortality even in non-randomized observational studies. Study characteristics predict mortality levels; these should be taken into account in future studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: A prospective cohort study was conducted to test our ability to identify chronically ill patients at near term risk of death by asking their primary care physician (PCP) the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of CHF or COPD?' METHODS: Patients were eligible for inclusion if 1) their clinic chart problem list carried a diagnosis of CHF or COPD, 2) they had been hospitalized within the past two years with primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF or COPD, or 3) direct identification by their PCP. Chart review was used to exclude patients erroneously carrying these diagnoses (e.g. coding errors), inactive patients (deceased or changed providers) and those patients with normal ejection fractions or not requiring scheduled ?-2 agonist and anticholinergic bronchodialator therapy. Patients were then stratified on the basis of their PCP's response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD?' All patients screened and stratified by the question were followed for the primary endpoint of death. RESULTS: The initial data query identified 190 patients with CHF and/or COPD. A chart review excluded eight inactive patients and thirty-one patients who did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria for significant disease. Of the remaining 151 patients, there were 72 whose PCP answered that he/she would not be surprised if the patient died from CHF and/or COPD in the next year. Within nine months, nine of these patients have died from complications of their CHF or COPD. There have been no deaths in the 79 patients whose PCP answered that they would be surprised if their patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD. (p-value < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF and/or COPD at risk of near term death can be differentiated from those who are not at high risk by the PCPs'response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of their CHF and/or COPD?' Such screening may be useful to more efficiently target palliative services and end of life care planning to patients with advanced CHF and/or COPD.

AB  - Abstract Increased attention in recent years has focused on theoretical orientations, considerations of environmental influences, and progressively nuanced methodological and statistical approaches for analyzing complex phenomena. Despite advances and recommendations, outcomes for many African American youth have declined in education, in physical health, in mental health, and in more general well-being. To address these contradictory trends, this chapter provides a sociohistorical framing in reviewing research that has informed the field, with specific attention on African American youth vulnerability and resilience. The phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory affords a strategy for examining the vulnerability status and resiliency patterns of African American children and youth while acknowledging the role of the American Creed and historical contributions on their social contexts and patterned outcomes. An alternative strategy for examining vulnerability and resiliency among African American youth is introduced along with findings on typical and atypical developmental. These reports represent and focus on several central research themes for youth of African American descent that are further considered in explaining methodological controversies. The scope of risk and attributes of resiliency are raised in understanding mechanisms by which protective factors mitigate risks and extend current translational practices.

AB  - Background: The establishment of reliable central venous access is essential in the management of patients with major complications, including pneumothorax and hemopneumothorax. Although peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCS) offer advantages over traditional central venous approaches, PICC lines are associated with a number of insertion and maintenance problems, including clotting and catheter fracture. These complications often result in catheter removal before completion of prescribed therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study in a convenience sample of 322 consecutively placed PICC lines. Study variables included size of catheter, tip placement, infused solutions, patient diagnosis, and unit of line placement. The rationale for line discontinuance as well as for complication rates is described. Results: Complication rates for infection and central venous thrombosis were less than 1%. Phlebitis occurred in 9.7% of patients, and catheter fracture occurred in 9.7% of patients. Two distinct clusters of phlebitis, early and late development, were observed. Early phlebitis is attributable to the mechanics of insertion, and late phlebitis is attributable to chemical and patient-specific causes. Catheter fractures were primarily related to tearing of the catheter during insertion or traction on the catheter-hub junction (51.6%). Conclusions: The majority of published data about PICC lines is in the area of chemotherapy or antibiotic infusion. Our study supports the use of PICC lines in patients receiving a variety of solutions, primarily parenteral nutrition. With an experienced, team approach to catheter placement and maintenance, PICC lines provide reliable, cost-effective venous access and reduce many of the complications of central venous access in a variety of clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract Background: This study examined the degree to which combat-related guilt mediated the relations between exposure to combat-related abusive violence and both Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in Vietnam Veterans. Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted on data collected from 1,323 male Vietnam Veterans as part of a larger, multisite study. Results: Results revealed that combat-related guilt partially mediated the association between exposure to combat-related abusive violence and PTSD, but completely mediated the association with MDD, with overall combat exposure held constant in the model. Follow-up analyses showed that, when comparing those participants who actually participated in combat-related abusive violence with those who only observed it, combat-related guilt completely mediated the association between participation in abusive violence and both PTSD and MDD. Moreover, when comparing those participants who observed combat-related abusive violence with those who had no exposure at all to it, combat-related guilt completely mediated the association between observation of combat-related abusive violence and MDD, but only partially mediated the association with PTSD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that guilt may be a mechanism through which abusive violence is related to PTSD and MDD among combat-deployed Veterans. These findings also suggest the importance of assessing abusive-violence related guilt among combat-deployed Veterans and implementing relevant interventions for such guilt whenever indicated.

AB  - Summary Opioids are the prototypical analgesics, antitussives, and antidiarrheal drug class. The opioid receptor system or opioid effects have been identified in numerous animal species including ascarids, scallops, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The primary effect site of opioids is the central nervous system (CNS) for analgesia, antitussive effects, and sedation. Three opioid receptor types have been definitively identified: mu (?), kappa (?), and delta (δ). The most common indication for opioid administration is pain management (i.e., hypoalgesia or analgesia). Opioids typically produce dose-dependent sedation when administered alone, but can produce more profound sedation when combined with other sedatives such as phenothiazines and α2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Opioids are capable of inhalant anesthetic Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) reduction, a phenomenon that is species, dose, and opioid receptor dependent. Morphine elicits its effects primarily as a full ? opioid agonist, but higher doses can also result in ? receptor agonist effects.
