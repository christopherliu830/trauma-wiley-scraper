AB  - Abstract Introduction Women living with HIV (WLHIV) experience stigma and elevated exposure to violence in comparison with HIV-negative women. We examined the mediating role of experiencing recent violence in the relationship between stigma and depression among WLHIV in Canada. Methods We conducted a cohort study with WLHIV in three Canadian provinces. Recent violence was assessed through self-reported experiences of control, physical, sexual or verbal abuse in the past three months. At Time 1 (2013-2015) three forms of stigma were assessed (HIV-related, racial, gender) and at Time 2 (2015-2017) only HIV-related stigma was assessed. We conducted structural equation modelling (SEM) using the maximum likelihood estimation method with Time 1 data to identify direct and indirect effects of gender discrimination, racial discrimination and HIV-related stigma on depression via recent violence. We then conducted mixed effects regression and SEM using Time 1 and Time 2 data to examine associations between HIV-related stigma, recent violence and depression. Results At Time 1 (n = 1296), the direct path from HIV-related stigma (direct effect: ? = 0.200, p < 0.001; indirect effect: ? = 0.014, p < 0.05) to depression was significant; recent violence accounted for 6.5% of the total effect. Gender discrimination had a significant direct and indirect effect on depression (direct effect: ? = 0.167, p < 0.001; indirect effect: ? = 0.050, p < 0.001); recent violence explained 23.15% of the total effect. Including Time 1 and Time 2 data (n = 1161), mixed-effects regression results indicate a positive relationship over time between HIV-related stigma and depression (Acoef: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.06, p < 0.001), and recent violence and depression (Acoef: 1.95, 95% CI: 0.29, 4.42, p < 0.05), controlling for socio-demographics. There was a significant interaction between HIV-related stigma and recent violence with depression (Acoef: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07, p < 0.05). SEM analyses reveal that HIV-related stigma had a significant direct and indirect effect on depression over time (direct effect: ? = 0.178, p < 0.001; indirect effect: ? = 0.040, p < 0.001); recent violence experiences accounted for 51% of the total effect. Conclusions Our findings suggest that HIV-related stigma is associated with increased experiences of recent violence, and both stigma and violence are associated with increased depression among WLHIV in Canada. There is an urgent need for trauma-informed stigma interventions to address stigma, discrimination and violence.

AB  - Autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have been transferred with third generation lentiviral vectors, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the human PGK promoter, and transplanted in wild type mice. Transplanted mice have been sacrificed at 6, and 9 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to study the timing and extent of migration of BM derived transduced cells into peripheral nervous system (PNS). Starting from 6 months after BMT cells have been found in the PNS, such as in the acoustic ganglion, the dorsal root ganglions (DRG) and the sciatic nerve. At 9 months from transplant GFP positive cells represented the 50?60% of the F4/80 (a microglial marker) positive population of sciatic nerve sections and the 65?75% of F4/80?+ cells of the acoustic ganglion and DRG. At these sites, GFP positive cells were found between nerve fibers and neurons, they expressed F4/80, and were negative for GFAP, neuronal and myelin markers. Autologous BMT coupled with HSC transduction with high efficiency vectors could provide therapeutic benefit to several disorders affecting the PNS such as many lysosomal storage disorders. In these patients clinical evidence confirms the relevance of PNS involvement in the prognosis of the disease.

AB  - Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for the treatment of gouty arthritis, Behçet's disease and amyloidosis. Reported side effects, such as blood dyscrasias and gastroenteritis, are probably ascribed to its antimitotic properties. Colchicine-induced myopathy with vacuolar changes and frequently associated sensory-motor axonal neuropathy have also been described. A 52-yr-old woman, previously treated for gouty arthritis, persisted in self-administering colchicine intermittently for three years, in order to reduce body weight by inducing diarrhea. The patient had weakness and hypotrophy in upper and lower girdles and proximal muscles, ?stocking and glove? hypoesthesia and loss of deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. EMG examination showed a neurogenic/myogenic mixed pattern and nerve conduction studies were consistent with sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy, with autophagic vacuoles and associated neurogenic changes. A moderate loss of myelinated fibers and some degenerating axons were observed in sural nerve biopsy. There were neither demyelinating changes nor autophagic vacuoles within axons. Muscle and nerve findings were thus suggestive of colchicine neuromyopathy. The drug was withdrawn and clinical-electrophysiological data improved. Colchicine muscular toxicity is presumably due to inhibition of tubulin monomer polymerization. The microtubular network destabilization might cause cytoplasmic deposits of autophagic debris in skeletal muscle. We thus evaluated number, density and spatial array of microtubules in myelinated and unmyelinated axons by transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis was carried out on high magnification photographs in our patient biopsy and in control nerves (normal and with axonal loss). Decrease of microtubular density and increase of tangentially oriented microtubules were observed both in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. No neural deposits of tubulin-like material, as described in some cases of colchicine myopathy, were found. As in experimental vincristine neuropathy, cytoskeletal damage induced by colchicine seems related to effects of primary microtubular disarray on axonal transport and caliber, rather than to the extent of axonal loss.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is widely used in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain. However, there is controversy over its true efficacy. We aimed to determine the efficacy of LLLT in the treatment of neck pain through systematically reviewing the literature. Study Design/Materials and Methods A search of computerized bibliographic databases covering medicine, physiotherapy, allied health, complementary medicine, and biological sciences was undertaken undertaken from date of inception until February 2004 for randomized controlled trials of LLLT for neck pain. A comprehensive list of search terms was applied and explicit inclusion criteria were developed a priori. Twenty studies were identified, five of which met the inclusion criteria. Results Significant positive effects were reported in four of five trials in which infrared wavelengths (??=?780, 810?830, 904, 1,064 nm) were used. Heterogeneity in outcome measures, results reporting, doses, and laser parameters precluded formal meta-analysis. Effect sizes could be calculated for only two of the studies. Conclusions This review provides limited evidence from one RCT for the use of infrared laser for the treatment of acute neck pain (n?=?71) and chronic neck pain from four RCTs (n?=?202). Larger studies are required to confirm the positive findings and determine the most effective laser parameters, sites and modes of application. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary The Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family plays a central role in the generation and regulation of inflammatory responses, in both innate and adaptive immunity. Although the IL-1 molecules are traditionally considered to be classical proinflammatory cytokines, their functions are not restricted to inflammation, and they have also been shown to play a key role in a wide range of additional physiological and pathological functions, including learning modulation, sleep, pregnancy, depression, appetite, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and many others. Since their effect as cytokines and regulators of inflammation is so pleiotropic, any shift of the biological balance between agonistic and antagonistic signals has the potential to cause disease. Here, we consider the genetic influence of interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in the context of susceptibility to human diseases. We review known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-1 genes linked to human diseases, and suggest how exploring biological effects of IL-1 gene cluster polymorphism may lead to new directions in understanding and diagnostic of disease and effective treatment.

AB  - Abstract Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP or oxytocinase) is a membrane-bound zinc-metallopeptidase that cleaves neuroactive peptides in the brain and produces memory enhancing effects when inhibited. We have determined the crystal structure of human IRAP revealing a closed, four domain arrangement with a large, mostly buried cavity abutting the active site. The structure reveals that the GAMEN exopeptidase loop adopts a very different conformation from other aminopeptidases, thus explaining IRAP's unique specificity for cyclic peptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin. Computational docking of a series of IRAP-specific cognitive enhancers into the crystal structure provides a molecular basis for their structure?activity relationships and demonstrates that the structure will be a powerful tool in the development of new classes of cognitive enhancers for treating a variety of memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Abstract Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a lack of expression of the maternal copy of UBE3A. Although the ?classic? features of AS are well described, few large-scale studies have delineated the clinical features in AS. We present baseline data from 92 children with a molecular diagnosis of AS between 5 and 60 months old who are enrolled in the National Institutes of Health Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network Angelman Syndrome Natural History Study from January 2006 to March 2008. Seventy-four percent of participants had deletions, 14% had either uniparental disomy (UPD) or imprinting defects, and 12% had UBE3A mutations. Participants with UPD/imprinting defects were heavier (P?=?0.0002), while those with deletions were lighter, than the general population (P?<?0.0001). Twenty out of 92 participants were underweight, all of whom had deletions or UBE3A mutations. Eight out of 92 participants (6/13 (46%) with UPD/imprinting defects and 2/11 (18%) with UBE3A mutations) were obese. Seventy-four out of 92 participants (80%) had absolute or relative microcephaly. No participant was macrocephalic. The most common behavioral findings were mouthing behavior (95%), short attention span (92%), ataxic or broad-based gait (88%), history of sleep difficulties (80%), and fascination with water (75%). Frequent, easily provoked laughter was observed in 60%. Clinical seizures were reported in 65% of participants but all electroencephalograms (EEGs) were abnormal. We conclude that the most characteristic feature of AS is the neurobehavioral phenotype, but specific EEG findings are highly sensitive for AS. Obesity is common among those with UPD/imprinting defects. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser skin resurfacing has become an accepted procedure for the rejuvenation of aged and wrinkled facial skin. The benefits of this technique have been limited by the prolonged postoperative erythema, delayed re-epithelialization, and potential changes in pigmentation. We investigated the effects of coupling a pulsed CO2 laser to a zinc selenide handpiece at various temperatures to cool and conduct heat from the skin surface. We compared the heat conducting handpiece to standard techniques used to determine the effects on epithelial preservation, depth of thermal damage, and new collagen growth. Study Design/Materials and Methods The dorsal aspect of piglets was treated with four handpiece arrangements: no thermally conducting window; a zinc selenide thermally conducting window at room temperature; and the zinc selenide thermally conducting window cooled to 10 and 5°C. Intensities were measured to account for reflections from the surface of the handpiece. With the CO2 laser in scanning mode and a spot size of 1 mm, each handpiece was used at intensities ranging from 8?30 W in one pass. Biopsies for histopathologic analysis and determination of the degree of epithelial damage and the depth of thermal damage were taken on days 0, 2, and 16. Results All specimens revealed complete re-epithelialization by day 16. The addition of a cooled handpiece did not affect either the amount of epithelial preservation or the depth of thermal damage. Conclusions There is no significant advantage in using a cooled or room temperature zinc selenide handpiece for epithelial preservation or decreasing the inflammatory response in CO2 laser resurfacing.

We sought to specifically examine the role of mechanical strain in hypertrophic scars. To do so, we developed and characterized a novel murine model which uses mechanical strain to produce hypertrophic scars in mice. Methods: Paired incisions were created on C57BL6 mice (n?=?20). After closure, mechanical strain was applied across one wound using a novel device; the other wound was a control. Starting at day 3, mechanical strain was increased every other day over 4?wks. Wounds were harvested each week, and examined histologically using Sirius red, DAPI, BrdU for proliferation, and caspase 3 for apoptosis. Results: Strained wounds showed features of hypertrophic scars: raised borders, loss of rete pegs and adnexal structures in the epidermis overlying scars, blood vessels that were perpendicular and fibrillary collagen that was parallel to skin surface. Features persisted beyond 6 months. Wound collagen deposition in strained wounds increased 6-fold at 1 wk and over 12-fold at 2?4?wks, in parallel to an increase in number of stromal cells within scar (28-fold). This resulted in an increase in number of cells per unit area of collagen (over 42%). In all wounds, there was no significant difference in proliferation. There was a significant reduction in blood vessel (4-fold) and fibroblast (3-fold) apoptosis at 1?4?wks in strained wounds. Conc: Mechanical strain alone is sufficient to produce hypertrophic scars in this model that are indistinguishable from human scars. Notably, hypertrophic scars appear to result from a marked reduction in apoptosis, rather than from a significant proliferation and upregulation of cellular collagen deposition, validating previous in vitro studies.
