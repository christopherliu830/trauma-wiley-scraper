AB  - Summary It has been reported that a small decrease in the strain in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) occurs if the toe is raised during walking. Although walking on a slope appears similar to raising the toe, it is unclear whether uphill exercise decreases the strain in the SDFT. Because the force or strain on tendons is one of the important factors leading to tendon stress injury, we hypothesised that reducing the force in the SDFT during exercise may prevent tendinitis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of treadmill inclination on the force in the SDFT in the walking horse. ?Arthroscopically implantable force probes? (AIFP) were implanted into the SDFT of the forelimb of 4 horses. The AIFP output was recorded during walking on a treadmill inclined at 0%, 3%, 8% and then 0% again. When the inclination increased from 0 to 8%, the first peak of force in the SDFT decreased significantly, the second increased significantly, but the maximal force and the area under the force-time curve did not change. In conclusion, uphill walking on an inclined treadmill did not decrease the maximal force in the SDFT or the area under the force-time curve, however, the patterns of force were altered. Future research should focus on the force distributions of tendons and ligaments at faster gaits, because the effects of a change in hoof angle and slope may be greater at faster gaits.

AB  - The present investigation examined implicit and explicit memory in 20 children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) and 20 matched controls. Consistent with previous research, children with AD/HD performed more poorly than controls on an explicit test of long-term memory for pictures. New results were that (a) there was no deficit on an implicit memory test for equivalent material and that (b) the observed deficit in explicit memory operated over and above any effects of depression/anxiety. Another finding to emerge was that AD/HD children had greater difficulty than controls in identifying pictures of objects that were presented in an unusual form, either rotated or degraded. Overall, the pattern of results is interpreted in terms of deficient effortful/resource-intensive processes in AD/HD but intact automatic processes.

AB  - Abstract Free water elimination (FWE) in brain diffusion MRI has been shown to improve tissue specificity in human white matter characterization both in health and in disease. Relative to the classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model, FWE is also expected to increase sensitivity to microstructural changes in longitudinal studies. However, it is not clear if these two models differ in their test?retest reproducibility. This study compares a bi-tensor model for FWE with DTI by extending a previous longitudinal-reproducibility 3T multisite study (10 sites, 7 different scanner models) of 50 healthy elderly participants (55?80 years old) scanned in two sessions at least 1 week apart. We computed the reproducibility of commonly used DTI metrics (FA: fractional anisotropy, MD: mean diffusivity, RD: radial diffusivity, and AXD: axial diffusivity), derived either using a DTI model or a FWE model. The DTI metrics were evaluated over 48 white-matter regions of the JHU-ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas, and reproducibility errors were assessed. We found that relative to the DTI model, FWE significantly reduced reproducibility errors in most areas tested. In particular, for the FA and MD metrics, there was an average reduction of approximately 1% in the reproducibility error. The reproducibility scores did not significantly differ across sites. This study shows that FWE improves sensitivity and is thus promising for clinical applications, with the potential to identify more subtle changes. The increased reproducibility allows for smaller sample size or shorter trials in studies evaluating biomarkers of disease progression or treatment effects.

AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the suitability of functional and morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model and further to validate that the ischemic injury was successfully induced. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T (Siemens Vision, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) in piglets (n?=?10; age 12?36?h) under general anaesthesia. Hypoxia was induced by ventilation of a gas mixture containing 8% O2 in N2 (AGA, Oslo, Norway). Ischemia was induced by bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries (CCA). HI was maintained for 30?min, followed by re-oxygenation with ambient air (21% O2) for 2.5?h. Relative cerebral flow (rCF) was estimated using a single shot SE-EPI sequence (TE?=?85?ms, voxel size 1???1???5?mm3), measuring the first-pass response following bolus injection of an intravascular iron oxide nanoparticulate contrast agent (NC100150 Injection; Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway) at a dose of 4.5?mg Fe/kg. rBF maps were generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis from the peak height of a gamma-variate function fitted to the first-pass contrast agent response. The presence of total carotid occlusion was assessed by MR angiography (MRA). MRA images (3D-GRE, TR/TE 4.4?ms/1.8?ms, voxel size 0.9???0.9???1.5?mm3) were acquired after contrast administration; utilizing the T1-effect of NC100150 injection. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously during the experiment via a catheter placed in the femoral artery. Blood gasses and rectal temperature were measured at regular intervals. At the end of the experiment, the piglets were given an overdose of 150?mg/kg Pentobarbital i.v., and a dissection was performed in order to identify structures identified on the MRI. MR angio (MRA) and volume rendering identified a prominent, highly vascularized, defined structure close to the eyeball, medioventrally. At dissection, when comparing with the MR images, the deep gland of the third eyelid, the Harderian gland, corresponded to this structure both by topography and size. It was thick, brownish and finely lobulated, and extended from the cartilage of the third eyelid towards the origin of the extrinsic eye muscles at the apex of the orbit. In contrast, the lacrimal gland presented as a small, soft and pale structure that was difficult to distinguish from the surrounding connective tissue. At histological examination, the Harderian gland consisted mostly of compact areas of alveolar glands with abundant eosinophilic granules. Wide thin-walled vessels were conspicuous in the interlobular connective tissue and the capsule. The present MRI demonstration of the Harderian gland was an accidental finding during an investigation to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model. In pig, this gland has received little attention in the literature. However, taking its size and blood supply into consideration, it must be of significant importance also in the pig. It is mostly studied in rodents and lower vertebrates and is found to possess various endocrine functions as well as exocrine.
