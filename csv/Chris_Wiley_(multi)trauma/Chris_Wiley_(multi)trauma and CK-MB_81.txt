AB  - Objective To compare sociodemographics, parity and mode of delivery between women diagnosed with vaginismus or localised provoked vestibulodynia (LPV) to women without a diagnosis before first pregnancy. Design Retrospective, population-based register study. Setting Sweden. Sample All women born in Sweden 1973?83 who gave birth for the first time or remained nulliparous during the years 2001?09. Methods Nationally linked registries were used to identify the study population. Women diagnosed with vaginismus or LPV were compared to all other women. Odds ratios for parity and mode of delivery were calculated using multinominal regression analysis and logistic regression. Main outcome measures Parity and mode of delivery. Results Women with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to be unmarried (P = 0.001), unemployed (P = 0.012), have a higher educational level (P < 0.001), a lower body mass index (P < 0.001) and use nicotine during pregnancy (P = 0.008). They were less likely to give birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.56?0.67). Women with vaginismus/LPV more often delivered by caesarean section (P < 0.001) especially for maternal request (adjusted OR 3.48, 95% CI 2.45?4.39). In women having vaginal delivery, those with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to suffer a perineal laceration (adjusted OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.56?2.25). Conclusions Women with vaginismus/LPV are less likely to give birth and those that do are more likely to deliver by caesarean section and have a caesarean section based upon maternal request. Those women delivering vaginally are more likely to suffer perineal laceration. These findings point to the importance of not only addressing sexual function in women with vaginismus/LPV but reproductive function as well.

AB  - Infection is a potentially devastating complication of Breast Reconstruction Surgery. We retrospectively reviewed primary implant based breast reconstruction cases over a six year period at a tertiary Plastic Surgery Unit in Perth to determine both infection and explantation rates, as well as patient and operative factors which may contribute to this risk. First and subsequent reconstructive stages were included in the study with the majority of patients having had their second stage procedure. All cases were followed up for a minimum of six months post operatively. 185 implants were placed into 88 patients with an overall infection rate of 7.6% and an explantation rate of 4.3%. Most (86%) of these infections occurred following the first staged procedure. Factors which may impart a greater risk of infection included smoking, increased Body Mass Index, shorter duration of wound drains and larger implant size. Multiple antibiotic regimes of varying duration were noted, however there was no significant difference between the infected and non-infected groups. Of note, documentation was found to be poor, particularly regarding implant and pocket preparation, drain sites and their subsequent daily drainage and time of removal. Formal protocol and/or a dedicated Breast Reconstruction database may prove useful in further audit and surveillance with the aims of identifying and decreasing patient and operative risks.

AB  - ABSTRACT Complications of popliteal cysts may closely mimic the clinical features of a deep venous thrombosis. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the non-invasive procedures of radionuclide venography and popliteal space ultrasound examination compared with those of contrast venography and arthrography, respectively, and then prospectively studied 23 non-surgical patients with acutely painful, swollen calves to determine the utility of these techniques. The cause of this symptom was popliteal cyst complications in 10 patients, deep venous thrombosis in seven patients, and both conditions in two patients. Radionuclide venography was highly reliable and ultrasound examination was specific but only moderately sensitive in these studies. The painful, swollen calf may be investigated adequately in most cases by means of noninvasive techniques; contrast venography and arthrography should be reserved for only a minority of patients.
