AB  - New insights into the phenotype of Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-hypermobile type (hEDS) have raised many issues in relation to classification, diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Within the multidisciplinary team, physical therapy plays a central role in management of individuals with hypermobility related disorders. However, many physical therapists are not familiar with the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, common clinical presentation, and management. This guideline aims to provide practitioners with the state of the art regarding the assessment and management of children, adolescents, and adults with JHS/hEDS. Due to the complexity of the symptoms in the profile of JHS/hEDS, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is adopted as a central framework whereby the umbrella term of disability is used to encompass functions, activities and participation, as well as environmental and personal factors. The current evidence-based literature regarding the management of JHS/hEDS is limited in size and quality and there is insufficient research exploring the clinical outcomes of a number of interventions. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions for children and adults. Until further multicenter trials are conducted, clinical decision-making should be based on theoretical and the current limited research evidence. For all individuals diagnosed with JHS/hEDS, international consensus and combined efforts to identify risk profiles would create a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms and the potential for optimizing health care for affected individuals. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Co-production of research into public health services has yet to demonstrate tangible benefits. Few studies have reported the impact of co-production on research outcomes. The previous studies of organ donation have identified challenges in engaging with public organizations responsible, gaining ethical approval for sensitive studies with the recently bereaved and difficulty in recruiting bereaved family members who were approached about organ donation. Objective To address these challenges, we designed the first large co-productive observational study to evaluate implementation of a new system of organ donation in Wales. This paper outlines the co-productive strategies that were designed to overcome known methodological challenges and reports what impact they had on resolving these challenges. Design Two-year co-produced study with multiple stakeholders with the specific intention of maximizing engagement with the National Health Service arm in Wales responsible for organ donation, and recruitment of bereaved family members whose perspectives are essential but commonly absent from studies. Setting and participants NHS Blood and Transplant, Welsh Government and multiple patient and public representatives who served as co-productive partners with the research team. Results Co-productive strategies enabled a smooth passage through four different ethics processes within the 10-week time frame, family member recruitment targets to be surpassed, sharing of routinely collected data on 100% of potential organ donor cases and development of further research capacity and capability in a critically under researched area. Discussion and conclusion Although expensive and time consuming, co-production was effective and added value to research processes and study outcomes.

AB  - Objective To compare sociodemographics, parity and mode of delivery between women diagnosed with vaginismus or localised provoked vestibulodynia (LPV) to women without a diagnosis before first pregnancy. Design Retrospective, population-based register study. Setting Sweden. Sample All women born in Sweden 1973?83 who gave birth for the first time or remained nulliparous during the years 2001?09. Methods Nationally linked registries were used to identify the study population. Women diagnosed with vaginismus or LPV were compared to all other women. Odds ratios for parity and mode of delivery were calculated using multinominal regression analysis and logistic regression. Main outcome measures Parity and mode of delivery. Results Women with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to be unmarried (P = 0.001), unemployed (P = 0.012), have a higher educational level (P < 0.001), a lower body mass index (P < 0.001) and use nicotine during pregnancy (P = 0.008). They were less likely to give birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.56?0.67). Women with vaginismus/LPV more often delivered by caesarean section (P < 0.001) especially for maternal request (adjusted OR 3.48, 95% CI 2.45?4.39). In women having vaginal delivery, those with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to suffer a perineal laceration (adjusted OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.56?2.25). Conclusions Women with vaginismus/LPV are less likely to give birth and those that do are more likely to deliver by caesarean section and have a caesarean section based upon maternal request. Those women delivering vaginally are more likely to suffer perineal laceration. These findings point to the importance of not only addressing sexual function in women with vaginismus/LPV but reproductive function as well.

AB  - Infection is a potentially devastating complication of Breast Reconstruction Surgery. We retrospectively reviewed primary implant based breast reconstruction cases over a six year period at a tertiary Plastic Surgery Unit in Perth to determine both infection and explantation rates, as well as patient and operative factors which may contribute to this risk. First and subsequent reconstructive stages were included in the study with the majority of patients having had their second stage procedure. All cases were followed up for a minimum of six months post operatively. 185 implants were placed into 88 patients with an overall infection rate of 7.6% and an explantation rate of 4.3%. Most (86%) of these infections occurred following the first staged procedure. Factors which may impart a greater risk of infection included smoking, increased Body Mass Index, shorter duration of wound drains and larger implant size. Multiple antibiotic regimes of varying duration were noted, however there was no significant difference between the infected and non-infected groups. Of note, documentation was found to be poor, particularly regarding implant and pocket preparation, drain sites and their subsequent daily drainage and time of removal. Formal protocol and/or a dedicated Breast Reconstruction database may prove useful in further audit and surveillance with the aims of identifying and decreasing patient and operative risks.
