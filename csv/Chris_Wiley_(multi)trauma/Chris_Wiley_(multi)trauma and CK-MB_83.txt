AB  - Allostatic load (AL) is a complex clinical construct, providing a unique window into the cumulative impact of stress. However, due to its inherent complexity, AL presents two major measurement challenges to conventional statistical modeling (the field's dominant methodology): it is comprised of a complex causal network of bioallostatic systems, represented by an even larger set of dynamic biomarkers; and, it is situated within a web of antecedent socioecological systems, linking AL to differences in health outcomes and disparities. To address these challenges, we employed case-based computational modeling (CBM), which allowed us to make four advances: (1) we developed a multisystem, 7-factor (20 biomarker) model of AL's network of allostatic systems; (2) used it to create a catalog of nine different clinical AL profiles (causal pathways); (3) linked each clinical profile to a typology of 23 health outcomes; and (4) explored our results (post hoc) as a function of gender, a key socioecological factor. In terms of highlights, (a) the Healthy clinical profile had few health risks; (b) the pro-inflammatory profile linked to high blood pressure and diabetes; (c) Low Stress Hormones linked to heart disease, TIA/Stroke, diabetes, and circulation problems; and (d) high stress hormones linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Post hoc analyses also found that males were overrepresented on the High Blood Pressure (61.2%), Metabolic Syndrome (63.2%), High Stress Hormones (66.4%), and High Blood Sugar (57.1%); while females were overrepresented on the Healthy (81.9%), Low Stress Hormones (66.3%), and Low Stress Antagonists (stress buffers) (95.4%) profiles. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Co-production of research into public health services has yet to demonstrate tangible benefits. Few studies have reported the impact of co-production on research outcomes. The previous studies of organ donation have identified challenges in engaging with public organizations responsible, gaining ethical approval for sensitive studies with the recently bereaved and difficulty in recruiting bereaved family members who were approached about organ donation. Objective To address these challenges, we designed the first large co-productive observational study to evaluate implementation of a new system of organ donation in Wales. This paper outlines the co-productive strategies that were designed to overcome known methodological challenges and reports what impact they had on resolving these challenges. Design Two-year co-produced study with multiple stakeholders with the specific intention of maximizing engagement with the National Health Service arm in Wales responsible for organ donation, and recruitment of bereaved family members whose perspectives are essential but commonly absent from studies. Setting and participants NHS Blood and Transplant, Welsh Government and multiple patient and public representatives who served as co-productive partners with the research team. Results Co-productive strategies enabled a smooth passage through four different ethics processes within the 10-week time frame, family member recruitment targets to be surpassed, sharing of routinely collected data on 100% of potential organ donor cases and development of further research capacity and capability in a critically under researched area. Discussion and conclusion Although expensive and time consuming, co-production was effective and added value to research processes and study outcomes.

AB  - Summary Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) are the most frequent musculoskeletal pain syndromes. These conditions are often not distinct entities and may overlap. There is significant comorbidity of FMS with other functional somatic syndromes and mental disorders. Clinical assessment should therefore focus on the whole range of physical and somatic distress and associated disability. The clinical diagnosis of FMS and MPS is based on history (typical cluster of symptoms), complete physical examination and the exclusion of other somatic disease as cause of local, regional or widespread pain. There is strong evidence for the efficacy of aerobic exercise, balneotherapy, multidisciplinary therapy (exercise and psychological therapy) and specific pharmacological agents (amitriptyline, duloxetine, fluoxetine, milnacipran, paroxetine, pregabalin) in reducing some of the key symptoms of FMS. There is strong evidence for short term pain relief in MPS by needling and laser therapy; however, the role for these treatments in long term therapy awaits further research.

AB  - Objective To compare sociodemographics, parity and mode of delivery between women diagnosed with vaginismus or localised provoked vestibulodynia (LPV) to women without a diagnosis before first pregnancy. Design Retrospective, population-based register study. Setting Sweden. Sample All women born in Sweden 1973?83 who gave birth for the first time or remained nulliparous during the years 2001?09. Methods Nationally linked registries were used to identify the study population. Women diagnosed with vaginismus or LPV were compared to all other women. Odds ratios for parity and mode of delivery were calculated using multinominal regression analysis and logistic regression. Main outcome measures Parity and mode of delivery. Results Women with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to be unmarried (P = 0.001), unemployed (P = 0.012), have a higher educational level (P < 0.001), a lower body mass index (P < 0.001) and use nicotine during pregnancy (P = 0.008). They were less likely to give birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.56?0.67). Women with vaginismus/LPV more often delivered by caesarean section (P < 0.001) especially for maternal request (adjusted OR 3.48, 95% CI 2.45?4.39). In women having vaginal delivery, those with vaginismus/LPV were more likely to suffer a perineal laceration (adjusted OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.56?2.25). Conclusions Women with vaginismus/LPV are less likely to give birth and those that do are more likely to deliver by caesarean section and have a caesarean section based upon maternal request. Those women delivering vaginally are more likely to suffer perineal laceration. These findings point to the importance of not only addressing sexual function in women with vaginismus/LPV but reproductive function as well.

AB  - Recent studies describe families with both elevated plasma HRG levels and thrombosis. In order to study the possibility that allelic variants of the HRG locus are associated with differences in HRG level, we studied linkage between HRG levels and a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in a Dutch family which was selected on the presence of both thrombosis and elevated plasma HRG levels. No other known risk factors from thrombosis were found in this family. Linkage was calculated between the dinucleotide repeat and the HRG level considering the HRG level as a quantitative phenotype assuming a population prevalence of elevated HRG of 5%. Two classes of HRG levels were defined by a mean and a variance: one class with normal HRG levels and a second class with high HRG levels. Using a mean HRG level of 99% for individuals with a normal HRG level and 145% for individuals with high HRG, a maximum lod score of 4.17 (odds in favour of linkage of 22 000:1) was found at a recombination fraction of 0, indicating linkage. Considering the pedigree, an association was found between the presence of a specific allele (no. 6) of the dinucleotide repeat polymorphism and plasma HRG levels. Family members carrying allele 6 were found to have higher HRG plasma levels compared with family members lacking allele 6 (149% v 109% respectively). We conclude that in this family, linkage is found between the HRG locus and the HRG level, and that a HRG gene coupled to allele 6 of the dinucleotide polymorphism is associated with elevated plasma HRG levels. No evidence was found for a causal relationship between elevated plasma HRG levels and thrombosis in this family.

AB  - Abstract The extent and potential dangerousness of the problem of domestic violence warrants systematic screening and assessment in all mental health settings. Few empirical studies have approached the question of domestic violence with the aim of identifying risk markers, making it impossible to identify a particular characteristic or set of characteristics that can be used to identify individuals at risk for perpetrating or becoming the victims of domestic violence. However, there are a number of factors that have been identified as correlates of domestic violence that may eventually prove useful for identifying individuals at risk, but the extant literature does not provide the empirical support at this time. Because many of these correlates may be brought to the attention of mental health and medical professionals (e.g., depression, substance use/abuse, physical injuries) and given the absence of established risk factors for domestic violence, there is a need for clinicians to systematically assess for violence among all of their patients. By identifying factors that might help clinicians realize that many of their patients are at risk for domestic violence, we hope to encourage them to attend to this potentially dangerous problem. Ongoing assessment in the context of knowledge regarding correlates of domestic violence can provide important information for evaluating risk of a particular violent incident. In addition, we outline strategies for assessing violence and violence risk in both perpetrators and victims in order to assist clinicians in approaching this difficult topic in a clinical setting. A careful assessment of the potential for violence within clients' ongoing relationships is necessary for clinicians to provide appropriate clinical care. ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
