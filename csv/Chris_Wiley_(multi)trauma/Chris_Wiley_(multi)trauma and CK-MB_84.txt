AB  - Reasons for performing study Little exists in the literature regarding the outcome of endoscopically-guided desmotomy of the palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) where injury to the PAL was the only diagnosis. Objectives To report the return to previous level of exercise in horses treated with endoscopically guided PAL resection in which PAL injury was considered to be the primary condition. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Medical records of surgical cases at Donnington Grove Veterinary Surgery between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were cases that had undergone surgical transection of the palmar/plantar annular ligament under general anaesthesia and endoscopic guidance using a No. 12 scalpel blade where annular ligament injury was the only notable finding at surgery. Follow-up was obtained by a telephone questionnaire. Results Twenty-three horses were included in the study. Twenty horses were noted to have restriction to passage of the arthroscope within the digital flexor tendon sheath at the time of surgery. Following the initial 3-month post operative rest period 21 horses were sound. Three horses did not return to their previous level of activity due to unrelated lameness issues and 2 returned to a lower level of competition due to owner preference. Of the remaining 18 horses, 16 returned to their previous level of athletic performance. Two horses had recurrent or persistent lameness associated with the residual PAL desmopathy. Conclusions In this case series surgical treatment of primary PAL injury carries a good prognosis (89% return to previous level of exercise) in contrast to a previously reported study (<50% of horses were able to return to athletic function) [1]. Ethical animal research:?Ethical committee approval not currently required by this congress: retrospective study of clinical records. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a comprehensive, integrated, public health approach to the delivery of services to those at risk for the adverse consequences of alcohol and other drug use, and for those with probable substance use disorders. Research on successful SBIRT implementation has lagged behind studies of efficacy and effectiveness. This paper (1) outlines a conceptual framework, the SBIRT Program Matrix, to guide implementation research and program evaluation and (2) specifies potential implementation outcomes. Methods Overview and narrative description of the SBIRT Program Matrix. Results The SBIRT Program Matrix has five components, each of which includes multiple elements: SBIRT services; performance sites; provider attributes; patient/client populations; and management structure and activities. Implementation outcomes include program adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, costs, penetration, sustainability, service provision and grant compliance. Conclusions The Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment Program Matrix provides a template for identifying, classifying and organizing the naturally occurring commonalities and variations within and across SBIRT programs, and for investigating which variables are associated with implementation success and, ultimately, with treatment outcomes and other impacts.

AB  - Introduction:? The formation of the liver structure at mammal embryogenesis is interconnected by drawing up of venous mains. In parallel to the transformation of the main veins, there is a reduction of the blood formation function and the liver transformation from the primary organ of embryogenesis into the secondary one, but the exception is immaturity and underdeveloped maturity mammals (Smirnova, 1967; Mechtiev, 1968; Bresler, 1993). The purpose of research is to establish morphofunctional criteria of the incompleteness in the blood vessels and in tissue components of the liver in neonatal animals. Material and Methods:? The afferent and efferent liver veins of calves, piglets and puppies at one day of age were investigated. The complex of morphological, roentgenological, ultrasound and statistic methods was used. Results:? It was established that the liver veins in newborn animals portoumbilical (afferent) and caval (efferent) collectors. In 1-day-old calves, the afferent collector is connected with caval way of the large vein flow of the main type. Relative weight of the liver in the calves is 2.31?2.85%, hepatocytes form balks and they are not always oriented radially to the central venuels. There are no seats of haemopoesis. Sonography of the liver and its veins proves inconstancy of the sizes depending on acts of breath. In 1-day-old piglets, many treelike anastomoses follow with the left hepatic vein. Relative weight of the liver in the piglets is 2.27?4.64%. The parenchyma of the organ is spongy with the seats of haemopoesis (0.04 3.61%). In 1-day-old puppies afferent and efferent collectors combine through the venous duct. Additionally, in the abdominal cavity of puppies, there are the vitelline artery (starts from a. mesenterica) and vein (runs to v. porta near the afferent collector), following to the umbilical ring. Relative weight of the liver in the puppies is about 5.18?6.04%. Hepatocytes form the chaotic congestion with haemopoetic points (2.04?7.14%). Conclusion:? Thus, incompleteness of morphology of the liver is shown in preservation of provisional vein structures and tissue components of the embryonic type, which is one of the factors complicating diseases of digestive organs in neonatal animals.

AB  - Abstract The concept of personality disorder (PD) is more relevant in the clinical management of drug users than other approaches to personality assessment. A problem in diagnosis is separating behaviours inherent in the activity of drug misuse from true evidence of PD, especially the anti-social type (ASPD), and rating instruments vary in their ability to do this. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that approximately two-thirds of drug users in treatment have PD, with ASPD the most common. Studies have mainly been in opiate users, while the prevalence of PD may be lower across the range of drugs, and in non-treatment settings. PD has been found to be associated with a range of complications and adverse outcomes in drug use, including psychiatric problems, poor social functioning, dropout from treatment, and increased HIV risk behaviours and infection rates. Outcomes for ASPD individuals in methadone maintenance treatment appear reasonable, however, and it may be that early recourse to such treatment is the most practical option for many PD opiate users, a potential criticism being that this does not directly address the PD problems.

AB  - Summary Parkes SE, Parke S, Manghan DC, Grimer RJ, Davies P, Morland BJ. Fifty years of paediatric malignant bone tumours in the West Midlands, UK, 1957?2006: incidence, treatment and outcome. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010. Malignant bone tumours in the paediatric age group (0?14 years) are uncommon; various aetiological theories exist and few reports of incidence, age and sex distributions have been published. We examined the incidence of childhood malignant bone tumours in one large single region of the UK over an extended period of 50 years. The West Midlands specialist regional children's tumour registry holds data on all malignancies and benign brain tumours in children under 15 years in the West Midlands region, which has a population of around 1 million children. Demographic and clinical data have been abstracted and diagnoses reviewed by a panel of expert pathologists. During the period 1957?2006, 259 cases of malignant paediatric bone tumours were diagnosed. There were 153 osteosarcomas, 78 Ewing sarcomas and 28 other primary bone tumours. The overall age standardised rate was 4.66, with no increase over time, although there was a significant increase in the incidence of Ewing sarcomas in the period 1965?92. Sixty-eight per cent of tumours were in patients over 10 years, whereas the incidence in patients under 10 years showed a non-significant increase. Survival rates increased dramatically post-chemotherapy introduction, with Ewing sarcoma demonstrating better survival overall. This is a large study giving an overview of malignant bone tumours in the childhood population of a single region over an extended period, showing results consistent with national reports. It also examines late effects, which were mostly mobility/orthopaedic, although almost one-fifth of patients had cardiac problems and five went on to develop second malignancies.

Kalaria (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 94?113?Molecular genetics and pathology of hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of several monogenic conditions involving small vessels predisposing to ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and diffuse white matter disease. With emphasis on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we review the molecular pathogenesis of recently characterized disorders including cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) and the Collagen type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1)-related disorders. CADASIL remains the most common hereditary small vessel disease (SVD) caused by >190 different mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a cell-signalling receptor. Mutant NOTCH3 instigates degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles leading to recurrent lacunar infarcts. Mutations in the serine protease HTRA1 gene are associated with CARASIL. Aberrant HTRA1 activity results in increased transforming growth factor-? signalling provoking multiple actions including vascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix synthesis. The RVCL disorders characterized by profound retinopathy are associated with mutations in TREX1, which encodes an abundant 3??5? DNA-specific exonuclease. TREX1 mutations lead to detrimental gain-of-function or insufficient quantities of enzyme. The COL4A1-related disorders are highly variable comprising four major phenotypes with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including SVD with cerebral haemorrhages in children and adults. Mutant COL4A1 likely disrupts the extracellular matrix resulting in fragile vessel walls. The hereditary SVDs albeit with variable phenotypes demonstrate how effects of different defective genes converge to produce the characteristic arteriopathy and microvascular disintegration leading to vascular cognitive impairment.

AB  - Abstract This study aimed to assess ex vivo the accuracy of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), as compared to operative microscope, for evaluating pulp chamber size. A total of forty teeth were extracted for periodontal reasons and a horizontal section was done at the most apical level of the cement?enamel junction. The pulp chamber was photographed using a digital camera connected to an optical microscope. Then, the tooth was scanned with CBCT and the horizontal slide matching the anatomical section of pulp chamber was digitally stored. The pulp chamber section area was measured through image analysis software. The two methods provided similar results, either for monoradicular (P = 0.14) or multiradicular teeth (P = 0.93). Correlation was statistically significant (P < 0.0001), being the coefficient r = 0.89 and 0.94 for monoradicular and multiradicular teeth, respectively. Conclusively, CBCT is suitable for pulp chamber morphology evaluation. However, it has limitations in detecting the anatomical variability of small branches in root canal system.

AB  - Abstract Nicotine use remains highly prevalent with tobacco and e-cigarette products consumed worldwide. However, increasing evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance suggests that nicotine use may alter behavior and neurobiology in subsequent generations. We tested the effects of chronic paternal nicotine exposure in C57BL6/J mice on fear conditioning in F1 and F2 offspring, as well as conditioned fear extinction and spontaneous recovery, nicotine self-administration, hippocampal cholinergic functioning, RNA expression, and DNA methylation in F1 offspring. Paternal nicotine exposure was associated with enhanced contextual and cued fear conditioning and spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear memories. Further, nicotine reinforcement was reduced in nicotine-sired mice, as assessed in a self-administration paradigm. These behavioral phenotypes were coupled with altered response to nicotine, upregulated hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding, reduced evoked hippocampal cholinergic currents, and altered methylation and expression of hippocampal genes related to neural development and plasticity. Gene expression analysis suggests multigenerational effects on broader gene networks potentially involved in neuroplasticity and mental disorders. The changes in fear conditioning similarly suggest phenotypes analogous to anxiety disorders similar to post-traumatic stress.
