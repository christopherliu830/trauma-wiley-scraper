AB  - ABSTRACT The spectrum of pulmonary pathology in the Middle East is as versatile as its civilizations and cultures. In this review, we outline the key challenges confronting pulmonologists in the Middle East. We shed light on the diverse conditions commonly encountered in the region, from the centuries-old illnesses of tuberculosis, to contemporary problems such as lung complications from chemical warfare. We specifically highlighted unique aspects related to respiratory illnesses in the Middle East, for example, climate factors in the desert region, cultural habits, for example, water-pipe smoking and disorders unique to the region, such as Behçet's disease. Pulmonologists are also faced with the consequences of modernization, including large immigrant population and associated social and health issues, rising incidence of obesity and sleep apnoea, and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Tackling these health issues will require an integrated approach involving public health, primary care as well as specialist pulmonology input, taking into consideration the unique cultural and environmental factors to ensure effective management and compliance to medical care.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents in a continuum of severity that spans from incidentally discovered subsegmental PE to massive PE resulting in cardiogenic shock and death. The main cause of death in patients with large PE is right ventricular failure, cardiogenic shock, and refractory hypoxemia. Rapid recanalization of the pulmonary arteries is the ultimate goal of all therapies for acute PE, regardless if pharmacologic, surgical, or catheter-based. All patients presenting with PE should be risk-stratified with the goal of: identifying patients who are at high risk of dying if they do not receive treatment with thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy; and identifying patients who are likely to develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Normotensive patients with acute PE who have any of the following factors at presentation are at increased risk of death and clinical deterioration: RV systolic dysfunction, RV dilatation, elevated plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or evidence of myocardial injury.

AB  - Abstract Objective Online psychological therapies provide a way to connect adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors to evidence-based support. We aimed to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of Recapture life, a six-session group-based online cognitive-behavioural intervention, led by a facilitator, for AYAs in the early post-treatment period. Methods A randomised-controlled trial compared Recapture Life to an online peer-support group control and a waitlist control. Participants could nominate a support person. Acceptability was assessed using study opt-in and retention rates, participant-reported benefits/burdens of participation, and group facilitator burden. We also assessed the feasibility (eg, frequency/impact of technological difficulties) and psychological safety (ie, occurrence of clinically concerning distress) of the program. Results Sixty-one participants took part (45 AYAs, 51.1% female; 19 support people). The opt-in rate was 30%, the enrolment rate was 87%, and 75% of participants took part in ≥5/6 sessions. AYAs reported high benefit and low burden of participation. Overall, 95 online group sessions were conducted; few required rescheduling by group facilitators (3%), but many took place outside of office hours (~90 hours). It took 40 days on average to create online groups, but established weekly sessions commenced quickly (M = 4.0 minutes). Technological difficulties were common but had a low impact on intervention delivery. Although 54% of AYAs returned a clinically concerning distress screen at some point, none reflected acute mental health risks. Conclusions The data largely indicate that Recapture Life is an acceptable, feasible, and safe model of evidence-based psychological support for AYAs during early survivorship, which nevertheless experienced common challenges in online/AYA intervention delivery.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.

AB  - Inappropriate control of the expression and function of the components of the TGF-? signaling pathway has been implicated in impaired wound healing and abnormal scarring. Factors that have been shown to have profound effects on skin homeostasis and wound healing include steroids and oxygen tension. These agents may exert their effects (at least in part) on the skin and wound healing by modulating TGF-? action. To identify steroids and oxygen tension as mediators of TGF-? action in the skin, we examined the effects of hypoxia and glucocorticoids on the levels of active TGF-? and its signaling receptors and on the phosphorylation of its intracellular mediators, Smad 2 and Smad 3, in skin fibroblasts. Our results show that the active TGF-? levels, expression of types I and II receptors and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 are markedly up-regulated by 2?hrs of hypoxia, whereas all these parameters are significantly downregulated by 24?hrs of hypoxia. Dexamethasone treatment of 2?hrs, on the other hand, increased active TGF-? levels and TGF-? receptor expression with little effect on the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. However, dexamethasone treatment of 24?hrs downregulated the active TGF-? levels while maintaining the higher receptor expression, again with no significant effect on phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels. Interestingly, hypoxia had an additive effect on the steroid-induced downregulation of active TGF-? levels while counteracting the steroid-induced upregulation of TGF-? receptor expression. The upregulation at 2?hrs and the downregulation at 24?hrs of the components of TGF-? signaling pathway by hypoxia is consistent with the beneficial effect of initial hypoxia and the deleterious effect of sustained hypoxia, respectively, on wound healing. The synergestic and antagonistic effects of dexamethasone and hypoxia on the TGF-? signaling components emphasize the complex regulation of TGF-? signaling at multiple levels.

AB  - ABSTRACT Long-term administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can induce detrimental side effects such as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) in human. Although inflammation is known to be associated with BRONJ development, the detailed underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-36α is, in part, responsible for the BRONJ development. We found a notably higher level of IL-36α and lower level of collagen in the BRONJ lesions in mice. We also found that IL-36α remarkably suppressed TGF-?-mediated expression of Collα1 and α-Sma via the activation of Erk signaling pathway in mouse gingival mesenchymal stem cells. When IL-36 signaling was abrogated in vivo, development of BRONJ lesions was ameliorated in mice. Taken together, we showed the pathologic role of IL-36α in BRONJ development by inhibiting collagen expression and demonstrated that IL-36α could be a potential marker and a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of BRONJ. ? 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Introduction:? Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an established treatment of chronic wounds. There is limited understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of NPWT. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the biochemical composition of wound fluid collected from chronic pressure ulcer wounds in adults treated with NPWT. Methods:? Nine stage III or IV pressure ulcer patients scheduled for NPWT (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI, San Antonio, TX) were recruited. Their ages ranged between 30 and 99. Concentrations of cytokines (IL-1?, TNF-α), metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in wound fluids were measured at baseline and after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days of continuous NPWT. Results:? At days 1, 3, and 7, TNF-α levels were significantly and comparably lower than baseline (p?<?0.05). MMP- 3 levels significantly decreased from baseline at days 1 and 3 (p?<?0.05) and significantly increased from baseline at day 7 (p?<?0.05) with continuous NPWT. IL-1? levels significantly increased at day 3 (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in TIMP-1 or MMP-2 levels at any of the time points when compared to baseline. Discussions and Conclusions:? A key finding of this study is that with NWPT, reductions in levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, from baseline levels were observed and this effect was sustained for at least 1 week. This, together with effects on IL-1 and MMP-3, may be an indication that the NPWT has a rapid and sustained effect on the inflammatory state of chronic wounds. Further studies are being conducted to expand sample size and to analyze other wound healing indicators.

AB  - Abstract In vivo structural MRI studies in schizophrenia auditory cerebral cortex have reported smaller volumes and, less consistently, have reported altered hemispheric asymmetry of volumes. We used autopsy brains from 19 schizophrenia and 18 nonpsychiatric male subjects to measure the volume asymmetry of the planum temporal (PT). We then used the most recently autopsied 11 schizophrenia and 10 nonpsychiatric brains to measure the widths and fractional volumes of the upper (I?III) and lower (IV?VI) layers. Measurements of whole PT gray matter volumes did not show significant changes in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, laminar volume measurements revealed that the upper layers of the PT comprise a smaller fraction of the total cortex in schizophrenia than in nonpsychiatric brains. Subdivision of the PT showed that this change was especially prominent caudally, beyond Heschl?s gyrus, whereas similar but less pronounced changes were found in the rostral PT and Heschl?s gyrus. Complementary measures of laminar widths showed that the altered fractional volume in the caudal left PT was due mainly to ?8% thinner upper layers. However, the caudal right PT had a different profile, with thicker lower layers and comparatively unchanged upper layers. Thus, in the present study, laminar measurements provided a more sensitive method for detecting changes than measurement of whole PT volumes. Besides findings in schizophrenia, our cortical width measurements revealed normal hemispheric asymmetries consistent with previous reports. In schizophrenia, the thinner upper layers of the caudal PT suggest disrupted corticocortical processing, possibly affecting the multisensory integration and phonetic processing of this region.

AB  - Abstract There are a large number of studies on color and its influence upon human emotions, but there have been only a few studies on the correlation between color and depressive mental disorders. This study used color preference, association, and creation of self-portraits to explore the relationship between color and depressive tendency. In this study, 337 freshman design students participated in the experiment, and the center for epidemiologic studies-depression scale (CES-D) was used to determine the extent of depression in the subjects. After classifying the subject as ?depressive tendency? and ?no depressive tendency,? the semantic differential scale and color association methods were used to explore the subjects' emotional, cognitive, and perceptive responses to Munsell 14 colors. In the final portion of the study, the 233 subjects created a colored self-portrait. The main conclusions found by this study are: (1) when color is used to determine whether subjects have depressive tendency, then the three colors of Yellowish Red, Purple, and Dark Gray are important discriminant variables. (2) those who have depressive tendency (DT) or do not have depressive tendency (NoDT) have similar results in color association, except when viewing dark Gray in association with abstract concepts, wherein DT subjects chose more negative emotional words such as ?hopeless,? ?fear,? and ?depression?; (3) among the 233 self-portraits, the existence of depressive tendency correlated with the colors used on the face in the self-portrait. From the above conclusions, this study finds that there is much association between depressive tendency and color perception. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 34, 84?92, 2009.
