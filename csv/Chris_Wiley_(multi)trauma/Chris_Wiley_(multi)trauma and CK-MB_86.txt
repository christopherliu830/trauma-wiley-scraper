AB  - Study Type ? Diagnostic (exploratory cohort)?Level of Evidence?2b INTRODUCTION To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of transvesical contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as an alternative method for the detection of anastomotic leakage after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) in comparison with the current standard method of conventional retrograde cystography (CG). PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-three patients underwent RRP for histologically proven localized prostate cancer. The vesico-urethral anastomosis was evaluated 8 days after RRP by CG and CEUS. Any peri-anastomotic leakage was assessed and determined in CG and CEUS as follows: no extravasation (EV), small leakage (≤0.5?cm), moderate leakage (>0.5?cm to ≤2?cm), large leakage (>2?cm diameter of EV seen). RESULTS In total, 21 (49%) patients showed a watertight anastomosis. Ten (23%), two (4.7%) and ten (23%) patients showed a small, intermediate and large EV, respectively. In 31 cases (72%) there was 100% agreement of CG and CEUS for detection of no, moderate and large EV, respectively. In nine cases a small and in two cases a moderate EV was categorized as watertight anastomosis by CEUS. Only in one case did CG detect a small EV where a large EV was detected in CEUS. The agreement between both methods was 95% for detecting absence or large leakages. CONCLUSION CEUS is a promising imaging modality that seems to be equivalent to CG for detecting the presence of a large anastomotic leakage that is clinically relevant for postoperative persistence of the indwelling catheter. CEUS could be a cheap and time-saving alternative to the CG without exposure of the patient to radiation.

AB  - The tuberous breast deformity is an uncommon congenital breast anomaly which affects young women unilaterally or bilaterally. It is associated with usually a constriction in the lower pole of the breast as a result of the constricting fibrous ring with hypoplasia of the breast gland and pseudo-herniation of breast tissue into an enlarged areola. Several methods have been suggested to correct this deformity. A retrospective analysis has been undertaken of six consecutive patients with tuberous breast deformity using a dual plane breast augmentation via an inferior peri-areolar approach creating a dual plane pocket and using Marionette sutures to control the lower pectoralis major edge. Surgical release of the constricting lower pole glandular tissue was undertaken with excellent aesthetic results. Either immediate or delayed areolar reduction was carried out if required. Results show excellent expansion of the lower pole with good soft tissue coverage of the implant by the pectoralis major in the supero-medial aspect of the breast. The dual plane pocket combined with lower pole release assists lower pole expansion in a one stage procedure without requiring two stage tissue expansion. The results have been uniformly acceptable and compare favourably with those presented in the literature where other methods were used. The dual plane breast augmentation technique is a simple and reliable way to treat tuberous breast deformity.

AB  - Aim:? To investigate the risk of adult hand eczema and possible influence on later working life in persons with childhood atopic dermatitis. Method:? After reviewing medical records from the school healthcare in Stockholm regarding individuals born 1960?69, 600 individuals where signs of atopic dermatitis were noted (?cases?) and 600 matched controls without eczema or allergic disease (?controls?) were identified. 405 cases and 378 controls answered a questionnaire regarding past and present skin disease, choice of job, exposure at work and possible change of job due to eczema. Results: Hand eczema was more than 3 times more common among cases, 42%, compared to controls, 13%(p?<?0.001). Hand eczema during the past 12 months was reported by 24% of the cases and 9% of the controls (p?<?0.001). The proportion of individuals working in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema was equal between the groups, as well as exposure to water, detergents, chemicals and hand washing. Among the cases 9% reported change of job due to eczema compared to 2% of controls (p?<?0.001) and sick leave 10% compared to 2%(p?<?0.001). Conclusions: Childhood atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for hand eczema. As the proportion of individuals in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema and the exposure was the same in cases and controls measures preventive measures are important to reduce consequences like sick leave and change of job.

AB  - Summary The Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family plays a central role in the generation and regulation of inflammatory responses, in both innate and adaptive immunity. Although the IL-1 molecules are traditionally considered to be classical proinflammatory cytokines, their functions are not restricted to inflammation, and they have also been shown to play a key role in a wide range of additional physiological and pathological functions, including learning modulation, sleep, pregnancy, depression, appetite, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and many others. Since their effect as cytokines and regulators of inflammation is so pleiotropic, any shift of the biological balance between agonistic and antagonistic signals has the potential to cause disease. Here, we consider the genetic influence of interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in the context of susceptibility to human diseases. We review known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-1 genes linked to human diseases, and suggest how exploring biological effects of IL-1 gene cluster polymorphism may lead to new directions in understanding and diagnostic of disease and effective treatment.

AB  - Objectives: To assess whether doxycycline and rifampin have a therapeutic role in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Design: Randomized, triple-blind, controlled trial. Setting: Three tertiary care and two community geriatric clinics in Canada. Participants: One hundred one patients with probable AD and mild to moderate dementia. Intervention: Oral daily doses of doxycycline 200 mg and rifampin 300 mg for 3 months. Measurements: The primary outcome was a change in Standardized Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (SADAScog) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in the SADAScog at 12 months and tests of dysfunctional behavior, depression, and functional status. Results: There was significantly less decline in the SADAScog score at 6 months in the antibiotic group than in the placebo group, (?2.75 points, 95% confidence interval (CI)=?5.28 to ?0.22, P=.034). At 12 months, the difference between groups in the SADAScog was ?4.31 points (95% CI=?9.17?0.56, P=.079). The antibiotic group showed significantly less dysfunctional behavior at 3 months. There was no significant difference in adverse events between groups (P=.34). There were no differences in Chlamydia pneumoniae detection using polymerase chain reaction or antibodies (immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgA) between groups. Conclusion: Therapy with doxycycline and rifampin may have a therapeutic role in patients with mild to moderate AD. The mechanism is unlikely to be due to their effect on C. pneumoniae. More research is needed to investigate these agents.

AB  - Objective:? To assess occupational dermal exposure to permanent hair dyes in hairdressers. Methods:? Dermal exposure was assessed in 31 hairdressers using a previously evaluated method, hand wash sampling with bag rinsing. The measurements were performed in hairdressing saloons during working hours. Hand wash samples were collected from each hand before start of the hair dyeing process, after application of the hair dye and after cutting the newly dyed hair. 13 of the hairdressers did not use gloves during application of the hair dye, and during cutting of the dyed hair no one used gloves. The samples were analysed for aromatic amines and resorcinol using an HPLC-method. Results:? After application of the hair dye PPD (p-phenylenediamine) was found in samples from 1 hairdressers (148?185?nmol/hand), TDA (toluenediamine) in samples from 12 hairdressers (range 10?735?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 22 individuals (range 19?769?nmol/hand). In the samples taken after cutting the dyed hair PPD was found in 2 hairdressers (range 36?358?nmol/hand), TDA in 14 (range 8?361?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 20 (range 10?725?nmol/hand. Conclusion:? Skin exposure to aromatic amines and resorcinol was detected in more than half of the hairdressers after application of hair dye and also after cutting newly dyed hair. To reduce exposure improved skin protection is important.

AB  - No consensus yet exists on how to handle incidental fnd-ings (IFs) in human subjects research. Yet empirical studies document IFs in a wide range of research studies, where IFs are fndings beyond the aims of the study that are of potential health or reproductive importance to the individual research participant. This paper reports recommendations of a two-year project group funded by NIH to study how to manage IFs in genetic and genomic research, as well as imaging research. We conclude that researchers have an obligation to address the possibility of discovering IFs in their protocol and communications with the IRB, and in their consent forms and communications with research participants. Researchers should establish a pathway for handling IFs and communicate that to the IRB and research participants. We recommend a pathway and categorize IFs into those that must be disclosed to research participants, those that may be disclosed, and those that should not be disclosed.

AB  - Introduction? Facial nerve paralysis can be a disabling condition functionally, psychologically and aesthetically. When there has been an acquired proximal injury to the facial nerve in the presence of previously functional facial musculature, such as in acoustic neuroma surgery, neurotisation of the distal facial nerve is an appropriate choice of management. The hypoglossal nerve is most commonly used. However this is not without its limitations, notably subsequent hemilingual atrophy and facial synkinesis. We present an alternative technique of facial reinnervation utilising a motor branch of the trigeminal nerve, the nerve to masseter. We believe this technique has the potential to overcome problems encountered with use of other extra-facial nerves. Methods? Three patients with acquired facial nerve palsy following tumour resection underwent transfer of the ipsilateral masseteric nerve to facial nerve. In two patients the nerve was directly coapted to the trunk of the facial nerve while the third patient had transfer to the buccal branch. Results? By twelve months postoperatively all three patients demonstrated significant improvement in facial muscle tone and symmetry at rest. All patients were able to produce a symmetrical smile with minimal synkinesis. Two of the three patients also had evidence of occasional spontaneous movements. Conclusion? Use of the ipsilateral motor nerve to masseter offers an alternative technique for neurotisation of the facial nerve. The advantages of this technique include ease of dissection, constant and reliable anatomy, powerful innervation of the facial muscles, minimal donor site morbidity and the potential for return of spontaneous facial movements.
