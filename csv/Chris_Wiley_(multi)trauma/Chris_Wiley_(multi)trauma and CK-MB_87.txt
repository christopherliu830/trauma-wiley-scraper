AB  - ABSTRACT Decreased reactive postural responses in elderly adults may place them at increased risk for falls and related injuries. The first step in addressing the high rate of falls in the elderly population is to determine a baseline for postural response in healthy young and healthy elderly individuals. To determine these age-related differences in reactive postural responses during recovery from posterior and anterior perturbations, we used the tether-release method in conjunction with a motion analysis system to evaluate overall movement latencies, overall movement amplitude and velocity, and joint-specific amplitude and velocity in healthy young (n = 10, mean age=25 ± 5) and healthy elderly participants (n = 10, mean age = 67 ± 6). During posterior perturbations, healthy elderly participants had increased recovery time (P = 0.01) and ratio of center of mass to step length (P = 0.013) when compared with young participants. Elderly participants also had decreased step length (P = 0.006), peak COM velocity (P = 0.01), peak knee flexion angle (P = 0.002), and decreased hip (P = 0.005) and knee (P = 0.0005) average angular velocity when compared with young participants. We conclude that these movement deficiencies at the hip and knee limited the length of the recovery step. With this restricted step, elderly participants could not achieve adequate mechanical advantage to counteract the displacement of their COM using a single step. During anterior perturbations, elderly participants did not exhibit any significant differences compared to young participants in overall movement variables. This understanding of postural responses in healthy individuals is clinically relevant to the development of rehabilitation programs for individuals at high fall risk.

AB  - Abstract Background The objective of this work was to determine the effect of both direct force feedback and visual force feedback on the amount of force applied to mitral valve tissue during ex vivo robotics-assisted mitral valve annuloplasty. Methods A force feedback-enabled master?slave surgical system was developed to provide both visual and direct force feedback during robotics-assisted cardiac surgery. This system measured the amount of force applied by novice and expert surgeons to cardiac tissue during ex vivo mitral valve annuloplasty repair. Results The addition of visual (2.16 ± 1.67), direct (1.62 ± 0.86), or both visual and direct force feedback (2.15 ± 1.08) resulted in lower mean maximum force applied to mitral valve tissue while suturing compared with no force feedback (3.34 ± 1.93 N; P < 0.05). Conclusions To achieve better control of interaction forces on cardiac tissue during robotics-assisted mitral valve annuloplasty suturing, force feedback may be required.

AB  - Questionnaire-tools for surveying occupational skin diseases and exposure are needed for comparable epidemiological research, workplace assessments, and evaluation of workplace interventions. The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire Group supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers has developed a standardized questionnaire-tool for surveys on work-related skin diseases and skin exposures to environmental factors. Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) includes two questionnaires designed for separate purposes. NOSQ-2002/short is a 4-page questionnaire for screening skin problems at workplaces. NOSQ-2002/long is an in-depth survey tool for research purposes. The questionnaire covers occupational history, atopic symptoms, self-reported hand or forearm eczema, exacerbating factors, consequences and life impact of dermatoses, self-reported contact urticaria on hands or forearms, skin symptoms, skin tests, exposures, and protective glove use. For the time being, NOSQ-2002 is available in English, Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Icelandic. Further translations are welcomed. The NOSQ-2002 report includes a review of pertinent literature on questionnaire methods for skin disease studies. Questions on work and exposure can be tailored to specific populations or occupational groups, according to the instructions and recommendations given in NOSQ-2002/INFO version of the questionnaire. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaire files can be downloaded from http://www.ami.dk/NOSQ. The Nordic Council of Ministers has the copyright to the NOSQ-2002 questionnaires. Use of the questionnaires is free of charge. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaires and their present and possible future translations cannot be used commercially.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in acute conjunctivitis (non-trachoma) in Australia and to examine the source of transmission. Design: A prospective survey of 400 consecutive patients presenting with acute conjunctivitis to the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Emergency Department, Melbourne, from May to November 1991. Patients identified with chlamydial conjunctivitis during the survey period and in the following two months were assessed for concomitant genital infection. Results: Chlamydia was the causative organism in 2% of patients with acute conjunctivitis. Of 15 patients with chlamydial conjunctivitis, 11 presented with disease in one eye only, and the same number had had symptoms for longer than two weeks. Many had been seen previously by experienced ophthalmologists, yet there were long delays in making a definitive diagnosis. Ten of the 12 adult patients who were assessed had signs of concomitant genital tract infection, although none had past or current genital tract symptoms. Serotyping of chlamydial isolates from the genital tract and eye showed concordance in individual patients. Conclusion: Most cases of ocular chlamydia infection have a genital source. Therefore, it is essential that all patients with chlamydial conjunctivitis and their sexual partners are examined and treated for concomitant genital infection.

AB  - Parasitism is expected to impact host morbidity or mortality, although the fitness costs of parasitism have rarely been quantified for wildlife hosts. Tapeworms in the genus Taenia exploit a variety of vertebrates, including livestock, humans, and geladas (Theropithecus gelada), monkeys endemic to the alpine grasslands of Ethiopia. Despite Taenia's adverse societal and economic impacts, we know little about the prevalence of disease associated with Taenia infection in wildlife or the impacts of this disease on host health, mortality and reproduction. We monitored geladas at Guassa, Ethiopia over a continuous 6½ year period for external evidence (cysts or coenuri) of Taenia-associated disease (coenurosis) and evaluated the impact of coenurosis on host survival and reproduction. We also identified (through genetic and histological analyses) the tapeworms causing coenurosis in wild geladas at Guassa as Taenia serialis. Nearly 1/3 of adult geladas at Guassa possessed ≥1 coenurus at some point in the study. Coenurosis adversely impacted gelada survival and reproduction at Guassa and this impact spanned two generations: adults with coenuri suffered higher mortality than members of their sex without coenuri and offspring of females with coenuri also suffered higher mortality. Coenurosis also negatively affected adult reproduction, lengthening interbirth intervals and reducing the likelihood that males successfully assumed reproductive control over units of females. Our study provides the first empirical evidence that coenurosis increases mortality and reduces fertility in wild nonhuman primate hosts. Our research highlights the value of longitudinal monitoring of individually recognized animals in natural populations for advancing knowledge of parasite-host evolutionary dynamics and offering clues to the etiology and control of infectious disease.

AB  - Abstract The growing resistance against antifungal drugs has renewed the search for alternative treatment modalities, and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a potential candidate. Preliminary findings have demonstrated that dermatophytes and yeasts can be effectively sensitized in vitro and in vivo by administering photosensitizers (PSs) belonging to four chemical groups: phenothiazine dyes, porphyrins and phthalocyanines, as well as aminolevulinic acid, which, while not a PS in itself, is effectively metabolized into protoporphyrin IX. Besides efficacy, PDT has shown other benefits. First, the sensitizers used are highly selective, i.e., fungi can be killed at combinations of drug and light doses much lower than that needed for a similar effect on keratinocytes. Second, all investigated PSs lack genotoxic and mutagenic activity. Finally, the hazard of selection of drug resistant fungal strains has been rarely reported. We review the studies published to date on antifungal applications of PDT, with special focus on yeast, and aim to raise awareness of this area of research, which has the potential to make a significant impact in future treatment of fungal infections.

AB  - Abstract The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Apheresis Applications Committee is charged with a review and categorization of indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (fourth edition), the subcommittee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Fifth ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by refining the category definitions and by adding a grade of recommendation based on widely accepted GRADE system. The concept of a fact sheet was introduced in the Fourth edition and is only slightly modified in this current edition. The fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis. The article consists of 59 fact sheets devoted to each disease entity currently categorized by the ASFA as category I through III. Category IV indications are also listed. J. Clin.
