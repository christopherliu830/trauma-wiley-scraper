AB  - A biofilm is a formation of surface-associated microbial cells that are enclosed in a self produced extracellular polymeric substance matrix. This definition is acceptable for in-vitro research but a clear definition for biofilm-associated diseases has yet to be elucidated. A structural/morphological definition is currently used to define biofilms; additionally, physiological or molecular criteria will allow us to define biofilms in disease infection accurately. Our objective over the past several years has been to characterize and observe bacterial biofilms in wound infections using different wound models. To broaden our current understanding of biofilm morphology in wounds for this study we used epifluorescent and light microscopy to visualize wound pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in a porcine partial thickness infection model. Three experimental animals were used for this study. After animal preparation, partial thickness wounds were created on the backs of 3 animals. Wounds were then inoculated with 106 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and covered for 48 hours to allow bacteria to colonize and infect the wound. Biopsies were obtained from normal skin, wounds before inoculation, wounds at 48 hours and wounds 48 hours after inoculation. Biopsies were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for light microscopy and Calcofluor White and Ethidium Bromide for epifluorescence microscopy. Images obtained using epifluorescent and light microscopy demonstrate that bacteria form aggregates of microcolonies. These structures are representative of bacterial biofilms and support the hypothesis that bacteria live as biofilms in wound infection. Although currently there is no established and accepted definition for biofilm associated diseases, we anticipate that more studies looking into physiological changes of these structures will clarify our current understanding of wound infection and treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the common interest with the sub-specialities of neuro-rehabilitation, neuro-inflammation, neuro-infection, neuro-genetics and neuro-muscular disorders. It broadly divides into four sections: spinal embryology anatomy and physiology; diagnosis of spinal column and cord disorders; specific diseases of the spinal column and spinal cord, and clinical management including medical and surgical approaches. The chapter discusses conditions that have yielded insight into spinal cord maldevelopment. Consideration of the details of Klippel?Feil syndrome, X-linked Kallmann syndrome and congenital hemiplegia pathophysiology has led to a wider appreciation of corticospinal tract development. The chapter focuses on symptoms and physical signs that are of particular value in helping the experienced clinician achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis and an assessment that allows a coherent plan of management to be formulated. Surgical detethering may treat a tethered cord in a patient with progressive neurological symptoms.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the known prominent role of polyunsaturated (phospho)lipids as structural blocks of biomembranes, there is an emerging understanding of another important function of these molecules as a highly diversified signaling language utilized for intra- and extracellular communications. Technological developments in high-resolution mass spectrometry facilitated the development of a new branch of metabolomics, redox lipidomics. Analysis of lipid peroxidation reactions has already identified specific enzymatic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of several unique signals in response to inflammation and regulated cell death programs. Obtaining comprehensive information about millions of signals encoded by oxidized phospholipids, represented by thousands of interactive reactions and pleiotropic (patho)physiological effects, is a daunting task. However, there is still reasonable hope that significant discoveries, of at least some of the important contributors to the overall overwhelmingly complex network of interactions triggered by inflammation, will lead to the discovery of new small molecule regulators and therapeutic modalities. For example, suppression of the production of AA-derived pro-inflammatory mediators, HXA3 and LTB4, by an iPLA2? inhibitor, R-BEL, mitigated injury associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory processes in animals exposed to whole-body irradiation. Further, technological developments promise to make redox lipidomics a powerful approach in the arsenal of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments for personalized medicine of inflammatory diseases and conditions.

AB  - HLA alloimmunization induced by pregnancy, multiple transfusions or transplantation is responsible for some of the serious complications seen in patients receiving blood and blood products. These complications are primarily the result of antibody and antigen triggering an acute immunological reaction, which in some cases can be fatal e.g. TRALI. Some adverse reactions are triggered by HLA antibodies present in the patient whereas others are initiated by antibodies or HLA reactive cells present in the transfused product. The introduction of universal leucodepletion for the prevention of vCJD transmission has resulted in a significant reduction in these reactions by eliminating the main source of alloimmunization, but residual cellular components or platelets are still able to activate the immune system and induce the development of HLA reactive antibodies or T cells. However, the use of more sensitive and specific techniques to detect HLA antibodies and antigens has not only improved the investigation of transfusion reactions and their subsequent diagnosis, but it has also facilitated the implementation of a number of measures such as the use of HLA antibody negative products to further reduce their development.
