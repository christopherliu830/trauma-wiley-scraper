AB  - Introduction Blood is often collected from performing poorly horses to measure blood variables that may indicate a reason. However, intense exercise affects many blood variables and therefore time of sampling can affect the interpretation of results. This study examined the behaviour of blood variables after racing to determine the magnitude of the changes and to determine when it is better to collect samples. Methods Blood was sampled in 17 Standardbred racehorses 3 and 2 days before as well as 2 and 3 days after racing. GGT, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, CK, AST, LDH and cortisol were measured in plasma, and haematocrit, haemoglobin, number of erythrocytes, total white blood cells, granulocytes and lymphocytes were measured in EDTA blood. Parametric data was analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher test; non-parametric data with Friedman test and Wilcoxon test. Results Plasma Ca concentration was lower on day 3 after racing than on day 2 before racing (P<0.01). P concentration and GGT activity were higher at days 2 and 3 after racing compared to before racing (P?=?0.01). Erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin were higher at day 2 after racing than before and 3 days after racing (P<0.01). The other variables were not affected. Conclusions Some slight but significant changes in blood variables have to be taken in account when interpreting biochemical and haematologic variables for poor performance diagnosis in Standardbreds. It seems preferable to take blood samples on the third day after racing than on the second day.

AB  - This is the author's fourth revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately one-third of the previous references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unrefereed article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society, and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this report was to review retrospectively the management of splenic trauma at a major Australian tertiary referral centre (Westmead Hospital) over a 10 year period. Forty-nine patients (0-15 years of age) with documented blunt splenic trauma were identified. The causes of splenic injury were road trauma (73%) and falls (27%). There were 22 minor injuries (Injury severity score [ISS] <16) and 27 severe injuries (ISS ≥16). All nine deaths were related to road trauma (mean ISS = 59). The investigation most commonly used was CT scanning (47%). Peritoneal lavage was performed in six patients (12%). Management involved non-operative care in 29 patients (57%), exploratory laparotomy alone in 5 (10%), splenic salvage in 2 (4%) and splenectomy in 13 (26%). This experience supports the view that non-operative management of splenic injury in haemodynamically stable children is safe and is the preferred treatment. Experienced assessment and meticulous observation is necessary. Laparotomy is indicated if there is continuing haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation. Operative management is aimed at splenic salvage with splenectomy being reserved for uncontrolled haemorrhage.

AB  - We studied secondary chronic headaches (≥?15 days/month for at least 3 months) in a random sample of 30?000 persons aged 30?44 years. They received a mailed questionnaire. Those with self-reported chronic headache within the last month and/or year were invited to an interview and examination by a neurological resident. The criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) were applied. The questionnaire response rate was 71%, and the participation rate of the interview was 74%. Of the 633 participants, 298 had a secondary chronic headache. The 1-year prevalence of secondary chronic headache was 2.14%, i.e. chronic posttraumatic headache 0.21%, chronic headache attributed to whiplash injury 0.17%, post-craniotomy headache 0.02%, medication-overuse headache (MOH) 1.72%, cervicogenic headache 0.17%, headache attributed to chronic rhinosinusitis 0.33% and miscellaneous headaches 0.04%. The majority of those with ICHD-II-defined secondary chronic headache had MOH, while about one-third had other secondary headaches often in combination with MOH.

KW  - Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC)
KW  - Biofilm Meeting
KW  - Local Antibiotics
KW  - Musculoskeletal Infection (MSKI)
AB  - Abstract Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) is broadly used to treat orthopaedic infections based on the rationale that high-dose local delivery is essential to eradicate biofilm-associated bacteria. However, ALBC formulations are empirically based on drug susceptibility from routine laboratory testing, which is known to have limited clinical relevance for biofilms. There are also dosing concerns with non-standardized, surgeon-directed, hand-mixed formulations, which have unknown release kinetics. Based on our knowledge of in vivo biofilms, pathogen virulence, safety issues with non-standardized ALBC formulations, and questions about the cost-effectiveness of ALBC, there is a need to evaluate the evidence for this clinical practice. To this end, thought leaders in the field of musculoskeletal infection (MSKI) met on August 1, 2019 to review and debate published and anecdotal information, which highlighted four major concerns about current ALBC use: 1) substantial lack of Level 1 evidence to demonstrate efficacy; 2) ALBC formulations become subtherapeutic following early release, which risks induction of antibiotic resistance, and exacerbated infection from microbial colonization of the carrier; 3) the absence of standardized formulation protocols, and FDA-approved high-dose ALBC products to use following resection in MSKI treatment; and, 4) absence of a validated assay to determine the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) to predict ALBC efficacy against patient specific microorganisms. Here we describe these concerns in detail, and propose areas in need of research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the influence of supracondylar femoral derotation osteotomy (FDO) on hip abduction muscle force and frontal hip moments in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Method For this retrospective cohort study 79 children (36 females, 43 males; mean age at surgery 11y [SD 3y]; range 4?17y) with bilateral cerebral palsy and preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively documented frontal hip moments who received supracondylar FDO in 134 limbs were included. The control group consisted of eight children (two females, six males; mean age 11y [SD 4y]; range 5?17y) who received single-event multi-level surgery without FDO. Results Hip joint impulse (p<0.001) and the first peak of frontal hip moments (p=0.003) increased, whereas the second peak decreased (p<0.001) from preoperatively to postoperatively. Hip abductor strength improved (p=0.001) from preoperatively to postoperatively. Interpretation Despite the compensatory mechanism, frontal hip moments are decreased preoperatively. Supracondylar FDO results in increased frontal hip moments. Changes in anteversion directly influence hip kinetics, although no direct change of the proximal bony geometry is performed. What this paper adds Internal rotation gait cannot fully restore the frontal hip moment. Supracondylar femoral derotation osteotomy (FDO) influences frontal hip kinetics in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Supracondylar FDO changes the curve progression of frontal hip moments. Supracondylar FDO restores the hip abductor moment arm. Supracondylar FDO leads to an increase in hip abductor muscle force.

AB  - Objective To describe the causes of maternal death in a population-based cohort in six low- and middle-income countries using a standardised, hierarchical, algorithmic cause of death (COD) methodology. Design A population-based, prospective observational study. Setting Seven sites in six low- to middle-income countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guatemala, India (two sites), Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. Population All deaths among pregnant women resident in the study sites from 2014 to December 2016. Methods For women who died, we used a standardised questionnaire to collect clinical data regarding maternal conditions present during pregnancy and delivery. These data were analysed using a computer-based algorithm to assign cause of maternal death based on the International Classification of Disease?Maternal Mortality system (trauma, termination of pregnancy-related, eclampsia, haemorrhage, pregnancy-related infection and medical conditions). We also compared the COD results to healthcare-provider-assigned maternal COD. Main outcome measures Assigned causes of maternal mortality. Results Among 158 205 women, there were 221 maternal deaths. The most common algorithm-assigned maternal COD were obstetric haemorrhage (38.6%), pregnancy-related infection (26.4%) and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (18.2%). Agreement between algorithm-assigned COD and COD assigned by healthcare providers ranged from 75% for haemorrhage to 25% for medical causes coincident to pregnancy. Conclusions The major maternal COD in the Global Network sites were haemorrhage, pregnancy-related infection and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. This system could allow public health programmes in low- and middle-income countries to generate transparent and comparable data for maternal COD across time or regions. Tweetable abstract An algorithmic system for determining maternal cause of death in low-resource settings is described.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - The data collection system described in a previous study has been used to analyze some of the results of treatment of 352 consecutive admissions to the Spinal Injuries Unit, Austin Hospital. The results indicate that the basically conservative approach to the management of the spinal injury, supplemented by surgery in selected cases, appears to be vindicated by the low rate of instability of the spine, and good neurological sequelae of the spinal cord injury. An intermittent catheter regimen for management of the neurogenic bladder has resulted in a low rate of permanent indwelling catheterization on discharge from hospital and a low rate of urinary infections. The survival rate of patients in a well integrated unit, with a multi-disciplinary team, is high. The relatively long periods of hospitalization are justified by the return to the community of a high proportion of independent, healthy, disabled people.

AB  - Abstract Patients with supraventricular tachycardia commonly present to the ED. There is a lack of consensus regarding assessment of these patients. Our aim was to determine the utility of troponin and four other investigations (full blood examination, electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests and chest X-rays) commonly requested for these patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1992?March 2017) were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies (of sample size greater than 10). Our search strategy yielded no randomised controlled trials and seven observational studies with significant statistical heterogeneity among selected studies (I2 87.3%, P < 0.001). Included studies investigated a total of 1155 patients. All studies reported on the utility of troponin testing in this patient population. The pooled proportion of patients investigated with troponin was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.44?0.88). The pooled proportion of positive troponin tests was 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.23?0.41). Only one study reported on the utility of the remaining four investigations with abnormal results as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone 14%, haemoglobin 6%, white cell count 19% and chest X-ray 22%. Investigations are commonly requested for patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardia. Troponin testing is commonly performed with a high proportion of positive findings although these results did not appear to be associated with major adverse cardiac events. Heterogeneity among studies and low levels of evidence precluded conclusions on full blood examinations, electrolyte levels, thyroid testing and utility of chest X-rays in this patient population.

AB  - Abstract Trauma surgery lack, substitute, for the reconstruction of large defects of the long bones. Encouraged by the promising results of bone allotransplantation in animal models, we successfully performed vascularized bone transplantation in humans. Vascularized femoral diaphyses were allogenically transplanted into three patients suffering from chondrosarcoma or post-traumatic osteomyelitis with postoperative immunosuppression. The bone segments were harvested from multi-organ donors and perfused with UW solution. After back-table preparation, the grafts were transplanted into the defect zone. Interlocking devices were used in these operations. Vascular anastomoses were performed in end-to-side technique. The early clinical course of the patients was not free of anatomical, technical, or immunological complications. However, all patients are currently free of malignancy and infection. They are also free of pain and full weight bearing. We conclude that allogenic grafting of vascularized bone segments has the potential to become an alternative for the replacement of large bone defects.

AB  - This article examines 3 contexts in which moderate or severe traumatic brain injury can be approached. The epidemiologic background of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury is presented, with particular attention paid to new findings from the study of a national hospital inpatient database. We review aspects of neuroimaging and how new imaging modalities can reveal fine detail about traumatic brain injury. Finally we examine the current state of neuropathologic evaluation of, and recent developments in, understanding of the neural disruptions that occur following traumatic brain injury, together with cellular reactions to these disruptions.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
