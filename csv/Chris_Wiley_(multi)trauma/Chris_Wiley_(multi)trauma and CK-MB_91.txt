AB  - ObjectiveTo analyse trends in prognostic factors at diagnosis of melanoma to indicate targets for health promotion. MethodsCases of melanoma notified to the South Australian Cancer Registry during 1981-1992 (1361 in situ and 4509 invasive) were analysed by tumour site, histological type, stage, thickness, period of diagnosis and sociodemo-graphic characteristics of the patient. ResultsThe relative probability of being diagnosed with an in-situ, rather than a thin invasive, lesion increased progressively between 1984-1986 and 1990-1992. The relative probability of having an in-situ melanoma diagnosed was: lower among those aged 80 years or more; higher among patients residing in the upper socioeconomic areas of Adelaide; high for lesions on the face; and high for lentigo maligna as opposed to superficial spreading lesions. The relative probability of invasive lesions being diagnosed when more than 1.5 mm thick decreased progressively between the 1981-1983 and 1990-1992 diagnosis periods. The relative probability of thick lesions being diagnosed was higher among older patients and for nodular lesions compared with superficial spreading or lentigo maligna lesions. Facial lesions and those in males tended to be thicker. ConclusionsThere are favourable trends towards earlier detection of melanomas in South Australia, probably reflecting the effect of skin-cancer awareness campaigns. Further campaigns should emphasise early detection in people aged 60 years and over, males and residents of less affluent areas. Early detection of nodular melanomas and invasive lesions of the face also warrants special attention.

AB  - Summary Four studies investigated lawyers' concerns that the narrative style of police interviews with adult rape complainants reduces the impact of this interview as video evidence. Study 1 (N?=?96) compared mock juror perceptions of simulated evidence-in-chief either in traditional short-answer or narrative style and found testimony style was not a predictor of complainant credibility. Studies 2 (N?=?104), 3 (N?=?102) and 4 (N?=?102) examined different variables that change with testimony style?the number of questions asked, overall testimony length and response length. The number of questions asked was the only predictor of complainant credibility; more questions resulted in higher credibility ratings. These findings suggest that lawyers' concerns about narrative style interviewing are unwarranted. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background. To evaluate the diagnostic methods and to elucidate the etiology of intrauterine fetal death. Material and methods. A prospective study was conducted on all intrauterine fetal deaths occurring in Stockholm County in 1998?99. During a 24-month period, 188 cases of intrauterine fetal death with gestational ages of ≥ 22?weeks were investigated in accordance with structured test protocol. All information from antenatal and delivery records as well as all test results were entered in to an Internet-based database for continuous evaluation. Results. A presumptive explanation to the stillbirth was established in 91% of the cases. The most common factors associated with intrauterine fetal death could be identified as infections (24%), placental insufficiency/intrauterine growth restriction (22%), placental abruption (19%), intercurrent maternal conditions (12%), congenital malformations (10%), and umbilical cord complications (9%). Conclusions. A relevant test protocol in cases of intrauterine fetal death reduces the number of unexplained cases to a minimum. An Internet-based register on test results of fetal deaths may enable a continuous evaluation of the diagnostic tools and etiologic factors in an ever-changing panorama. The results from the present study can serve as a base for a case-control study in Sweden.

AB  - Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is the alteration of corneal curvature by photoablation with an excimer laser to eliminate or significantly reduce refractive errors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the literature on this procedure, from the principles and development of the laser system, to its clinical application, Melbourne particularly for the correction of myopia. Both animal and human studies have shown promising results and the procedure is fundamentally superior to radial keratotomy and other refractive surgical procedures; patient response is encouraging, refractive results are reasonably predictable and serious adverse effects on the cornea are infrequent. However, a number of concerns remain, including stromal haze and opacification, regression and instability of the refractive effect, decreased visual performance, due to light scattering and an imperfect refracting surface, and potential long-term side-effects. Optometrists should be well informed regarding PRK, so as to provide expert, independent advice for prospective patients, as well as pre- and post-operative follow- up care.

AB  - Abstract Objective Posthypoxic myoclonus (PHM) in the first few days after resuscitation can be divided clinically into generalized and focal (uni- and multifocal) subtypes. The former is associated with a subcortical origin and poor prognosis in patients with postanoxic encephalopathy (PAE), and the latter with a cortical origin and better prognosis. However, use of PHM as prognosticator in PAE is hampered by the modest objectivity in its clinical assessment. Therefore, we aimed to obtain the anatomical origin of PHM with use of neurophysiological investigations, and relate these to its clinical presentation. Methods This study included 20 patients (56 ± 18 y/o, 68% M, 2 survived, 1 excluded) with EEG-EMG-video recording. Three neurologists classified PHM into generalized or focal PHM. Anatomical origin (cortical/subcortical) was assessed with basic and advanced neurophysiology (Jerk-Locked Back Averaging, coherence analysis). Results Clinically assessed origin of PHM did not match the result obtained with neurophysiology: cortical PHM was more likely present in generalized than in focal PHM. In addition, some cases demonstrated co-occurrence of cortical and subcortical myoclonus. Patients that recovered from PAE had cortical myoclonus (1 generalized, 1 focal). Interpretation Hypoxic damage to variable cortical and subcortical areas in the brain may lead to mixed and varying clinical manifestations of myoclonus that differ of those patients with myoclonus generally encountered in the outpatient clinic. The current clinical classification of PHM is not adequately refined to play a pivotal role in guiding treatment decisions to withdraw care. Our neurophysiological characterization of PHM provides specific parameters to be used in designing future comprehensive studies addressing the potential role of PHM as prognosticator in PAE.

AB  - Objective:? We have reported that intimal hyperplasia, which is the pathologic change of the radial artery, is associated with early failure of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in hemodialysis (HD) patients (Am J Kidney Dis, 41:422?428, 2003). Intima-media thickness (IMT), which represents the whole thickness of arterial wall, can be easily measured by ultrasonography, unlike intima thickness. This study was performed to investigate the impact of IMT of radial artery on early failure of AVF in HD patients. Methods:?Ninety HD patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation were included in this study. The AVF was constructed in an end vein?to?side artery fashion at the wrist by one vascular surgeon. During the operation, 10-mm long partial arterial walls were removed with elliptical form for microscopic analysis. Specimens were stained with trichrome and examined by a pathologist blinded to the clinical data. AVF patency was prospectively followed up for 1 year after the operation. Results:?Mean age of the patients was 56?±?13 years and the number of females was 44 (48.9%). Mean IMT was 430?± 132??m (133?760??m). Of the total 90 patients, 31 patients (34.4%) had AVF failure within 1 year after the operation. Mean IMT was higher in the failed group (n?=?31) than in patent group (n?=?59)(486?±?130??m vs. 330?±?178??m, p?=?0.004). Using a threshold of 500??m of IMT, AVF patency rate was compared between these two groups using Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test. The AVF patency rate within 1 year after the operation was higher in patients with IMT?≥?500??m (n?=?26) than in patients with IMT?<?500??m (n?=?64)(p?<?0.001). The patients with IMT?≥?500??m were older and had higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, compared to the patients with IMT?<?500??m. There was no difference in sex, smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol and albumin levels between the two groups. Conclusion:?Our data suggest that increased intima-media thickness of radial artery is associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients.
