AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) JCA Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizating indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Sixth Edition of the ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by consistently applying the category and GRADE system definitions, but eliminating the ?level of evidence? criteria (from the University HealthCare Consortium) utilized in prior editions given redundancy between GRADE and University HealthCare Consortium systems. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was utilized in the Fourth and Fifth Editions, has been largely maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. This article consists of 78 fact sheets (increased from 2010) for therapeutic indications in ASFA categories I through IV, with many diseases categorized having multiple clinical presentations/situations which are individually graded and categorized.

AB  - Abstract The authors give an overview of the rationale for using alcohol pricing as a public health tool. They outline the background to government alcohol strategies, review recent moves by the government to acknowledge the problem, and contrast their proposed policy to the evidence base that underpins the advice of health professionals advocating for an urgent minimum pricing policy for alcohol.

AB  - Objective To determine the pressure and traction forces exerted on a model fetal head by the BD Odon Device, forceps and Kiwi ventouse during simulated births. Design Simulation study. Setting Simulated operative vaginal birth. Population or sample Eighty-four simulated operative vaginal births. Methods A bespoke fetal mannequin with pressure sensors around the head and strain gauge across the neck was used to investigate pressure applied over the head, and traction across the neck during 84 simulated births using the BD Odon Device, non-rotational forceps and Kiwi ventouse. Main outcome measures Peak pressure on the fetal face and lateral aspects of the head during correct use of the BD Odon Device and forceps. Peak pressure on orbits and neck during misplacement of the BD Odon Device and forceps. Peak traction force generated until instrument failure using the BD Odon Device, forceps and Kiwi ventouse. Results When correctly sited and using 80 kPa inflation pressure on the cuff, the BD Odon Device generated a lower peak pressure on the fetal head than forceps (83 versus 146 kPa). When instruments were purposefully misplaced over the orbits, the BD Odon Device generated a lower peak pressure on the orbits compared with forceps (70 versus 123 kPa). When purposefully misplaced over the neck, the BD Odon Device, compared with forceps, generated a greater peak pressure on the anterio-lateral aspect of the neck (56 versus 17 kPa) and a lower peak pressure on the posterior aspect of the neck (76 versus 93 kPa) than forceps. In cases of true cephalic disproportion, the BD Odon Device ?popped-off? at a lower traction force than did forceps (208 versus 270 N). Conclusions In simulated assisted vaginal birth with correctly placed instruments, the peak pressure exerted on the fetal head by a BD Odon Device is lower than the pressure exerted by non-rotational forceps. In cases in which delivery of the fetal head is not possible due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion, lower traction forces could be applied using the BD Odon Device than with forceps before the procedure was abandoned due to device failure. Tweetable abstract BD Odon Device exerts less pressure on a model fetal head than forceps, but more than Kiwi ventouse.

AB  - Background: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a major human congenital heart defect that results in single ventricle physiology and high mortality. Clinical data indicate that intracardiac blood flow patterns during cardiac morphogenesis are a significant etiology. We used the left atrial ligation (LAL) model in the chick embryo to test the hypothesis that LAL immediately alters intracardiac flow streams and the biomechanical environment, preceding morphologic and structural defects observed in HLHS. Results: Using fluorescent dye injections, we found that intracardiac flow patterns from the right common cardinal vein, right vitelline vein, and left vitelline vein were altered immediately following LAL. Furthermore, we quantified a significant ventral shift of the right common cardinal and right vitelline vein flow streams. We developed an in silico model of LAL, which revealed that wall shear stress was reduced at the left atrioventricular canal and left side of the common ventricle. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that intracardiac flow patterns change immediately following LAL, supporting the role of hemodynamics in the progression of HLHS. Sites of reduced WSS revealed by computational modeling are commonly affected in HLHS, suggesting that changes in the biomechanical environment may lead to abnormal growth and remodeling of left heart structures.

AB  - Purpose? The treatment of craniosynostosis has continued to evolve over the last few decades. Techniques from linear strip craniectomies through osteotomies, orbital bandeau fashioning, craniotomies and immediate calvarial remodelling to the latest spring-mediated dynamic reshaping have been used to achieve ongoing improvements in facial and skull shape. This paper discusses the timing, long-term results and recent advances of surgical techniques based on our experience. We also aim to identify factors which could affect the outcome. Methodology? We performed a retrospective analysis of 67 patients surgically treated for craniosynostosis over a 24 year period in Christchurch Hospital. The craniofacial team consisted of a Plastic Surgeon and a Neurosurgeon. We analyzed results based on type of sutural involvement, cosmetic outcome, complications, blood transfusions and surgical technique. Results? There were 20 females and 47 males. 62 had a non-syndromic craniosynostosis and 5 had a syndromic craniosynostosis. The non-syndromic cases comprised: sagittal (n?=?30), metopic (n?=?17), unilateral coronal (n?=?9), bicoronal (n?=?2) and multiple (N?=?4). The 5 syndromic cases comprised: Crouzon?s/bilat coronal (n?=?2), Apert?s (n?=?2, 1 bilateral coronal, 1 unilateral coronal)) and Klippel-Feil/unilateral lambdoid (n?=?1). The median age at first operation was 8 months. Complications and outcomes will be presented and our conclusions will highlight the evolving surgical techniques and that a multidisciplinary approach (including neurosurgeon, plastic surgeons and paediatric team) provides the best outcome for children with craniosynostosis.
