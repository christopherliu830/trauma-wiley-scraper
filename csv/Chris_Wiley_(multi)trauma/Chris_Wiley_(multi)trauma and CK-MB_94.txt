AB  - Objective To determine the pressure and traction forces exerted on a model fetal head by the BD Odon Device, forceps and Kiwi ventouse during simulated births. Design Simulation study. Setting Simulated operative vaginal birth. Population or sample Eighty-four simulated operative vaginal births. Methods A bespoke fetal mannequin with pressure sensors around the head and strain gauge across the neck was used to investigate pressure applied over the head, and traction across the neck during 84 simulated births using the BD Odon Device, non-rotational forceps and Kiwi ventouse. Main outcome measures Peak pressure on the fetal face and lateral aspects of the head during correct use of the BD Odon Device and forceps. Peak pressure on orbits and neck during misplacement of the BD Odon Device and forceps. Peak traction force generated until instrument failure using the BD Odon Device, forceps and Kiwi ventouse. Results When correctly sited and using 80 kPa inflation pressure on the cuff, the BD Odon Device generated a lower peak pressure on the fetal head than forceps (83 versus 146 kPa). When instruments were purposefully misplaced over the orbits, the BD Odon Device generated a lower peak pressure on the orbits compared with forceps (70 versus 123 kPa). When purposefully misplaced over the neck, the BD Odon Device, compared with forceps, generated a greater peak pressure on the anterio-lateral aspect of the neck (56 versus 17 kPa) and a lower peak pressure on the posterior aspect of the neck (76 versus 93 kPa) than forceps. In cases of true cephalic disproportion, the BD Odon Device ?popped-off? at a lower traction force than did forceps (208 versus 270 N). Conclusions In simulated assisted vaginal birth with correctly placed instruments, the peak pressure exerted on the fetal head by a BD Odon Device is lower than the pressure exerted by non-rotational forceps. In cases in which delivery of the fetal head is not possible due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion, lower traction forces could be applied using the BD Odon Device than with forceps before the procedure was abandoned due to device failure. Tweetable abstract BD Odon Device exerts less pressure on a model fetal head than forceps, but more than Kiwi ventouse.

AB  - Abstract Background Hypotension following orthopaedic surgery has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Rapid response teams (RRT) review patients on hospital wards with hypotension. Aim To evaluate the epidemiology of hypotensive RRT activations in adult orthopaedic patients to identify contributing factors and areas for future quality improvement. Methods Timing of RRT activations, presumed causes of hypotension and associated treatments were assessed. Results Among 963 RRT activations in 605 patients over 3 years, the first calls of 226 of 605 patients were due to hypotension, and 213 (94.2%) of 226 had sufficient data for analysis. The median age was 79 (interquartile range 66?87) years; 58 (27.2%) were male, and comorbidities were common. Most (68%) surgery was emergent, and 75.1% received intraoperative vasopressors for hypotension. Most activations occurred within 24 h of surgery, and hypovolaemia, infection and arrhythmias were common presumed causes. Fluid boluses occurred in 173 (81.2%), and the time between surgery and RRT activation was 10 (4.0?26.5) h. in cases where fluid boluses were given, compared with 33 (15.5?61.5) h. where they were not (P < 0.001). Blood transfusion (30, 14.1%) and withholding of medications were also common. Hospital mortality was 8.5% (18), and 13.6% (29) were admitted to critical care at some stage. In-hospital death was associated with older age, functional dependence, arrhythmia and presumed infection. Conclusions Hypotension-related RRT calls in orthopaedic patients are common. Future interventional studies might focus on perioperative fluid therapy and vaso-active medications, as well as withholding of anti-hypertensive medications preoperatively.

AB  - Apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be involved in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases. We have tested an orally active anti-apoptotic molecule (CGP 3466B) that binds to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in an animal model with motoneuron degeneration, i.e. a mouse mutant with progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn). In pmn/pmn mice, CGP 3466B was administered orally (10?100?nmol?kg?1) at the onset of the clinical symptoms (2 weeks after birth). CGP 3466B slowed disease progression as determined by a 57% increase in life-span, preservation of body weight and motor performance. This improvement was accompanied by a decreased loss of motoneurons and motoneuron fibres as well as an increase in retrograde transport. Electron microscopic analysis showed that CGP 3466B protects mitochondria which appear to be selectively disrupted in the motoneurons of pmn/pmn mice. The data support evaluation of CGP 3466B as a potential treatment for motor neuron disease. British Journal of Pharmacology (2000) 131, 721?728; doi:10.1038/sj.bjp.0703633

AB  - ABSTRACT Tibiotalar arthrodesis is commonly used to treat end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. Post-operative impairments are often attributed to limited ankle motion. However, whether muscular deficits also exist, thereby potentially contributing to impairments, is unknown. This study aimed to identify post-operative deficits in ankle musculature by examining range of motion, strength (maximum isometric ankle joint torque), and leg composition (cross-sectional area of individual tissue types: bone, subcutaneous adipose, intramuscular adipose, muscle). Ten individuals with unilateral tibiotalar arthrodesis participated. Paired t-tests (p?<?0.05) identified differences between the fused and contralateral, control limb. The results indicate that individuals with tibiotalar arthrodesis have profound losses of range of motion and strength. Across participants, range of motion in the fused limb was 53.5?±?11.7%, 66.8?±?6.3%, 38.2?±?18.7%, 37.8?±?13.6% less than the control for dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion, respectively. The largest strength deficit was in dorsiflexion, with the fused limb producing 47.2?±?9.4% less torque than the control. The quantity and quality of muscle tissue was also negatively affected in individuals following tibiotalar arthrodesis. The total cross-sectional area of the fused limb was 11.4?±?5.4% smaller than the control limb. This change was primarily due to the 16.1?±?6.7% decrease in muscle cross-sectional area. However, intramuscular adipose was significantly increased. Although the posterior compartment demonstrated a significant decrease in cross-sectional area, when accounting for differences in total cross-sectional area, the relative sizes of the four muscle compartments were consistent between limbs. This cross-sectional study motivates longitudinal research examining muscular deficits and whether these deficits are reversible with exercise and rehabilitation. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - The prognosis of chronic toxic encephalopathy in former house painters was examined in a prospective study with a two-year observation period. Twenty-six patients, who at the initial examination had cerebral atrophy and/or intellectual impairment, were selected for the follow-up study. No competitive etiological factors (including alcohol) to the encephalopathy were suspected. During the two-year follow-up interval these patients were not professionally exposed to organic solvents. At the follow-up examination neurological, biochemical, neuropsychological, and neuroradiological parameters were reassessed and compared to the original findings. Generally the condition was unchanged. Slight improvements with regard to headache and dizziness were reported by some. However, the neurological status, the neuropsychological impairment, and the cerebral atrophy, did not change significantly. In three patients further deterioration was observed. It is argued that our patients suffered from a brain disorder different from presenile dementia of the Pick-Alzheimer type. Other alternative etiological entities were also excluded. Our findings indicate that long-term exposure to organic solvents may lead to a chronic brain syndrome. Once intellectual impairment and/or cerebral atrophy has developed, reversibility is not observed. Nor is further progression to be expected if exposure is stopped. Occupational exposure to organic solvents should be maximally restricted as it represents a risk of inducing invalidating brain syndromes.
