AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Patients with musculoskeletal tumors can face large bone deficiency, deformity, and nonunion. Distraction osteogenesis via the Ilizarov method may be useful for reconstruction of these deficiencies allowing limb preservation and optimizing function. Methods We reviewed 20 patients with a range of musculoskeletal tumors necessitating surgical treatment. The group included 9 females and 11 males with a mean age of 22.6 (8?58) years at a mean follow up of 81.7 (26?131) months. The mean bone deficiency was 7.9 (1.2?18.0)?cm. Results The mean lengthening achieved was 7.1 (3.5?18.0)?cm over an EFI of 33.5 (range, 9.5?58.3)?days/cm. This treatment resulted in 10 excellent and 3 good ASAMI bone scores, 10 excellent and 3 good ASAMI function scores, a mean lower extremity MSTS score of 93% and a mean upper extremity MSTS score of 87%. Treatment resulted in 2 complications, 18 obstacles, and 6 problems. Conclusion The Ilizarov method is an effective technique for limb reconstruction of bone tumors, although extended time in external fixation is required. Since no one in this group received simultaneous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, we cannot comment on use of the Ilizarov method with these treatments. Further use and clinical follow-up is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Background An OSCE was used to measure the ability of a cohort of residents to manage oncologic problems. Methods Nine oncologic clinical problems were presented to 56 surgical residents. Each problem contained a 5-minute data-gathering period (DGP) and a 5-minute data-interpretation period (DIP). A performance score was determined for each resident for each problem. Reliability was estimated by coefficient α; validity, by the construct of experience. Wilks's ? criterion was used to determine whether training level could be identified by OSCE performance. Results The DGP reliability was 0.80; the DIP, 0.49. Senior residents performed significantly better than junior residents (P = 0.0001), who performed significantly better than interns (P = 0.0009). Of the residents, 62% were competent on the DGP, but only 21% on the DIP. Important deficits in knowledge and clinical skills were apparent at all levels of training. Conclusion The education and evaluation of residents in oncology need improvement. J. Surg. Oncol. 64:135?142. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Study Type ? Diagnostic (exploratory cohort)?Level of Evidence?2b INTRODUCTION To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of transvesical contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as an alternative method for the detection of anastomotic leakage after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) in comparison with the current standard method of conventional retrograde cystography (CG). PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-three patients underwent RRP for histologically proven localized prostate cancer. The vesico-urethral anastomosis was evaluated 8 days after RRP by CG and CEUS. Any peri-anastomotic leakage was assessed and determined in CG and CEUS as follows: no extravasation (EV), small leakage (≤0.5?cm), moderate leakage (>0.5?cm to ≤2?cm), large leakage (>2?cm diameter of EV seen). RESULTS In total, 21 (49%) patients showed a watertight anastomosis. Ten (23%), two (4.7%) and ten (23%) patients showed a small, intermediate and large EV, respectively. In 31 cases (72%) there was 100% agreement of CG and CEUS for detection of no, moderate and large EV, respectively. In nine cases a small and in two cases a moderate EV was categorized as watertight anastomosis by CEUS. Only in one case did CG detect a small EV where a large EV was detected in CEUS. The agreement between both methods was 95% for detecting absence or large leakages. CONCLUSION CEUS is a promising imaging modality that seems to be equivalent to CG for detecting the presence of a large anastomotic leakage that is clinically relevant for postoperative persistence of the indwelling catheter. CEUS could be a cheap and time-saving alternative to the CG without exposure of the patient to radiation.

AB  - Abstract? Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the early postoperative outcome in patients undergoing ??-anastomosis? construction, a technique that permits revascularization of coronary bifurcations employing a single arterial graft. Materials and methods: Between January 2000 and March 2002, ?-anastomosis was employed in 12 patients. The main indication for ?-anastomosis construction was the presence of a significant stenotic lesion involving one of the coronary tree's bifurcations, presenting a relevant secondary branch. There were ten men and two women, with a mean age of 55.4 ± 4.3 years (range 48 to 66). The ?-anastomosis was constructed employing a single arterial graft (internal mammary artery or radial artery) effectively tailored to obtain a bi-petal shape and anastomosed to the coronary bifurcation according to a three-foliate anastomosis. All patients underwent postoperative coronary angiography. Results: There were no hospital deaths, neither ECG nor enzymatic alterations. One patient was reoperated for excessive bleeding. The mean aortic cross-clamp time and duration of CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass) were 64 ± 18 minutes (range 45 to 108) and 89 ± 26 minutes (range 67 to 135), respectively. Thirty-four arterial conduits were used: 12 LIMA, 12 RIMA, and 10 RA. Twelve ?-anastomoses were constructed, in six patients employing the RA, and in six other patients employing one of the internal mammary arteries (IMAs). Five left Y-grafts between the in situ LIMA and free LIMA graft and one right Y-graft between the RIMA and RA were constructed. The mean ICU stay was 14.4 ± 5.7 hours. The postoperative coronary angiography revealed a good patency of the ??-anastomosis.? Transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography (TTECD) demonstrated a normal IMAs flow pattern in all cases. Conclusions: We define the reported configuration as a possible surgical alternative to achieve total arterial myocardial revascularization in multi-vessels patients, associated with excellent postoperative outcome that should be part of the coronary surgical armamentarium.

AB  - Abstract Cancer survivorship is best viewed as a process that continues across the life span. Appraisals of cancer change over time and may not be explicit until long after treatment completion. The current study, using the Lazarus and Folkman (1984) stress-appraisal-coping framework, explored factors related to both a stressful and an irrelevant appraisal of the cancer experience by older long-term survivors. Hierarchical regression analysis investigated the individual and cumulative effects of person factors (survivors' demographic characteristics, beliefs about the effect of cancer on family members) and situation factors (characteristics of cancer) on survivors' appraisals that cancer was a stressful life event. The strongest correlates of the stress appraisal were person factors. A more stressful appraisal was associated with: (1) the belief that diagnosis/treatment caused greater family distress, (2) being younger, and (3) being White. The irrelevant appraisal had a marginally significant correlate in bivariate analysis and was not included in regression analysis. Implications for health-care professionals and patient/family interventions are discussed. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Drawing on dozens of in-depth life-history interviews and extensive participant observation in mosques and community centers, this article probes the interaction of religion and nationalism in the formation of individual identities within the Palestinian immigrant community in Chicago, Illinois since the late 1980s. The analysis focuses on three individuals who represent distinct approaches to negotiating the relationship of religion and nation. The first approach is context-adaptive, responding and accommodating to the diverging moral assumptions that underlie the ethos of religious and secular spaces. The second approach entails a transition from secular-nationalism to a type of Islamic nationalism or even Islamic secularism. The third approach resists both forms of nationalism, seeking a transcendent Islam in which ethnicity and nation recede within a new religious humanism. The core argument throughout is that processes of religious return, often analyzed in relation to transnational trends, take diverse and indeterminate forms. This fact results from the shaping effects of a range of ?secular? factors ? gender, generation, class, family dynamics, intercommunal interactions, traumatic events ? which register within the specific local settings of ordinary life.

AB  - Aim:? To investigate the risk of adult hand eczema and possible influence on later working life in persons with childhood atopic dermatitis. Method:? After reviewing medical records from the school healthcare in Stockholm regarding individuals born 1960?69, 600 individuals where signs of atopic dermatitis were noted (?cases?) and 600 matched controls without eczema or allergic disease (?controls?) were identified. 405 cases and 378 controls answered a questionnaire regarding past and present skin disease, choice of job, exposure at work and possible change of job due to eczema. Results: Hand eczema was more than 3 times more common among cases, 42%, compared to controls, 13%(p?<?0.001). Hand eczema during the past 12 months was reported by 24% of the cases and 9% of the controls (p?<?0.001). The proportion of individuals working in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema was equal between the groups, as well as exposure to water, detergents, chemicals and hand washing. Among the cases 9% reported change of job due to eczema compared to 2% of controls (p?<?0.001) and sick leave 10% compared to 2%(p?<?0.001). Conclusions: Childhood atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for hand eczema. As the proportion of individuals in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema and the exposure was the same in cases and controls measures preventive measures are important to reduce consequences like sick leave and change of job.
