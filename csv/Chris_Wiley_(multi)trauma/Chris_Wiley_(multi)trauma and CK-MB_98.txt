AB  - Abstract Background Suicide in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) accounts for 75% of the world's burden of suicide mortality and is the leading single cause of death among Nepali reproductive age women. To advance treatment for suicidal behaviors in LMICs, a single-case experimental design (SCED) was conducted of a culturally adapted Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills intervention for Nepali populations (DBT-N). Method Ten Nepali women with histories of suicidality participated in the 10-session intervention. Outcomes of emotion regulation, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, resilience, and coping skills use were measured at multiple time points pre-intervention, during, and at follow-up. Qualitative interviewing assessed DBT-N's feasibility and acceptability. Results Participants showed improvements in emotion regulation over the course of treatment, which were associated with increased skills use. Rapid, sustained reductions in suicidal ideation and improvements in resilience were observed after DBT-N initiation. Conclusion This SCED supports conducting further evaluation of DBT-N through controlled trials with emotion regulation as a target mechanism of action for reducing suicidal behaviors in LMICs.

AB  - Abstract A high-resolution elastically stretchable microelectrode array (SMEA) for interfacing with neural tissue is described. The SMEA consists of an elastomeric substrate, such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), elastically stretchable gold conductors, and an electrically insulating encapsulating layer in which contact holes are opened. We demonstrate the feasibility of producing contact holes with 40 ?m ? 40 ?m openings, show why the adhesion of the encapsulation layer to the substrate is weakened during contact hole fabrication, and provide remedies. These improvements result in greatly increased fabrication yield and reproducibility. An SMEA with 28 microelectrodes was fabricated. The contact holes (100 ?m ? 100 ?m) in the encapsulation layer are only ?10% the size of the previous generation, allowing a larger number of microelectrodes per unit area, thus affording the capability to interface with a smaller neural population per electrode. This new SMEA is used to record spontaneous and evoked activity in organotypic hippocampal tissue slices at 0% strain before stretching, at 5% and 10% equibiaxial strain, and again at 0% strain after relaxation. Stimulus?response curves at each strain level are measured. The SMEA shows excellent biocompatibility for at least two weeks.

AB  - Abstract Background Managing distress has become crucial in optimized cancer care. Psychoeducation using tablet PCs has potential as a novel intervention to reduce distress in cancer patients. We examined the benefit of a single-session psychoeducation using a tablet PC during chemotherapy. Methods Thirty-six cancer patients with significant levels of distress, as determined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), enrolled from the chemotherapy unit in Seoul National University Cancer Hospital. Participants were quasi-randomized into either the intervention (n?=?19) or control (n?=?17) group. Twenty-minute-long psychoeducation on distress management was provided via tablet PCs during chemotherapy infusion. HADS, Short-form 8 Health Survey, MD Anderson Symptom Inventory, Insomnia Severity Index, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were administered at baseline and 3 weeks later. The use of psychosocial services was reviewed 6 months later. Results Compared with controls, the intervention group showed a superior 3-week clinical trajectory regarding the score changes of the HADS depression subscale (U?=?69.0; p?=?0.006), mental component summary score of the Short-form 8 Health Survey (U?=?75.5; p?=?0.011), Impact of Event Scale-Revised avoidance subscale (U?=?89.0; p?=?0.036), and Insomnia Severity Index total score (U?=?82.5; p?=?0.021). There was no significant between-group difference regarding the use of psychosocial services after 6 months. Conclusions A tablet PC-based psychoeducation during chemotherapy infusion could be an effective intervention on managing depression, sleep disturbance, and quality of life in cancer patients suffering from distress.

AB  - A biofilm is a formation of surface-associated microbial cells that are enclosed in a self produced extracellular polymeric substance matrix. This definition is acceptable for in-vitro research but a clear definition for biofilm-associated diseases has yet to be elucidated. A structural/morphological definition is currently used to define biofilms; additionally, physiological or molecular criteria will allow us to define biofilms in disease infection accurately. Our objective over the past several years has been to characterize and observe bacterial biofilms in wound infections using different wound models. To broaden our current understanding of biofilm morphology in wounds for this study we used epifluorescent and light microscopy to visualize wound pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in a porcine partial thickness infection model. Three experimental animals were used for this study. After animal preparation, partial thickness wounds were created on the backs of 3 animals. Wounds were then inoculated with 106 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and covered for 48 hours to allow bacteria to colonize and infect the wound. Biopsies were obtained from normal skin, wounds before inoculation, wounds at 48 hours and wounds 48 hours after inoculation. Biopsies were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for light microscopy and Calcofluor White and Ethidium Bromide for epifluorescence microscopy. Images obtained using epifluorescent and light microscopy demonstrate that bacteria form aggregates of microcolonies. These structures are representative of bacterial biofilms and support the hypothesis that bacteria live as biofilms in wound infection. Although currently there is no established and accepted definition for biofilm associated diseases, we anticipate that more studies looking into physiological changes of these structures will clarify our current understanding of wound infection and treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the common interest with the sub-specialities of neuro-rehabilitation, neuro-inflammation, neuro-infection, neuro-genetics and neuro-muscular disorders. It broadly divides into four sections: spinal embryology anatomy and physiology; diagnosis of spinal column and cord disorders; specific diseases of the spinal column and spinal cord, and clinical management including medical and surgical approaches. The chapter discusses conditions that have yielded insight into spinal cord maldevelopment. Consideration of the details of Klippel?Feil syndrome, X-linked Kallmann syndrome and congenital hemiplegia pathophysiology has led to a wider appreciation of corticospinal tract development. The chapter focuses on symptoms and physical signs that are of particular value in helping the experienced clinician achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis and an assessment that allows a coherent plan of management to be formulated. Surgical detethering may treat a tethered cord in a patient with progressive neurological symptoms.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the known prominent role of polyunsaturated (phospho)lipids as structural blocks of biomembranes, there is an emerging understanding of another important function of these molecules as a highly diversified signaling language utilized for intra- and extracellular communications. Technological developments in high-resolution mass spectrometry facilitated the development of a new branch of metabolomics, redox lipidomics. Analysis of lipid peroxidation reactions has already identified specific enzymatic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of several unique signals in response to inflammation and regulated cell death programs. Obtaining comprehensive information about millions of signals encoded by oxidized phospholipids, represented by thousands of interactive reactions and pleiotropic (patho)physiological effects, is a daunting task. However, there is still reasonable hope that significant discoveries, of at least some of the important contributors to the overall overwhelmingly complex network of interactions triggered by inflammation, will lead to the discovery of new small molecule regulators and therapeutic modalities. For example, suppression of the production of AA-derived pro-inflammatory mediators, HXA3 and LTB4, by an iPLA2? inhibitor, R-BEL, mitigated injury associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory processes in animals exposed to whole-body irradiation. Further, technological developments promise to make redox lipidomics a powerful approach in the arsenal of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments for personalized medicine of inflammatory diseases and conditions.
