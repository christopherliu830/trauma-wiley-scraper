AB  - Abstract The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Apheresis Applications Committee is charged with a review and categorization of indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (fourth edition), the subcommittee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Fifth ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by refining the category definitions and by adding a grade of recommendation based on widely accepted GRADE system. The concept of a fact sheet was introduced in the Fourth edition and is only slightly modified in this current edition. The fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis. The article consists of 59 fact sheets devoted to each disease entity currently categorized by the ASFA as category I through III. Category IV indications are also listed. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract The growing resistance against antifungal drugs has renewed the search for alternative treatment modalities, and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a potential candidate. Preliminary findings have demonstrated that dermatophytes and yeasts can be effectively sensitized in vitro and in vivo by administering photosensitizers (PSs) belonging to four chemical groups: phenothiazine dyes, porphyrins and phthalocyanines, as well as aminolevulinic acid, which, while not a PS in itself, is effectively metabolized into protoporphyrin IX. Besides efficacy, PDT has shown other benefits. First, the sensitizers used are highly selective, i.e., fungi can be killed at combinations of drug and light doses much lower than that needed for a similar effect on keratinocytes. Second, all investigated PSs lack genotoxic and mutagenic activity. Finally, the hazard of selection of drug resistant fungal strains has been rarely reported. We review the studies published to date on antifungal applications of PDT, with special focus on yeast, and aim to raise awareness of this area of research, which has the potential to make a significant impact in future treatment of fungal infections.

AB  - Objectives As part of a series of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded large-scale retrospective observational studies on bipolar disorder (BD) treatments and outcomes, we sought the input of patients with BD and their family members to develop research questions. We aimed to identify systemic root causes of patient-reported challenges with BD management in order to guide subsequent studies and initiatives. Methods Three focus groups were conducted where patients and their family members (total n = 34) formulated questions around the central theme, ?What do you wish you had known in advance or over the course of treatment for BD?? In an affinity mapping exercise, participants clustered their questions and ranked the resulting categories by importance. The research team and members of our patient partner advisory council further rated the questions by expected impact on patients. Using a Theory of Constraints systems thinking approach, several causal models of BD management challenges and their potential solution were developed with patients using the focus group data. Results A total of 369 research questions were mapped to 33 categories revealing 10 broad themes. The top priorities for patient stakeholders involved pharmacotherapy and treatment alternatives. Analysis of causal relationships underlying 47 patient concerns revealed two core conflicts: for patients, whether or not to take pharmacotherapy, and for mental health services, the dilemma of care quality vs quantity. Conclusions To alleviate the core conflicts identified, BD management requires a coordinated multidisciplinary approach including: improved access to mental health services, objective diagnostics, sufficient provider visit time, evidence-based individualized treatment, and psychosocial support.

AB  - Abstract Complex systems are present in such diverse areas as social systems, economies, ecosystems and biology and, therefore, are highly relevant to dental research, education and practice. A Complex Adaptive System in biological development is a dynamic process in which, from interacting components at a lower level, higher level phenomena and structures emerge. Diversity makes substantial contributions to the performance of complex adaptive systems. It enhances the robustness of the process, allowing multiple responses to external stimuli as well as internal changes. From diversity comes variation in outcome and the possibility of major change; outliers in the distribution enhance the tipping points. The development of the dentition is a valuable, accessible model with extensive and reliable databases for investigating the role of complex adaptive systems in craniofacial and general development. The general characteristics of such systems are seen during tooth development: self-organization; bottom-up emergence; multitasking; self-adaptation; variation; tipping points; critical phases; and robustness. Dental findings are compatible with the Random Network Model, the Threshold Model and also with the Scale Free Network Model which has a Power Law distribution. In addition, dental development shows the characteristics of Modularity and Clustering to form Hierarchical Networks. The interactions between the genes (nodes) demonstrate Small World phenomena, Subgraph Motifs and Gene Regulatory Networks. Genetic mechanisms are involved in the creation and evolution of variation during development. The genetic factors interact with epigenetic and environmental factors at the molecular level and form complex networks within the cells. From these interactions emerge the higher level tissues, tooth germs and mineralized teeth. Approaching development in this way allows investigation of why there can be variations in phenotypes from identical genotypes; the phenotype is the outcome of perturbations in the cellular systems and networks, as well as of the genotype. Understanding and applying complexity theory will bring about substantial advances not only in dental research and education but also in the organization and delivery of oral health care.

AB  - Abstract The psychological sense of community is one of the most commonly investigated constructs in community psychology. Sense of community may be particularly important for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) because they often face societal barriers to participation in community living, including stigma and discrimination. To date, no published studies have investigated the psychometric qualities of sense of community measures among individuals with SMI. The current study tested a series of confirmatory factor analyses using the Brief Sense of Community Index (Long & Perkins, 2003) in a sample of 416 persons with SMI living in community settings to suggest a model of sense of community for individuals with SMI and other disabilities. The resulting scale, the Brief Sense of Community Index-Disability, demonstrated good model fit and construct validity. Implications are discussed for how this scale may be used in research investigating community integration and adaptive functioning in community settings. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The failure to remyelinate and regenerate is a critical impediment to recovery in multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in severe dysfunction and disability. The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that accumulate in MS lesions are thought to be linked to the failure to regenerate, impeding oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and neuronal growth. The potential of endocannabinoids to influence MS progression may reflect their capacity to enhance repair processes. Here, we investigated how 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) may affect the production of the CSPGs neurocan and brevican by astrocytes in culture. In addition, we studied whether 2-AG promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation under inhibitory conditions in vitro. Following treatment with 2-AG or by enhancing its endogenous tone through the use of inhibitors of its hydrolytic enzymes, CSPG production by rat and human TGF-?1 stimulated astrocytes was reduced. These effects of 2-AG might reflect its influence on TGF-?1/SMAD pathway, signaling that is involved in CSPG upregulation. The matrix generated from 2-AG-treated astrocytes is less inhibitory to oligodendrocyte differentiation and significantly, 2-AG administration directly promotes the differentiation of rat and human oligodendrocytes cultured under inhibitory conditions. Overall, the data obtained favor targeting the endocannabinoid system to neutralize CSPG accumulation and to enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation.

AB  - Abstract There are a number of problems for evidence-based practice (EBP) including limited generalizability of efficacy research results, the consequent lack of confidence in the relevance of such research, and the conceptual distance of most practitioners from the research process. The result is that EBP, although sound in principle, often fails to achieve its aim of improving practice. Practice-based evidence (PBE) provides a complementary bridge for the gap between research and practice to offset some of these problems, promoting collaboration between mental health services and academic institutions. This paper presents the initial results of such a collaboration via three phases: (1) the development of a referential database for primary care counselling services, (2) ?practitioner-friendly? feedback on grouped data to services, and (3) the combination of the two to build an evidence base for work with ethnic minorities?an area in which research trials are not well adapted to provide much evidence.?Copyright ? 2003 John Wily & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract X-linked vacuolar myopathies can be divided into two forms: one that is associated with cardiomyopathy and mental retardation (XVCM-MR) and a second form, termed X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA), that spares cardiac muscle and has no central nervous system involvement. In this article, we demonstrate linkage between XMEA and markers on chromosome Xq28 and assign the XMEA gene locus to the most telomeric 10.5 cM of chromosome X. We also show that XVCM-MR is not allelic to XMEA. Ann Neurol 2000;47:666?669
