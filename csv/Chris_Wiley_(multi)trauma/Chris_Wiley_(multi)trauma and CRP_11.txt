AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

AB  - An in vitro study of dural lesions produced by 25-gauge Quincke and Whitacre needles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. (Hospital de Mostoles, Madrid Spain) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:393?402. This study evaluated the dural lesions produced by Whitacre and Quincke spinal needles in the external and internal surface of the dura mater of the lower spine area in an attempt to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of postdural puncture headaches (PDPH). The T11-L4 dural membranes from 5 fresh (immediately after extraction of organs for transplantation) male patients declared brain dead, ages 23, 46, 48, 55, and 60, were excised by anterior laminectomy. Morphologic orientation of the membrane and normal pH were maintained; 100 punctures at 90-degree angles were done with a new needle each time, 50 with 25-gauge Whitacre and 50 with 25-gauge Quincke needles. Half of the punctures with the Quincke needles were done with the bevel in the parallel direction to the axis of the spinal cord, and the rest with the bevel perpendicular to it. Fixation in solutions of 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer, followed by dehydration with acetone, was done 15 min after the punctures. The acetone was removed and the specimens were metallized with carbon followed by gold and inspected under a scanning electron microscope. When the area of the dural lesions found in the external and internal surfaces produced by the 2 types of needles was compared, no significant differences were found. The percentage of lesion closing area with the Quincke needles was 88.3% and 82.7% in the external and internal surfaces, respectively. With the Whitacre needles, the percentage of closing was 86.8% and 84.8% in the epidural and arachnoid surfaces, respectively. There were differences noted in the morphology of the lesions. The Whitacre needles produced coarse lesions with significant destruction in the dura's fibers while the Quincke needles produced a ?U?-shaped lesion (flap) that mimics the opened lid of a tin can, regardless of the tip's direction. Conclude that the needles produced lesions in the dura with different morphology and characteristics. Lesions with the Quincke needles resulted in a clean-cut opening in the dural membrane while the Whitacre needle produced a more traumatic opening with tearing and severe disruption of the collagen fibers. The lower incidence of PDPH seen in the Whitacre needles may be explained, in part, by the inflammatory reaction produced by the tearing of the collagen fibers after dural penetration. The inflammatory reaction may result in a significant edema, which may act as a plug limiting the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article that explains why a patient will develop a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after receiving a spinal with a Quincke needle and not after a Whitacre-type needle. The explanation is based more upon an inflammatory reaction than the direction of the needle cut. The Quincke needle appears to make a sharp cut while the Whitacre needle induced an inflammatory response including edema, which could block off the dura from leaking. It is very interesting that the response seen after the Whitacre needle was utilized occurred as quickly as it did. The article introduces the question as to whether a Quincke needle or a Whitacre needle is associated with more trauma to the dura, and which is better for decreasing the incidence of PDPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

AB  - Objectives To report clinical and laboratory features, treatment responses and outcome in dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis in the United Kingdom. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis from 2009 to 2016 at six specialist referral centres were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 49 dogs. Springer spaniels appeared to be over-represented (16 of 49 dogs). Young dogs (median age: 3?years and 9 months) and females (31 of 49) were frequently affected. Clinical presentation was variable, with pyrexia (39 of 49), lethargy (35 of 49) and anorexia (21 of 49) the most commonly reported clinical signs. Lymph node cytology or histopathology demonstrated neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous, granulomatous or necrotising lymphadenitis without a detectable underlying cause in all cases. Because a sterile immune-mediated aetiology was suspected, all dogs received prednisolone, which was followed by rapid resolution of clinical signs and lymphadenopathy in most cases. Clinical Significance Sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis should be considered in dogs with pyrexia of unknown origin with inflammatory lymphadenopathy if no underlying cause can be found and often responds well to immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy.

AB  - Intravenous clodronate in the treatment of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. (Istituto Ortopedico Gaetano Pini, Milan, Italy) J Rheumatol 2000;27:1477?1483. This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) and assessed the urinary excretion of type 1 collagen crosslinked N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after treatment. Thirty-two patients with RSDS were randomized to receive either IV Clodronate 300 mg daily for 10 consecutive days or placebo. Forty days later, the placebo treated patients received the clodronate treatment. Outcome measures included as a primary endpoint the visual analog scale of pain (VAS, range 0?100); secondary endpoints were a clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3) and an efficacy verbal score (EVS, range 0?3). Clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before the treatment, 40 (T40), 90 (T90), and 180 (T180) days later. At T40 the 15 patients randomized to clodronate treatment showed significant decreases of VAS and CGA (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively). Compared with the placebo group (17 patients), significant differences were found in all clinical variables. A further clinical improvement was observed throughout the study. Pooling the results of all 32 patients after clodronate treatment, at T180 the overall percentage decrease of VAS was 9.32 ± 15.6% with 30 patients significantly improved or asymptomatic. Significant inverse correlations between baseline NTx values and decreases of VAS were found at T90 (P = 0.03) and T180 (P = 0.01). No adverse events related to treatment occurred. Conclude that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and effective in the treatment of RSDS. NTx seems to be a predictive factor for clodronate efficacy. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized double blind placbo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) or complex regional pain syndrome type I. It is also to assess the urinary excretion of type I collogen crosslink N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after the treatment. Thirty-two patients with complex regional pain syndrome type I were randomized to receive either a placebo or IV clodronate 300mg daily for 10 consecutive days. At the end of 40 days, the placebo group was then treated with the clodronate. The primary endpoint measures with the visual analog scale (VAS, range 0?100) and a secondary endpoint was the clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3), and an efficacy vocal score (EVS, range 0?3). In addition, the patient had clinical and biochemical assessments performed before the treatment at 40 days, at 90 days, and at 180 days later. The purpose of the study was valued at the efficacy of the IV clodronate in pain relief. The second purpose was to evaluate the possibility of using NTx as a predicting factor for evaluating complex regional pain syndrome type I or the clodranate efficacy. On day 40, 15 patients that were randomized to the clodronate treatment showed significant decreases in their VAS and CGA when compared with the placebo group with 17 patients. In addition, the patients who had originally received placebo infusions showed decreased VAS and CGA scores after 40 days of treatment with the clodronate when compared to their VAS and CGA scores after placebo. At 180 days, the patients continued to show significant improvement or were asymptomatic. Bisphosphonates have been proposed since 1988 for the treatment of CRPS type I. The most frequently used is pamidronate, which is given intravenously showing varied results. The pamidronate did not seem to be well tolerated. Alendronate is also given intravenously demonstrating good efficacy. It, however, has a high relapse rate. Clodronate was chosen for this study because it was efficacious in treatment of various painful skeletal disorders and was more tolerable and safe than the pamidronate. The length of the time of the study was chosen to be 10 consecutive days so that it followed the study with successful use of pamidronate. These results suggest that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and is an effective complex regional pain syndrome type I treatment that may induce prompt and long lasting improvement. This study also attempted to demonstrate NTx as a predictive factor for clodranate efficacy. While NTx has shown to be a specific and sensitive marker of bone resorption, in this study, they found a low association between high NTx values and the complex regional pain syndrome type I. This finding could weaken the relationship between NTx baseline values and the responsiveness to clodronate treatment. It should be noted, however, that there were significant immerse correlations found between the baseline NTx values and in the pain improvement measured on the percentage change of VAS at 90 days and 180 days. Therefore, while significant inverse correlations may have been determined, and the NTx may be a promising tool, it is not yet possible to determine the predictive rolls of NTx as a marker.

AB  - Summary Mental illness exerts a major burden on human health, yet evidence-based treatments are rudimentary due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathologies. Clinical studies point to roles for the immune system in psychiatric diseases, while basic science has revealed that the brain has an active and multi-cellular resident immune system that interacts with peripheral immunity and impacts behavior. In this perspective, we highlight evidence of immune involvement in human psychiatric disease and review data from animal models that link immune signaling to neuronal function and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework for linking advances in basic neuroimmunology to their potential relevance for psychiatric diseases, based on the subtypes of immune responses defined in peripheral tissues. Our goal is to identify novel areas of focus for future basic and translational studies that may reveal the potential of the immune system for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses

AB  - Aims Type 1 diabetes can be complicated with neuropathy that involves immune-mediated and inflammatory pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, have shown anti-inflammatory properties, and thus we hypothesized that long-term treatment with liraglutide induced diminished inflammation and thus improved neuronal function. Methods The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Titration was 6 weeks to 1.2?1.8 mg/d, continuing for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in latency of early brain evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints were changes in proinflammatory cytokines, cortical evoked potential, autonomic function and peripheral neurophysiological testing. Results Thirty-nine patients completed the study, of whom 19 received liraglutide. In comparison to placebo, liraglutide reduced interleukin-6 (?22.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?38.1, ?3.2; P = .025) with concomitant numerical reductions in other proinflammatory cytokines. However neuronal function was unaltered at the central, autonomic or peripheral level. Treatment was associated with ?3.38 kg (95% CI: ?5.29, ?1.48; P < .001] weight loss and a decrease in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (?40.2%; 95% CI: ?60.6, ?9.5; P = .02). Conclusion Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic.

AB  - Introduction:? Electric fields of the magnitude likely to occur in electrical injury can result in skeletal muscle electroporation. It has been reported that Poloxamer 188 (P188) is able to seal damaged cell membranes. Using a previously described rat hind limb model of electrical injury, in this study we employ MRI to demonstrate that intravenously administered P188 arrests muscle tissue edema caused by electrical shock. Methods:? Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat hindlimbs were subjected to 12 electrical shock pulses of 2?kV and ?2A amplitude with duration of 4?ms. There was a 10-second separation period between shocks to allow thermal relaxation. Animals received either P188 or Lactated Ringer?s Injection (control) intravenously at 60 minutes after shock. Proton MRI were recorded using a 4.7-Tesla Bruker scanner (200?MHz). A Multi-Slice Multi-Echo (MSME) spin echo sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted images. Ten slices over the entire midthigh region were taken. For each slice, images from 10 echos in the TE range of 10?ms?100?ms and TR?=?2000?ms were collected. Imaging began at 60 minutes and continued until 3 hours postshock. The signal intensities at different TE times were used to fit an exponential decay and measure the T2 value in each voxel. Voxels with T2 values?>?80?ms were considered injured. Results:? There were noticeable increases of injured area with time for electrically injured limbs due to development of edema. Control-treated rats averaged a 58.0%(±6.59% SD) increase in total area of injury. The total area of injury for P188-treated rats increased by 46.6%(±2.96% SD) In nonelectroporation limbs, no change in T2 occurred. Discussion:? Disruption of the plasma membrane due to electrical current leads to edema. We treated the injured muscles with P188 and observed that it helped to arrest edema. MRI proved effective not only in characterizing the degree of injury resulting from electrical shock but also in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - This title is sure to be a turnoff for most surgeons! Neuropathic pain is a term that has been brought to prominence with the marketing of the drug, neurontin. Neuropathic along with nociceptive are two general terms used to classify pain symptoms. Nociceptive often refers to pain symptoms that are amenable to the surgical knife whereas neuropathic often involves more central mechanisms. Management of neuropathic pain is generally based around the use of prescription medication. I will briefly detail what is hot and what is not in neuropathic analgesia. Information will be provided on neuromodulation/surgical techniques that modulate central nervous system transmission. My experience of spinal cord stimulation in a case of extreme CRPS will be presented.

AB  - Abstract Background The metabolism of the essential trace element copper remains incompletely understood and, until recently, nearly ignored in acute medicine. Menkes disease was for long the only known copper deficiency condition, but several case reports and investigations conducted over the last 2 decades have shown that deficiency is more frequent than previously suspected, with devastating individual consequences and potential public health consequences. The copper needs in healthy individuals are 0.9 mg/d, which translates to 0.3 mg/d intravenously in parenteral nutrition; the present review aims at gathering actual knowledge. Method and results A review of literature was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane systematic reviews to identify the most recent information about copper deficiency and generate a narrative review. Copper deficiency has hereditary and acquired origins, the latter being the most frequent. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific but affect all organs and systems, particularly the hematologic (anemia) and the neurologic (myeloneuropathy) systems. Deficiency also affects the cardiovascular, cutaneous, and immune systems. Severe copper deficiency due to reduced absorption after bariatric bypass surgery has become frequent. Conclusion Deficiency is more frequent than previously recognized, probably because of changing nutrition patterns but also because of some treatments that have become very common such as bypass bariatric surgery and, in acute medicine, prolonged continuous renal replacement therapy. The patients may present with severe hematologic and neurologic complications that go untreated because copper deficiency was not considered in the differential diagnosis: These complications often need active intravenous repletion with doses 4?8 times the usual nutrition recommendations.
