AB  - The severely of skin loss and the options of resurfacing is determined by taking into account the following factors. 1) The size & location of the defect, 2) The depth of the defect and the quality of the tissue bed, 3) The extent of exposed vital structures, 4) The associated bone and other tissues injuries, 5) The availability of donor skin flap. The size of the defect is the most important factor in choosing a resurfacing option. The size can be categorized into small, medium and large. A small defect is one that is less than 5?cm2 in size, a medium defect is between 5 to 15?cm2, and a large defect is greater than 15?cm2. Local flaps are usually sufficient to cover small defects <5?cm2. These are advancement flaps or rotation and transposition flaps. Regional flaps are indicated to resurface these medium-sized defects 5 to 15?cm2. The donor is within the same region of the hand, from one of the digits or from dorsum and palmar surfaces of the hand. It is usually based on vascular or NV pedicles. Large defects >15?cm2 will need larger flaps for coverage. These large flaps are pedicled distant flaps and free flaps. In these severe injuries, there is usually associated bone and soft tissues injuries. These injuries can be reconstructed as a single stage combined reconstruction or multi-staged reconstructions. The resurfacing should always be given priority.

AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Abstract HZ/su is an investigational recombinant subunit vaccine for the prevention of shingles, a disease resulting from the reactivation of varicella zoster virus. The vaccine is composed of recombinant varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE), and liposome-based Adjuvant System AS01. To evaluate the potential local and systemic effects of this vaccine, three studies were performed in rabbits. In the first two studies, rabbits received a single intramuscular (IM; study 1) or subcutaneous (SC; study 2) dose of gE/AS01, AS01 alone (in study 2 only) or saline, and the local tolerance was evaluated up to 3?days after administration. Under these conditions, only local inflammatory reactions at the injection sites were detected by microscopic evaluation. In the third study, gE/AS01, AS01 alone or saline, were injected SC or IM on four occasions at 2?week intervals. General health status, local tolerance, ophthalmology, haematology and blood chemistry parameters were monitored. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were performed after termination of the study. The only treatment-related changes included a transient increase in neutrophils, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels and microscopic signs of inflammation at the injection sites, which are expected observations related to the elicited inflammatory reaction. The SC and IM routes of administration produced similar systemic effects. However, microscopic findings at the injection sites differed. One month after the last injection, recovery was complete in all groups. In conclusion, the single and repeated SC and IM administration of the gE/AS01 vaccine were locally and systemically well-tolerated in rabbits and support the clinical development of the vaccine.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome on patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A hundred and eighty-eight patients with detailed thyroid hormone levels at diagnosis of DLBCL were enrolled. Low T3 syndrome was defined as a low serum free T3 (FT3) level with low or normal serum free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver-operator characteristic curves and the corresponding areas under the curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of International Prognostic Index (IPI) and low T3 syndrome. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with low T3 syndrome, which was associated with worse PFS and OS in the rituximab era. It was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS, especially for those with IPI 0?2, extranodal sites ≤1 and stage III?IV. Synchronously low FT3 and FT4 had poorer survival outcome compared to only low FT3 and adding criterion of low T3 syndrome improved the prognostic capacity of IPI for predicting PFS and OS in DLBCL. Low T3 syndrome was found to be a strong prognostic predictor in DLBCL.

AB  - Summary This chapter considers how religion and religions have been studied in relation to diaspora and transnationalism, loosely adapting Robin Cohen's mapping of scholarship in diaspora studies to organize the discussion. Drawing upon the examples of Judaism and the religions of the black Atlantic, the chapter begins with reflections on the paradigm of diaspora as a large-scale, traumatic scattering, exploring the role of religions in maintaining consciousness of a real or imagined homeland connection to people and place through time and across space. Next, I consider the challenges of remaking home abroad as a religious minority, focusing on international migration to the United States and Western Europe from the 1960s, and highlighting the relationships between religious organizations, ethnic identity, and hostland incorporation. After that, the chapter illuminates the impact of a more transnational frame from the 1990s, underlining the embeddedness of actors simultaneously in at least two places, and what this means in terms of understanding everyday religious circulations of people, goods, capital, and ideas. Finally, the chapter returns to more theoretical matters, testing the utility of distinctions between so-called ?ethnic? and ?universal? religions, advocating instead Tweed's schema of diasporic and transnational ?religioning? in terms of three distinctive locative practices.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - Does early intervention with a light mobilization program reduce long-term sick leave for low back pain? (Central Hospital in Hedmark, Ottestad, Norway) Spine 2000;25:1973?1976. This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. Early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. In this experiment, patients were referred to a low back pain clinic and given a simple and systematic program as an outpatient treatment. Patients sick-listed 8 to 12 weeks (N = 457) for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. At 12-month follow-up assessment, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full-duty work, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Conclude that early intervention with examination, information, and recommendations to stay active showed significant effects in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patients that have been sick listed for more than 8 weeks in Norway. Comparison was between a control group that received conventional primary health care and an intervention group that was examined at a spine clinic, given information, and advised to stay active. The authors wanted to examine if an early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. This study involved 457 patients that were sick listed 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain. The inclusion criteria for the study was based on 1) 8 to 12 weeks being ?sick-listed,? 2) age (18 to 60 years), and 3) diagnosis that included back pain, low back pain, leg and thigh pain, back pain without sciatica, and sciatica. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, recent low back trauma, cauda equina symptoms, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatic low back disease, and ongoing low back treatment. The intervention used was modification of Indahl's light mobilization program where the patient was referred to a spine clinic, answered standard questionnaires, and was interviewed and examined by a treatment team consisting of a physician and a physiotherapist. Any somatic findings during the examination were explained to the patient and information was given about their importance. All radiographs were shown and explained. The idea was to educate the patient and dedramatize their problems. The patient was assured of a good prognosis and informed of the importance of remaining active to avoid development of muscle dysfunction. The physiotherapist individually advises the patient on how to train and stretch at home. They were also advised on how to manage the back pain and resume normal activity. The patients in the control group were not examined at the clinic, but were treated with primary health care, which included at least one visit to a general practitioner. The patients were reassessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The assessment was to determine if the patient had returned to full duty work. At each of the assessments, the intervention group had a higher percentage of patients that had returned to full duty work. At the 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full duty work as compared with 56.4% in a controlled group. This study demonstrates that a consultation with thorough examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement shows a significant effect in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain as compared to the conventional health care guidelines used by general practitioners that tend to recommend bed rest, caution, and reduced activities. The authors suggest that information and fear reduction when offered systematically may reduce the fear of ?doing something wrong? to the back. This may then prevent unnecessary activity and long sick leave.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Avoiding abdominal incisions is one of the unique features of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) surgery. There has been no consensus on whether the avoidance of abdominal incisions can reduce the systemic inflammatory response after NOSE surgery. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transanal NOSE, especially the inflammatory response after transanal NOSE versus mini-laparotomy (LAP). Methods A total of 172 colorectal cancer patients who underwent transanal NOSE were matched with 172 patients who underwent LAP for colorectal cancer. Clinical characteristics, pathological features, perioperative parameters, and indicators of the inflammatory response were collected and compared. The inflammatory response was assessed by measuring body temperature, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein levels, and procalcitonin levels. Results Patients in the NOSE group had better short-term outcomes, such as lower incidence of wound infection, less postoperative pain, less need for anesthetic drugs, and faster recovery of intestinal function. Regarding the inflammatory response, the average body temperature of patients in the NOSE group was higher on postoperative day (POD) 2 than that in the LAP group. A higher median neutrophil count and C-reactive protein levels were observed in the NOSE group on POD3 and POD5 than was observed in the LAP group. Conclusions Transanal NOSE is safe and feasible for colorectal cancer, with better short-term outcomes. Although transanal NOSE produced a larger systemic inflammatory response than LAP in the early postoperative stages, this response did not appear to translate into infectious morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection, is considered the major cause of death among critically ill patients in the developed world. While there is a general view that this reflects contributions from both the pathogen and the host with respect to an inappropriate inflammatory response, there is a lack of agreement as to the key immune mechanisms. This has been reflected in the diverse range of immunotherapies tested in clinical trials, often with rather marginal effects. The case has been made for a pathogenic role of excessive immunity, the so-called ?cytokine storm?, and for a role of too little immunity through immune paralysis. Apoptosis is implicated as a key mechanism in both this immune paralysis and the multi-organ failure that is a feature of severe sepsis. A number of polymorphisms have been implicated in susceptibility to sepsis, including cytokine genes, HLA class II and caspase-12. In this review we focus in particular on the role of group A streptococci in severe sepsis. Here the effect of bacterial superantigens appears to be a correlate of inflammatory activation, although the precise evolutionary role of the superantigens remains unclear.

AB  - Abstract Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenic disease characterized by massive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney. Due to its genetic pattern, the disease differs from other CKD. ADPKD is a multi-system, progressive disorder which is frequently complicated with hypertension, cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, there are many clinical problems specific to ADPKD. In this article, we reviewed these clinical problems and their management in ADPKD with hemodialysis patients.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric cancers are a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, with variable prognoses and treatments. Tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) represent the most common childhood malignancy, followed by leukemia, with an annual incidence of 5.57 per 100 000 population, and are the most common pediatric malignancies requiring radiation therapy. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary pediatric bone tumor, accounting for 3% of childhood malignancies and with approximately 400 cases diagnosed each year. Treatment includes the use of multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen that includes methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, among other agents. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric sarcoma, with approximately 200-250 cases per year in the United States. Treatment of Ewing's sarcoma includes chemotherapy and surgery and/or radiation. Following cancer treatment, pediatric patients require lifelong care and surveillance for potential late side effects of therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To examine whether the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) screening tool can satisfy Rasch model expectations and therefore be transformed into an interval level measurement scale, suitable for use as an outcome measure in clinical studies. Design.? Rasch analysis (using the software RUMM2020) of LANSS data from both a random selection of all chronic pain patients and also specific chronic pain diagnostic categories. Patients.? Original LANSS data from a previous study of 2,480 patients with chronic pain were used. Specific diagnostic groups examined included diabetic neuropathy, postsurgical pain, osteoarthritis, posttraumatic injury, and low back pain. Outcome Measures.? The following assessments were made: fit to the Rasch model, scale reliability, scale multi-dimensionality, and differential item functioning. Results.? The overall fit to the Rasch model was only acceptable in two groups; diabetic neuropathy and chronic postsurgical pain. For these groups, the scale is unidimensional (measures a single construct) and there is no evidence of differential item functioning across gender and age groups. The scale only has reliability consistent with use at the group level. Conclusions.? Neuropathic screening tools such as the LANSS have been used as outcome measures in clinical studies. Rasch analysis demonstrates that the LANSS can be used as such in specific populations of patients with neuropathic pain, however it's reliability in this context does not support use at the individual level and it cannot be used as a generalised measurement tool across pain diagnostic groups. The LANSS remains primarily a diagnostic tool.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), that is Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, affects about 1.5 million persons in the USA and 2.2 million in Europe. The pathophysiology of IBD involves immunological, genetic and environmental factors. The treatment is medico-surgical but suspensive. Anti-TNFα agents have revolutionized the treatment of IBD but have side effects. In addition, a non-negligible percentage of patients with IBD stop or take episodically their treatment. Consequently, a nondrug therapy targeting TNFα through a physiological pathway, devoid of major side effects and with a good cost-effectiveness ratio, would be of interest. The vagus nerve has dual anti-inflammatory properties through its afferent (i.e. hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal axis) and efferent (i.e. the anti-TNFα effect of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway) fibres. We have shown that there is an inverse relationship between vagal tone and plasma TNFα level in patients with CD, and have reported, for the first time, that chronic vagus nerve stimulation has anti-inflammatory properties in a rat model of colitis and in a pilot study performed in seven patients with moderate CD. Two of these patients failed to improve after 3 months of vagus nerve stimulation but five were in deep remission (clinical, biological and endoscopic) at 6 months of follow-up and vagal tone was restored. No major side effects were observed. Thus, vagus nerve stimulation provides a new therapeutic option in the treatment of CD.

AB  - Zusammenfassung Haut - und Weichgewebeinfektionen gehören weltweit zu den häufigsten Infektionen. Das klassische Erysipel ist eine nicht-eitrige Infektion, verursacht durch beta-hämolysierende Streptokokken. Es ist klinisch gut diagnostizierbar, wenn die Haut ansonsten unverändert ist, anhand der Kombination aus einem überwärmten, schmerzhaften, hellroten Erythem mit glänzender Oberfläche sowie zungenförmigen Ausläufern und einer initial vorliegenden Allgemeinsymptomatik mit Fieber oder zumindest Frösteln. Das Erysipel spricht immer und am besten auf Penicillin an. So genannte begrenzte Phlegmonen oder begrenzte Weichgewebeinfektionen sind unsere Begriffe für solche Infektionen, die häufig von Wunden ihren Ausgang nehmen, meist durch S. aureus verursacht werden und als dunkelrote, schmerzhafte Schwellung erscheinen. Fieber oder Frösteln fehlen anfangs oft. Schwere Phlegmonen sind hingegen eitrige, z. T. nekrotische, oft bis an die Faszie reichende Infektionen, welche neben der Antibiotikabehandlung auch einer chirurgischen Versorgung bedürfen. Oft erfüllen sie auch die Kriterien für sogenannte komplizierte Weichgewebeinfektionen der FDA. Zu diesen Kriterien gehören z.B. schlecht eingestellter Diabetes mellitus, periphere arterielle Verschlusskrankheit und Immunsuppression. Die seltenen nekrotisierenden Weichgewebeinfektionen sind dagegen eigenständigie, rasch progrediente, akut lebensbedrohliche Infektionen infolge Toxin-bedingter Ischämien und Schock. Die Behandlung begrenzter Phlegmonen umfasst initial Cephalosporine der Gruppe 1 und 2, oder bei Nachweis von S.aureus auch Flucloxacillin (wegen seines geringen Selektionsdruckes auf andere Bakterien). Bei schweren Phlegmonen erfolgt eine kalkulierte und meist parenterale Therapie ? je nach Lokalisation - mit Substanzen gegen anaerobe Bakterien und/oder gramnegative Bakterien (z.B. Clindamycin, Aminopenicillin mit beta-Lactamase-Inhibitoren, Fluorchinolone). Abszesse müssen in erster Linie gut drainiert werden. Nur unter bestimmten Umständen sollten sie zusätzlich antibiotisch behandelt werden. Die Beachtung dieser diagnostischen Kriterien und der hier aufgeführten, auf Evidenz oder Konsensus basierenden Empfehlungen, ermöglicht eine rationale Antibiotikatherapie, die wirksam und für den Patienten möglichst verträglich ist und die keinen unnötigen Selektionsdruck in Richtung (multi-)resistenter Erreger ausübt.

AB  - Summary Background Heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in cirrhosis and in conditions of systemic inflammation. Whether HRV is associated with cirrhosis decompensation and development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is unknown. Aims To (a) validate wireless remote HRV monitoring in cirrhosis decompensation; (b) determine if severely reduced HRV is a surrogate for inflammation and progression of cirrhosis decompensation; (c) assess if measuring HRV determines prognosis in cirrhosis decompensation. Methods One hundred and eleven patients at risk of cirrhosis decompensation at two clinical sites were monitored for HRV. Standard deviation of all normal beat-beat intervals (SDNN) reflecting HRV was assessed using remote monitoring (Isansys Lifetouch) and/or Holter ECG recording. Clinical outcomes and major prognostic scores were recorded during 90-day follow-up. Results Reduced HRV denoted by lower baseline SDNN, correlated with severity of decompensation (median 14 (IQR 11-23) vs 33 (25-42); P < 0.001, decompensated patients vs stable outpatient cirrhosis). Furthermore, SDNN was significantly lower in patients developing ACLF compared to those with only decompensation (median 10 (IQR9-12) vs 16 (11-24); P = 0.02), and correlated inversely with MELD and Child-Pugh scores, and C-reactive protein (all P < 0.0001) and white cell count (P < 0.001). SDNN predicted disease progression on repeat measures and appeared an independent predictor of 90-day mortality (12 patients). An SDNN cut-off of 13.25 ms had a 98% negative predictive value. Conclusions This study demonstrates that remote wireless HRV monitoring identifies cirrhosis patients at high risk of developing ACLF and death, and suggests such monitoring might guide the need for early intervention in such patients.

AB  - Degenerative disease of the spine is one of the most common clinical entities and affects the intervertebral discs, including opposing vertebral endplates, the intervertebral posterior joints and the ligaments. The most severe primary spinal degenerative changes are found in the lower cervical and lumbar spine regions. The spine contains three different types of joints, each of which presents its own pattern of degenerative disease: cartilaginous joints, synovial joints, and fibrous joints. With regard to radicular pain, root compression alone does not fully account for root pain following disc-root conflict, but it is, nevertheless, considered to be the main cause of pain. The authors pointed out that the origin of pain is multi-factorial and that inflammation probably predominates over merely mechanical mechanisms. They also considered whether vertebral arthrosis can be construed as the body's decision to favor the spine's static function over its dynamic role when joint ?hypermobility? linked to chronic load in old age could cause severe structural damage to the bony vertebral structures.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.
