AB  - Abstract Aim: The purpose of this cross-sectional evaluation was to determine the impact of neuropathic pain (NeP) on patient functioning and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) under standard care conditions. Methods: Patients with NeP or neuropathic and nociceptive pain [Mixed Pain (MP)] enrolled in the DONEGA study, a naturalistic, prospective and multi-centre study of the effectiveness of gabapentin under usual care conditions, were included in this cross-sectional evaluation before starting study treatments. Participants completed the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire, MOS Short Form-12 (SF-12), and Sheehan Disability Scale (ShDS). Multivariate analysis and regression models were used to analyze patient data. Results: A total of 1519 patients [mean±SD; 56.0±13.7 yrs old (58.8% female)] with NeP or MP were enrolled in the study. The mean pain history was 1.1±2.8 yrs, current pain intensity on a 5-point visual analogue scale was 2.8±1.0 and mean pain in previous week was 71.3±19.0mm. Pain substantially interfered (i.e., score≥5 on 0?10 scale) with normal work (5.9±3.0), social life (5.7±3.0), and family life (5.3±3.0), producing substantial disability (total ShDS score of 16.9±8.3 pts). Country-standardised physical (PCS) and mental health (MCS) component summary scores of SF-12 indicated significant impairment in both domains compared with the general Spanish population: PCS; ?1.13±1.0 SDS (standard deviation score), and MCS; ?1.21±0.7 SDS, equivalent to the 15th and 25th percentiles of normative populations, respectively. Conclusions: Under standard care conditions, neuropathic and mixed pain are associated with impaired physical and mental QoL, producing a substantial level of disability in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers are the main cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for major amputation in diabetic foot patients. Eight hundred and sixty diabetic patients were admitted to the diabetic wound centre of the Korea University Guro Hospital for foot ulcers between January 2010 and December 2013. Among them, 837 patients were successfully monitored until complete healing. Ulcers in 809 patients (96·7%) healed without major amputation and those in 28 patients (3·3%) healed with major amputation. Data of 88 potential risk factors including demographics, ulcer condition, vascularity, bioburden, neurology and serology were collected from patients in the two groups and compared. Among the 88 potential risk factors, statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed in 26 risk factors. In the univariate analysis, which was carried out for these 26 risk factors, statistically significant differences were observed in 22 risk factors. In a stepwise multiple logistic analysis, six of the 22 risk factors remained statistically significant. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios were 11·673 for ulcers penetrating into the bone, 8·683 for dialysis, 6·740 for gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, 6·158 for hind foot ulcers, 0·641 for haemoglobin levels and 1·007 for fasting blood sugar levels. The risk factors for major amputation in diabetic foot patients were bony invasions, dialysis, GI disorders, hind foot locations, low levels of haemoglobin and elevated fasting blood sugar levels.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Histological characteristics of age-related muscle wasting are type II muscle fiber atrophy, accumulation of oxidative stress-induced lipofuscin granules and decreased satellite cell numbers. There is increasing clinical evidence for a strong correlation between chronic systemic inflammation and age-related muscle wasting. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of chronic systemic inflammation on age-related histological muscle characteristics. Methods: As a model for chronic systemic inflammation, we included 10 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 27 control patients suffering from osteoarthritis (OA). Biopsies were taken from the vastus medialis muscle. Results: No significant differences were found in type II muscle fiber atrophy, lipofuscin accumulation, or satellite cell number in RA compared with OA patients. Conclusions: These results suggest there is no association between chronic systemic inflammation in RA and age-related muscle characteristics. Future research should focus on inflammation and satellite cell function. Muscle Nerve 46: 204?209, 2012

AB  - SUMMARY Glutamine is the most abundant amino-acid in the extra- and intracellular compartments of the human body, which accounts for over 50% of its free amino-acid content. Utilization of glutamine peptides is explicitly useful, resulting in a decrease in the number of postoperative infectious complications, period of hospitalization, and therapeutic costs. This article aims to study the effects of glutamine on systemic inflammatory response, morbidity, and mortality after esophagectomy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial was used. Following sealed-envelope block randomization, the patients were divided into two groups. Members of the glutamine group (group G) received glutamine (Dipeptiven, Fresenius) as continuous infusion for 6 hours at 0.5?g/kg for 3 days prior to, and 7 days following surgery; while patients of the control group were given placebo. We examined 30 patients in group G, and 25 patients as controls. In both patient groups, the levels of total protein, albumin, pre-albumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin, transferring-saturation, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lymphocte, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum lactate were determined prior to surgery (t0), directly after surgery (tu), following surgery on day 1 (t1), day 2 (t2), and day 7 (t7). For statistical analysis Mann?Whitney U test and chi-square test were used. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, male/female ratio, and SAPS II scores. Intensive care unit morbidity and mortality was similar in both groups (group G: 24 survivors/6 nonsurvivors; Control: 17 survivors/8 nonsurvivors; P= 0.607). Daily Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score did not differ significantly between the two groups. The observed inflammatory markers followed the pattern we described without significant difference. Based on our study, the glutamine supplementation that we used had no influence on morbidity, mortality, or postoperative inflammatory response after esophagectomy.

AB  - Essentials The lectin pathway's MASP-1/2 activates coagulation factors but the trigger of the activation is unknown. MASP-1/2 activation was assessed by quantifying complexes between MASPs and antithrombin/C1-inhibitor. Activated platelets and fibrin were demonstrated to activate MASP-1 and MASP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may represent a crossroad between the complement and the coagulation systems. Summary Background The activated forms of the complement lectin pathway (LP) proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 are able to cleave the coagulation factors prothrombin, fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in vitro. In vivo studies also show that MASP-1 is involved in thrombogenesis. Objectives To clarify the not yet identified mechanisms involved in triggering activation of the LP during thrombotic reactions. Methods Novel sandwich-ELISAs for detection of complexes between MASP-1 or MASP-2 and the serpins C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) or antithrombin (AT), were used to specifically detect and quantify the activated forms of MASP-1 and MASP-2. Results Activated platelets were shown by flow cytometry to bind Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 but not MBL, which was associated with activation of MASP-1 and MASP-2. We also demonstrated that fibrin and the plasmin-generated fibrin fragment DD in plasma, bind and activate MASP-1 and MASP-2. As demonstrated by the ELISA and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, the fibrin-associated activation was reflected in a specific inactivation by AT during clotting without the assistance of heparin. In all other cases the MASPs were, as previously reported, inactivated by C1-INH. In systemic lupus erythematosus patients with thrombotic disease and in polytrauma patients, the levels of activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 in complex with both AT and C1-INH were associated with markers of thrombotic disease and contact/coagulation system activation. Conclusions MASP-1 and MASP-2 are activated during blood clotting. This activation is triggered by activated platelets and by the generation of fibrin during thrombotic reactions in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a novel activation/amplification mechanism in thromboinflammation.

AB  - Abstract Objectives It is difficult to predict the evolution of uncomplicated type B intramural hematoma (IMHB) with a focal intimal disruption (FID) in the acute phase. The aims of this study were to investigate the predictors of FIDs and summarize the risk factors for the evolution of uncomplicated IMHB in the acute phase. Methods Eighty-six patients with uncomplicated IMHB were included and were divided according to the development of an FID during the acute phase: the FID group (n?=?32) and the no-FID group (n?=?54). Geometric measurements and computed fluid dynamic calculations were based on a computed tomography scan performed on admission. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the predictors of FID development. Results Thirty-two (37%) patients developed an FID. Patients with an FID had higher C-reactive protein levels (18.6?±?2.3 vs 8.1?±?0.2?mg/dL, P?<?0.001) and white blood cell counts (10.3?±?2.1 vs 7.5?±?1.7 109/L, P?<?0.001). The no-FID group had lower occurrences of disease progression (15% vs 64%, P?<?0.001) and aorta-related mortality (6% vs 25%, P?=?0.016). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a significant risk for the occurrence of an FID with a larger maximum aortic diameter (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.73, P?=?0.020), thicker hematoma (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.40-3.48, P?=?0.001), and higher oscillatory shear index (per 0.01 unit, OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.21-2.49, P?=?0.003). The aorta-related mortality during the acute phase was 25% (n?=?8). Conclusions Certain aortic conditions, including ta larger aortic diameter, thicker hematoma and higher oscillatory shear stress, are associated with the FID development and result in worse clinical outcomes.

AB  - Dentofacial defects can be small or very large, consisting of defects in the craniomaxillofacial region with missing soft tissue, bony and other hard tissue components. Such combined mucosal, osseous and even cartilaginous defects can be reconstructed using flaps and bone grafts, or hopefully, in the future with bone graft substitutes or even tissue engineered constructs. The healing of such wounds always relies on the vascularity of the surrounding tissues. This chapter seeks to provide a physiological basis for the mechanisms involved in the healing of such large complex defects. The reconstruction of specific defects must follow sound and logical surgical principles. The authors employ the concept of the reconstructive surgical ladder, in which techniques of step-wise increasing complexity are used with a strong preference for the simplest possible procedure at the outset. A number of techniques are presented along with the principles of tissue engineering and the basis for bone regeneration using adipose derived stem cells, growth factors and resorbable scaffolds.

AB  - Abstract Acute hypoglycaemia provokes profound physiological changes affecting the cardiovascular system and several haematological parameters, principally as a consequence of sympatho-adrenal activation and counter-regulatory hormonal secretion. Many of these responses have an important role in protecting the brain from neuroglycopenia, through altering regional blood flow and promoting metabolic changes that will restore blood glucose to normal. In healthy young adults the cardiovascular effects are transient and have no obvious detrimental consequences. However, some of the effected changes are potentially pathophysiological and in people with diabetes who have developed endothelial dysfunction, they may have an adverse impact on a vasculature that is already damaged. The acute haemodynamic and haematological changes may increase the risk of localized tissue ischaemia, and major vascular events can certainly be precipitated by acute hypoglycaemia. These include myocardial and cerebral ischaemia and occasionally infarction. Established diabetic retinopathy often deteriorates after strict glycaemic control is instituted, the latter being associated with a threefold increase in frequency of severe hypoglycaemia, and enhanced exposure to mild hypoglycaemia. The possible mechanisms underlying these hypoglycaemia-induced effects include haemorrheological changes, white cell activation, vasoconstriction, and the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The concept that acute hypoglycaemia could aggravate vascular complications associated with diabetes is discussed in relation to evolving comprehension of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and blood vessel disease.

AB  - Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreas by an autoimmune response. Due to ethical and practical difficulties, the features of the destructive process are known from a small number of observations, and transcriptomic data are remarkably missing. Here we report whole genome transcript analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction (qRT?PCR) and correlated with immunohistological observations for four T1D pancreases (collected 5 days, 9 months, 8 and 10 years after diagnosis) and for purified islets from two of them. Collectively, the expression profile of immune response and inflammatory genes confirmed the current views on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes and showed similarities with other autoimmune diseases; for example, an interferon signature was detected. The data also supported the concept that the autoimmune process is maintained and balanced partially by regeneration and regulatory pathway activation, e.g. non-classical class I human leucocyte antigen and leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B1 (LILRB1). Changes in gene expression in islets were confined mainly to endocrine and neural genes, some of which are T1D autoantigens. By contrast, these islets showed only a few overexpressed immune system genes, among which bioinformatic analysis pointed to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) (CXCR4) chemokine pathway activation. Remarkably, the expression of genes of innate immunity, complement, chemokines, immunoglobulin and regeneration genes was maintained or even increased in the long-standing cases. Transcriptomic data favour the view that T1D is caused by a chronic inflammatory process with a strong participation of innate immunity that progresses in spite of the regulatory and regenerative mechanisms.

AB  - Effect of pretreatment with intrathecal excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists on the development of pain behavior caused by plantar incision. (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) Anesthesiology 2000;93:489?496. This study examined the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluRs) on the development of pain behavior after plantar incision. Rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were anesthetized with halothane. Fifteen minutes before an incision was made, drug [40 nmol MK-801; 20 nmol NBQX; or 200 nmol [(+)-MCPG] or vehicle was injected intrathecally followed by an infusion of the same drug for 75 min. Withdrawal thresholds to calibrated von Frey filaments applied adjacent to the wound and response frequencies to a blunt mechanical stimulus applied directly to the wound were measured before incision and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after incision and then once daily for 6 days. Preincision treatments with antagonists against the NMDA (MK-801) and Group I and II metabotropic receptors [(+)-MCPG] did not inhibit the development of mechanical hyperalgesia caused by incision. Preincision treatment with the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX increased withdrawal thresholds at 1 and 2 h and on postoperative day 1 compared with the vehicle group; response frequencies were reduced 1 and 2 h after incision and on postoperative day 2 (P < 0.05). In an additional group, postincision treatment with NBQX was similar to preincision treatment. Conclude spinal NMDA and MGluR antagonists may not be useful for preventing postsurgical pain. Spinal non-NMDA receptor antagonists reduced pain behaviors, but a preventive effect using preincision treatment was not apparent. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The incisional model using rats was developed by Dr. Brennan and colleagues for the study of acute surgical pain. In a previous study, they showed that blockade of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors, but not blockade of NMDA receptors nor mGluR receptors reduces postincisional pain if administered after the incision is made. This study shows the same is true if the receptor antagonists are administered before the incision is made. However, the effect is not particularly marked and; therefore, pursuit of non-MNDA excitatory amino transmitter receptor blockers for the prevention of postincisional pain would not likely be fruitful. The results of the study do require us to rethink how postincisional pain differs from other experimental pains and the phenomena of ?wind-up? attributed to activation of the NMDA receptor. Worth keeping in mind is that incisional pain does not equal surgical pain, which may involve traumatic injury to nerves and produce a neuropath pain, which strongly indicates involvement of NMDA receptors.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - The recent clinical availability of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) opens the door for potential therapeutic repurposing for non-oncological indications. Considering (a) the preclinical efficacy data with PARP inhibitors in non-oncological diseases and (b) the risk?benefit ratio of treating patients with a compound that inhibits an enzyme that has physiological roles in the regulation of DNA repair, we have selected indications, where (a) the severity of the disease is high, (b) the available therapeutic options are limited, and (c) the duration of PARP inhibitor administration could be short, to provide first-line options for therapeutic repurposing. These indications are as follows: acute ischaemic stroke; traumatic brain injury; septic shock; acute pancreatitis; and severe asthma and severe acute lung injury. In addition, chronic, devastating diseases, where alternative therapeutic options cannot halt disease development (e.g. Parkinson's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis or severe fibrotic diseases), should also be considered. We present a preclinical and clinical action plan for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors.
