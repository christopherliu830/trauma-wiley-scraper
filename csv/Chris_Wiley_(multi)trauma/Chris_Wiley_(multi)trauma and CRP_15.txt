AB  - Background In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), current oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitors do not provide maximal platelet inhibition at the time of reperfusion. Furthermore, administration of cangrelor prior to reperfusion has been shown in pre-clinical studies to reduce myocardial infarct (MI) size. Therefore, we hypothesize that cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion in STEMI patients will reduce the incidence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) and limit MI size in STEMI patients treated with PPCI. Methods The platelet inhibition to target reperfusion injury (PITRI) trial, is a phase 2A, multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, in which 210 STEMI patients will be randomized to receive either an intravenous (IV) bolus of cangrelor (30 ?g/kg) followed by a 120-minute infusion (4 ?g/kg/min) or matching saline placebo, initiated prior to reperfusion (NCT03102723). Results The study started in October 2017 and the anticipated end date would be July 2020. The primary end-point will be MI size quantified by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) on day 3 post-PPCI. Secondary endpoints will include markers of reperfusion, incidence of MVO, MI size, and adverse left ventricular remodeling at 6 months, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Summary The aim of the PITRI trial is to assess whether cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion would reduce acute MI size and MVO, as assessed by CMR.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Severity prediction is difficult early in the course of acute pancreatitis. Markers of pancreatic injury, or inflammatory activation are candidate markers of severity. The aim of the present study was to assess predictive abilities of carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide (CAPAP-B) and soluble l-selectin (sL-selectin) using samples collected on admission to hospital. Methods:? Patients with acute pancreatitis and disease (acute abdomen) and normal controls were studied. Samples were collected at admission and daily for 5?days. There were significant differences between mild and severe pancreatitis in urinary and plasma CAPAP-B on admission, C-reactive protein on day 3 and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II scores. Prediction of severity with CAPAP-B on admission was as good as with APACHE-II score after 48?h. Carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide was not raised in disease controls. By contrast, sL-selectin was lowered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and in disease controls. There was no difference between mild and severe pancreatitis. Conclusion:? Urinary CAPAP-B, a marker of acinar injury, can be used to predict severity of acute pancreatitis at the time of admission to hospital, but sL-selectin has no value in this regard. The extent of acinar injury may be a more important early marker of severity than markers of inflammatory activation.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.
