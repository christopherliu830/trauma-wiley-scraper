AB  - ABSTRACT The majority of periprosthetic joint infections occur shortly after primary joint replacement (<3 months) and require the removal of all implant components for the treatment period (~4 months). A clinically relevant animal model of periprosthetic infection should, therefore, establish an infection with implant components in place. Here, we describe a joint replacement model in the rat with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium components inoculated at the time of surgery by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which is one of the main causative microorganisms of periprosthetic joint infections. We monitored the animals for 4 weeks by measuring gait, weight-bearing symmetry, von Frey testing, and micro-CT as our primary endpoint analyses. We also assessed the infection ex vivo using colony counts on the implant surfaces and histology of the surrounding tissues. The results confirmed the presence of a local infection for 4 weeks with osteolysis, loosening of the implants, and clinical infection indicators such as redness, swelling, and increased temperature. The utility of specific gait analysis parameters, especially temporal symmetry, hindlimb duty factor imbalance, and phase dispersion was identified in this model for assessing the longitudinal progression of the infection, and these metrics correlated with weight-bearing asymmetry. We propose to use this model to study the efficacy of using different local delivery regimens of antimicrobials on addressing periprosthetic joint infections. Statement of clinical significance: We have established a preclinical joint surgery model, in which postoperative recovery can be monitored over a multi-week course by assessing gait, weight-bearing, and allodynia. This model can be used to study the efficacy of different combinations of implant materials and medication regimens. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - The present study examined the role of positive parenting on externalizing behaviours in a longitudinal, genetically informative sample. It often is assumed that positive parenting prevents behaviour problems in children via an environmentally mediated process. Alternatively, the association may be due to either an evocative gene?environment correlation, in which parents react to children's genetically influenced behaviour in a positive way, or a passive gene?environment correlation, where parents passively transmit a risk environment and the genetic risk factor for the behavioural outcome to their children. The present study estimated the contribution of these processes in the association between positive parenting and children's externalizing behaviour. Positive parenting was assessed via observations at ages 7, 9, 14, 24 and 36?months and externalizing behaviours were assessed through parent report at ages 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12?years. The significant association between positive parenting and externalizing behaviour was negative, with children of mothers who showed significantly more positive parenting during toddlerhood having lower levels of externalizing behaviour in childhood; however, there was not adequate power to distinguish whether this covariation was due to genetic, shared environmental or nonshared environmental influences.

AB  - The case of a 78 year old man who presented with fever and hepatic abscesses is reported. He was found to have an infected abdominal aortic aneurysm and the organism cultured was Streptococcus milleri. He was treated with an in situ Dacron graft and high-dose intravenous penicillin. This may be suitable treatment when Gram-positive organisms are involved and there is no gross peritoneal soiling.
