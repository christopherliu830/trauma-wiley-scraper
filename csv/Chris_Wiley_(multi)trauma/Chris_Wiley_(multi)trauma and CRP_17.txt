AB  - Summary. Background:?Clotting factor (F) VIII is an independent risk factor for primary and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). The causes for high plasma FVIII levels are not fully understood, but an involvement of genetic factors has been demonstrated. A multifunctional endocytic receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), mediates cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of FVIII and may contribute to variations in FVIII levels. Objective:?We assessed the association of a genetic variation of LRP1 (663C?>?T) with basal FVIII levels and the risk of venous thrombosis in a group of high-risk patients and in healthy controls. Patients and methods:?One hundred and fifty-two patients with a history of recurrent VTE (median age 56?years, 47% women) were compared with 198 age- and sex-matched controls (median age 53?years, 50% women). The LRP1 663C?>?T genotype was analyzed by mutagenic separated polymerase chain reaction assay and heterozygosity was confirmed by sequence analysis. Results:?LRP1 663C?>?T genotype distribution differed significantly between patients (663CC n?=?138, 663CT n?=?14) and controls (663CC n?=?190, 663CT n?=?8; P?=?0.048). In multivariable linear regression analysis including LRP1 663C?>?T, ABO blood group, von Willebrand factor antigen, C-reactive protein and age, LRP1 663CT was independently associated with FVIII activity (P?=?0.02). LRP1 663CT was also associated with increased odds for VTE following adjustment for blood group O, FV Leiden and the prothrombin variation 20210G?>?A in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3?8.5). Conclusions:?According to our data the LRP1 663C?>?T polymorphism influences plasma FVIII levels independently of blood group, C-reactive protein and von Willebrand factor and is significantly associated with the risk of VTE.

AB  - Abstract Background Micronutrients, an umbrella term used to collectively describe vitamins and trace elements, are essential components of nutrition. Those requiring alternative forms of nutrition support are dependent on the prescribed nutrition regimen for their micronutrient provision. The purpose of this paper is to assist clinicians to bridge the gap between the available guidelines? recommendations and their practical application in the provision of micronutrients via the parenteral route to adult patients. Methods Based on the available evidenced-based literature and existing guidelines, a panel of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals with significant experience in the provision of parenteral nutrition (PN) and intravenous micronutrients developed this international consensus paper. Results The paper addresses 14 clinically relevant questions regarding the importance and use of micronutrients in various clinical conditions. Practical orientation on how micronutrients should be prescribed, administered, and monitored is provided. Conclusion Micronutrients are a critical component to nutrition provision and PN provided without them pose a considerable risk to nutrition status. Obstacles to their daily provision?including voluntary omission, partial provision, and supply issues?must be overcome to allow safe and responsible nutrition practice.

AB  - The essential trace element zinc (Zn) has a large number of physiologic roles, in particular being required for growth and functioning of the immune system. Adaptive mechanisms enable the body to maintain normal total body Zn status over a wide range of intakes, but deficiency can occur because of reduced absorption or increased gastrointestinal losses. Deficiency impairs physiologic processes, leading to clinical consequences that include failure to thrive, skin rash, and impaired wound healing. Mild deficiency that is not clinically overt may still cause nonspecific consequences, such as susceptibility to infection and poor growth. The plasma Zn concentration has poor sensitivity and specificity as a test of deficiency. Consequently, diagnosis of deficiency requires a combination of clinical assessment and biochemical tests. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) are susceptible to Zn deficiency and its consequences. Nutrition support teams should have a strategy for assessing Zn status and optimizing this by appropriate supplementation. Nutrition guidelines recommend generous Zn provision from the start of PN. This review covers the physiology of Zn, the consequences of its deficiency, and the assessment of its status, before discussing its role in PN.

AB  - Abstract There is strong evidence that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. This elevated risk is independent of classical risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and hypertension. The risk of coronary heart disease, put simply, is proportional to the severity of the depression. Also conclusively demonstrated is the adverse effect of depression in patients following myocardial infarction, which materially increases mortality. The mechanism of increased cardiac risk attributable to MDD is at present uncertain, but activation of the sympathetic nervous system, altered baroreflex sensitivity, and/or exaggerated platelet reactivity and endothelial dysfunction are likely to be of prime importance.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to investigate the initiation and course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early inflammatory response and to elucidate the cytokine system in relation to the adrenal response caused by stress. Seven blood samples were collected, pre- and postoperatively (0?72?h) after total hip replacement (THR) due to osteoarthritis. The following cytokines were measured using Cytometric Bead Array: interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 (B Wilcoxon test P?<?0.01) Repeated measurements were also significant (Friedman P?<?0.05). The concentration of IL-8 doubled the day of surgery but did not reach a significant level (Friedman test =0.069). None of the other cytokines showed any significant changes. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was interrupted after the surgery and there was a significant correlation between the cortisol secretion and IL-6 response. This study demonstrates an isolated elevation in IL-6 levels with only a minor elevation in IL-8 following THR. This pro-inflammatory response seemed to decline without activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), but cortisol seemed to play a complicated role in halting the acute inflammatory response.
