AB  - Abstract Background Published guidelines promote best practice in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) treatment and management; however, these recommendations are not always applied in clinical practice. Understanding existing care internationally will help inform future patient and health professional service delivery, education initiatives and content of clinical guidelines. Methods An e-survey was conducted in order to gain an insight into routine CRPS clinical practice. Health professionals and academics, from the field of CRPS, were recruited from an international population. Quantitative and qualitative data were elicited. Data were mapped onto a framework to identify macro-regional factors. Results Of the 260 survey respondents, 96% (n = 241) provided clinical care for people with CRPS, with academics not involved in patient care also responding. Half of respondents expressed difficulty in recognizing the symptoms of CRPS but treatment aims corresponded with published guidelines. However, a lack of resources and fragmented care were reported as barriers to early intervention. Service constraints were most frequently reported by European respondents. Five themes emerged from the qualitative data: the benefit of interdisciplinary working; the importance of symptom management; need for early diagnosis and intervention; establishing a collaborative partnership with patients; the value of education for patients and health professionals. Conclusions Our data suggest that more work is required to raise awareness of the Budapest CRPS diagnostic criteria so as to promote early diagnosis and intervention. Future work to optimize clinical effectiveness should consider enhancing interdisciplinary service delivery that encourages a collaborative patient/clinician partnership; includes excellent patient education; and addresses modifiable patient-related factors. Significance Health professionals expressed some level of difficulty recognizing the signs and symptoms of CRPS despite the majority of health professionals having had clinical experience exceeding 6 years in the field of CRPS. More work is required to raise awareness amongst clinicians of the Budapest CRPS diagnostic criteria so as to promote early diagnosis and intervention Health professionals' treatment aims reflected the current clinical guidelines however, a lack of resources and fragmented care were frequently cited as barriers to achieving these.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of serum fibronectin and serum somatomedin-C as nutritional markers during enteral nutrition support (ENS) of critically ill, traumatized patients using an enteral product containing high concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Twelve critically injured patients received a standard enteral formula with 30 g of a 44% branched-chain amino acid supplement added to each liter of formula. Fibronectin concentration, somatomedin-C concentration, and nitrogen balance were measured on study days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 or until adequate oral intake began. Both fibronectin and somatomedin-C concentrations increased significantly from baseline by day 7 of ENS. Nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline by day 4. On days 14 and 21, only somatomedin-C and nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline. Nitrogen balance was significantly correlated with somatomedin-C concentration (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01), cumulative caloric intake (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01), and cumulative nitrogen intake (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that serum somatomedin-C is useful and serum fibronectin has potential in monitoring nutrition support response in critically ill, traumatized patients.

AB  - Abstract Background There is a need for an ideal indicator of surgery in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Several markers have been analysed, but the search still continues as none have proven effective. This study aimed to analyse and compare the predictive value of plasma procalcitonin (PCT) strip test in patients presenting with acute abdomen and identify a useful cut-off value to differentiate patients that would benefit with surgery from those that require conservative management. Methods A prospective study was conducted in the department of general surgery from June 2012 to June 2013. Plasma PCT was estimated by the semi-quantitative strip test. The levels of plasma PCT and other routinely used markers of inflammation were analysed and compared. Results Of the total of 58 patients, 44 patients (76%) were men with a mean age of 45 years. Forty patients required emergency surgical intervention. A plasma PCT value of >0.5?ng/mL at admission was 80% sensitive and 100% specific for predicting need for antibiotics in patients with acute abdomen that were managed conservatively. The mean plasma PCT value in the patients undergoing surgery (5.0?10.0?ng/mL) was significantly more than in those managed conservatively (0.5?2.0?ng/mL). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves a cut-off for plasma PCT of >5.0?ng/mL was 75% sensitive and 100% specific for considering surgical intervention in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Conclusions Plasma PCT (value?>5?ng/mL) could be used as an adjunct to clinical examination to predict requirement of surgery in patients presenting with acute abdomen.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Epidemiological studies using high-sensitivity assays for serum C-reactive protein have shown a consistent association between cardiovascular disease risk and serum C-reactive protein concentrations. C-reactive protein is a biomarker for inflammation, and has been established in clinical practice as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease events. There is evidence that serum C-reactive protein is an excellent biomarker of cardiovascular disease and is also an independent and strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events. Further characterization of the impact and influence of lifestyle exposures and genetic variation on the C-reactive protein response to cardiovascular disease events may have implications for the therapeutic approaches to reduce cardiovascular disease events. This review summarizes the studies that have examined the association between serum C-reactive protein and the risk of cardiovascular disease. We also discuss the impact of independent factors and C-reactive protein genetic polymorphisms on baseline plasma C-reactive protein levels.

AB  - Summary Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are rarely due to fungal agents and if so they are mainly caused by Candida strains. This case represents a PJI caused by a multi-drug resistant Pseudallescheria apiosperma, with poor in vivo response to itraconazole and voriconazole. This case differs also by the way of infection, since the joint infection did not follow a penetrating trauma. In the majority of cases, Scedosporium extremity infections remain local in immunocompetent individuals. We report a persistent joint infection with multiple therapeutic failures, and subsequent amputation of the left leg. Detailed clinical data, patient history, treatment regime and outcome of a very long-lasting (>4?years) P. apiosperma prosthetic knee infection in an immunocompetent, 61-year-old male patient are presented with this case. The patient was finally cured by the combination of multiple and extensive surgical interventions and prolonged antifungal combination therapy with voriconazole and terbinafine.

AB  - Abstract In hospitalized patients, lipid emulsions are an integral part of balanced parenteral nutrition. Traditionally, a single lipid source, soybean oil, has been given to patients and was usually regarded as just a source of energy and to prevent essential fatty-acid deficiency. However, mixtures of different lipid emulsions have now become widely available, including mixtures of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Fish oil is high in the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is a growing body of evidence that these ?-3 fatty acids can exert beneficial immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and inflammation-resolution effects across a wide range of patient groups including surgical, cancer, and critically ill patients. At least in part, these effects are realized via potent specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). Moreover, parenteral nutrition including ?-3 fatty acids can result in additional clinical benefits over the use of standard lipid emulsions, such as reductions in infection rates and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Clinical and experimental evidence is reviewed regarding lipid emulsion use in a variety of hospitalized patient groups, including surgical, critically ill, sepsis, trauma, and acute pancreatitis patients. Practical aspects of lipid emulsion use in critically ill patients are also considered, such as how to determine and fulfill energy expenditure, how and when to consider parenteral nutrition, duration of infusion, and safety monitoring.

AB  - Summary Preoperative glucocorticoid administration reduces the systemic inflammatory response. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a novel inflammatory marker belonging to the humoral arm of innate immunity exerting a potentially protective host response. This study evaluated PTX3 and other complement marker changes after preoperative methylprednisolone (MP) early after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Seventy patients were randomized (1 : 1) to preoperative intravenous (i.v.) MP 125 mg (group MP) or isotonic saline i.v. (group C). The outcomes included change in plasma PTX3, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins (ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3), complement components (C4 and C3), terminal complement complex (TCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Blood samples were analysed at baseline and 2, 6, 24 and 48 h after surgery with complete sampling from 63 patients for analyses. MP resulted in an increase in circulating PTX3 compared to saline from baseline to 24 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001), while MP reduced the systemic inflammatory response (CRP) 24 and 48 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001). However, the small postoperative changes in MBL, ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3, C4, C3 and TCC concentrations did not differ between groups (P?>?0·05). In conclusion, preoperative MP 125 mg increased circulating PTX3 and reduced the general inflammatory response (CRP) early after TKA, but did not affect other complement markers.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. Recognition of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), intensive care, shifting away from early surgical treatment, and monitoring of the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is important in the management of SAP. The aim of our study was retrospective evaluation and critical assessment of the experience with SAP management protocol involving new strategy in the university hospital. Methods. Protocols of 274 SAP patients treated in our institution during the last eight years were reassessed. APACHE II, CRP and SOFA score, IAP, pulmonary complications, ventilatory support and infection rate were evaluated. The success of the conservative treatment, surgical interventions and mortality was analysed comparing period 1 from 1999 to 2002 and period 2 from 2003 to 2006. Results. More patients with necrotising SAP were treated in period 2. The average CRP and SOFA score was higher in period 2, p=0.018; p=0.011. A total of 139 patients underwent continuous veno-venouse haemofiltration (CVVH) as a component of fluid resuscitation and IAP control. Application of CVVH increased in period 2, p<0.005. Only 5?8% of patients were managed with ventilatory support. The overall infection rate decreased in period 2 comprising 21%, p<0.005. Success rate of the conservative therapy reached 69% in period 2, p<0.01. Surgical treatment was performed in 41% of patients in period 1 vs. 19% in period 2, p<0.001. Overall mortality was 19%, with a reduction to 12% in year 2006. Conclusion. The conservative protocol-based approach is a rational treatment strategy for the management of SAP and can be successfully implemented in the setting of the university hospital.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition, often triggered by trauma to a limb and characterized by sensory, motor, autonomic and trophic changes within the affected limb. Due to the multi-faceted nature of the condition there are a wide range of potential health outcome measures for use within CRPS related clinical trials. This aim of this systematic literature review was to identify which patient or health professional questionnaire format outcome measures have been used in CRPS specific clinical trials, and which of these have been developed specifically for use in CRPS populations. Information gained from this review will inform an international consortium project to define a Core Outcome measurement set for CRPS Clinical trials. Databases and data treatment The electronic databases EMBASE, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL and LILACS were systematically searched from January 2000 until April 2014. Results One hundred and four full text papers were obtained with 68 questionnaire outcome measures identified. Five of these outcome measures were validated for CRPS. Of those outcome measures used since 2000, those addressing physical functioning were most prevalent. Conclusions Currently, CRPS clinical trials use a wide range of outcome measures making the potential to synthesize evidence problematic. There is no internationally agreed core measurement set. This diversity of outcome measures demonstrates a clear need for the development of a core measurement set to be used in CRPS clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Aim To test the null hypothesis of association between chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) and plasmatic levels of the C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen in a population of severely hypertensive patients. Methodology One hundred and seventy patients with severe refractory hypertension were selected. All patients were submitted to radiographic, clinical and periodontal evaluation. Plasmatic levels of CRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen were measured on the morning of the first periodontal appointment using commercially available kits. Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to appraise the effect of the co-variables on the plasmatic levels of the inflammatory markers assessed. Results Of the 170 subjects who participated, 105 (61.8%) were females and the median age of the participants was 53 years (range: 40?78). The adjusted multiple linear analyses demonstrated that plasmatic levels of CRP levels were associated with the body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.259, P < 0.001) and residual tooth roots (RTR) (r = 0.191, P = 0.041). IL-6 and fibrinogen levels showed associated with BMI (r = 0.400, P < 0.001 and r = 0.214, P = 0.002 respectively). CAP correlated weakly with CRP (r = 0.250, P = 0.005), IL-6 (r = 0.174, P = 0.020) and fibrinogen (r = 0.393, P < 0.001) levels. Conclusion The null hypothesis was rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis. In other words, the presence of chronic apical periodontitis was associated with higher plasmatic levels of CRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen, in a population of severely hypertensive patients. However, the weak association between CAP and each dependent variable suggests a modest participation of endodontic infection on the plasmatic levels of biomarkers.

Design Secondary analysis of a 2-year double-blind clinical trial for osteoporosis. Setting Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Participants Women aged 65 and older with osteoporosis in long-term care (LTC) (N = 178). Measurements Baseline serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and soluble receptors (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its two receptors (TNFα-R1 and TNFα-R2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), IL-10), functional status assessed according to activities of daily living, the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test, gait speed, cognitive status, mental health, and falls. Results At baseline, older age was moderately associated with higher serum concentrations of hs-CRP (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.22), TNFα-R1 (r = 0.36), TNFα-R2 (r = 0.34), and IL-10 (r = 0.16) (all P < .05). Frail participants had significantly higher hs-CRP, TNFα-R1, TNFα-R2, IL-6, and IL-6-sR levels (all P < .05) than those nonfrail participants. Higher baseline hs-CRP and IL-6 levels were associated with worse physical performance and gait speed at 12 months independent of age, zoledronic acid use, and comorbidity (|r| = 0.25?0.30; all P < .05). Inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with incident falls. Conclusions Higher proinflammatory biomarker levels are associated with frailty and poorer function and mobility in older women residing in LTC facilities.

AB  - Abstract To understand links between early experience and biomarkers of peripheral physiology in adulthood, this study examined associations between quality of early caregiving and markers of sympathetic activation and chronic inflammation in a sample of 52 low-income mothers and their preschool-aged children. Mothers reported on levels of positive caregiving experienced during childhood using the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior-Intrex. Mother and child sympathetic activation was indexed via pre-ejection period (PEP) at rest, during a dyadic social engagement task, and for children, while interacting with an unfamiliar adult. C-reactive protein (CRP) was collected using whole blood spots to assess levels of low-grade chronic inflammation. Results showed that mothers who reported experiencing more warm guidance and support for autonomy in early childhood displayed lower resting sympathetic nervous system activation (i.e., longer PEP) and lower chronic inflammation (i.e., CRP levels). Further, lower maternal chronic inflammation levels were associated with lower sympathetic activation (i.e., longer PEP) in their children at rest, and during social interactions with mother and a female stranger.

AB  - Background One major concern in about one third of elder patients after total hip-replacement surgery is post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment is accompanied with changes in serum S-100? protein (S-100?) and inflammatory markers. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the value of serum S-100? and interleukin(IL)-1?, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in reflecting POCD after total hip-replacement surgery. Methods Forty-two elderly patients were enrolled, and 37 patients completed the follow-up. Serum S-100? protein and IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were determined pre-operatively, as well as 1?h and 6?h post-operatively. Neuropsychological tests were performed pre-operatively, as well as on day 1, 3, and 7 post-operatively. Results Seventeen (45.9%, 17/37) patients developed POCD 1?day after surgery, and three (8.1%, 3/37) developed POCD 7?days after surgery. [Correction added after publication 7 February 2012: in the preceding sentence (54.1%, 17/37) was corrected to (45.9%, 17/37)]. Patients with POCD 1?day after surgery had significantly higher serum levels of IL-6 at 6?h (135?±?32?pg/ml vs. 91?±?29?pg/ml, P?<?0.05) and S-100? at 1?h (1872?±?385?pg/ml vs. 1289?±?143?pg/ml, P?<?0.05. No significant post-operative change was detected in levels of TNF-α, IL-1, or CRP. Conclusion The serum levels of pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 and S-100? protein increased after total hip-replacement in elderly patients, and such increase may serve as predicting parameters for the occurrence of POCD.

AB  - Plasma fibrinogen is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disturbances, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with elevated causes of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. That is the reason to look for the causes of increased CRP levels in CRF and haemodialysis (HD). The study tries to find whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consistent factor for CRP elevation in CRF and/or in HD patients, when a dialysis-induced IL-6 synthesis may occur, as IL-6 has been claimed as a responsible factor for production of some acute phase proteins like CRP. CRP [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, limit 0.1?µg/L], IL-6 (ELISA, Medgenix, Brussels, Belgium), and fibrinogen (photometric technique) were tested in 45 stable predialytic CRF patients (mean age 48?±?7 years) and in 50 stable HD patients (mean age 62?±?15). In CRF patients, a positive correlation was found between plasma fibrinogen (mean 356?±?167?mg/dL) and CRP (r?=?0.51, p?<?0.01) and between fibrinogen and proteinuria (r?=?0.32, p?<?0.01), but no correlation was found between CRP and IL-6. In HD patients, a high positive correlation was registered between CRP (mean 6.93?±?5.88?mg/L) and IL-6 (mean 9.4?±?10.6?pg/mL) (r?=?0.84, p?<?0.001) and between CRP and fibrinogen (mean 325?±?110?mg/dL) (r?=?0.59, p?<?0.001). The study suggests that, in HD patients, one of the factors stimulating hepatic production of CRP is probably IL-6, which is synthesized by the dialysis-related, activated macrophages. In predialytic patients, the bacterial products in dialysate and their effect on macrophages are absent and there is no correlation between CRP and IL-6.

AB  - The presence of persistently high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels is well known to be associated with a state of inflammation, malnutrition, and erythropoietin resistance in hemodialysis (HD) population. Meanwhile, a substantial group of patients present with intermittent elevations of CRP levels, and its clinical consequences are unclear. We designed this study to compare the inflammatory and nutritional parameters and erythropoietin requirements in HD patients with persistent or intermittent CRP elevation and those with CRP levels in without. We included 100 HD patients [age: 48.4?±?14.3 years; HD duration: 69.3?±?49.0 months (minimum 12 months)]. The 6-month retrospective clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the patient records, and those with chronic inflammatory disease, malignancy, infectious complications, and surgery were excluded. The monthly determined CRP levels (at least 6 for each patient) were reviewed, and the patients were grouped according to their CRP levels as those with persistent (group 1), intermittent (at least one level of CRP?10?mg/L) (group 2), and those with CRP in normal ranges set by the laboratory (group 3). We compared the fibrinogen, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, albumin, prealbumin, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct results of the patient groups. The patient groups revealed significant differences in terms of fibrinogen (p?<?0.001), albumin (p?<?0.0001), prealbumin (p?<?0.007), ICAM-1 (p?<?00.2) levels and nPCR (p?<?0.03), IDWG (p?<?0.02), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct (p?<?0.03) values. Group 2 presented to be in risk of inflammation and malnutrition with a decrease in albumin levels and nPCR and presence of rHUEpo resistance when compared to patients in group 3. We conclude that, similar to HD patients with persistently high CRP levels, those with intermittent elevation of CRP must also be considered to be in a state of chronic inflammatory response associated with malnutrition and erythropoietin resistance. This signifies the importance of regulatory monitoring of CRP in HD population.

AB  - Abstract Elevated serum procalcitonin (PCT) level has been reported to be a diagnostic index in systemic bacterial infections, but it can also increase in some non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Stevens?Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare immune-mediated cutaneous mucosal reaction which is susceptible to bacterial infections and may have elevated PCT levels. The value of serum PCT has not been assessed in series of SJS/TEN patients. We aimed to investigate the PCT levels in SJS/TEN patients with systemic bacterial infections (systemic infected group), with skin surface bacterial infections (skin surface infected group) and without infections (non-infected group), to assess whether PCT was a valuable indicator for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 42 inpatients with SJS/TEN were retrospectively analysis. The receiver?operator curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of PCT for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that PCT levels in the systemic infected group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CRP between the three groups. The cut-off PCT level of 0.65 ng/mL calculated by ROC had optimal diagnostic efficacy, with sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 89.7%, respectively. PCT and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis were positively correlated (P < 0.05). In conclusion, PCT is a valuable index and superior to CRP in detecting systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The level of PCT can partially reflect the severity of the disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Today, ankle joint kinematic assessment gives important information regarding the intersegment range of motion. It does not, however, provide information regarding coordination between the segments. This study aimed to determine whether or not intersegment coordination can provide valuable, otherwise missed information in relation to kinematic alterations of the ankle joint. The study consisted of 40 participants, including 12 total ankle replacement (TAR) patients, 12 ankle arthrodesis (AA) patients, and 16 controls. Gait assessment was carried out wearing 3-D inertial sensors. Intersegment coordination was determined by calculation of the continuous relative phase (CRP) between foot intersegments. CRP analysis found useful information regarding the magnitude and directionality of segment motion throughout the gait cycle, with AA patients reporting an altered coordination pattern for all three intersegments, forefoot?hindfoot, hindfoot?shank, and forefoot?shank, and TAR patients showing alterations in the hindfoot?shank intersegment. Results show that assessment of intersegment coordination can provide further information, otherwise overlooked by the general kinematic assessment, which could be used to optimize patient rehabilitation. Furthermore, the study showed that such information could be used to compare surgical outcomes. As a result, the study concludes that the inclusion of intersegment coordination assessment could be beneficial in clinical practice. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract A delipid extracorporeal lipoprotein filter (DELP) system has been used to treat patients with stroke and has shown favorable prognosis. However, the mechanism for the neuronal functional recovery remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neuronal histological assessment, and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) after ischemic stroke following DELP treatment. Hyperlipidemic rabbits underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion. After 30?min, the animals received an extracorporeal apheresis treatment with a DELP filter. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of the plasma were measured. The levels of CRP, TNF-α, and oxLDL in brain tissue were also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, cresyl violet staining, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed. DELP apheresis reduced TC and LDL by >30%. The number of neurons at day 7 (P?<?0.01) and the integrated optical density of NSE at day 1 (P?<? 0.05) and day 7 (P?<?0.01) were significantly increased in the DELP group. TUNEL-positive cells were significantly decreased (P?<?0.05). Astrocytes were moderately activated, and this activation persisted up to 7 days. Gliosis was not found in the DELP group. After treatment, the level of CRP declined at day 1 (P?<?0.05); TNF-α and oxLDL declined at day 7 (P?<?0.05). DELP apheresis decreased neuronal apoptosis, reduced inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia, and improved neuronal survival.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the independent associations between measures of adiposity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with clustered cardiometabolic risk in adolescents. Methods 209 adolescents (139 boys), aged 15?17.5 years participated. Participants completed anthropometric measurements [height, weight, waist circumference (WC)] whilst the 20 m fitness test was used to assess CRF. Additional measures included systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, ratio total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin resistance (HOMA), interleukin-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and adiponectin. Results Partial correlations revealed weak to moderate negative associations for body mass index (BMI) and WC with CRF (r = ?0.295 and ?0.292, P < 0.001) and adiponectin (r = ?0.227 and ?0.262, P < 0.05). Weak to moderate positive associations were evident for BMI with CRP, and cardiometabolic risk (r = 0.274, and 0.283, P < 0.05, respectively). Weak to moderate positive associations were apparent for WC with CRP and triglycerides (r = 0.240 and 0.254, P < 0.05), whilst moderate to large associations were evident for WC with clustered cardiometabolic risk (r = 0.317, P < 0.05). Regression analyses revealed that BMI was positively associated with cardiometabolic risk (? = 0.243, P < 0.001). Further analysis whilst additionally controlling for WC and CRF strengthened this association (? = 0.352, P < 0.001). Finally, participants in the least-fit quartile for CRF had significantly poorer cardiometabolic risk scores than those in the other quartiles. Conclusion BMI and not CRF was independently associated with cardiometabolic risk. Reducing BMI appears essential to minimize cardiometabolic risk during adolescence. Am. J. Hum.

AB  - Overproduction of interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis (MG), and thymectomy can cause myasthenic crisis because of surgically induced overproduction of IL-6. Preoperative steroid therapy is beneficial in preventing MG crisis during the perioperative period. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of preoperative steroid therapy on proinflammatory mediators during the perioperative period of transsternal thymectomy for MG. The study group comprised 20 consecutive MG patients undergoing transsternal thymectomy during the period March 2002 through March 2004. Seventeen of these patients received dose-escalated steroid therapy before thymectomy (steroid treatment group) and three did not (non-steroid treatment group). Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 were determined during the perioperative period; clinical outcomes were reviewed, and the results were compared between the two groups. Peak serum IL-6 and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in the steroid treatment group than in the non-steroid treatment group. Amongst perioperative variables subjected to multiple regression analysis, preoperative steroid treatment were found to be the most significant independent predictor of inhibited IL-6 production on postoperative day 1. No postoperative respiratory failure occurred in the steroid treatment group, but it did occur in the non-steroid treatment group. Preoperative steroid therapy can ameliorate IL-6 overproduction and may help stabilize the patient's postoperative condition.
