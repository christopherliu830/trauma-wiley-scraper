AB  - Abstract Loss of muscle mass and insulin sensitivity are common phenotypic traits of immobilisation and increased inflammatory burden. The suppression of muscle protein synthesis is the primary driver of muscle mass loss in human immobilisation, and includes blunting of post-prandial increases in muscle protein synthesis. However, the mechanistic drivers of this suppression are unresolved. Immobilisation also induces limb insulin resistance in humans, which appears to be attributable to the reduction in muscle contraction per se. Again mechanistic insight is missing such that we do not know how muscle senses its ?inactivity status? or whether the proposed drivers of muscle insulin resistance are simply arising as a consequence of immobilisation. A heightened inflammatory state is associated with major and rapid changes in muscle protein turnover and mass, and dampened insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and oxidation in both rodents and humans. A limited amount of research has attempted to elucidate molecular regulators of muscle mass loss and insulin resistance during increased inflammatory burden, but rarely concurrently. Nevertheless, there is evidence that Akt (protein kinase B) signalling and FOXO transcription factors form part of a common signalling pathway in this scenario, such that molecular cross-talk between atrophy and insulin signalling during heightened inflammation is believed to be possible. To conclude, whilst muscle mass loss and insulin resistance are common end-points of immobilisation and increased inflammatory burden, a lack of understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these traits exists such that a substantial gap in understanding of the pathophysiology in humans endures.

AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.

AB  - Summary The evidence base for diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal infections has become stronger in the last years with publication of a substantial number of new articles. This chapter covers three of the most important entities of musculoskeletal infection: septic arthritis, prosthetic joint infection (PJI), and osteomyelitis. It presents background, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of septic arthritis, PJI and osteomyelitis. The chapter also presents some case examples. In native joints, septic arthritis is most commonly caused by hematogenous seeding of microorganisms from a distant infection focus. PJI represents an important complication, associated with high morbidity, need for complex treatment and substantial healthcare costs. Osteitis describes infection affecting only cortical bone; osteomyelitis implies that the cortex and medulla are involved. Osteomyelitis is classified by the route of infection. In contrast to acute osteomyelitis, chronic osteomyelitis and osteosynthesis-associated infections are unlikely to be eradicated without surgical treatment.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. We report a case of temporal arteritis with a sympathetic component in the orofacial region, which responded to stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs). Case. An 81-year-old woman with limited mouth opening and pain upon chewing was referred to the Orofacial Pain Clinic at Nihon University Dental Hospital. The patient also presented with blurred vision and a burning sensation on the right side of her face. On clinical examination, the temporal artery was tender to palpation, and there was increased sensitivity in the temporal region bilaterally. The patient reported jaw pain and limited mouth opening. Laboratory examination showed elevations in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The burning sensation was due to a sympathetic component, and SGBs substantially reduced both the burning sensation and right temporal pain. Blocking the sympathetic chain on the ipsilateral side also improved jaw movement. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist, after which she was admitted to hospital with a tentative diagnosis of temporal arteritis. Treatment with oral prednisone 30?mg daily was initiated, and the dose was tapered as her symptoms resolved. Discussion. The reason for the gradual pain relief after SGB is unclear, but we believe it was effective for ischemia in temporal arteritis because it led to dilation of affected arteries or suppression of inflammation/edema of the vascular wall. Conclusion. This case demonstrates that SGB may relieve pain related to temporal arteritis and sympathetically maintained headache and orofacial pain by reducing noxious stimulation peripherally and decreasing central pain transmission centrally.

AB  - Inflammatory and immune responses play important roles following ischaemic stroke. Inflammatory responses contribute to damage and also contribute to repair. Injury to tissue triggers an immune response. This is initiated through activation of the innate immune system. In stroke there is microglial activation. This is followed by an influx of lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain, triggered by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response contributes to further tissue injury. There is also a systemic immune response to stroke, and there is a degree of immunosuppression that may contribute to the stroke patient's risk of infection. This immunosuppressive response may also be protective, with regulatory lymphocytes producing cytokines and growth factors that are neuroprotective. The specific targets of the immune response after stroke are not known, and the details of the immune and inflammatory responses are only partly understood. The role of inflammation and immune responses after stroke is twofold. The immune system may contribute to damage after stroke, but may also contribute to repair processes. The possibility that some of the immune response after stroke may be neuroprotective is exciting and suggests that deliberate enhancement of these responses may be a therapeutic option.
