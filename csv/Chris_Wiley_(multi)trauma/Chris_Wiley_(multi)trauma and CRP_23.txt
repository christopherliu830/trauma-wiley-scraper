AB  - Abstract Introduction Although increasing evidences emphasize the importance of early cardiovascular evaluation in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) of unexplained aetiology, impaired masturbation-induced erections in young men are usually overlooked and habitually presumed to be psychological origin. Aims To evaluate the young men presenting weaker masturbatory erection with no sexual intercourse (WME-NS) and verify if this cohort have early cardiovascular risks associated with ED. Methods Male subjects aged 18?40 years with WME-NS were screened by analyzing detailed sexual intercourse and masturbatory history. The age-matched ED and non-ED population were identified by using International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). All subjects with acute and/or chronic diseases (including diagnosed hypertension and diabetes) and long-term pharmacotherapy were excluded. Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR), systemic vascular parameters and biochemical indicators related to metabolism were assessed. Main Outcome Measures Comparison analysis and logistic regression analysis were conducted among WME-NS, ED and non-ED population. Results In total, 78 WME-NS cases (mean 28.99?±?5.92 years), 179 ED cases (mean 30.69?±?5.21 years) and 43 non-ED cases (mean 28.65?±?4.30 years) were screened for analysis. Compared with non-ED group, WME-NS group had higher prevalence of early ED risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, high level of glycosylated serum protein and abnormal NPTR. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed endothelia dysfunction (odds ratio: 8.83 vs. 17.11, both P?<?0.001) was the independent risk factor for both WME-NS and ED. Conclusions Weaker masturbatory erection may be a sign of early cardiovascular risk associated with ED in young men without sexual intercourse. More studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical benefits by targeting these formulated strategies. Huang Y-P, Chen B, Yao F-J, Chen S-F, Ouyang B, Deng C-H, and Huang Y-R.

AB  - Abstract Creatine (Cr), one of the most popular nutritional supplements among athletes, has been recently shown to prevent the cytotoxicity caused by different oxidative stressors in various mammalian cell lines, including C2C12 myoblasts, via a direct antioxidant activity. Here, the effect of Cr on the differentiating capacity of C2C12 cells exposed to H2O2 has been investigated. Differentiation into myotubes was monitored using morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular techniques. Treatment with H2O2 (1 h) not only caused a significant (30%) loss of cell viability, but also abrogated the myogenic ability of surviving C2C12. Cr-supplementation (24 h prior to H2O2 treatment) was found to prevent these effects. Interestingly, H2O2-challenged cells preconditioned with the established antioxidants trolox or N-acetyl-cysteine, although cytoprotected, did not display the same differentiating ability characterizing oxidatively-injured, Cr-supplemented cells. Besides acting as an antioxidant, Cr increased the level of muscle regulatory factors and IGF1 (an effect partly refractory to oxidative stress), the cellular availability of phosphocreatine and seemed to exert some mitochondrially-targeted protective activity. It is concluded that Cr preserves the myogenic ability of oxidatively injured C2C12 via a pleiotropic mechanism involving not only its antioxidant capacity, but also the contribution to cell energy charge and effects at the transcriptional level which common bona fide antioxidants lack.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are frequently used to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and may be part of multimodal analgesic regimes. The objective of this review was to evaluate the overall benefit vs. harm of perioperative glucocorticoids in patients undergoing hip or knee surgery. A wide search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. A systematic approach was used, starting from the PRISMA recommendations. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used for risk of bias assessment. Studies were divided into three groups: systemic glucocorticoid administration analogous to >?10?mg or ≤?10?mg dexamethasone, and local glucocorticoid administration. Seventeen studies with data from 1081 patients were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Benefit (of any kind) with glucocorticoid vs. placebo was reported in 15 studies. PONV was reduced with systemic glucocorticoid. Pain was reduced with high-dose systemic and local glucocorticoid, but not with low-dose systemic glucocorticoid. Systemic inflammatory markers were reduced with low-dose and high-dose systemic glucocorticoid, and with local glucocorticoid. Functional recovery was improved with local glucocorticoid. All studies were small-sized and none sufficiently powered to meaningfully evaluate uncommon adverse events. Most of the local administration studies had poor scientific quality (high risk of bias). Due to clinical heterogeneity and poor scientific quality, no meta-analysis was performed. In conclusion, in addition to PONV reduction with low-dose systemic glucocorticoid, this review supports high-dose systemic glucocorticoid to ameliorate post-operative pain after hip and knee surgery. However, large-scale safety and dose-finding studies are warranted before final recommendations.

AB  - Summary Angio-oedema (AE) is a known adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy. Over the past several decades, evidence of failure to diagnose this important and potentially fatal reaction is commonly found in the literature. Because this reaction is often seen first in the primary care setting, a review was undertaken to analyse and document the keys to both diagnostic criteria as well as to investigate potential risk factors for ACE-I AE occurrence. A general review of published literature was conducted through Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database, targeting ACE-I-related AE pathomechanism, diagnosis, epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical decision making and treatment. The incidence and severity of AE appears to be on the rise and there is evidence of considerable delay in diagnosis contributing to significant morbidity and mortality for patients. The mechanism of AE due to ACE-I drugs is not fully understood, but some genomic and metabolomic information has been correlated. Additional epidemiologic data and clinical treatment outcome predictors have been evaluated, creating a basis for future work on the development of clinical prediction tools to aid in risk identification and diagnostic differentiation. Accurate recognition of AE by the primary care provider is essential to limit the rising morbidity associated with ACE-I treatment-related AE. Research findings on the phenotypic indicators relevant to this group of patients as well as basic research into the pathomechanism of AE are available, and should be used in the construction of better risk analysis and clinical diagnostic tools for ACE-I AE.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.

AB  - It has been recognized for some time that cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are, to a major extent, inflammatory disorders associated with an environment characterized by a sedentary lifestyle together with abundant intakes of calories. Systemic low-level inflammation is suggested to be a cause as well as consequence of pathological processes with local tumor necrosis factor α production as an important biological driver. It is hypothesized that physical inactivity contributes to an enhanced proinflammatory burden independently of obesity, as regular muscle contractions mediate signals with myokines/cytokines as important messengers, which suppress proinflammatory activity at distant sites as well as within skeletal muscle. Muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to possess a central role in anti-inflammatory activities and health beneficial effects in relation to physical exercise. It is discussed how this fits the consistent observation that enhanced plasma levels of IL-6 represent a strong risk marker in chronic disorders associated with systemic low-level inflammation and all-cause mortality.

AB  - Abstract Aim Over the past several decades, there has been a growing research interest in the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This review aims to summarize evidence in support of this relationship, to discuss biological mechanisms that might explain it, and to explore the translational impact by examining evidence from trials of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of schizophrenia. Methods This narrative review of the literature summarizes evidence from observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and to discuss associated implications for treatment. Results Epidemiological evidence and animal models support a hypothesis of maternal immune activation during pregnancy, which increases the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. Several biomarker studies have found associations between classical pro-inflammatory cytokines and schizophrenia. The precise biological mechanisms by which inflammatory processes might contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain unclear, but likely include the actions of microglia and the complement system. Importantly, several trials provide evidence that certain anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents show beneficial effects in the treatment of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is a need for further precision-focused basic science and translational research. Conclusions Increasing our understanding of the role of inflammation in schizophrenia will enable novel opportunities for therapeutic and preventative interventions that are informed by the underlying pathogenesis of this complex disorder.
