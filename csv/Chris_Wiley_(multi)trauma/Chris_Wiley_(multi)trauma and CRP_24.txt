AB  - It has been recognized for some time that cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are, to a major extent, inflammatory disorders associated with an environment characterized by a sedentary lifestyle together with abundant intakes of calories. Systemic low-level inflammation is suggested to be a cause as well as consequence of pathological processes with local tumor necrosis factor α production as an important biological driver. It is hypothesized that physical inactivity contributes to an enhanced proinflammatory burden independently of obesity, as regular muscle contractions mediate signals with myokines/cytokines as important messengers, which suppress proinflammatory activity at distant sites as well as within skeletal muscle. Muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to possess a central role in anti-inflammatory activities and health beneficial effects in relation to physical exercise. It is discussed how this fits the consistent observation that enhanced plasma levels of IL-6 represent a strong risk marker in chronic disorders associated with systemic low-level inflammation and all-cause mortality.

AB  - Summary These first German S2k guidelines for bacterial skin and soft tissue infections were developed as one chapter of the recommendations for ?calculated initial parenteral treatment of bacterial infections? issued under the auspices of the Paul-Ehrlich Society, of which the main part is presented here.Well-calculated antibiotic therapies require precise diagnostic criteria. Erysipelas is defined as non-purulent infection considered to be caused by beta-hemolytic strepto?cocci. It is diagnosed clinically by its bright-red erythema and early fever or chills at disease onset. Penicillin is the treatment of choice. Limited soft tissue infection (cellulitis) is usually caused by Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, frequently originates from chronic wounds and presents with a more violaceous-red hue and only rarely with initial fever or chills. Treatment consists of first- or second-?generation cephalosporins or flucloxacillin (IV).Severe cellulitis is a purulent, partially necrotic infection which extends through tissue boundaries to fascias and requires surgical management in addition to antibiotics. Moreover, it frequently fulfills the criteria for ?complicated soft tissue infections?, as previously defined by the Food and Drug Administration for use in clinical trials (they include comorbidities such as uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral artery disease, neutropenia). It requires antibiotics which besides S. aureus target anaerobic and/or gramnegative bacteria. The rare so-called necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections represent a distinct entity. They are characterized by rapid, life-threatening progression due to special bacterial toxins that cause ischemic necrosis and shock and need rapid and thorough debridement in addition to appropriate antibiotics. For cutaneous abscesses the first-line treatment is adequate drainage. Additional antibiotic therapy is required only under certain circumstances (e.g., involvement of the face, hands, or anogenital region, or if drainage is somehow complicated).The present guidelines also contain consensus-based recommendations for higher doses of antibiotics than those approved or usually given in clinical trials. The goal is to deliver rational antibiotic treatment that is both effective and well-tolerated and that exerts no unnecessary selection pressure in terms of multidrug resistance.

AB  - Abstract Background Immunosuppressive drugs may prevent or partially reverse progression of renal AA-amyloidosis, a rare complication of Crohn's disease, often fatal due to renal failure. Materials and methods The clinical, biological and pathological data of 16 patients treated since 1976 were reviewed. Serum amyloid A was determined in surviving patients. Results The median age of the 16 patients (13 men) was 23·5 years (range 16?69). At Crohn's disease onset, Montreal phenotypes were similar to reported data. Out of 15 patients with renal insufficiency, 8 developed a nephrotic syndrome and 7 a low grade proteinuria. The single patient without renal insufficiency had nephrotic syndrome. A significant correlation (P < 0·05) between the extension of renal amyloid A and sclerosis was found in 12 patients. One patient had a 10 year remission of nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive drugs. In 6 patients treated with anti-TNF-α (Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-α) agents, anaphylactic reaction (1/6), death from septic shock (1/6), 5-year remission (1/6) or reduction of nephrotic syndrome (1/6) and stabilization of renal insufficiency (2/6) were observed. Surgery was performed in 10 patients. Kidney transplantation was performed in 5 of the 8 patients dialysed for end-stage renal failure. Among 6/16 patients (37%) still alive, 3 belong to the 5 transplanted patients (survival: 3?20 years) and 3 to the anti-TNF-α drugs treated patients; all but one exhibited a low serum amyloid A level. Conclusions Suppression of Crohn's disease inflammation potentially leads to the control of amyloid A production, assessed by a decrease of serum amyloid A. Kidney transplantation provides a long survival.
