AB  - Objectives Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vestibular end-organ disease. This article aims to summarize research findings and key discoveries of BPPV. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, nonsurgical, and surgical management are discussed. Methods A comprehensive review of the literature regarding BPPV up through June 2018 was performed. Results BPPV is typified by sudden, brief episodes of vertigo precipitated by specific head movements. While often self-limited, BPPV can have a considerable impact on quality of life. The diagnosis can be established with a Dix-Hallpike maneuver for the posterior and anterior canals, or supine roll test for the horizontal canal, and typically does not require additional ancillary testing. Understanding the pathophysiology of both canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis has allowed for the development of various repositioning techniques. Of these, the particle repositioning maneuver is an effective way to treat posterior canal BPPV, the most common variant. Options for operative intervention are available for intractable cases or patients with severe and frequent recurrences. Conclusions A diagnosis of BPPV can be made through clinical history along with diagnostic maneuvers. BPPV is generally amenable to in-office repositioning techniques. For a small subset of patients with intractable BPPV, canal occlusion can be considered. Level of Evidence N/A

AB  - Abstract Pain afflicts up to 20% of the population in the Western World and represents a challenge for clinicians and scientists because of a large interindividual variability in: (a) pain sensitivity, (b) in development of chronic pain and (c) in the response to analgesics. The personal and socioeconomic costs are considerable. The genetic approach to investigate pain has identified several potential areas of interest to understand genetic predisposition, the occurrence of pain and the variability of pain in human and in mice. In this paper, we will focus on genetic methods and variables influencing pain and pharmacotherapy elucidating the complexity of the area. Examples of promising candidate genes and allelic variables have been intensively studied and the number has been increasing during recent years with more or less reproducible results.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the extent to which inflammatory markers explain the association between handgrip strength and mortality. Methods Analyses of data from The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Handgrip strength and inflammatory marker data (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) were collected at baseline (2004/5) and inflammatory marker data at follow-up (2012/13). Participant data were linked with death records. General linear models were used to explore associations between handgrip strength and inflammatory markers at follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine associations between grip strength and risk of death. Models were estimated with the covariates age, sex, wealth, physical activity, smoking, depressive symptoms, long-standing illness, and adiposity. Results The sample comprised of 5,240 participants (mean age 65.9 (SD 9.4) years; 53.8% female). Over an average 9.7 ± 1.4 years follow-up, there were 650 deaths. Inverse associations were evident between handgrip strength and change in inflammatory markers in women only. There was an association between grip strength and lower risk of mortality in women (hazard ratio = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74, 0.98) after adjusting for age and wealth. The association was attenuated after adjustment for clinical and behavioral risk factors (0.92; 0.79, 1.07), and further attenuated after adjusting for inflammatory markers (0.95; 0.82, 1.11). Conclusion Higher grip strength is associated with lower levels of inflammation at 8-year follow-up, and inflammatory markers partly explained the association between handgrip strength and mortality.

AB  - Abstract The fat embolism syndrome is an important complication of patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies because of severe morbidity and mortality. Our recent experience with three cases that survived with intensive supportive care and prompt use of transfusion stimulates this review. A high index of suspicion, prompt use of diagnostic tools, and aggressive clinical management are the keys to a successful outcome. Am. J. Hematol. 79:61?67, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Patients with heart failure (HF) are at an increased risk of stroke, sudden death and venous thromboembolism, which are all linked to thrombus formation (thrombogenesis). The present ?viewpoint? article will discuss how the prothrombotic state in HF may be perpetuated by a chronic inflammatory state that is maladaptive. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that thrombogenesis and endothelial (dys)function can be intimately linked to inflammation in HF.

AB  - Abstract Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) oil has been receiving increasing attention due to its nutritional and functional potentials. However, its application as a novel food ingredient has not yet been fully explored. This review summarizes the chemical composition, extraction technologies, potential health benefits, and current applications of krill oil, with the aim of providing suggestions for its exploitation. Krill oil is a unique lipid consisting of diverse lipid classes and is characterized by a high concentration (39.29% to 80.69%) of phospholipids (PLs) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It also contains considerable amounts of bioactive minor components such as astaxanthin, sterols, tocopherols, vitamin A, flavonoids, and minerals. The current technologies used in krill oil production are solvent extraction, nonsolvent extraction, super/subcritical fluid extraction, and enzyme-assisted pretreatment extraction, which all greatly influence the yield and quality of the end-product. In addition, krill oil has been documented to have various health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, women's health, neuroprotection, and anticancer activities. Although krill oil products used for dietary supplements have been commercially available, few studies have attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms to elucidate how exactly the krill oil exerts different biological activities. Further studies should focus on this to improve the development of krill oil products for human consumption.
