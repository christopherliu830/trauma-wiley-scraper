AB  - The antioxidant effects of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) contribute substantially to the health benefits of this compound. Resveratrol has been shown to be a scavenger of a number of free radicals. However, the direct scavenging activities of resveratrol are relatively poor. The antioxidant properties of resveratrol in vivo are more likely to be attributable to its effect as a gene regulator. Resveratrol inhibits NADPH oxidase-mediated production of ROS by down-regulating the expression and activity of the oxidase. This polyphenolic compound reduces mitochondrial superoxide generation by stimulating mitochondria biogenesis. Resveratrol prevents superoxide production from uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase by up-regulating the tetrahydrobiopterin-synthesizing enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. In addition, resveratrol increases the expression of various antioxidant enzymes. Some of the gene-regulating effects of resveratrol are mediated by the histone/protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 or by the nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2. In this review article, we have also summarized the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol observed in clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract In an effort to identify tumor-associated proteins from plasma of tumor-bearing mice that may be used as diagnostic biomarkers, we developed a strategy that combines a tumor xenotransplantation model in nude mice with comparative proteomic technology. Five human cancer cell lines (SC-M1, HONE-1, CC-M1, OECM1, GBM 8401) derived from stomach, nasopharyngeal, colon, oral and brain cancers were subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice and compared to control nude mice injected with phosphate-buffered saline. One month later, plasma from mice inoculated with cancer cells was collected for proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Comparison of plasma 2-DE maps from tumor-bearing mice with those produced from control mice revealed the overexpression of several mouse acute phase proteins (APPs) such as haptoglobin. Another APP, serum amyloid A (SAA), was found only in mice bearing tumors induced by the stomach cancer cell line SC-M1, which has not previously been demonstrated in xenotransplatation experiment. Furthermore, by using immunohistochemistry, SAA and haptoglobin were found to originate from the mouse hosts and not from the human cancer cell line donors. The protein alterations were further confirmed on patients with stomach cancers where up-regulated levels of SAA were also observed. These results indicate that APPs may be used as nonspecific tumor-associated serum markers. SAA in particular may serve as a potential marker for detecting stomach cancer. Taken together, the combination of the xenotransplatation model in nude mice and proteomics analysis provided a valuable impact for clinical applications in cancer diagnostics. In addition, our findings demonstrate that a panel of APPs might serve as screening biomarkers for early cancer detection.

AB  - Background: Due to the high prevalence of obesity in adults, nutrition support clinicians are encountering greater numbers of obese patients who require nutrition support during hospitalization. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity. Method: A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding management of nutrition support in patients with obesity was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process, that includes consideration of the strength of the evidence together with the risks and benefits to the patient, was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. Questions: (1) Do clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non?intensive care unit (ICU) patients? (2) How should energy requirements be determined in obese critically ill or hospitalized non-ICU patients? (3) Are clinical outcomes improved with hypocaloric, high protein diets in hospitalized patients? (4) In obese patients who have had a malabsorptive or restrictive surgical procedure, what micronutrients should be evaluated?
