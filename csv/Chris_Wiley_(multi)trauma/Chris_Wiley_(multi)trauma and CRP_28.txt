AB  - Abstract The study aim was to report survival and morbidity of all patients in Sweden with peritoneal mesothelioma treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as well as investigate whether the survival has increased on a population level since this treatment was nationalized 2011. Study data were collected from the Swedish HIPEC registry and the Swedish National Cancer Registry. All patients with peritoneal mesothelioma scheduled for CRS/HIPEC treatment in Sweden January 2011 to March 2018 were retrieved from the Swedish HIPEC registry. Clinicopathological and survival data were collected. For population-level analysis, all patients with diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) were identified from the Swedish National Cancer Registry and data were retrieved from two separate 5-year time periods: 1999-2003 and 2011-2015. Thirty-two patients were accepted for CRS/HIPEC. Four were open/close cases. Two-year survival rate was 84% or 59% when excluding borderline peritoneal mesotheliomas (n = 17). Median overall survival was not reached. Grade III-IV Clavien-Dindo events occurred in 22% with no mortality. From the national cancer registry, 102 DMPM cases were retrieved: 40 cases between 1999 and 2003, and 62 cases between 2011 and 2015 (corresponding to an increase from 0.9 to 1.24/million/year, P = .04). Six patients (10%) received CRS/HIPEC in the second period. Median OS increased between periods from 7 to 15 months and 5-year survival from 14% to 29% (P = .03). Peritoneal mesothelioma of both borderline and DMPM subtypes undergoing CRS/HIPEC have good long-term survival. The incidence of DMPM in Sweden has increased. Overall survival has increased alongside the introduction of CRS/HIPEC, which may be a contributing factor.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores how to approach joint pain from a rheumatological perspective. It presents the case examples of an on-call SHO bleeped to review a 60 year old lady with a hot, swollen, painful right wrist and a 55 year old lady referred to the Rheumatologist by the general practitioner with a two week history of painful, swollen left wrist joint. Reactive arthritis is often seen following gastrointestinal and genito-urinary infections with specific micro-organisms. Pre-existing rheumatological disease increases the risk of septic arthritis and although the leflunomide was stopped it has a long half-life conferring an immunosuppressed state. Erythema of the skin overlying the affected joint raises the probability of either septic arthritis or crystal arthropathy. Variability in disease presentation and disease evolution over time constantly revise SQs. Paying attention to the SQs in flux ensures that are consciously considering other possibilities.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Severe lithium poisoning requires intensive and prolonged hemodialysis (HD) treatment in addition to supportive therapy. Aggressive dialytic therapy can bring about hypophosphatemia, especially, in those patients who are normo- or hypophosphatemic to begin with. We report here the use of phosphorus (P)-enriched HD in a hypophosphatemic patient with lithium poisoning. A 58-year-old woman with a long history of bipolar disorder treated with chronic lithium therapy presented with progressively worsening confusion and incoherent speech. She was noted to be confused with a labile mood. The serum levels were lithium 3.6?mM, creatinine 1.7?mg/dL, Na 136?mM, K 4.2?mM, CO2 21?mM, BUN 23?mg/dL, and P 2.1?mg/dL. After a conventional, 4-h HD session, she became more hypophosphatemic with a P level of 1.8?mg/dL. A P-enriched dialysate, prepared by adding a Fleet? oral saline laxative preparation (containing NaH2PO4.H2O and Na2HPO4.7H2O) to the ?base concentrate? of a dual concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate generating system to obtain a final dialysate containing 3?mg (0.97?mM) of P/dL was used. She underwent 3 subsequent HD sessions using this P-enriched dialysate, followed by normalization of the serum levels of both lithium and P. Our data suggest that hypophosphatemic patients suffering from severe lithium poisoning requiring intensive HD therapy and becoming more hypophosphatemic as a result of the dialysis treatment can be further dialyzed with a P-enriched dialysate both to treat the lithium poisoning and to rectify the hypophosphatemia. In general, the use of such dialysates can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of dialysis-induced hypophosphatemia.

AB  - Valproic acid toxicity is not infrequent and is difficult to treat, as there is no specific antidote. In the past, this drug was considered unremovable by extracorporeal methods because of the highly protein bound state (90?95%). However, recent reports suggest that the toxicokinetics of valproate vary considerably from the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels, and at higher concentrations protein-binding sites become saturated. The drug's relatively low molecular weight (144?Da), small volume of distribution (0.13?0.23?L/kg), and saturable protein binding render it potentially amenable to extracorporeal removal, but published experience is scant and there are only a few reported instances in which patients were successfully treated with extracorporeal methods. Here we report the case of a patient with serious valproate toxicity treated with simultaneous ?in series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. A 35-year-old homeless male presented to the emergency department after ingesting 120 pills of valproic acid. Initial valproic acid level was 59?µg/mL. Urine drug screen was negative and serum chemistries including LFTs were normal. He was treated with activated charcoal and admitted to the intensive care unit. 4 h later, he developed respiratory failure and became hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequently, the valproic acid level was found to be 553?µg/mL and a decision was made to employ extracorporeal methods for drug removal. ?In series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were done for 4?h and simultaneous blood samples for measurement of valproic acid levels were obtained as blood entered the hemoperfusion column (arterial) and as it exited the hemodialysis membrane (venous). Extraction ratio, whole blood, and plasma clearances were calculated and they compared substantially with the published data. The above measures decreased valproate levels from 572.6 (pre-dialysis level) to 203.2?µg/mL. This was followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for 18?h, which sustained the drug removal and prevented significant post-dialytic rebound. This is the first reported instance in which these three methods were administered together successfully in the management of valproic acid toxicity.

AB  - The purpose of the poster was to demonstrate how Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing is utilized daily within the multicultural pediatric population at the hospital for sick children. Methods:? Within this diverse and challenging population, the hemodialysis nurse is constantly challenged to ensure that the nursing care provided to the patient is reflective and meeting the needs of our pediatric population and their families. Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing has provided an avenue to ensure that the many cultures of our clients are maintained and respected. A case study will be used to show the integration of Leininger's theory. Resources for supporting the cultural values of the hemodialysis patient will also be identified. Conclusion:? The use of a transcultural nursing model enhances the quality and effectiveness of the patient care provider for the pediatric hemodialysis patient at the hospital for sick children. Utilization of a transcultural nursing model ensures that the patients and their families are respected and supported for their diverse backgrounds by the hemodialysis nurse. The hemodialysis nurses are providing quality nursing care which reflects the needs and concerns of a multicultural population.

AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.

AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.

AB  - Introduction:? The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) has established target hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11?12?g/dL for all dialysis patients. For patients who leave an inpatient hospitalization with an Hb under this target, it is hypothesized that several factors contribute to the length of time required to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL after hospitalization. Objective:? To identify factors contributing to a decreased likelihood of reaching this target Hb. Methods:? Using the first hospitalization of patients who initiated HD in 1999 and who were regularly treated with EPO, we identified those with a mean Hb of less than 11?g/dL on EPO claims during the same month as their index hospitalization. Patients were then followed up to see how long it took them to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL, censored at death, re-hospitalization, a switch of modality, or suspension of EPO treatment. Results:? A total of 6050 HD patients were identified. 3 months after hospitalization, 70% had achieved 11?g/dL, and 12% had been censored. For the remaining patients who eventually reached 11?g/dL, the average number of additional months required was 2.69 (SE of 0.09). From proportional hazards regression on the time (in months) to achieving an Hb of 11?g/dL, factors that significantly decreased the likelihood of reaching a target Hb included: a diagnosis on the index hospitalization of CHF or hepatic disease, a low Hb prior to the hospitalization, a high dose of EPO prior to the hospitalization, and a longer hospital stay. Conclusions:? Patients with anemia after hospitalization are at high risk of both persistent anemia and rehospitalization. It is important to address patient comorbidities, to ensure adequate medication usage, and to monitor patient progress to prevent hospitalizations and potential impact on Hb levels.

AB  - Background:? Daily hemodialysis (DHD) markedly ameliorates cardiovascular instability (CVI) and discomfort (DIS) during dialysis, but patients continue to have some of these problems during DHD. We studied what contributed to these problems during 4445 DHD in 23 patients. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR), maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP), and a subjective score of patients' overall evaluation of the quality of dialysis (OEQ), adding a score of 14 symptoms (0 best, 40 worst). Independent variables were ultrapure dialysate and biocompatible dialysis (UP) (1626 dialyses) vs. conventional dialysis (CONV) (2819 dialyses), ultrafiltration (Uf) as percentage of body weight (BW), pre?post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1 kg?BW?1), and target??post-dialysis BW (Ta-Po BW). Relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased by 1.6?±?13/min; MAX BP fall was 25?±?20?mmHg; OV BP fall was 13?±?22?mmHg; OEQ?=?0.6 ±?1.2. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=??BUN???0.12?+?Ta-Po BW?????1.8?+?K/V???1.1???5 r?=?0.13, p?<?0.0001 MAX BP?=?CONV???8?+?T???0.2???Ta-Po BW ?????6?+?Uf???2.7??13 r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001 OV BP?=?CONV???11?+?Uf???4???Ta-Po BW ????4?+??BUN???0.3???9 r?=?0.35, p?<?0.0001 OEQ?=?K/V???0.3???Ta-Po BW???0.1???0.2 r?=?0.20, p?<?0.0001 Conclusion:? To minimize drop in BP and hypotensive crashes, use of ultrapure dialysate and a biocompatible membrane (UP) was by far the most important factor, followed by slowing dialysis. To avoid post-dialysis tachycardia and discomfort during dialysis, slow dialysis was most important. Overall, ?fast? dialysis and use of ?impure? regular dialysate appear to be the major dialysis factors causing CV instability and discomfort during daily hemodialysis.

AB  - Starting any new program, especially one without a proven track record, raises questions about cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Purpose:? This research investigated how long patients should be expected to remain as daily/nocturnal hemodialysis patients in order to justify the initial investment in sending them home. Methods:? Costs for 10 short-hour daily (SHD) and 12 slow nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) were compared with the savings incurred by switching those patients from conventional hemodialysis (CHD). One-time expenses were divided by net savings to determine the minimum length of time the patients should be expected to remain at home on these modalities. Results:? One-time training, installation, and home equipment expenses were comparable for the SHD and NHD patients. NHD patients without monitoring noticed that these costs recovered in 1 year. NHD patients with monitoring took approximately 16 months to recover these costs, while initial SHD costs were offset in 20 months. Conclusions:? Patients selected for home NHD and SHD should be expected to be able to remain at home for at least 12?20 months. Subsequent investigation indicates that these costs and time periods may be further reduced. NHD Costs ($Can) Daily (SHD) Excluding monitoring Including monitoring One-time $21,281 $19,772 $21,465 Savings $12,836 $20,484 $16,703 ROI (years) 1.7 1.0 1.3

AB  - Introduction:? A bioartificial kidney, which consists of a continuous hemofilter and a bioartificial tubule device using proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), is desired to develop for preventing long-term complications in hemodialysis patients. A bioartificial tubule device should function for a long duration in terms of the simplicity and the economy. Continuous hemofiltration with 10?L/day of filtrate could maintain plasma urea, creatinine and ?2-microglobulin in patients at low levels compared to those in standard hemodialysis patients. Methods:? 6 bioartificial tubule devices, in which LLC-PK1 cells were grown on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber capillaries (membrane area: 0.4?m2, 1600 fibers), were used to evaluate the transport ability of H2O, glucose and Na+, and leak rates of urea and creatinine for 2 weeks when the medium containing 50?mg/dL of urea and 5.0?mg/dL of creatinine was perfused inside of the cell-attached membranes and another medium containing 2.5?g/dL of albumin was perfused outside of the membranes. Scanning electron micrograph of cross-sectional findings of the hollow fibers was taken at 6, 10, and 14 days after formation of confluence. Results:? By conversion into 1?m2 of membrane area, transport of H2O, glucose, and Na+ was 6266?± 995?mL/day, 22832?±?7240 mg/day, and 941.3?±?180 mEq/day, respectively at 6 days after confluence. Leak rates of urea and creatinine across the cell-attached membranes were 22?±?6.1% and 19.2?±?4.9 with albumin addition, whereas 13.1?±?1.9% and 12.2?±?1.6 without albumin addition. Transport capacity of these components and the leak rates had continued for 10?13 days, and decreased thereafter because of the formation of the multilayers. Bioartificial tubule devices with membrane area 1.0?m2 can reach the targeted amounts of H2O, glucose, and Na+ transports when 6?L of 10?L/day of hemofiltrate has to be regenerated, substituting 4?L with meal and drinks.

AB  - Many synthetic polymeric membranes have been widely used for blood purification therapies. Among them polyester polymer alloy (PEPA) membrane shows unique blood compatibility and filtration characteristics. Objective:? To evaluate blood compatibility and filtration characteristics of 3 different PEPA membranes, including FLX (PEPA only), FDX (PEPA with polyvinylpyrrolidone, (PVP) as a hydrophilic agent), and FDY (PEPA with PVP) that has larger pore diameter. Methods:? Ultrafilters with 3 PEPA membranes (FLX, FDX, FDY, Nikkiso, Tokyo) were compared with those with polysulfone (PS; NK-PS, Nikkiso, Tokyo) for blood compatibility in vivo. Also, ultrafilters with PEPA, PS, and cellulose triacetate (CTA; FB-110GA, Nipro, Osaka) membranes were also investigated for filtration characteristics of albumin in aqueous in vitro. Results:? FDY, the latest version of the three PEPA, showed excellent small changes in C5a concentration during the treatment right after switching from PS membrane, leaving no significant changes in other biocompatible indices. First 60?min of the time course of s.c. for albumin were shown below taken under aqueous low albumin concentration, i.e., 2.42???10?3?kg/dm3. The time-dependent patterns were totally different from each other in 5 filters. Generally speaking, PS takes a peak value 20?40?min after starting the experiment, depending on the flow conditions. Since PEPA is a hydrophobic material, it showed high s.c. for albumin in FLX (PEPA with no PVP) and never reached plateau. With a hydrophilic agent (PVP), the s.c. greatly reduced in FDX and showed little time-dependent change. By enlarging the pore diameter in FDY, the s.c. increased in accordance with the enlargement. Conclusion:? Newly developed PEPA with PVP has excellent blood compatibility and has unique separation characteristics for albumin.

AB  - A decrease in hepatitis C viral load in HD patients along HD sessions has been described. It has also been proposed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation by HD could have some protective effect in hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease outcome. Aims:? (i) Measurement of HCV viral load variation and quantitation of HGF stimulation in CKD patients (HCV+ and HCV?) on HD, along the HD session. (ii) Study whether albumin HD (MARS) decreases HCV viral load and stimulates HGF, compared to HD sessions. Methods:? We performed two MARS and two HD sessions in vitro by using an extracorporeal circuit with blood bag contaminated with HCV serum with a known HCV viral load. (We used only a single blood bag for each testing.) In vivo we performed three MARS sessions. The total number of treatments was 6 in 2 patients (3 treatments each) and one HD session in 2 HCV+ patients and 5 HCV? patients (included in HD program in our center), taking samples at the start of the following HD session, to compare the results with those obtained in vitro. We took samples at the beginning, middle, and at the end of MARS sessions in vivo and in vitro and starting (15?min) and at the end and before starting the following HD session in vivo. (The interval between 2 HD sessions in HCV+ patients was 2 days.) We determined HCV viral load using Amplicor (Roche) and HGF using ELISA (R 15?min, 1537; final, 1981 HD in vitro: start, 476; 15?min, 677; final, 1236 HD in vivo: start, 2808.57; ?15?min, >8000; final, ??2605.28; ?start the following session, 2299.5 MARS in vivo: HGF starting (first session, 4633; second session, ??4390; third session, 4775); at 4?h (first session, 5443; second session, 4167; third session, 5178); final (first session, 4477; second session, 6167; third session, 5078). Conclusions:? MARS and HD sessions decreased HCV viral load and stimulated HGF both in vitro and in vivo. It is necessary to confirm these results because it could offer protective effect for HCV chronic liver disease outcome. HD seems to be the best option for patients with HCV hepatopathy. On the other hand, patients with liver disease who need to be treated with MARS could obtain not only a good clearance of toxin binding to albumin, but also the positive effects described.

AB  - Healthy nutritional status is crucial for obtaining favorable hemodialysis (HD) and transplantation results in chronic renal failure (CRF), because there is a high incidence of malnutrition in these patients. In addition, there is a remarkable loss of amino acids (AAs) during HD. Purpose:? This study examined changes in the serum AA profiles of pre- and post-HD in order to plan a strategy for providing nutritional support to patients on HD. Method:? Twenty-nine stable male patients on HD were enrolled in this study. The criteria for patient selection were urine output less than 200?mL/day, 3 times HD a week, and HD treatment for more than 12 months. Results:? Total plasma AA concentrations of pre- and post-HD were 2948.4?±?543.1 and 2279.2?±?400.8?mol/L, the difference being highly significant (p?<?0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in the level of essential AAs (EAAs, 774.4?±?163.8 vs. 643.4?±?142.5??mol/L, p?<?0.0005) and non-EAAs (2019.0?±?411.7 vs. 1539.6?±?278.3 ?mol/L, p?<?0.0001) after HD. The ratio of the EAAs to the non-EAAs increased after HD (0.39?±?0.07 vs. 0.42?±?0.07??mol/L). The level of branched chain AAs (BCAAs) of pre- and post-HD was 323.3?±?73.7 vs. 286.7?±?71.2??mol/L and that of aromatic AAs (AAAs) was 180.9?±?56.2 vs. 137.5?±?42.6??mol/L (p?<?0.0005), and the BCCA to AAA ratio increased after HD (1.8?±?0.41 vs. 2.2?±?0.57??mol/L, p?=?0.01). Among the abnormal AAs which appear in CRF, the concentrations of ?-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, 1-methyl histidine, phophoserine, and taurine decreased significantly after HD. Conclusion:? Patients revealed a large loss of AAs including abnormal-appearing AAs during HD. The ratios of EAA to non-EAA and BCAA to AAA increase significantly, which indicates the beneficial effect of HD on the metabolic recovery of the AA profile. But replacing AAs, especially EAAs with high BCAAs, is essential for maintaining nutritional status to compensate the significant loss of AAs during HD.

AB  - Serum level of nitrite plus nitrate (NO2 plus NO3), endothelin-1 (Et-1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been estimated in 20 patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment in a trial to explain the hypotension occurring in some of these patients. According to the incidence of hypotension, patients were divided into GI (n?=?10) hypotension prone patients and GII (n?=?10) hypotension resistant patients (normotensive). Clinical examination with measurement of systolic and mean arterial blood pressure was performed in all cases before and after hemodialysis (HD) settings. After HD, GI showed significant increase in the serum levels of (NO2 plus NO3), IL-1, and TNF-α, whereas a significant decrease in serum Et-1 level was noticed. GII showed no significant change in serum level of the 4 parameters mentioned above. In hypotensive patients, there was a significant positive correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and the duration of dialysis, and a significant negative correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and post dialysis systolic blood pressure, also between IL-1 and Et-1. From the previous results, it could be concluded that the vascular endothelial factors studied (NO and Et-1) together with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α contribute to the development of HD-induced hypotension in ESRF subjects which is evidenced by: (1) the coupling of decrease of blood pressure and increase in NO2 plus NO3 level after HD in group I; (2) Et-1, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor, showed a significant decrease postdialysis; and (3) levels of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) (which are potent NO inducers) were found to be significantly increased postdialysis in group I.

AB  - Kinetics of urea extraction during a single dialysis session in children are unknown, because analysis of solutes in dialysate is difficult due to their extreme dilution. >Objective:? A novel urea monitor of the Gambro Company might be of help in studying urea kinetics also in children. Methods:? We studied 107 urea kinetics in 5 adolescents aged 13?19 years, weighing 26?58?kg, and looked for influences of membrane size, blood flow, and duration of one dialysis session. Urea measurement applies to the change of electric dialysate conductivity due to ionization because of urea splitting by urease. Bicarbonate dialysis regimen was 4?5?h each, 3 times a week, using polysulfone high-flux dialyzers (Fresenius F60 or F80, depending on body size). Results:? Average 4-h urea Kt/V values for F60 (n?=?85) were 1.69±0.53 and for F80 (n?=?21) 1.63±0.25, extracted urea mass was 16.0±5.4?g and 32.5±5.4?g, respectively (p?<?0.05); Kt/V urea results for blood flows of 180?220?mL/min were 1.36±0.52 and for <180?mL/min 1.10±0.43; extracted urea mass was 17.3±8.0 and 11.7±4.9?g, respectively (p?<?0.05). Total average urea extraction ratio after 2?h of dialysis (n?=?107) was 64.8±5.6%. Extraction ratio during the 4th h of dialysis was only 15.3±4.1% and during the 5th h not more than 9.0±3.6% of total urea extraction. Conclusion:? Kinetics of urea extraction helps understanding dialysis processes in children. Adapting the size of the dialyzer according to body size raises urea extraction and maintains urea clearance Kt/V at the desired quality level. An inadequate blood flow lowers both urea extraction and urea clearance Kt/V. Prolonging dialysis beyond 4?h is, at least in concern of urea kinetic modelling, a rather ineffective means. We speculate that children with blood flow problems should be dialysed more often.
