AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Abstract Background: Perioperative enteral immunonutrition is thought to reduce postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. This study assessed the clinical effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing total gastrectomy. Methods: Well nourished patients with primary gastric cancer, fit for total gastrectomy, were randomized to either a control group with regular diet, or an immunonutrition group that received regular diet supplemented with 1000 ml/day of immunonutrients for 5 consecutive days before surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical-site infection (SSI). Secondary endpoints were rates of infectious complications, overall postoperative morbidity and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on 3?4 days after surgery. Results: Of 244 randomized patients, 117 were allocated to the control group and 127 received immunonutrition. SSIs occurred in 27 patients in the immunonutrition group and 23 patients in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 1·09, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·66 to 1·78). Infectious complications were observed in 30 patients in the immunonutrition group and 27 in the control group (RR 1·11, 0·59 to 2·08). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 30·8 and 26·1 per cent respectively (RR 1·18, 0·78 to 1·78). The median CRP value was 11·8 mg/dl in the immunonutrition group and 9·2 mg/dl in the control group (P = 0·113). Conclusion: Five-day preoperative enteral immunonutrition failed to demonstrate any clear advantage in terms of early clinical outcomes or modification of the systemic acute-phase response in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing elective total gastrectomy.

AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy remain at increased risk for developing febrile neutropenia (FN). For this heterogeneous population, a biomarker based risk stratification of FN patients may be a useful clinical tool. We hypothesized that serum biomarkers during initial presentation of an FN event could be predictive of subsequent clinical outcome. Procedure Eighty-nine FN events from 36 non-consecutive subjects were analyzed. ?High-risk? FN criteria included prolonged hospitalization (≥7 days), admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or a microbiology confirmed bacteremia. Patients with ?low risk? FN had none of the above. Biomarkers measured during the first 2 days of FN hospitalization were analyzed and correlated with respective clinical outcome. Results Of the 89 FN events, 44 (49%) fulfilled pre-defined high-risk criteria and 45 (51%) were low-risk. Procalcitonin level (>0.11?ng/ml) was found to be associated with the high-risk FN outcome with sensitivity of 97%. With an increase in log scale by 1, the odds of being high-risk FN increased twofold. Hs-CRP >100?mg/L had sensitivity of 88% in predicting high-risk FN. The odds of a high-risk FN event increased by approximately 1.8-fold with an increase in the log scale of hs-CRP by 1 (10-fold). In univariate analysis, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were statistically significant and associated with high-risk FN. However, no statistically significant difference was found for IL-1α, sIL-2Ra, IL-3, or TNF-α. Conclusions Biomarkers with appropriate critical threshold values may be a useful clinical tool for appropriate risk stratification of children with FN.

AB  - Objective To describe the frequency and extent of complications associated with lateral caudal axial pattern flaps used to cover large traumatic or excision skin defects on the dorsum, gluteal, and perineal region in 13 dogs. Study Design Case series. Animals Thirteen client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 8 institutions were reviewed for dogs treated with a lateral caudal axial pattern flap, including cases in which the procedure was combined with other reconstructive techniques. The flap length relative to the tail length, location of tail skin incision, size and cause of the defect, and short- and long-term complications were recorded. Results Thirteen dogs were included, 11 with tumors and 2 with traumatic skin loss. The mean estimated length of the flap relative to tail length was 51% (range 33?70%). Four dogs had wound complications. This included 2 dogs with minor postoperative wound complications (mild distal dehiscence) that did not require surgical revision and 2 dogs with major complications that required surgical revision. Two of these 4 dogs had distal flap necrosis, one was revised surgically and one was managed conservatively. In these 2 dogs, the flap length was estimated as 80% and 65% of the tail length, respectively. At 30 days, flaps in all dogs were completely healed. No long-term complications were recorded in any dog. For some dogs, the reconstruction was not obvious, with only the change in hair direction and color noticeable. Conclusion Lateral caudal axial pattern flap is a reconstructive option for gluteal, dorsal, and perineal skin defects in dogs. Distal flap necrosis and dehiscence due to wound infection occurred in 4 dogs that required additional wound care but not always surgical revision.

AB  - Abstract Ankle and foot injuries are the most common musculoskeletal injuries presenting to Australian EDs and are associated with a large societal and economic impact. The quality of ED care provided to patients with ankle and foot fractures or soft tissue injuries is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common ankle and foot injuries in the ED. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English language articles published in the last 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 1242 articles, of which 71 were included in the review (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?35 systematic reviews and n?=?14 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the ankle and foot in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. Following a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of the Ottawa ankle rules, ED clinicians should not only provide a diagnosis, but rate the severity of soft tissue injuries, or stability of fractures and dislocations, which are the pivotal decision points in guiding ED treatment, specialist referral and the follow-up plan.

AB  - Abstract Inflammation and immunity development are well recognized as responses to tumor treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). To demonstrate that another major host response effector process, acute phase response, may be also induced by this cancer treatment modality, the expression of serum amyloid P component (SAP) acknowledged as a hallmark acute phase reactant in the mouse was investigated following PDT of murine FsaR fibrosarcomas. The results reveal almost 150-fold increase in the expression of SAP gene in the liver of mice bearing tumors treated by Photofrin-mediated PDT, while serum SAP levels increased around 50-fold at the peak interval about 24 hr post PDT. The same tumor treatment induced also the liver gene upregulation and serum levels elevation of another established acute phase reactant, mannose-binding lectin A (MBL-A). Both SAP and MBL-A were found to accumulate in PDT-treated tumors, but this includes local production because their genes in these tumor tissues were upregulated as well. Gene encoding C-reactive protein (CRP) was also upregulated almost 7-fold in the same tumor tissues, suggesting a rare example of CRP participation in host response of the mouse. Interleukin-6 and glucocorticoid hormones were identified as major mediators promoting tumor PDT-induced upregulation of liver SAP gene. Moreover, glucocorticoids were found to act as critical inducers of SAP gene upregulation in PDT-treated tumors. The study definitely proves the occurrence of a strong acute phase response following tumor PDT, and reveals that glucocorticoid hormones released during this development impact the expression of host response-relevant genes in PDT-treated tumors. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to review the history, clinical course, treatment, and outcome of movement disorders in children and young people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Case notes were reviewed retrospectively of children and young people who presented with movement disorders in CRPS to our tertiary paediatric pain service over a period of 13 years. Ten children with CRPS presented with movement disorders (eight females, two males). The age at first presentation with symptoms of CRPS ranged from 8 to 15 years (mean 11y 2mo, median 13y). The most common movement disorder was dystonia (n=8), followed by tremors (n=3) and myoclonus (n=3); two patients had all three movement disorders. The movement disorder affected mainly the lower limb (n=9) with a predilection for the foot (n=7) and was frequently initiated by minor trauma (n=7). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 14 years. The outcome was variable, with good prognosis in nearly half of the cases: four children experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Two children showed a slight improvement. Four children showed no improvement. Movement disorders in CRPS are under-recognized in children. The management has to be multidisciplinary with an expertize in paediatric pain.

AB  - Summary Objective Recent studies have shown that an elevated 1-h postload plasma glucose (1hPG) is able to identify subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at high risk for future type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, clinical studies about the characteristics of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with elevated 1hPG are lacking. The aim of this study was to analyse the 1hPG level in CHD patients with NGT. Methods A total of 204 CHD patients with NGT were recruited. Subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, echocardiography and coronary angiography. Demographic data were recorded and blood samples obtained. According to the 1hPG cut-off point of 8·6 mm, patients were divided into two groups: 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm (n = 65) and 1hPG < 8·6 mm (n = 139). Results Compared with the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, subjects with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm had a worse metabolic profile, exhibiting significantly higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride level and lower HDL-cholesterol level. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels were higher in the 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm group than in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group. Coronary angiography revealed that single-vessel changes were more frequent in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, but there were no significant differences in the Gensini score. Conclusions Patients with CHD with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm have a worse metabolic profile, higher levels of hsCRP and multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that, in patients with CHD, elevated 1hPG increases coronary risk factors and may be a marker for early-stage glucose intolerance.

AB  - Background:? Cardiovascular complications due to atherosclerosis (AS) are the major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Inflammation may play an important role in the development of AS. Several studies have demonstrated the association of acute-phase proteins and cytokines with AS in the general population and in HD patients. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of study was to compare serum levels inflammatory and anti-inflammatory indicators in HD patients according to the presence or absence of AS. Methods:? Thirty-three HD patients were enrolled. AS was defined as the detection of plaques by Doppler ultrasonography. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of plaques. Serum levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The factors for AS such as age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and HD duration were also evaluated. Results:? We found that the patients with AS had significantly higher hs-CRP and lower IL-10. Blood pressure values were also increased in patients with AS. Additionally, there was an increased correlation between CRP and IL-10. Conclusions:? AS(+) patients undergoing HD had low serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high serum levels of hs-CRP. These results may suggest that the limitation of anti-inflammatory response in atherosclerotic uremic patients is a triggering or contributing factor for AS.

AB  - Clinical manifestation of overt vascular disease may be preceded for years by endothelial dysfunction. Objective:? This study was undertaken to evaluate endothelial function in ESRD patients and correlation between endothelial function and clinical and biochemical parameters. Methods:? 32 stable ESRD patients (male?:?female?=?16?:?16, average age: 55.2?±?13.0) on hemodialysis were included. A 10-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to image the brachial artery. Brachial artery diameter was measured, and reactive hyperemia was induced by inflation to 250?mmHg for 5?min and then deflation of a pneumatic cuff. After release of the cuff, brachial artery diameter was measured. Results:? In the entire study population and non-diabetic group, the %FMD (% flow-mediated dilatation, % change of brachial artery diameter between before and after cuff inflation) did not show any significant correlation with duration of dialysis, age, hypertension, albumin, CRP, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, the %FMD of diabetic patients was lower than that of non-diabetics. Among the patients with diabetes, the group of patients with FMD of <5.2% showed significant lower serum albumin and significantly higher ln(CRP) levels compared to the group of patients with FMD ≥5.2%. The %FMD showed significant positive correlation with serum albumin level and significant negative correlation with ln(CRP) in diabetic patients. Conclusion:? These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction, estimated by FMD, was significantly more prominent in diabetic ESRD, especially with low serum albumin and high CRP levels.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? Advanced complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains very difficult to treat. While subanesthetic low-dose ketamine has shown promise in early localized CRPS, its use in advanced CRPS has not been as effective. Since ketamine's analgesic potency and duration of effect in neuropathic pain are directly dose-dependant, we investigated the efficacy of ketamine in anesthetic dosage in refractory CRPS patients that had failed available standard therapies. Methods.? Twenty ASA I-III patients suffering from refractory CRPS received ketamine in anesthetic dosage over 5 days. Outcome criteria were pain relief, effect on the movement disorder, quality of life, and ability to work at baseline and up to 6 months following treatment. Results.? Significant pain relief was observed at 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment (93.5?±?11.1%, 89.4?±?17.0%, 79.3?±?25.3%; P?<?0.001). Complete remission from CRPS was observed at 1 month in all patients, at 3 months in 17, and at 6 months in 16 patients. If relapse occurred, significant pain relief was still attained at 3 and 6 months (59.0?±?14.7%, P?<?0.004; 50.2?±?10.6%, P?<?0.002). Quality of life, the associated movement disorder, and the ability to work significantly improved in the majority of patients at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions.? This open-label trial suggests benefit in pain reduction, associated CRPS symptoms, improved quality of life and ability to work following anesthetic ketamine in previously refractory CRPS patients. However, a randomized controlled trial will be necessary to prove its efficacy.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current knowledge of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and describes emerging markers of inflammation in CVD. It examines whether individuals identified on the basis of elevated serum high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP) benefit from clinical intervention. The chapter reviews existing guidelines relating to hs-CRP and highlights limitations in the use of hs-CRP in risk assessment. It evaluates the prognostic value of other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, serum amyloid A, albumin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, circulating immune complexes, heat-shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), paraoxonase-1, and myeloperoxidase in CVD. The chapter reviews the influence of chronic inflammatory disease and infectious burden on CVD, and discusses relevant data regarding pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory effects in CVD. It evaluates the influence of dietary patterns, wholegrains, dietary fat, antioxidants, phytochemicals, plant sterols, alcohol, micronutrients, physical activity, genetics, and family history on inflammatory markers associated with CVD.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this paper is to describe the first reported use of computed tomography (CT) guided lumbar sympathetic block as treatment of a case of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in a child. The potential aetiology of CRPS is discussed in relation to the mechanism of action of local anaesthetics used in the block. Based on the successful treatment of this child and the documented success of its use in adults, we conclude that despite the minimal dose of radiation given, CT guided lumbar sympathetic block is an important treatment option in CRPS in children.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Background: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) evokes a systemic inflammatory response involving the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin (iL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Like IL-10, opioids downregulate the immune responses in vivo and in vitro, including the activity of the cytokine-producing monocytes and granulocytes. The proinflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of the hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate if choice of anaesthesia, based on high-dose opioids (fentanyl) versus low-dose opioids influenced the release of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Secondly, it was investigated whether serum amyloid P-component (SAP) is an acute-phase protein in man such as C-reactive protein (CRP), with which it is physically and structurally related. Methods: Sixteen patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomized to either low-dose opioid anaesthesia consisting of thoracic epidural analgesia combined with inhalational anaesthesia (group I) or high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (group II). From each patient 18 blood samples were taken perioperatively. Cytokine analyses were performed with ELISA, CRP and SAP mere measured with rocket immunoelectrophoresis (REI). Results: Surgery and CPB elicited a marked, transient and almost simultaneous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response with no differences between the groups. The cytokine levels returned to preoperative levels 1?3 d after operation. Anaesthesia and surgery did not affect SAP plasma levels while patients showed a major increase in CRP concentrations preceding the cytokine responses. Conclusion: CABG performed during two different anaesthetic techniques, high-dose fentanyl versus low-dose opioid anaesthesia, elicited a well-defined cytokine response with minor variation in the time course of each cytokine. The cytokine production was not modified by type of anaesthesia. Finally, SAP is not an acute-phase protein in men.

AB  - Abstract Fixity of colorectal tumours carries a poor prognosis, but only if it is the consequence of malignant spread. Pre-operative radiotherapy may be beneficial but selection depends on clinical examination which is often inaccurate or impossible. We therefore investigated if serum concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen and acute phase reactant proteins (APRPS) which may be elevated in patients with colorectal cancer could determine the degree and nature of local spread prior to operation. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), α1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured pre-operatively in 100 patients with colorectal tumours, 89 of whom had a carcinoma. Thirty-two (36 per cent) were fixed, 18 (56 per cent) by malignancy (FM) and 14 (44 per cent) by inflammation (F1). Levels of CEA, AGP and CRP were all significantly higher in the serum of patients with fixed tumours (P < 0.05). Concentrations of AGP > 1.4 g/l or CRP > 15 mg/l were accurate predictors of tumour fixation (specificity 87 and 90 per cent; sensitivity 78 and 78 per cent. CEA appeared more accurate in determining the nature of fixation. A value of > 50ng/ml predicted 82 per cent of FM tumours (specificity 100 per cent; sensitivity 87 per cent). Thus, pre-operative measurement of serum CEA and APRP appear able to predict fixation of colorectal tumours.
