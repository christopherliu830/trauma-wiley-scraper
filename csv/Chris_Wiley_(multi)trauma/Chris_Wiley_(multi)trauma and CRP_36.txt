AB  - Abstract:? The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are critically involved in inflammation and are activated by stress. This suggests that stressful circumstances may affect the chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fifty-six scientific publications of the past 15 years were reviewed to get insight into the possible impact of stressors (grouped in five categories) on the health status and HPA axis and ANS functioning of adult patients with RA. Our findings in this review were: (1) In response to mental and physical effort and applied physiological stressors, patients demonstrate ANS hyporesponsiveness and ?too normal? HPA axis responsiveness considering the elevated immune activity. A premorbid defect, past and current inflammatory activity, past and current stress, and physical deconditioning may explain disturbed physiological responses. (2) After brief naturalistic stressors, self-perceived and clinician's ratings of disease activity are increased; inflammation parameters have been insufficiently examined. (3) Major life events do not univocally affect disease status, but appear able to modify disease activity in a positive or negative way, depending on the nature, duration, and dose of the accompanying physiological stress response. (4) Enduring (e.g., work-related or interpersonal) stressors are associated with perceived health. Because this stressor category mingles with personality variables, the mere observation of a correlation does not prove that chronic stressors provoke health changes, although this might be the case. (5) Not one study rigorously examined the prospective hypothesis that past stressors (e.g., childhood victimization or pre-onset stressful incidents) may trigger RA or aggravate existing RA, which is a realistic belief for some patients.

AB  - Abstract Aging is associated with a decline of performance leading to reduced reproductive output and survival. While the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging has attracted considerable attention, the molecular/physiological functions underlying the early-life benefits/late-life costs paradigm remain elusive. We tested the hypothesis that while early activation of the inflammatory response confers benefits in terms of protection against infection, it also incurs costs in terms of reduced reproductive output at old age and shortened longevity. We infected mice with the malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii and increased the inflammatory response using an anti-IL-10 receptor antibody treatment. We quantified the benefits and costs of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of the infection and at old age. In agreement with the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, the inflammatory response provided an early-life benefit, since infected mice that were treated with anti-IL-10 receptor antibodies had reduced parasite density and anemia. However, at old age, mice in all treatment groups had similar levels of C-reactive protein, reproductive output, survival rate, and lifespan. Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that the benefits of a robust response to malaria infection in early life incur longer term fitness costs.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Obesity during pregnancy is associated with meta-inflammation and an increased likelihood of clinical complications. Surgery results in intense, acute inflammatory responses in any individual. Because obese individuals exhibit constitutive inflammatory responses and high rates of Caesarian section, it is important to understand the impact of surgery in such populations. Whether more pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and/or counterbalancing changes in anti-inflammatory immune modulators occurs is unknown. Here we investigated innate immune capacity in vivo and in vitro in non-obese, term-pregnant controls versus healthy, term-pregnant obese women (Class II, BMI 35?40). Methods Systemic in vivo induction of eleven pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and acute phase proteins was assessed in plasma immediately prior to and again following Caesarian section surgery. Independently, innate immune capacity was examined by stimulating freshly isolated PBMC in vitro with a panel of defined PRR-ligands for TLR4, TLR8, TLR3, and RLR 24?h post-surgery. Results The kinetics and magnitude of the in vivo inflammatory responses examined were indistinguishable in the two populations across the broad range of biomarkers examined, despite the fact that obese women had higher baseline inflammatory status. Deliberate in vitro stimulation with a range of PRR ligands also elicited pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses that were indistinguishable between control and obese mothers. Conclusions Acute in vivo innate immune responses to C-section, as well as subsequent in vitro stimulation with a panel of microbial mimics, are not detectably altered in Class II obese women. The data argue that while Class II obesity is undesirable, it has minimal impact on the in vivo inflammatory response, or innate immunomodulatory capacity, in women selecting C-section.
