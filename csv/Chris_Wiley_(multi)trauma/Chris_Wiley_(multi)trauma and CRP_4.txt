AB  - Introduction:?? The aim of the study was to evaluate whether C reactive protein level (CRP) on admission could aid the diagnostic accuracy of Alvarado score in acute appendicitis. Patients and methods : 233 patients (males 115, females 118, median age 28?years, range 15?87?years) who underwent appendicectomy were evaluated. Methods:?? Patients were categorized in to 3 groups retrospectively based on the Alvarado score. Group I: score 7?10 (n = 154), Group II: score 4?6 (n = 66), Group III: score < 3 (n = 13). Negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of CRP which was performed at the time of admission was calculated. Results:?? Overall, 169 of 233 (72.5%) had histopathological confirmation of acute appendicitis. In Group I it was 134 patients (87%), Group II: 35 patients (53%) and none of patients in Group III. NPV and PPV for Group I was 29.6% and 85.5%, Group II was 65% and 80% respectively. Conclusion:?? The CRP level improves the predictive value of diagnosing acute appendicitis in the equivocal group of Alvarado 4?6. Patients in this group with a normal CRP should be further investigated before proceeding to appendicectomy.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: A systematic review identified randomised and other trials (1966?2006) of studies of occlusal design of crowns, complete (CRP) and partial (PRP) removable prostheses and implant-borne reconstructions, and whether occlusal design influenced diet, quality of life, bruxism and attrition. Methods: The search primarily included Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Ovid Medline and PreMedline. Results: The search yielded 1315 studies: 20 on CRP ? 1 RCT, one systematic review, four clinical trials, 10 case series; 22 on PRP ? one cohort study, two experimental studies, 15 case reports or case series, three clinical trials; 23 on implant superstructures, and 24 reports on implant failure, 37 on oral health related quality of life, eight on attrition; and four studies on masticatory function. Conclusions: CRP ? Studies of occlusal form and tooth arrangements, included balanced, lingualised and monoplane arrangements ? lingualised posterior occlusion was preferred. Early studies on CRP design were observational as case reports, however data suggested that optimum function is achieved by modification of the maxillary occlusion, irrespective of the opposing mandibular occlusion. PRP ? Edentulous ridge resorption is patient-specific, has a multifactorial aetiology and there is no objective data to confirm that mechanical factors cause bone loss; oral hygiene management is crucial for long-term health. Studies on distal extension PDs confirmed a link between bite force and masticatory function; preservation of two functioning posterior tooth units ipsilateral to the distal extension optimises function. Data indicate that patient-specific factors, rather than PD design-specific features, influence long-term PD outcomes. Implant superstructures ? There is little scientific evidence specifying occlusal and superstructure design for fixed prostheses for teeth or implants. Occlusal scheme design and occlusal form have evolved through clinical experience, but there is no evidence to indicate that a particular design is superior. Complex neurophysiological mechanisms allow the jaw muscle system to accommodate to oral and dental changes.

AB  - Objective: To report outcome in dogs after internal fixation of a sarcoma-related pathologic fracture of the appendicular skeleton. Study Design: Multi-institutional case series. Animals: Dogs (n=16). Methods: Medical records of participating VSSO members were reviewed for dogs with pathologic fracture associated with a confirmed bone sarcoma of the appendicular skeleton repaired by external or internal fixation. Dogs were included if they had a histological diagnosis of osteosarcoma or sarcoma and excluded if they had radiation before fracture. Data collected were analyzed for signalment, fracture location, staging performed, method of fracture fixation, histopathology, adjunctive treatment and outcome. Results: Signalment and fracture location of 16 dogs that met the inclusion criteria was similar to dogs with appendicular OSA without fracture. One of 14 dogs had pulmonary metastasis and 3 of 5 dogs had bone metastasis. Bone plate or interlocking nail were used for repair in 12 dogs. Limb use immediately after surgery in 13 dogs was good (4), weight-bearing but lame (7) and non-weight bearing (2). Adjunctive therapy was administered in 5 dogs (chemotherapy, 3; radiation, 4; pamidronate, 3). Survival time ranged from 18 to 897 days; median survival was 166 days. Conclusions: Repair of pathologic fracture can result in palliation and prolonged survival.

AB  - Abstract Background The control of sepsis is the primary goal of surgical intervention in patients with infected necrosis. Simple surgical approaches that are easy to reproduce may improve outcomes when specialists in endoscopy are not available. The aim of the present study was to describe the experience with a focused open necrosectomy (FON) in patients with infected necrosis. Method A prospective pilot study conducted to compare a semi-open/closed drainage laparotomy and FON with the assistance of peri-operative ultrasound. The incidence of sepsis, dynamics of C-reactive protein (CRP), intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital stay, complication rate and mortality were compared and analysed. Results From a total of 58 patients, 36 patients underwent a conventional open necrosectomy and 22 patients underwent FON. The latter method resulted in a faster resolution of sepsis and a significant decrease in mean CRP on Day 3 after FON, P = 0.001. Post-operative bleeding was in 1 versus 7 patients and the incidence of intestinal and pancreatic fistula was 2 versus 8 patients when comparing FON to the conventional approach. The median ICU stay was 11.6 versus 23 days and the hospital stay was significantly shorter, 57 versus 72 days, P = 0.024 when comparing FON versus the conventional group. One patient died in the FON group and seven patients died in the laparotomy group, P = 0.139. Discussion FON can be an alternative method to conventional open necrosectomy in patients with infected necrosis and unresolved sepsis.

AB  - Though first introduced more than 130 years ago, the concept of stress diabetes or stress hyperglycemia has gained tremendous attention in recent years in view of the landmark article by van den Berghe and colleagues in 2001. As opposed to earlier work that suggested that hyperglycemia in the acute clinical setting may be beneficial, it now appears that lower glucose levels are associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms behind the improved outcomes are numerous and seem to be tied to the inflammatory process. Both lower glucose values and insulin therapy seem to be anti-inflammatory, whereas hyperglycemia increases the proinflammatory process and negatively affects the innate immune system. Despite the numerous approaches to achieve normoglycemia described in the literature, only modest success has been achieved. Understanding the pathophysiology driving stress hyperglycemia?the stress response and modulation of the inflammatory process?seems to be the key to improving the care of the most critically ill and injured patients.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim was to study risk-factors for vascular thrombosis and incidence of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in splenectomized children with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) at a single center. Procedure Pre- and post-splenectomy hemoglobin and platelet counts were recorded. Post-splenectomy lipid-profile, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and anti-coagulant-protein levels were compared to established controls. Echo-Doppler was performed for PAH. Results Twenty-six children with HS had undergone splenectomy; the mean age at surgery was 7.9?±?3.7 years. Nineteen of the 26 were prospectively investigated at a median duration of 4.5 years (range: 4 months to 19 years) following splenectomy. Thrombocytosis was observed in 19 (73%), whereas no patient had erythrocytosis at the last follow-up visit. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were not deranged (P?≥?0.3). Mean CRP levels (males: 2.8?±?0.5; females: 2.1?±?0.5?mg/L) were significantly higher than described for normal children (P?<?0.001). Six (23%) patients had a positive D-dimer assay. Protein S, anti-thrombin-III and fibrinogen were in range. A single patient had a borderline low protein C activity. Lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibody assays were negative. The mean tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) was 1.8?±?0.55?meter per second (range: 0?2.4). None had a TRJV ≥2.5?meter per second to suggest PAH. Conclusions There was no evidence of PAH, dyslipidemia, elevation of fibrinogen or a reduction in anti-coagulant proteins, at a median follow-up duration of 4.5 years following splenectomy in children with HS. However, elevated CRP level (42%), persistent thrombocytosis (73%) and elevated D-dimer levels (23%) were observed. These have been recognized as risk factors for cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:29?33. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. The incremental elastic modulus (Einc) measurement is a good marker of arterial wall stiffness. Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. Metabolic, inflammatory, and hemodynamic alterations cause structural changes and vascular complications in end-stage renal disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors that may affect the development of arteriosclerosis by measurement of Einc in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Thirty-two patients (16 men and 16 women) on chronic HD with a mean age of 42.2?±?19.3 (range, 15?80) were included in the study. The carotid Einc was measured to determine arteriosclerosis by high-resolution echo-tracking system. Einc measurement was calculated from transcutaneous measurements of carotid arterial internal diameter and wall thickness and carotid pulse pressure. Common carotid compliance (CCC) and distensibility (CCD) were determined from changes in carotid artery diameter during systole and simultaneously measured carotid pulse pressure. Serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), predialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP), predialysis diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), age, HD duration, CCC, and CCD were correlated with Einc in all patients. A significant positive correlation was found between Einc and age (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), SBP (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.02), PP (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), Ca (r?=?0.43, p?<?0.01), CRP (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.02). As expected, Einc was correlated inversely with CCD (r?=??0.77, p?<?0.0001). The correlation between Einc and HD duration, DBP, ferritin, P, PTH, and CCC was not significant. In conclusion, the stiffening of carotid artery in HD patients is related not only to hemodynamic changes (increased SBP and PP) but also to metabolic (increased Ca) and inflammatory (increased CRP) responses. Carotid Einc is an accepted independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Because of the positive correlation between Einc and serum Ca, vitamin D and Ca-containing P binder should be used carefully in HD patients.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Summary Inflammation has been recently implicated in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to examine the variation of inflammatory indexes during the first week after successful electrical cardioversion of persistent AF. Successive measurements of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels were performed in 30 cardioverted patients. At the end of the 7-day follow-up period, AF had recurred in 30% of patients. A significant variance was found in serial measurements of fibrinogen levels in the two groups (non-relapse and relapse, p?=?0.005). Fibrinogen levels increased significantly in patients who relapsed into AF, but remained stable in patients who remained in sinus rhythm. In the latter patients, CRP values tended to decrease post-cardioversion, but WBC count was significantly lower (p?<?0.001) on the 7th day (6083?±?1335), compared with baseline values (6648?±?1395). The variation of inflammatory indices post-cardioversion might have prognostic implications with regard to sinus rhythm maintenance.

AB  - Abstract Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a disabling pain condition with sensory, motor and autonomic manifestations. Uncertainty remains about how CRPS can be effectively managed. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for treatment and prophylactic interventions for CRPS published during the period 2000?2012, building on previous work by another group reviewing the period 1966?2000. Bibliographic database searches identified 173 papers which were filtered by three reviewers. This process generated 29 trials suitable for further analysis, each of which was reviewed and scored by two independent reviewers for methodological quality using a 15-item checklist. A number of novel and potentially effective treatments were investigated. Analysing the results from both review periods in combination, there was a steep rise in the number of published RCTs per review decade. There is evidence for the efficacy of 10 treatments (3? strong ? bisphosphonates, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and graded motor imagery, 1? moderate and 6? limited evidence), and against the efficacy of 15 treatments (1? strong, 1? moderate and ?13 limited). The heterogeneity of trialled interventions and the pilot nature of many trials militate against drawing clear conclusions about the clinical usefulness of most interventions. This and the observed phenomenon of excellent responses in CRPS subgroups would support the case for a network- and multi-centre approach in the conduct of future clinical trials. Most published trials in CRPS are small with a short follow-up period, although several novel interventions investigated from 2000 to 2012 appear promising.

AB  - Background:?? Necrotising fasciitis is a soft tissue infection with progressive tissue necrosis, affecting the deep fascial layers. It is a rare life-threatening disease with mortality rates from 6.1?43%. Many factors have been associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate these factors by analysing data from a larger patient series than any presented in the published literature to date. Methods:?? The medical records of 151 sequential patients with necrotising fasciitis treated in the Alfred Hospital from 1997?2004 were reviewed to identify the factors associated with increased mortality. The data was then analysed with multivariate analysis to identify the statistically significant factors. Results:?? Mortality rate of this study was 11.3%. The statistically significant factors were CRP > 200 on admission (p = 0.018), mechanical ventilation on admission (p = 0.002), older age (p = 0.0231), male (p = 0.013), delayed hyperbaric therapy from first symptoms (p = 0.045), spontaneous precipitant (p = 0.015), and complications of multi organ failure (p = 0.006), acute renal failure (0.011), acidosis (p = 0.001) or atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001), sepsis (p = 0.045). Conclusions:?? The knowledge of these factors will assist in the management of necrotising fasciitis by prioritising these patients, allocating more appropriate resources to prevent delay in hyperbaric treatment and by promptly treat the disease, especially in ICU setting to prevent complications and improve survival.

AB  - Summary We report the successful use of a stellate ganglion block as part of a multi-modal postoperative analgesic regimen. Four patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery following upper limb trauma underwent blockade of the stellate ganglion pre-operatively under ultrasound guidance. Patients reported excellent postoperative analgesia, with postoperative VAS pain scores between 0 and 2, and consumption of morphine in the first 24 h ranging from 0 to 14?mg. While these are preliminary findings, and must be confirmed in a clinical trial, they highlight the potential for stellate ganglion blockade to provide analgesia following major upper limb surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between prealbumin, nutrient intake, and indicators of inflammation for recuperative and rehabilitative care patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Recuperative Care Unit within a Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eleven men (100 white; mean age 80, range 64?93). MEASUREMENTS: Prealbumin and seven markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their soluble receptors) were measured at admission and discharge (median length of stay 23 days, interquartile range 15?40 days). Detailed calorie counts were performed daily, and intake was expressed as a percentage of estimated requirements for protein (1.5?g/kg body weight per day) and energy (Harris-Benedict equation). The study objective was examined using least-squares regression analysis. RESULTS: Discharge prealbumin and the change in prealbumin were positively correlated with protein and energy intake and inversely correlated with markers of inflammation, particularly CRP and IL-6. When all covariates were included in a multivariable regression analysis, the markers of inflammation predominantly accounted for the variance in prealbumin change (56%), whereas discharge protein intake accounted for 6%. CONCLUSION: For older recuperative care patients, prealbumin and its change during hospitalization are positively associated with protein intake, but inflammation or changes in inflammation appear to exert a much more-powerful influence on prealbumin concentration. Given the potential confounding effects of inflammation, monitoring the change in prealbumin is not an adequate substitute for a more-detailed nutritional assessment in this population.

AB  - Abstract Much attention has been drawn to the pro-inflammatory condition that accompanies aging. This study compared parameters from non-stimulated neutrophils, obtained from young (18?30?years old [y.o.]) and elderly (65?80?y.o.) human volunteers. Measured as an inflammatory marker, plasmatic concentration of hs-CRP was found higher in elderly individuals. Non-stimulated neutrophil production of ROS and NO was, respectively, 38 and 29% higher for the aged group. From the adhesion molecules evaluated, only CD11b expression was elevated in neutrophils from the aged group, whereas no differences were found for CD11a, CD18, or CD62. A 69% higher non-stimulated in vitro neutrophil/endothelial cell adhesion was observed for neutrophils isolated from elderly donors. Our results suggest that with aging, neutrophils may be constitutively producing more reactive species in closer proximity to endothelial cells of vessel walls, which may both contribute to vascular damage and reflect a neutrophil intracellular disrupted redox balance, altering neutrophil function in aging.

AB  - Abstract Background and objectives The aim of this study was to assess cellular and peritoneal immune responses after radical laparoscopic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods Peripheral heparinized plasma and plain serum tube samples were collected preoperatively, and at 2 hr, 1 day, and 4 days postoperatively for analysis o; white blood cells, total lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-suppressor lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A. Twenty-four hours peritoneal fluid collection was performed on days 1 and 4 for TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 analysis. Results No statistical differences were observed between the two groups with respect to immunocompetent cell counts. The serum levels of plasma CRP and SAA gradually increased significantly with time in both groups, but these temporal increases were lower in the LADG group (CRP; P?=?0.03, SAA; P?=?0.01). Peritoneal TNF-α levels in the CODG group at 4 days postoperatively were significantly higher than at day 1, but remained almost unchanged in the LADG group, and this difference was significant (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Because of its association with reduced peritoneal immune activity, laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer may require careful consideration in practice. Additional, larger prospective multicenter trials are required before a consensus can be reached. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:54?59. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Some authors suggest that inflammation can be one of the reasons of erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. The purpose of the study was to follow-up some laboratory markers of inflammation in 21 dialysis patients, all treated with adequate anaemia doses EPO, divided in 2 groups: first one adequately responding to EPO treatment (with Hb higher than 9?g/L) and second one resistant to it (with Hb lower than 9?g/L). Some acute phase proteins and markers of inflammation were measured as follow: C-reactive protein (CRP), α1-AGT, α1-antitrypsine, and haptoglobine (HP), as some anti-acute phase proteins, transferrin (TF). WBC count, some enzymes: ASAT, ALAT, and substrates: urea, creatinine, albumins (Albs), lipid profile, glucose, phosphate, iron, electrolytes, and parathyroid hormone were tested as well. The study found significant higher CRP, HP, Tg, P, and Alb in the second group than in the first. TF was lower in all patients, which may be connected to the chronic inflammatory status (uremia), and there was no iron deficit or severe parathyroid hyperfunction to be convinced for EPO resistance. The study suggests that EPO resistance may be related to some inflammatory factors and treatment of the inflammation possibly will overcome the problem.

AB  - Abstract Current immunosuppression in VCA is largely based on the experience in solid organ transplantation. It remains unclear if steroids can be reduced safely in VCA recipients. We report on five VCA recipients who were weaned off maintenance steroids after a median of 2 months (mean: 4.8 months, range 2?12 months). Patients were kept subsequently on a low dose, dual maintenance consisting of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenloic acid with a mean follow-up of 43.6 months (median?=?40 months, range 34?64 months). Early and late acute rejections responded well to temporarily augmented maintenance, topical immunosuppression, and/or steroid bolus treatment. One late steroid-resistant acute rejection required treatment with thymoglobulin. All patients have been gradually weaned off steroids subsequent to the treatment of acute rejections. Low levels of tacrolimus (<5?ng/mL) appeared as a risk for acute rejections. Although further experience and a cautious approach are warranted, dual-steroid free maintenance immunosuppression appears feasible in a series of five VCA recipients.

AB  - Purpose:? Quality of life (QoL) is a well-recognized important measure of therapy outcome, as it reflects what patients perceive as their health condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the QoL in patients on HD and to find the factors that mainly affect it. Patients and Methods:? We studied 70 patients on HD (38 male, age 57.86?±?14.63 years) with the use of kidney disease quality of life short form. Physical health (PH), mental health (MH), kidney disease issues (KDIs), and patient satisfaction (PS) were assessed, as well as Khan comorbidity index, adequacy of dialysis, nutrition, and epidemiologic and laboratory data. Results:? PH was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), serum albumin (Salb) (p?<?0005), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001), Hb (p?<?0.01), and CRP (p?<?0.01). MH was significantly correlated to comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), Salb (p?=?0002), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001) and Hb (p?<?0.01). KDI score was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), and Hb (p?<?0.05). The acceptance of the method was significantly lower in patients with AVF dysfunction (p?<?0005). As much as 44.3% of patients presented inadequate compliance to dietary and fluid restrictions. Conclusion:? Frequent QoL assessment in patients on HD is a useful tool for professionals involved in patients' care. Older age, long time on HD, malnutrition, elevated CRP, and comorbid conditions are correlated to lower QoL scores.
