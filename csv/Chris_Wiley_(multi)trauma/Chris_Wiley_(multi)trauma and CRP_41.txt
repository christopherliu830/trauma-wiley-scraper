AB  - Summary For many years the search for structural associations of osteoarthritis (OA) pain were based on conventional radiographic imaging that predominantly visualizes bone. As well as being tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the ability to directly visualize all the structures of a joint, including soft tissue and cartilage. Initial MRI studies focused on cartilage assessment, but recently there has been a growing body of work examining the correlation of structural findings with pain in OA and their relation to structural progression. Painful OA knees have more MRI-detected abnormalities and these pathologies are often correlated making individual contributions difficult to assess. However, in large cohort studies, both synovial hypertrophy and large synovial effusions were demonstrated to be more frequent in patients with OA knee pain. Similarly MRI-determined subchondral bone marrow oedema lesions (BME), particularly large ones, are associated with OA knee pain. Meniscal tears in OA knees, although common, have not been linked with pain. Improved, reliable quantification of the structural features and the rapid advances in MRI technology can only improve structure?pain understanding.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with ?unusual? causes of ischemic stroke to highlight clues in the history, on examination and on imaging, which should serve as ?red flags? that something unusual may be underlying the patient's presenting symptoms. It divides the unusual causes of stroke into several subcategories including arterial injury; inflammatory vasculopathies and syndromes; congenital arteriopathies; hematological disorders; stroke as a result of systemic illnesses; genetic causes; and others. Cervical arterial dissections are considerably more common than intracranial dissections and their presentations are different enough that they should be considered separately. The most common vasculitis involving the brain is the temporal arteritic form of giant-cell arteritis (GCA), although it is fundamentally a systemic vasculitis. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) can present with focal neurologic deficits and so mimic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A stroke is deemed cryptogenic if there are no evident direct cause or high-risk features for recurrence.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to explore the association between GPIa, COX-2 gene polymorphisms and aspirin resistance in the ischemic stroke patients from the southern part of Jiangsu province. Methods In all, 97 patients with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled in the study. GPIa gene polymorphism at 807C>T (rsl126643) locus and COX-2 gene polymorphism at -765G>C (rs20417) locus were genotyped by PCR pyrosequencing technology. Patients were divided into the aspirin sensitivity (AS) group and aspirin resistance (AR) group according to the platelet aggregation rate. The relationship between the two gene polymorphisms and aspirin resistance was investigated and analyzed. Results The distribution of the genotype (CC, CT, TT, CT + TT, and CC) and the frequency of allele T of GPIa gene at 807C>T locus were significantly different in AS and AR groups in female patients (P < .05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the genotype of CT+TT at 807C>T locus was significantly correlated with AR after adjustment for relative factors (P = .047, OR = 4.856, 95% CI: 1.020?23.108). There were no significant differences in the genotype distribution and allele frequency of the COX-2 gene -765G>C site between two groups (P > .05). Conclusion GPIa gene polymorphism at 807C>T locus was associated with AR in Chinese Han females, and the expression of allele T increased the incidence of AR. The gene polymorphism of COX-2 gene at -765G>C locus was not significantly correlated with AR.

AB  - Summary In neurology, as in all specialties within medicine, accurate diagnosis of the cause of symptoms is seen as an essential prerequisite for rational management. For example, neuropathic pain of burning quality can occur in the limb of a patient with peripheral neuropathy, syringomyelia or a cerebral infarct. This chapter discusses the definitions, mechanisms of neuropathic pain, and assessment of pain in the patient with neurological disease. Most theories invoke either excitation of damaged sensory pathways, or diminution of inhibitory processes, or perhaps both. There are tracts in the dorsal and ventral segments of the spinal cord that mediate transmission of excitatory and inhibitory influences to and from the brain. Glomus tumour and osteoid asteoma deserve mention here because patients may present to neurology clinics, and because they can be cured by appropriate treatment. Some disorders referred to a neurologist appear to involve the interface between cutaneous and visceral innervations.
