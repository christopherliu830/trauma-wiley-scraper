AB  - Autoinflammatory diseases are hyperinflammatory, immune dysregulatory conditions that typically present in early childhood with fever and rashes and disease-specific patterns of organ inflammation. This review provides a historic background of autoinflammatory disease research, an overview of the currently genetically defined autoinflammatory diseases, and insights into treatment strategies derived from understanding of the disease pathogenesis. The integrative assessment of autoinflammatory conditions led to the identification of innate pro-inflammatory cytokine ?amplification loops? as the cause of the systemic and organ-specific disease manifestations, which initially centered around increased IL-1 production and signaling. More recently, additional innate pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification loops resulting in increased Type I IFN, IL-17, IL-18, or IL-36 signaling or production have led to the successful use of targeted therapies in some of these conditions. Clinical findings such as fever patterns, type of skin lesions, genetic mutation testing, and the prevalent cytokine abnormalities can be used to group autoinflammatory diseases.

AB  - ABSTRACT HIV-infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-exposure are associated with bone loss. African data are limited despite the region's HIV burden. Of 247 ART-naïve, premenopausal, urban, black African women aged 33.9±6.6?years from Soweto, South Africa, measured at baseline, 110 underwent anthropometry, DXA and blood and urine collections at 12 and 24 months; 39 were HIV-negative (Nref), 28 were people with HIV (PWH) not ART-exposed for the duration of the study (ART-N) and 43 were PWH who were ART-exposed within the first 12 months (ART-Y). At baseline ART-Y had lower BMI and fat mass than Nref. Within 12 months of ART-initiation, aBMD had decreased at the lumbar spine and whole-body-less-head, despite increased weight, and hip aBMD had not increased in line with Nref. There was no evidence of further bone changes between 12 and 24 months. By 24 months, ART-Y had gained weight and fat mass, but remained lighter with less fat than Nref. ART-initiation normalized the low serum albumin of ART-Y at baseline but was associated with elevated bone turnover markers at 12 and 24 months. Vitamin D status and renal phosphate handling were normal. ART-N had similar aBMD and other characteristics to Nref throughout, except, unlike Nref, weight and fat mass did not increase and serum albumin decreased. This study in African women of childbearing age demonstrated that the bone loss that had occurred in these PWH after ART-initiation did not continue after 12 months and that bone loss did not occur in ART-unexposed PWH over 2?years. At 24 months, despite gains in weight and fat mass, ART-exposed women remained lighter, with lower aBMD, fat mass and higher bone turnover than women without HIV. More studies are required to establish if the bone loss and fat gain reverse, stabilize, or continue with further ART-exposure, particularly during and after menopause.

AB  - Abstract Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is now a routine therapy for advanced heart failure. Minimally invasive approach via thoracotomy for LVAD implantation is getting popular due to its potential advantage over the conventional sternotomy approach in terms of reduced risk at re-operation due to sternal sparing. We compared the approaches (thoracotomy and sternotomy) to determine the superiority. Minimally invasive approach involved fitting of the LVAD inflow cannula into left ventricle apex via left anterior thoracotomy and anastomosis of outflow graft to ascending aorta via right anterior thoracotomy. In the sternotomy approach, both the procedures were performed via sternotomy. Outcomes in patients after LVAD implantation were compared depending on these approaches for the surgery. Two hundred and five continuous flow LVAD implantations performed between July 2006 and June 2015 at a single center were divided based on surgical approach, that is, sternotomy (n?=?180) and thoracotomy (n?=?25) groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in relation to patient demographics, preoperative hemodynamic parameters, laboratory markers, or risk factors. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of postoperative hemodynamic parameters, laboratory markers, bleeding and requirement of blood products, intensive care unit, and hospital stay or complications of LVAD surgery. There were no significant differences in terms of long-term survival (Log-Rank P?=?0.953), however, thoracotomy, compared to sternotomy approach, incurred significantly less requirement of temporary right ventricular assist (4 vs. 19.4%, P?=?0.041). Minimally invasive bilateral thoracotomy approach for LVAD implantation in addition to benefits of sternal sparing avoids dilatation of right ventricle and reduces chances of right ventricular failure requiring temporary right ventricular assist.

AB  - Abstract The economic devastation caused in the past by the New World screwworm fly Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) to the livestock industry in the U.S.A., Mexico and the rest of Central America was staggering. The eradication of this major livestock pest from North and Central America using the sterile insect technique (SIT) as part of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme was a phenomenal technical and managerial accomplishment with enormous economic implications. The area is maintained screwworm-free by the weekly release of 40?million sterile flies in the Darien Gap in Panama, which prevents migration from screwworm-infested areas in Columbia. However, the species is still a major pest in many areas of the Caribbean and South America and there is considerable interest in extending the eradication programme to these countries. Understanding New World screwworm fly populations in the Caribbean and South America, which represent a continuous threat to the screwworm-free areas of Central America and the U.S.A., is a prerequisite to any future eradication campaigns. The Old World screwworm fly Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve (Diptera: Calliphoridae) has a very wide distribution ranging from Southern Africa to Papua New Guinea and, although its economic importance is assumed to be less than that of its New World counterpart, it is a serious pest in extensive livestock production and a constant threat to pest-free areas such as Australia. In the 1980s repeated introductions and an expansion of Old World screwworm populations were reported in the Middle East; in the 1990s it invaded Iraq and since late 2007 it has been reported in Yemen, where a severe outbreak of myiasis occurred in 2008. Small-scale field trials have shown the potential of integrating the SIT in the control of this pest and various international organizations are considering using the release of sterile insects as part of an AW-IPM approach on a much wider scale. Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Schiner) (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is a screwworm of temperate regions, which, although of limited agricultural importance, has invaded several new locations in the past few years. This special issue reports on the results of a 6-year project funded by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) Programme of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture entitled ?Enabling Technologies for the Expansion of the SIT for Old and New World Screwworm?. A major goal of the project was to better understand population genetic variation in screwworms as an aid to the identification of isolated populations. The project also addressed issues related to genetic sexing, cuticular hydrocarbons, population dynamics, genetic transformation and chromosome analysis.
