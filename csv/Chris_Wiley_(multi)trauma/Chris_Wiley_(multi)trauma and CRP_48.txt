AB  - Summary Patients may be referred to the immunology clinic for investigation of recurrent superficial abscess formation. In the majority of adult patients this clinical presentation does not equate with an underlying primary immune deficiency. Nevertheless, recurrent mucocutaneous abscesses can be associated with significant morbidity and long-term complications, including scarring and fistula formation, and may be associated with underlying immune-mediated disease. This review sets out an approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses, focusing on the differential diagnoses, investigation and management of both the common causes and those associated with specific immune deficiency.

What are the expectations? Inflammation is a central element of atherogenesis. Innate pathways contribute to vascular inflammation. However, the initial molecular process(es) starting atherogenesis remain elusive. The various risk factors, represented by particular compounds (activators), may cause altered cellular functions in the endothelium (e.g. vascular endothelial cell activation or -dysfunction), in invading cells (e.g. inflammatory mediator production) or in local vessel wall cells (e.g. inflammatory mediators, migration), thereby triggering the innate inflammatory process. The cellular components of innate immunology include granulocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes. Among the molecular innate constituents are innate molecules, such as the toll-like receptors or innate cytokines. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 are among the innate cytokines. Cytokines are potent activators of a great number of cellular functions relevant to maintain or commove homeostasis of the vessel wall. Within the vessel wall, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can significantly contribute to the cytokine-dependent inflammatory network by: (i) production of cytokines, (ii) response to cytokines and (iii) cytokine-mediated interaction with invading leucocytes. The cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are involved in SMC-leucocyte interaction. The IL-6 effects are proposed to be mediated by trans-signalling. Dysregulated cellular functions resulting from dysregulated cytokine production may be the cause of cell accumulation, subsequent low-density lipoprotein accumulation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The deposition of ECM, increased accumulation of leucocytes and altered levels of inflammatory mediators may constitute an ?innate-immunovascular-memory? resulting in an ever-growing response to anew invasion. Thus, SMC-fostered inflammation, promoted by invading innate cells, may be a potent component for development and acceleration of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Abstract Background Neuropathy can lead not only to impaired function but also to sensory sensitization. We aimed to link reduced skin nerve fibre density in different levels to layer-specific functional impairment in neuropathic pain patients and tried to identify pain-specific functional and structural markers. Methods In 12 healthy controls and 36 patients with neuropathic pain, we assessed clinical characteristics, thermal thresholds (quantitative sensory testing) and electrically induced pain and axon reflex erythema. At the most painful sites and at intra-individual control sites, skin biopsies were taken and innervation densities in the different skin layers were assessed. Moreover, neuronal calcitonin gene-related peptide staining was quantified. Results Perception of warm, cold and heat pain and nerve fibre density were reduced in the painful areas compared with the control sites and with healthy controls. Warm and cold detection thresholds correlated best with epidermal innervation density, whereas heat and cold pain thresholds and axon reflex flare correlated best with dermal innervation density. Clinical pain ratings correlated only with epidermal nerve fibre density (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.05) and better preserved cold detection thresholds (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.05), but not with other assessed functional and structural parameters. Conclusions Thermal thresholds, axon reflex measurements and assessment of skin innervation density are valuable tools to characterize and quantify peripheral neuropathy and link neuronal function to different layers of the skin. The severity of small fibre neuropathy, however, did not correspond to clinical pain intensity and a specific parameter or pattern that would predict pain intensity in peripheral neuropathy could not be identified.

AB  - Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by slow growing, acid fast, aerobic mycobacterium and has become the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease. Primary extra-pulmonary TB lesions may arise as swellings in the head and neck, and can pose challenges of diagnosis and management to healthcare professionals. We present an unusual case of primary extra-pulmonary TB manifesting as a fluctuant swelling of the fronto-temporal region of the head and discuss value of special tests, such as fine needle aspiration cytology, microbiology and histopathology, with reference to previous case reports of TB in the head and neck.
