AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HCV on two markers of systemic inflammation, serum CRP, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HD patients. Methods:? The study included 118 HD patients (47% males, age 47?±?13 years, 9% diabetics) who were treated by on standard HD for at least 6 months. The patients were divided in two groups, depending on the presence (HCV+) or absence (HCV?) of serum antibodies against HCV. Serum albumin (S-Alb), plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), IL-6, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured, and the values were compared with 22 healthy controls. Results:? The median of hsCRP, IL-6, and the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio were: 3.5 vs. 2.1?mg/L, p?<?0.05; 4.3 vs. 0.9?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001; and 0.8 vs. 2.7?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001 for patients and controls, respectively. Age, gender, S-Alb, IL-6, and hsCRP did not differ between the HCV+ and HCV? patients. However, HCV+ patients had higher ALT (29?±?21 vs. 21?±?25?UI/L) and had been a longer time on HD (6.1?±?3.0 vs. 4.0?±?2.0 years) (p?<?0.0001), respectively. Moreover, HCV+ patients had a significantly lower median hsCRP/IL-6 ratio (0.7 vs. 0.9; p?<?0.05) as compared to the HCV group. Conclusion:? The finding that the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio was lower in HCV+ patients than in HCV? patients suggests that hsCRP may be a less useful marker of inflammation in HCV+ patients and that a different cut-off value for hsCRP may be required to define inflammation in HD patients.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify strengths and weaknesses in current studies with a view to carrying out a major multi-center study in Australia. Methods:? The literature was reviewed using standard Medline and Ovid methods. Bibliography of well known key recent papers were used to identify further papers. Results:? Studies evaluating persistent pain after breast cancer surgery have been small and few were prospective controlled studies with adequate power. Like Jung et?al[1] we found that the literature was inconsistent in defining chronic pain and differentiating the breast cancer surgery pain syndromes. Marked variations in prior studies are due to differences in: study size (n?=?22 to 282 patients), methodology, diagnostic criteria, pain assessment instruments, and distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics in the samples studied. Unfortunately the largest study to date, the ALMANAC Trial (n?=?1031) which compared sentinel node biopsy vs ?standard axillary dissection? evaluated arm and shoulder function and quality of life, but not pain[2]. From the current literature, it appears that neuropathic breast and arm pain are most common. Widely varying prevalence estimates of different neuropathic pain syndromes have been reported: phantom breast pain (3?44%); intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICBN) (16?39%); ICBN in breast conserving surgery (14?61%); and ?neuroma pain? (23?49%). The most established risk factors for surgically related neuropathic pain syndromes are intraoperative nerve trauma, severe acute postoperative pain, and high use of postoperative analgesics[1]. Psychosocial distress is reported to be a risk factor and a consequence of chronic pain[1]. Conclusions:? Well-designed large multi-center studies are required to identify prevalences of various pain types, associated risk factors and treatment success for pain after breast cancer surgery. Such a study is in progress through the collaboration of our group with the Sentinel Node vs Axillary Clearance (SNAC) Study of 1000 women following breast surgery, conducted by the Royal Australian College of Surgeons (RACS).

AB  - Abstract In addition to the genomic alterations that occur in malignant cells, the immune system is increasingly appreciated as a critical axis that regulates the rise of neoplasms and the development of primary tumours and metastases. The interaction between inflammatory cell infiltrates and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment is complex, with inflammation playing both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles. Inflammasomes are intracellular multi-protein complexes that act as key signalling hubs of the innate immune system. They respond to cellular stress and trauma by promoting activation of caspase-1, a protease that induces a pro-inflammatory cell death mode termed pyroptosis along with the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-18. Here, we will briefly introduce inflammasome biology with a focus on the dual roles of inflammasome-produced cytokines in cancer development. Despite emerging insight that inflammasomes may promote and suppress cancer development according to the tumour stage and the tumour microenvironment, much remains to be uncovered. Further exploration of inflammasome biology in tumorigenesis should enable the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer patients.

AB  - Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) Int J Dermatol 2000;39:481?486. This review aimed to familiarize the dermatologist with the essential features of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It highlights areas that are most likely to be of interest to the dermatologist. Information regarding diagnosis, pathogenesis theories, and treatment are included. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This paper analyses RSD from the point of view of a specialist in dermatology. It addresses in depth the definition of RSD (or the new name, CRPS type I), the symptoms required for adequate diagnosis, some theories to explain this syndrome, and some of the treatments available. It highlights the clinical pictures, which can cause RSD (trauma, ischemia, tumors, infection, neurological and iatrogenic causes), and particularly dermatological syndromes (minor surgery, postherpetic neuralgia, Dupuytren, vasculitis ?). The treatment has a bipolar objective: to relieve pain in order to be able to apply appropriate physical therapy, which will allow recovery of the involved limb. There are more than 60 treatments reported in the literature, suggesting that there is no universal protocol. However, prevention of RSD, and particularly the early onset of treatment are essential for achieving functional and pain relief. To suppress sympathetic hyperactivity, nerve blocks (somatic and sympathetic), intravenous regional blockade with guanethidine or reserpine, alpha blockers (phentolamine), beta blockers (propranolol), and calcitonine can be used. No reference is made to anticonvulsants (gabapentine, topiramate), antidepressants (ie, amitriptyline), intravenous lidocaine, or spinal cord stimulation.

AB  - Objective:? Blood-membrane interaction during hemodialysis may contribute to inflammatory process, which accelerates the development of atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHD). Vitamin E has been widely used against oxidative stress in MHD. One of the strategies for the utilization of vitamin E in MHD patients is the usage of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer. We investigated the effects of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer on serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, the biomarker of inflammation, compared to polysulfone membrane dialyzer. Methods:?Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) and synthetic polysulfone dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) were manipulated in a crossover clinical study for 24 weeks in 10 non-diabetic MHD patients. Run-in and wash-out periods (Cellulose tri-acetate) were performed for 4 weeks before the treatment. Pre- and post-dialysis blood samples were taken at the begining and the end of each dialyzer period (12 weeks). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were examined. Results:?Mean age of the patients was 54.9 years old. CRP and IL-6 levels were similarly increased after dialysis in both groups (4.8?±?0.7 and 37.2?±?9.4, respectively). The CRP and IL-6 level in vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer treatment were lower than in polysulfone treatment (5.0?±?1.2, p?<?0.008 and 67.2?±?12.4, p?<?0.04, respectively). Serum albumin, hemoglobin level, and white blood cell count were not affected by types of dialyzer membrane. Conclusions:?In our study, hemodialysis stimulated the inflammation as the previous study. Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer may diminish the inflammatory process in MHD patients and may also prevent further atherosclerosis.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) survival in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis (HD) has been reported to be shortened due to the oxidative damage of RBC membrane. The use of antioxidants might help in the control of anemia and reduce the erythropoietin (EPO) dose needed. Objective:? The objective was to determine the effects of vitamin E-bonded dialyzer membrane (VEM) on anemia and EPO requirements in chronic HD patients. Patients and methods:? We prospectively studied 19 stable patients on HD (8 males, age 58.47, range 31?76 years) who were shifted from other dialyzer membranes to VEM for 6 months. At baseline they were given a mean dose of EPO of 90.6?±?51?U?kg?1 BW?1?week?1. Clinical data, dry body weight corrected pre-dialysis RBC, hemoglobin, reticulocytes, serum iron and ferritin, complete biochemistry, iPTH, and CRP were studied at 3 and 6 months, while therapy scheme was reevaluated monthly. Results:? A significant rise, compared to the baseline, was found in hemoglobin and in RBC at 3 months of treatment (12.44?±?1.16?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?=?0.002; and 4.01?± 0.53???106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05) and at the end of follow-up (12.17?±?1.33?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?<?0.05; and 4.03?±?0.53 ??106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05). No significant change in serum iron and ferritin, reticulocytes, EPO dose used, iPTH, Kt/V, or CRP was found at the end of follow-up compared to the baseline (68.8?±?17?mg/dL vs. 67.9 ±?18?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 421?±?296?mg/dL vs. 478?± 359?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 3.76?±?0.89???104/?L vs. 3.82?±?0.78 ??104/?L, p?=?NS; 90.2?±?53?U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1 vs. 90.6?±?51 U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1, p?=?NS; 157?±?43?pg/dL vs. 148?±?56?pg/dL, p?=?NS; 1.21?±?0.22 vs. 1.2?±?0.17, p?=?NS; 7.15?± 5.42?mg/L vs. 15.38?±?29.8?mg/L, p?=?NS, respectively). Conclusions:? Despite the small number of patients and the short time interval of treatment, an antioxidant effect of VEM apparently achieved early a better control of anemia in HD patients.

AB  - An eight-year-old bull mastiff dog underwent a craniotomy for surgical excision of an olfactory lobe meningioma. Rapidly progressive neurological deficits with cervical pain developed within the early postoperative period. Intraventricular and cervical subarachnoid space air accumulation (pneumorrhachis) was identified through magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Repair of a dural defect using synthetic dura substitute resulted in gradual resolution of neurological signs attributable to the tension pneumocephalus and subarachnoid space pneumorrhachis. Regrowth of the meningioma was not observed. Postoperative intraventricular tension pneumocephalus and air accumulation within subarachnoid space are uncommon but life-threatening complications of intracranial surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a satisfactory outcome.

A 47-year-old female with cervical spine infection was treated with vancomycin. Neutropenia occurred after 17?days of vancomycin therapy. Vancomycin was changed to teicoplanin, and the neutropenia resolved 4?days later. After 11?days of teicoplanin therapy, a new episode of hypersensitivity syndrome manifested as fever, bilateral neck lymphadenopathy, mild wheezing, hepatitis and increased CRP occurred. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed 3?days later. The patient?s symptoms settled over 1?week following withdrawal of teicoplanin. Naranjo?s ADR algorithm categorized the neutropenia associated with vancomycin and the hypersensitivity syndrome associated with teicoplanin as ?probable?.

AB  - Obturator hernia is a very rare cause of small bowel obstruction accounting for only 0.073?1% of all hernias(1). Here we report two such cases. A 69 year old female presents with 11/2 day history of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting and left medial thigh pain. Past history includes an admission 2 year ago with small bowel obstruction treated conservatively, diverticular disease and no previous abdominal surgery. At presentation she was unwell with recurrent faeculent vomiting. The abdomen was soft but generally tender. The left medial thigh was tender. No femoral hernia. Abdominal films revealed a dilated loop of small bowel. Blood results: raised WCC 18.7 (4.0?10.0), CRP 66 (<5). Obturator hernia was suspected and CT confirmed this. Laparotomy revealed a Richter?s hernia and viable small bowel. The defect was primarily closed. Patient was discharged 4 days post operatively. An 89 year old female presented with several days of colicky abdominal pain and no bowel motions. She had multiple co-morbidities including advanced Vascular Dementia, Asthma and Hypertension. At presentation she was unwell. Abdominal exam revealed right illiac fossa guarding with a normal WCC and a raised CRP 78. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alklosis with respiratory compensation. CT abdomen reported a small bowel obstruction due to right Obturator hernia with perforation. Due to her co-morbidities she was managed conservatively and she passed away a week later. The management of Obturator hernias is still open to debate with a wide variety of methods being described.

AB  - Background Spinal cord stimulation (SCS), by virtue of its historically described up-front costs and level of invasiveness, has been relegated by several complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) treatment algorithms to a therapy of last resort. Newer information regarding safety, cost, and efficacy leads us to believe that SCS for the treatment of CRPS should be implemented earlier in a treatment algorithm using a more comprehensive approach. Methods We reviewed the literature on pain care algorithmic thinking and applied the safety, appropriateness, fiscal or cost neutrality, and efficacy (S.A.F.E.) principles to establish an appropriate position for SCS in an algorithm of pain care. Results and Conclusion Based on literature-contingent considerations of safety, efficacy, cost efficacy, and cost neutrality, we conclude that SCS should not be considered a therapy of last resort for CRPS but rather should be applied earlier (e.g., three months) as soon as more conservative therapies have failed.

AB  - Hand is a very heavily innervated organ. Therefore any traumatic injury or surgical insults will provoke severe pain. Adequate pain management should be given in all the cases. Early motion is always necessary in all operated hands. It is uncertain as to the causes of excessive pain occurring in some patient. It is interesting to note that a hand with complex injury require flap surgery can be less painful in comparison to a lesser crushing injury that require minor repairs. Excessive pain that is out of proportion should be identified early in the follow up. Patient with pain that is unrelenting, not relieved with NSAID and disturbs sleep (after excluding all causes of complication) is a candidate to developing CRPS. In the first 2 weeks of follow up this is the stage ?nascent CRPS?. Nascent CRPS can be aborted if correctly managed. All pain provoking therapy should be stopped. Only active motion that is not pain provoking is allowed. Contact stimulation is very useful in reducing pain, it works on the basis of ?gate-control?. Self gentle rubbing of the hand on rough fabric cushion is performed hourly for 5?15 minutes. The gentle motion also moves all the normal joints in the upper limb that further suppresses pain. Excessive pain that continues beyond the duration of 6 weeks is very likely to develop into established CRPS.

AB  - Summary Increased peripheral levels of cytokines and central microglial activation have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. The degree of both innate and adaptive immune activation is also associated with worse clinical outcomes and poor treatment response in these patients. Understanding the possible causes and mechanisms leading to this immune activation is therefore an important and necessary step for the development of novel and more effective treatment strategies for these patients. In this work, we review the evidence of literature pointing to childhood trauma as one of the main causes behind the increased immune activation in patients with psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the potential mechanisms linking the experience of early life adversity (ELA) to innate immune activation. Specifically, we focus on the innervation of the bone marrow from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as a new and emerging mechanism that has the potential to bridge the observed increases in both central and peripheral inflammatory markers in patients exposed to ELA. Experimental studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SNS activation following early life stress exposure causes a shift in the profile of innate immune cells, with an increase in proinflammatory monocytes. In turn, these cells traffic to the brain and influence neural circuitry, which manifests as increased anxiety and other relevant behavioural phenotypes. To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to explore this candidate mechanism in humans. Future research is also needed to clarify whether these pathways could be partially reversible to improve prevention and treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Abstract Objective Hand infections are a common presentation to health services in the Northern Territory; however, little is known about these patients. This study aims to identify incidence, treatment and co-morbidities of hand infection patients and to pinpoint factors associated with poor outcome. Design A retrospective study of all patients presenting to Alice Springs Hospital with a hand infection during 2012. Setting Orthopaedic Unit at Alice Springs Hospital. Participants All patients admitted with a hand infection were included. Main outcome measures Admission duration, duration waited before first presentation, re-admission rate, duration of re-admission and rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Results One hundred fourteen cases of hand infections were admitted to Alice Springs Hospital during 2012, of which 87 (76%) were in Indigenous patients. Indigenous patients (P?=?0.001) and older patients (P?=?0.038) had significantly longer admissions. Indigenous patients were 9.52 times (P?=?0.038) more likely to be re-admitted than non-Indigenous patients. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 24.6%, and this was associated with smoking (P?=?0.049) and substance abuse (P?=?0.036). Formal follow-up was not related to indirect measures of hand infection severity, such as admission duration or re-admissions. Conclusion Hand infections are a common presentation to Alice Springs Hospital. Indigenous people are admitted 2.38 times longer after adjusting for age and alcohol abuse. They have a more than ninefold chance of being re-admitted to hospital than non-Indigenous people following a hand infection.

AB  - Abstract Objective Abdominal pain is a common paediatric presentation to the ED. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging, with the best-performing clinical scoring systems having sensitivities between 72% and 100%. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to seniority in diagnosing paediatric acute appendicitis in ED. Methods This is a prospective multi-centre observational study of clinician's prediction of appendicitis in children under the age of 16?years presenting to four EDs with abdominal pain over a 1 month period at each site. Clinician-estimated likelihood of acute appendicitis was compared with the final diagnosis determined by histopathology or operative findings and supplemented by telephone follow up for those without an operation. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to clinician seniority in diagnosing appendicitis. Results There were 381 children enrolled with completed clinician questionnaires, and 224 children had complete follow up or underwent appendicectomy. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range 6?12) and the incidence of appendicitis was 31/224 (13.8%, 95% confidence interval 9.3?18.4). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of clinician gestalt were 0.84 (0.76?0.91), 81% (63?93%), 76% (69?82%), 35% (28?42%) and 96% (92?98%), respectively, giving an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76% (70?82%). AUC stratified by clinician seniority (junior, intermediate and senior) were 0.89 (0.80?0.98), 0.82 (0.69?0.95) and 0.76 (0.56?0.96), respectively. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of ED clinician gestalt in paediatric appendicitis is comparable to current clinical scoring systems irrespective of seniority.

AB  - Summary As the numbers of postmortem examinations decline, pathologists face the challenging task of maintaining skills in the diagnosis of infection, obtaining good quality diagnostic samples, and upholding high standards of infection control. Over the last decade, considerable advances have been made within microbiology and virology that have enhanced the diagnostic work-up. This chapter provides an overview of the contribution of clinical microbiology to the diagnosis of infection, including an update on standard culture methods and an insight into newer molecular techniques in the context of the autopsy. We provide a framework for optimizing specimens collected and guidance on interpretation of results for common infections encountered at postmortem, as well as the role of autopsy in identifying emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorist threats. We also provide a perspective on the unique challenges of conducting neonatal autopsies in cases of sudden unexplained death in infancy. This chapter also identifies risk factors for transmission of infection among autopsy personnel and outlines basic principles for minimizing this risk.

AB  - Background The magnitude of the systemic response is proportional to the degree of surgical trauma. Much has been reported in the literature comparing metabolic and immune responses, analgesia use, or length of hospital stay between laparoscopic and open procedures. In particular, metabolic and immune responses are represented by measuring various chemical mediators as stress responses. Laparoscopic procedures are associated with reduced operative trauma compared with open procedures, resulting in lower systemic response. As a result, laparoscopic procedures are now well accepted for both benign and malignant processes. Laparoscopic liver resection, specifically, is employed for symptomatic and some malignant tumors, following improvements in diagnostic accuracy, laparoscopic devices, and techniques. However, laparoscopic liver resection is still controversial in malignant disease because of complex anatomy, the technical difficulty of the procedure, and questionable indications. There are few reports describing the stress responses associated with laparoscopic liver resection, even though many studies reviewing stress responses have been performed recently in both humans and animal models comparing laparoscopic to conventional open surgery. Although this review examines stress response after laparoscopic liver resection in both an animal and human clinical model, further controlled randomized studies with additional investigations of immunologic parameters are needed to demonstrate the consequences of either minimally invasive surgery or open procedures on perioperative or postoperative stress responses for laparoscopic liver resection.

AB  - Summary Thorough understanding of the complex pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) is necessary in order to open new avenues for treatment. The aim of this study was to characterize the CD4+ T cell population and evaluate their activation and polarization status in OA joints. Fifty-five patients with end-stage knee OA (Kellgren?Lawrence grades III?IV) who underwent surgery for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were enrolled into this study. Matched samples of synovial membrane (SM), synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) were analysed for CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets [T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells] and activation status (CD25, CD69, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD62L) by flow cytometry. Subset-specific cytokines were analysed by cytometric bead array (CBA). SM and SF samples showed a distinct infiltration pattern of CD4+ T cells. In comparison to PB, a higher amount of joint-derived T cells was polarized into CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets, with the most significant increase for proinflammatory Th1 cells in SF. CBA analysis revealed significantly increased immunomodulating cytokines [interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10] in SF compared to PB. Whereas in PB only a small proportion of CD4+ T cells were activated, the majority of joint-derived CD4+ T cells can be characterized as activated effector memory cells (CD69+CD45RO+CD62L?). End-stage OA knees are characterized by an increased CD4+ T cell polarization towards activated Th1 cells and cytokine secretion compared to PB. This local inflammation may contribute to disease aggravation and eventually perpetuate the disease process.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? There is strong evidence obtained from controlled trials that supports the use of biopsychosocial multidisciplinary interventions for chronic pain. Yet, studies of the clinical effectiveness and routine application of these approaches in real world settings are rare. This clinical evaluation sought to prospectively track changes in physical (e.g., pain severity, pain-related disability) and psychological (e.g., pain anxiety, pain self-efficacy) outcomes following usual care intervention at a large pain medicine centre (PMC). The degree to which improvements in physical and psychological outcomes were related to patient satisfaction was also examined. Methods:? One hundred and nine (M age?=?56.32 years, 51.4% female, pain chronicity Mdn?=?5 years) of 141 invited patients who attended the PMC for the first time over a 4-month period completed a pretreatment questionnaire comprised of standardised measures of pain, psychological function, and social background. Forty-three and 46 patients completed the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments respectively, which also included measures of patient satisfaction. Results:? Wiithin the initial 3 months of treatment there were no significant declines in reported pain intensity, yet patients reported significant improvements in pain relief (p?<?0.05). Patients who completed the 3-month follow-up questionnaire reported significantly reduced levels of disability (p?<?0.05), less frequent episodes of fearful appraisal and pain avoidance (p?<?0.05), and a reduction in catastrophizing pain coping responses (p?<?0.02). At 6 months, patients did not report any further improvements in physical and psychological function beyond what they had achieved within the first 3 months. Preliminary findings suggest that patient satisfaction with treatment is significantly related to perceived reductions in disability (p?<?0.05) and improvements in self-efficacy for coping with pain (p?<?0.01), yet not significantly related to changes in pain coping style. Conclusions:? These findings highlight the importance of measuring treatment outcomes prospectively across different time points in view of the initial improvement in outcome and subsequent plateau observed here. Furthermore, these preliminary results suggest the centrality of patient beliefs pertaining to disability and confidence in their ability to cope when examining the effectiveness of pain interventions.

AB  - There are limited data on demographics, long-term follow-up, and iron/rHuEPO requirements of hemodialysis (HD) patients in Turkey. The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of the HD duration, primary illness, blood pressure, and age on serum albumin, CRP, blood pressure, iron/rHuEPO requirements, PTH, and HCV positivity of HD patients. 703 patients (280 women, 423 men, aged 47.8?±?15.5 years) from 4 HD units were included and grouped according to the duration on HD. The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data of the last 3 months for each patient were recorded retrospectively. When the groups were compared, patients with a longer HD duration were younger and percentage of diabetic patients decreased as the duration increased. Serum albumin and CRP levels were similar between the groups. When the groups were compared according to the blood pressure profiles, after the 5th year, a decline in the systolic blood pressures was observed. Diastolic blood pressures were similar across the years. There was no significant difference in need of antihypertensive medicines. Iron requirements showed a fall after the 5th year, and an increase in after the 10th year. There was a decline in the hematocrit levels by the duration on HD but there was no change in rHuEPO requirements over the years. Parathyroid hormone levels and HCV positivity tended to increase across the years. Our results revealed that during the first 10 years, age, etiology (diabetes, hypertension), and blood pressure control seemed to be important factors affecting survival. Whereas, after the 10th year, patients seemed to be more prone to the long-term complications of HD, such as HCV infection, anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism.
