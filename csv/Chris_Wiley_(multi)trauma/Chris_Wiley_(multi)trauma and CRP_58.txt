AB  - Abstract Extracts from the seed of the African shea tree Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn have been used traditionally for the treatment of arthritic conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which benefit is conferred. This single-site, 15-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study examined a range of biomarkers in 89 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees and/or hips to determine potential modes of action of SheaFlex70TM, a triterpene-rich extract of Vitellaria paradoxa. In the group of participants with levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers in the upper quartile at baseline, there were significant decreases in inflammation and cartilage breakdown and trend level decreases in bone remodeling in the SheaFlex70TM group versus placebo between commencement and completion of the study. Inflammation marker TNF-alpha fell 23.9% vs 6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.041. Cartilage degradation marker CTX-II fell 28.7% vs an increase of 17.6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.018. This marker also showed significant falls across the entire study group, 10.6% vs an increase of 11.6%, (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.016. Osteocalcin levels fell 9.2%, p = 0.014 (treatment) vs 1.2%, ns (placebo), p = 0.096 (treatment vs placebo). These findings indicate that in patients with the highest levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers, SheaFlex70TM demonstrated multiple beneficial activities consistent with slowing the disease process.

AB  - Background? Laparoscopic surgery is often perceived to be more difficult for obese patients. Middlemore Hospital has unique patient population with high prevalence of obesity. This is a pilot study to compare the outcome of obese and non-obese patients who had laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our institution. Our hypothesis is that obese patients do not suffer more adverse postoperative outcome. Methods? We reviewed all patients undergoing acute and elective cholecystectomy from January 2004 to December 2006, 100 obese patients were identified. The control group consists of 100 non-obese patients matched for age, sex and type of admission. Outcome assessed includes length of recovery period, complication and conversion rate. Results? Over the three year period there were 1400 cholecystectomies, of which 96% were commenced laparoscopically. Overall conversion rate was 3.8%. The obese group has increased rate of wound complication (10% vs 2%, p?=?0.037) and conversion rate (8% vs 3.5%, p?=?0.28). The two study groups have similar median length of postoperative stay of 4 days. Conclusion? This confirms our hypothesis that it is safe for obese patients to have laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However there is increased risk of conversion and wound complication.

AB  - Abstract Several forms of arthritis and rheumatism can sometimes complicate leprosy. However, its presentation as an acute onset arthritis is unusual. We report two adult male naïve patients who presented to our rheumatology outpatient clinic with acute onset inflammatory polyarthritis, skin rash and mild sensory neurodeficit. Borderline lepromatous leprosy (in type I lepra reaction) was diagnosed. We also refer to 19 case records of Hansen arthritis in the clinic database (1998?2007) from approximately 35,000 patients and a community study to highlight the missed diagnosis of Hansen's disease and its unusual association with rheumatoid arthritis. In countries like India where leprosy is endemic, this disease also merits attention in rheumatology clinics.

AB  - Background? The provision of acute surgical care in the public sector is becoming increasingly more difficult due to the limitation of resources. The lack of predictability of access to theatres during the working day has the effect of displacing elective cases or forcing some acute cases to be performed after hours. An Acute Care Surgical Service was constructed at the Prince of Wales Hospital so as to provide acute surgery in a more timely and efficient manner. Methods? A roster of 8 general surgeons was constructed to provide onsite service during the working day and on call service after hours for a 52 week period. An acute care ward of 4 beds and an operating theatre was placed under the control of the Acute Care Surgeon (ACS). At the end of the ACS roster all patients whose treatment was incomplete were handed on to the next rostered ACS. Patient data and theatre utilisation data was prospectively collected and compared to the preceding 52 week period. Data was analysed using unpaired t-test. Results? Emergency theatre utilization during the day increased from 55% to 70%. There was a 15% reduction in acute care operating after hours. Fewer cases were done between midnight and 0800. There was more efficient use of the entire theatre block suggesting a significant cultural change. Staff satisfaction was high. Conclusion? On site consultant driven surgical leadership has provided significant positive change to the provision of Acute Surgical Care in our institution. The paradigm shift in acute surgical care has improved patient and theatre management and stimulated a cultural change of efficiency.

AB  - Purpose? To assess compliance with national and international guidelines for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in Victorian public hospitals and observe trends over time when results were reported back to hospitals. Methodology? Data on surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (drug choice, time of administration of first dose and duration) were collected as part of a surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections from April 2003 until September 2006. Results (own hospital and aggregate) were reported to hospitals on a six-monthly basis during this time. Results? Compliance with guidelines is best for cardiac and orthopaedic surgery, less so for other types of surgery. Improvements have occurred over the time period following commencement of reporting, mainly in compliance with choice of antibiotics. Conclusion? Feedback of results appears to have led to a decrease in the proportion of procedures where antibiotic prophylaxis is not considered to comply with guidelines, particularly for drug choice. There is still room for improvement, particularly with timing of administration and documentation of when antibiotics are administered. The VICNISS coordinating centre will continue to feed back results to hospitals on compliance with surgical antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations and to encourage both documentation and compliance.

AB  - Objective? Repair of incisional (and large ventral) abdominal hernias pose a challenge for many surgeons. Numerous techniques have been described. This series reports a single surgeon?s experience using the retromuscular (pre-peritoneal) mesh repair technique. Method? Data was collected on 70 consecutive incisional (n?=?23) and ventral (n?=?47) hernia repairs using retromuscular (pre-peritoneal) lightweight polypropylene mesh. Results? The median follow-up was 26 months (range 10 ? 66 months). Overall recurrence rate was 1.4%. There were seven major (10%) and four minor (7%) post-operative infections. One patient developed post-operative seroma requiring percutaneous aspiration, and one patient had chronic pain. Conclusion? Retromuscular mesh repair is a good alternative to traditional onlay mesh repairs. Morbidity and outcomes are acceptable and comparable with literature, with lower rates of seroma formation and hernia recurrence.

AB  - Introduction? Laparoscopic hernia repair remains controversial. This study aims to assess its safety and efficacy by a specialist herniologist. Materials and Methods? A prospective assessment of all patients referred from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2006 for laparoscopic extra-peritoneal inguinal/femoral hernia repair was undertaken. Polypropylene mesh was used prior to June 2004 and light weight mesh after. Patients were followed up for 5 years. Results? There were 737 hernias performed in 525 patients (including 34 recurrent and 78 Workers Compensation cases) with a median age of 51 years. Mean operation time was 48 minutes for unilateral and 65 minutes for bilateral. Mean follow-up was 3 years with one recurrence. Conversion to open operation occurred in 4 patients. Day surgery was achieved in 92% of cases with most of those staying overnight for social reasons. There was no mortality. Morbidity was low: 2 cases of urinary retention, 1 case of minor urethral bleeding and 3 cases of pneumomediastinum. Return to work/resumption of full activities occurred at a mean of 14 days. Significant chronic pain occurred in 4 patients (1 with light weight mesh) and all settled with Carbamazepine or Neurontin. Conclusions? Laparoscopic inguinal/femoral hernia repair can safely be performed as day cases with zero mortality, minimal morbidity, early resumption of physical activities and low recurrence. The use of light weight mesh resulted in fewer cases of chronic pain. Preoperative catheterization seemed to reduce incidence of urinary retention. Careful preoperative counseling achieved identical resumption of physical activities/work with Workers? Compensation cases.

AB  - Purpose? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most frequently reported malignancy in Australian cancer registries. A large proportion of these cancers are managed by general surgeons with no specific sub-specialist training. Our study aims to examine anastamotic leak rates after surgery for CRC in a regional hospital, performed by non sub-specialty trained general surgeons and to compare this data with those of other specialist colorectal units. Method? An audit of all patients treated for colorectal cancer at Toowoomba Base Hospital between 1 January 1990 and 1 April 2006 was undertaken. An anastamotic leak was defined as a clinical diagnosis documented in the patients? medical chart or operative report. Findings? 580 patients were treated for colorectal cancer during the prescribed period. Of these, 444 had surgery which included a gastrointestinal anastamosis. There were 13 anastamotic leaks (2.9%). The following commonest procedures had respective leak rates of: right hemicolectomy 2.2%; anterior resection 2.2%; sigmoid colectomy 3.28%; ultra-low anterior resection 6.67%. Of the 13 leaks, 1 occurred in Dukes A cancers (1.89%), 9 in Dukes B cancers (4%) and 3 in Dukes C cancers (1.5%). Conclusion? The anastamotic leak rates over the past 16 years at Toowoomba Hospital appear to be comparable to those of other specialist colorectal surgical units. It may be that leak rates are more dependent on the quality of the individual surgeons performing the procedure and the soundness of their surgical techniques, irrespective of their level of sub-specialization. However, research needs to be done to prospectively compare the leak rates of different surgical units before further conclusions can be made.

AB  - Background? This study was conducted to assess the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a district hospital and to compare these results with national guidelines and the published literature. Materials And Methods? This prospective and retrospective study included 112 patients, mean age 66 years, who presented with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding between July 2004 and February 2005. All patients were assigned a Rockall risk assessment score. Results? The surgical on-call teams managed all the patients according to an agreed protocol. 49 patients had a Rockall score > or =?4. Endoscopy was performed in all patients, with 60% accomplished within the first 24 hours. The most common cause found was peptic ulcer (30%). Therapeutic endoscopy was undertaken in 10 patients (9%) with a success rate of 70%. Open surgery was performed in 3 patients. One patient died after having surgery and the Rockall score was >5. Of the patients admitted with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 90.2% were discharged without complication. 11 patients died (9.8%) and all of them from the high risk group with Rockall scores >5. Their mean hospital stay was 17.8 days (range, 2?43 days). Conclusion? High-standard results in acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be achieved in a district hospital. The management, including the use of the operating theatre facilities with operative and anaesthetic support, was safe and efficient. A 24-hour-a-day endoscopy service is important to achieve early diagnosis and to plan management. A protocol and early endoscopy improve clinical outcome and reduce mortality, which occurred mostly among elderly patients with high risk scores. It is advisable to introduce the Rockall scoring system in practice.

AB  - Purpose? Bowel obstruction is a common surgical presentation, but has no defined management protocol. Our aim was to devise a series of protocols for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and large bowel obstruction (LBO) and determine if protocol implementation affects patient outcomes. Methods? This prospective single-blinded study involved an initial Medline literature review to develop ?ideal management protocols? for both SBO and LBO. Patients with bowel obstruction were identified at admission and assigned to a treatment protocol. Treating clinicians were blinded to the protocols and managed patients as they normally would. Patients were followed prospectively with investigations and management compared to ?ideal management protocol?. Results were evaluated using Students? T-Test and T test. Results? Sixty consecutive patients were identified. The use of nasogastric tubes (65%) was lower than expected from the ?ideal protocol?, but their use did not significantly impact on time to first bowel action (p?=?0.48), length of stay (p?=?0.19), time to surgery (p?=?0.16). Urinary catheters were used in 70% of patients, but had no significant impact on renal function (p?=?0.27). In adhesive SBO, Gastrograffin follow ? through was used in 61.5% of cases, but did not impact on time to first bowel action (p?=?0.13), length of stay (p?=?0.08), time to surgery (p?=?0.48). In LBO contrast enema was performed in only 30.1% of cases, but there was no significant delay in surgery (p?=?0.98). Conclusion? Current management of SBO and LBO varied widely from the ?ideal management protocol?, yet patients managed outside the protocols showed no significant differences in overall outcomes.

AB  - Purpose? To assess whether evidence based proforma?s and departmental audit can improve the management of patients with acute pancreatitis as compared to published international guidelines. Methodology? From June 2005 all patients admitted with acute pancreatitis were required to have an evidence based proforma prospectively completed. In March 2006 an interim analysis was performed and presented to the department of General Surgery highlighting areas which deviated from published guidelines. Key clinical indicators were analysed pre and post presentation. Results? Two hundred and eighty one patients were admitted with acute pancreatitis, 168 (60%) of whom were analysed in the interim analysis. The median (range) age was 59 (12?96) years and the aetiology was gallstones in 149/281 (53%) patients. 140/281 (50%) patients had predicted severe pancreatitis, but there was no difference pre and post departmental presentation (85/168 (51%) vs. 56/113 (50%), p?=?0.865). On univariate analysis following the departmental presentation there was a significant reduction in the number of CT scans performed (76/168 (45%) vs. 30/113 (27%), p?=?0.002), an increase in the number of patients undergoing definitive treatment for mild biliary pancreatitis (36/65 (55%) vs. 35/43 (81%), p?=?0.006) and a reduction in mortality (9/168 (5%) vs. 1/113 (1%), p?=?0.047). Multivariate analysis confirmed departmental presentation as independent prognostic factor in reducing the number of CT scans (p?<?0.001) and increasing definitive treatment of mild biliary pancreatitis (p?=?0.02). Conclusions? For Audit to change practice evidence based protocols alone are not sufficient. Feedback to clinicians would appear to be a powerful motivator of change.
