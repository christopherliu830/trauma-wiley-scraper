AB  - Purpose? Abdominal posterior rectopexy for rectal prolapse produces the lowest recurrence rates. However, 50% are troubled by severe postoperative constipation. Resection mitigates this dysfunction but involves the risks of an anastomosis. We aimed to evaluate functional results with laparoscopic anterior rectopexy, a novel technique designed to avoid rectal denervation and constipation. Methodology? Between January 2004 and December 2006 consecutive patients with rectal prolapse were offered undergoing laparoscopic anterior rectopexy. Patients were assessed preoperatively, at 3 and 12 months clinically and functionally (Wexner constipation and Faecal Incontinence Severity Index scores). Results? 63 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic anterior rectopexy. In this period no patient underwent a perineal procedure. Follow-up was for a median of 18 months (range 3?36 months). Minor complications occurred in 11%. There was one recurrence (2%), one conversion and no 30-day mortality. Median operating time (144 mins) and length of stay (3 days) shortened with experience. Constipation improved in 78% and median constipation scores fell from 8 to 3 (p?<?0.0001). In no patients was severe new-onset constipation induced. Continence improved in 90% and median incontinence scores fell from 32 to 0 (p?<?0.0001). Conclusion? Laparoscopic anterior rectopexy cures rectal prolapse and corrects incontinence equivalent to a posterior rectopexy. However uniquely it improves associated constipation without inducing new severe constipation, with the morbidity profile of a minimally invasive procedure. These qualities enable it to become the new gold standard for rectal prolapse.

AB  - Purpose? Patients with end stage renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) represent a potentially infected environment in which to use mesh for the repair of abdominal hernia. We present a review of our experience with these patients. Methodology? Retrospective review of all mesh repairs of abdominal hernia in CAPD patients performed by the senior author from 1997?2006. Results? 46 patients had 54 hernias repaired (25 umbilical, 18 inguinal, 9 incisional and 2 epigastric) using polypropylene mesh. 13 patients had simultaneous Tenckhoff catheter insertion. Median age was 63 years (range 22?85) and 22 were diabetic. CAPD was commenced or recommenced a median of 2 weeks after the repair (range 0 days?6 weeks). 6 short-term complications were recorded. 2 patients were treated for culture negative CAPD peritonitis within the first week after repair. 2 patients had localised wound bleeding and 1 patient was admitted with a wound infection. All were treated conservatively and no patient required mesh removal. 1 patient developed CAPD peritonitis at one month post-operation and required Tenckhoff removal, subsequent laparotomy and conversion to haemodialysis. At a median follow-up of 30 months (range 3?87) 29 patients were still alive and 2 patients were lost to follow-up. There were 4 documented recurrences and 1 patient had been converted to haemodialysis because of hernia recurrence. Conclusions? Mesh can be safely used to repair most hernias in CAPD patients. The results are comparable to those in healthy patients and mesh removal due to infection is extremely rare.

AB  - Purpose? To perform an audit of paediatric surgical patients in a provincial general surgical unit. Methodology? Data was prospectively recorded using a standardized proforma on all children aged up to 15?yrs, seen between 11th December 2005 and 11th December 2006. Results? There were 209 admissions (194 children), median age 8?yrs (6?wks?15?yrs) with 153 (73%) acutes. 37 children (18%) were under 2?yrs. Male?:?female ratio was 3?:?2. Procedures (n?=?119) were appendicectomy (35), inguinal herniotomy (30), skin procedures (29), endoscopy (10), testicular (10) and others (5). The commonest acute and elective operations were appendicectomy and inguinal herniotomy respectively. 51% of operations were acute. There were 10 tertiary hospital transfers (5%) for burns (4), pyloric stenosis (3), intussusseption (1), neonatal inguinal hernia (1) and pyoderma gangrenosum (1). Median age of transfers was 11 months (6?wks?14?yrs). Complications were wound infection (1), post-operative ileus (2) and infarcted ovary (1). Conclusion? There are increasing moves towards centralization in paediatric surgery.1 With only 4 paediatric tertiary centres in NZ, many general surgeons routinely perform paediatric surgery. A large number of children presented to our surgical department. Around half of these children required surgery and half of operations were acute. There is still a significant need for general paediatric surgery in the provinces and hence close collaboration with specialist paediatric surgeons.

AB  - Purpose? Traditionally, the postoperative management of patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) surgery has been to keep them ?nil by mouth? (NBM) until the postoperative ileus resolves. There is an evolving viewpoint that this practice is not based on sound evidence. This review examines the recent literature addressing this issue and aims to evaluate the role of early commencement of postoperative feeding compared to traditional NBM management. Methodology? Three electronic databases (Ovid Medline, PubMed and Cochrane Reviews) were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reviews or meta-analyses. Key words used included ?nil by mouth?, ?postoperative feeding?, and ?early feeding?. Reference lists were crosschecked for additional studies. Results and Conclusions? The practice of mandatory postoperative starvation and bowel rest is not supported by evidence. There is evidence from several RCTs that early postoperative feeding in patients is safe and tolerable. Some studies have shown that early feeding is beneficial in terms of postoperative complications, ileus and hospital stay. Although most of the literature is on colon surgery, similar evidence also exists for gut perforation and upper GI surgery with a trend towards reduced hospital stay and postoperative complications. In summary, this review identifies an important disparity between common clinical practice in New Zealand and evidence from several small RCTs. There does not appear to be any obvious clinical benefit in keeping patients NBM following GI surgery. The authors suggest that patients and the surgical community alike would benefit from a large scale, high quality, high-powered RCT to address this issue definitively.

AB  - Aims? The aim of this study is to assess the outcome of trans-anal excision of rectal cancer in a single Surgeon?s practice and determine possible selection criteria for this procedure. Methods? Retrospective review of hospital records, specimen histopathology and imaging of consecutive patients with rectal cancer undergoing trans-anal excision as the primary treatment. Results? 25 patients had trans-anal excision of rectal cancer including 3 cases of carcinoid tumour and 1 case of gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST). 5/25 proceeded to radical rectal resection because of the presence of adverse features including lympho-vascular and peri-neural invasion and poorly differentiated cell type; residual tumour was present in 4/5 cases, nodal metastases in 3/5 patients each of whom received pre-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 2/25 patients developed recurrence at 12 and 48 months from excision. One of these patients had distant recurrence at 12 months having proceeded to radical rectal resection and the other patient (aged 99), managed with trans-anal excision alone, recurred locally at 48 months. Both cases of recurrence were T3 tumours. Overall, 19/20 cases managed with trans-anal excision alone had no recurrence with a follow-up period of 12?48 months. 16 of these patients had T1 malignancy. Conclusion? T1 tumours may be treated with trans-excision alone in the absence of adverse pathological features. It is unclear from our study whether T2 should be managed in this way due to their small number in this study and T3 tumours are clearly at high risk of recurrence with this treatment alone.

AB  - A simplified operation suitable for most cases of straightforward pilonidal sinus is described in detail, and results of a personal series over 10 years are presented. The operation involves simple excision with closure using deep tension sutures tied over a Telfa or Melolin roll after closing the skin with a separate layer of sutures. it may be carried out in the left or right lateral position or the prone position. The operation is done as a day surgery procedure. 1?2 weeks off work may be necessary. Results compare favourably with other operations. This operation has the advantages of simplicity, minimal post-operative care and short time off work.

AB  - Purpose? The use of adjuvant therapies in colorectal carcinoma is becoming more common. However, it can be logistically difficult for patients of regional hospitals to have access to such treatments. Our aim was to document the proportion of regional patients with colorectal cancer who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Method? An audit of all patients treated for colorectal cancer at Toowoomba Base Hospital between 1 January 1990 and 1 April 2006 was undertaken. Chemotherapy use, radiotherapy use, anatomical location and histological grade of the cancers were examined. Findings? Of the 225 patients who had surgery for Dukes B colonic carcinomas, 22.7% were given chemotherapy. This rate increased to 59.6% for Dukes C colon cancers. 141 rectal cancers were curatively excised during the prescribed period. 39 of these patients received radiotherapy (27.7%). Of these, only 2 (5.13%) had pre-operative radiotherapy. 19 patients had rectal cancers which were considered non resectable and of these, 5 (26.3%) were treated with radiotherapy. Conclusion? Despite the paucity of high level evidence showing a benefit in using adjuvant therapy in node negative colon cancers, a relatively large proportion of our regional patients with Dukes B adenocarcinomas were given chemotherapy. The rate of such therapy for Dukes C cancers was comparable to other studies. Fewer than expected patients with rectal adenocarcinomas had radiotherapy. Of those who did receive this, only a very small proportion received pre-operative radiotherapy. It may be that the lower than expected rates of radiotherapy were due to this service being located about 130?km from Toowoomba Hospital.

AB  - Traditional teaching instructs us to remove a normal appendix during open appendicectomy, to avoid confusion during future presentations with right iliac fossa pain1. This ideology has been associated with a negative appendicectomy rate in the order of 15?20%2. The risk of missing submucosal appendicitis, of which the clinical significance remains unclear, has also propagated the decision to remove the ?normal? appendix. The advent of laparoscopy has lead to an improvement in the diagnosis of alternate pathology in the context of suspected appendicitis, particularly in the female population. There however still remains some confusion and concern amongst members of the surgical community as to whether appendicectomy should be performed in the context of normal other laparoscopic findings. We present the results of a retrospective review of 400 patients who underwent laparoscopy (+/? appendicectomy) at Westmead Hospital (Sydney, Australia) from July 2004 to June 2006 for suspected appendicitis, or for the investigation of right iliac fossa pain. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2.5 years. Of the 200 patients reviewed to date, in the 120 patients who underwent laparoscopy, 84% proceeded to have appendicectomies despite normal operative findings in one third of cases. This led to a high negative appendicectomy rate of 34%. In our experience, removal of the appendix is not justified when the appendix appears normal at laparoscopy, even in the absence of alternate pathology.

AB  - Background? A national minimum clinical data set for predicting non-operative and post-operative mortality at discharge was developed by Prytherch et?al. Our aim to audit the octogenerian surgical admissions in our hospital for complications, discharge outcomes and discharge mortality. Method? Prospective audit from the 1st January 2006?30th November. Data collected for 243 consecutive admissions: 91 non-operative, 82 elective and 70 emergency, using standardized pro forma. Results? In total 223 surgical patients (re-admission 8.2%) included 70 emergency admissions (28.8%), 82 elective admissions (33.8%) and 91 non-operative admissions (37.5%). Complications rate of 47.1% Emergency, 18.3% Elective and 23.3% Non-operative admissions. Discharged home: 52% Emergency, 92% Elective and 57% Non-operative patients. Mortality: Emergency 7.1% (n?=?5), Elective 0% (n?=?0) and Non-operative 5.5% (n?=?5) patients. Emergency laparotomy 35% (n?=?2) mortality. When minimum clinical data compared predicted to observed mortality emergency ?2?=?10.95 (p?<?0.001), elective ?2?=?6.22 (p?<?0.0025) non-operative ?2?=?6.51 (p?<?0.025). Conclusion? The audit overall mortality data was acceptable when compared to published work. Emergency, elective and non-operative patient groups differed significantly (p?<?0.025) from predicted deaths and did not fit this model according to risk stratification.

AB  - Purpose? The Abdominal Wall Components Separation Technique (AWCST), allows closure of ventral defects by transposition of the abdominal wall muscle(1). The aim of this audit of our initial experience was to evaluate the technique for repairing defects after removal of infected mesh or for uncomplicated incisional hernia. Methodology? A prospective audit was conducted on the initial experience of 9 consecutive patients under the care of one surgeon (BPW) from August to December 2006. Results? Of the 9 patients, 5 had infected mesh and 4 had large incisional hernias. The median follow up was 62 days range 7?125 days. Significant wound infections occurred in 4 patients requiring re-operation. In all 4 abdominal wall repair remained in tact. 1 patient has developed a recurrent incisional hernia. Conclusion? AWCST is an useful procedure for the closure of large defects, particularly for incisional hernia and may avoid the use of mesh. We recommend avoiding primary skin closure after removing infected mesh and follow the principle of delayed primary closure. No specific conclusions can be made from this small series with a short follow up, but the technique has merit and requires further evaluation.

AB  - Objective? To examine current practice regarding autopsy requests and assess consultant opinion in a general surgical department. Methods? 100 patient deaths in a general surgical department, over a 2 year period, were randomly selected. A brief summary of each admission was distributed to 13 general surgeons who were asked to comment whether; cases should have been discussed with the coroner, a coroner?s autopsy should have been performed, a hospital post mortem should have been performed and whether it would be appropriate to complete a death certificate without post mortem. Surgeon responses were compared with actual outcomes. Results? The majority of patients were elderly (median age 79?yrs, 49%?>?80?yrs), admitted acutely (92%) and did not undergo an operation (73%). Patients who had undergone recent operation were more likely to be referred to the coroner (p?<?0.001) and more likely to undergo coroners autopsy (p?=?0.011). Older patients and those admitted from a rest home were less likely to be referred to the coroner (p?<?0.001 & 0.02 respectively) or undergo coroners autopsy (p?=?0.002). The survey predicted more referrals to the coroner (p?=?0.001), more hospital autopsies (p?<?0.001), and that the treating doctor would complete the certificate of death less often than actually happened (p?=?0.004). Conclusions? General surgeons consider autopsy to be necessary more often than current practice in our institution. The decline in autopsy rates may compromise the education of surgeons and trainees.

AB  - Over the past decade, chemical labeling with isobaric tandem mass tags, such as isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification reagents (iTRAQ) and tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents, has been employed in a wide range of different clinically orientated serum and plasma proteomics studies. In this review the scope of these works is presented with attention to the areas of research, methods employed and performance limitations. These applications have covered a wide range of diseases, disorders and infections, and have implemented a variety of different preparative and mass spectrometric approaches. In contrast to earlier works, which struggled to quantify more than a few hundred proteins, increasingly these studies have provided deeper insight into the plasma proteome extending the numbers of quantified proteins to over a thousand.
