AB  - Purpose? Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed operations in general surgical practice. A variety of techniques have been used in the past with different results. The aim of the present study is to report our experience of inguinal hernia repair using the Kugel patch and to measure the frequency of postoperative recurrence and chronic groin pain. Methodology? Data were recorded prospectively from a series of 333 inguinal hernia repairs performed between January 2004 to December 2006 using the Kugel patch technique. Wound infection, seroma, haematoma urinary retention, 6-month recurrence and chronic groin pain were the outcome measures. Results? The Kugel patch hernia repairs were performed in 284 patients during the 3-year period. There were no recurrences or chronic groin pain within 6 months of the 333 repairs. There was only one reported wound infection. The average operating time for bilateral hernia repair was 40.5 minutes (SD 8.8). Recurrent hernias took an average of 26 minutes (SD6.2) to repair whilst unilateral hernias took an average of 23 minutes (SD 6.8). 5 (1.8%) of the 284 patients had urinary retention. The average operating time for 136 direct procedures was 27 minutes compared with 25 minutes for the 148 indirect procedures (p?=?0.096, t-test). Conclusion? In this prospective series the Kugel hernia repair is associated with no post hernia repair groin pain and no recurrence within 6 months of the procedure. It is inexpensive compared with laparoscopic repair, and allows the surgeon to cover all potential defects with one piece of mesh.

AB  - Purpose? Varicose veins are a significant health problem which attract much medico-legal attention. Recent publications have suggested ?best practice? regarding assessment of patients with varicose veins. A retrospective audit was performed comparing clinical practice in a New Zealand teaching hospital with suggested standards. Methods? Clinic letters from 80 patients awaiting varicose vein surgery were reviewed. Data were collated regarding presenting problem, relevant medical history, clinical findings on examination, further investigations and outcome. Results? Presenting complaint was noted for 99% of patients but actual symptoms were only recorded for 41%. The degree of disability caused by varicose veins was documented for 33% and patient concerns in 4%. Half of the patients presented with leg ulcers but ABPIs were only recorded in 26% of clinic letters. Duplex scanning was recommended prior to surgery for 69% of patients and hand held Doppler assessment of venous disease was recorded in 61% cases. Clinic letters did not specify the nature and extent of disease in 6% of cases, and although every patient was recommended for surgery the exact procedure was specified in only 24%. Details of surgical risks and complications were only present in 20% of letters, and only 21% of patients received a printed information sheet. Conclusions? The quality of the data recorded in the clinic letters of fell below suggested standards for assessment of patients with varicose veins. Improving the documentation of patient assessment will allow better communication between providers of healthcare and make clinical errors less likely.

AB  - Objectives: To assess whether doxycycline and rifampin have a therapeutic role in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Design: Randomized, triple-blind, controlled trial. Setting: Three tertiary care and two community geriatric clinics in Canada. Participants: One hundred one patients with probable AD and mild to moderate dementia. Intervention: Oral daily doses of doxycycline 200 mg and rifampin 300 mg for 3 months. Measurements: The primary outcome was a change in Standardized Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (SADAScog) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in the SADAScog at 12 months and tests of dysfunctional behavior, depression, and functional status. Results: There was significantly less decline in the SADAScog score at 6 months in the antibiotic group than in the placebo group, (?2.75 points, 95% confidence interval (CI)=?5.28 to ?0.22, P=.034). At 12 months, the difference between groups in the SADAScog was ?4.31 points (95% CI=?9.17?0.56, P=.079). The antibiotic group showed significantly less dysfunctional behavior at 3 months. There was no significant difference in adverse events between groups (P=.34). There were no differences in Chlamydia pneumoniae detection using polymerase chain reaction or antibodies (immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgA) between groups. Conclusion: Therapy with doxycycline and rifampin may have a therapeutic role in patients with mild to moderate AD. The mechanism is unlikely to be due to their effect on C. pneumoniae. More research is needed to investigate these agents.

AB  - Purpose? Endometriosis is defined as the presence of aberrant endometrial tissue outside of the uterus that responds to stimulation by ovarian hormones. A large, circumscribed mass of such tissue is commonly termed an endometrioma. Abdominal wall endometriomas in association with caesarean section scars have been reported repeatedly in the obstetrics and gynaecology literature, but rarely in general surgical journals. Methodology? In this paper, six patients are reviewed who presented between 2001 and 2006 with painful, tender nodules in and around caesarean section scars. Of these, four reported exacerbation of symptoms during, or just prior to menstruation. One patient had experienced 12 years of symptoms, previously attributed to intra-abdominal adhesions. Results? All patients had their scar nodules excised. Five procedures were performed electively. One patient underwent emergency exploration of her caesarean scar for possible incarcerated incisional hernia. Ectopic endometrial tissue was seen in the histological specimens of all patients. Four patients reported resolution of their symptoms following surgery. One patient had ongoing symptoms post-operatively, with an additional mass lesion seen on ultrasound consistent with a second endometrioma. One patient did not attend follow-up. Conclusion? General surgeons are commonly required to assess and manage abdominal wall masses, and should have an awareness of endometrioma in the differential diagnosis when such a lesion is seen in association with a caesarean section scar. Wide excision is usually very effective at alleviating symptoms of abdominal wall endometrioma.

AB  - Purpose? To evaluate surgical management of patients presenting with symptomatic gallstone disease to Middlemore Hospital in 2005. Method? Retrospective case review of acute presentations of symptomatic gallstone disease between Jan 1st and Dec 31st 2005. Results? Four hundred and two patients were included in the final analysis. Forty six of these patients were unfit for surgery, 26 were solely admitted to the emergency department without being referred to a surgical team and 22 declined surgery. Therefore 308 patients (77%) were eligible for surgery at index admission (IA). Sixty six percent (204) of these received surgery during IA with an average time to surgery of 4 days. Of the remaining 104 eligible patients who did not receive surgery during IA, 54% (56) received public surgery at a later date with an average wait of 85 days. Fourteen percent (42) never received surgery despite being eligible during IA. There was no significant difference in duration of total acute hospital stay between those with surgery at IA and those who did not receive surgery at IA. For those who had acute surgery the conversion rate was 2% (4). There were no biliary injuries or perioperative deaths and post-operative readmission rate was 4% (9). Sixty two percent (64) of the 104 eligible patients who did not receive surgery at IA were subsequently readmitted acutely within 24 months. The average wait time for US, MRCP and ERCP was 0.9, 3.1 and 3.4 days respectively. Conclusion? Acute surgery remains the treatment of choice for acute biliary disease. This approach requires a committed team approach but is safe and cost effective.

AB  - Summary Rationale This initiative is focused on building a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings. Methods In January 2016, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. GLIM appointed a core leadership committee and a supporting working group with representatives bringing additional global diversity and expertise. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications. Results A two-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected, i.e., first screening to identify ?at risk? status by the use of any validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among the GLIM core and supporting working group members. The top five ranked criteria included three phenotypic criteria (weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity as Stage 1 (moderate) and Stage 2 (severe) malnutrition are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories. Conclusion A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure further collaboration and endorsements from leading nutrition professional societies, to identify overlaps with syndromes like cachexia and sarcopenia, and to promote dissemination, validation studies, and feedback. The diagnostic construct should be re-considered every 3?5 years.

AB  - Purpose? In New Zealand, surgeons working in the private sector are reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. Due to concerns that a truly competitive market does not exist, other countries have adopted a Relative Value Scale (RVS) to help determine a fair relative rate of reimbursements. No such scale exists in NZ for surgeons, but does so for anaesthetists. Methodology? This study compares reimbursements to surgeons and anaesthetists from private insurers, other than Southern Cross, using data from 3186 procedures performed between 1996 and 2002. We calculate an implicit hourly rate of reimbursement and then compare the level of reimbursements between procedures and the variance of reimbursements within a procedure for surgeons and anaesthetists. Results? The results demonstrate significantly greater variations in average reimbursements between procedures for surgeons than for anaesthetists. Furthermore, the variability of reimbursements is greater for reimbursements to surgeons within specific procedures, especially for those more recently introduced. Conclusions? While the results do not necessarily imply that surgical reimbursements are inconsistent with underlying market rates, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that anaesthetist?s fees show greater stability because of the existence of a RVS. We conclude by suggesting that a RVS for determining private surgical fees should be given serious consideration in New Zealand.

AB  - Background? A recent meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of abdominal fascial closures concluded that in order to reduce incisional hernia rates without increasing wound pain, or the rate of dehiscence slowly absorbable continuous sutures appear to achieve the best results in abdominal fascial closures. We surveyed the techniques for abdominal fascial closure among general surgeons in Canberra, Australia. Methodology? 49 out of 80 surgeons responded to the survey by form. The information collected included the seniority of the surgeon, the frequency of laparotomy closure, surgical technique and suture material utilised in abdominal fascial closure. Results? 34 (69%) of the surgeons surveyed preferred a non-absorbable monofilament suture material for abdominal fascial closure with nylon being the most popular. Most (38, 78%) also preferred a non-absorbable monofilament suture in emergency surgery. 12 (24%) surgeons preferred to use slowly absorbable suture. The majority of surgeons (37, 76%) preferred continuous suture technique, whilst only 2 (4%) used continuous followed by interrupted suture closures. Only 5 (10%) complied with the dual recommendation of continuous suture technique and slowly absorbable suture. Conclusion? The majority of surgeons preferred non-absorbable monofilament suture rather than slowly absorbable suture. Only 1 in 10 surgeons complied with both components of evidence base, which supports the use of slowly absorbable suture material and a continuous technique in abdominal fascial closure. A definitive RCT would confirm this observation.

AB  - Purpose? Fatty food intolerance and diarrhoea (PCD) are increasingly being recognised as distressing postoperative sequels in a proportion of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Understanding of PCD, its predisposing factors and associated symptoms is important for both consent and postoperative management. Methodology? 100 consecutive patients underwent chart review and telephone contact. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect data on age; sex; weight/BMI; pre- and post-operative bowel habits, bloating, pain, dietary intolerance, dietary modification and patient satisfaction. Patients were divided into two categories, those with and those without PCD. Groups were compared using t-test and univariate analysis to determine significance at p-value of 0.05. Results? Two patients were excluded due to preoperative diarrhoea (2%). PCD, defined by changes in consistency and frequency of bowel actions (p?=?0.0004), was observed in 17 of 98 patients (17%). PCD was associated with younger age (p?=?0.014), higher weight (p?=?0.041), less bloating preoperatively (p?=?0.045) and higher likelihood of bloating postoperatively (p?=?0.048). There was no statistically significant correlation with dietary intolerance, dietary modification or patient satisfaction. 7 patients (7%) reported postoperative constipation or resolution of pre-existing diarrhoea. Conclusions? Subjective PCD and dyspeptic symptoms correlate with measurable differences in bowel habits. Younger patients are significantly more likely to develop PCD and should specifically be warned of this possibility.
