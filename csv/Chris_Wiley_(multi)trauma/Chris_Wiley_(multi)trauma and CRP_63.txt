AB  - Summary The role of the phagocytic function of monocytes and neutrophils in sepsis has been poorly investigated. The present study evaluated the impact of the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes on the outcome of patients with severe sepsis. Thirty-one patients and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. The phagocytic activity of monocytes and neutrophils was evaluated during 24?h after admission and the results were correlated to the expression of CD64 on neutrophils and monocytes, CD14 antigen on monocytes, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and the patients' survival. A reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils during the first 24?h after admission was a negative predictor for survival. Increased expression of CD64 antigen on polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and monocytes was favourably correlated to the patients' survival. In multivariate analysis the phagocytic activity of PMNs was the only independent predictor factor for survival. Patients with PMN phagocytic activity <37% had lower expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and worse outcome, while those with phagocytic activity >37% had higher expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and better outcome. Reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils may represent a state of neutrophil inactivation similar to that previously described for monocytes during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response.

AB  - Summary Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have reduced numbers and frequencies of dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, and there is also evidence for defective activation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Collectively, these observations may point to a primary defect in the generation of functional DCs. Here, we measured frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) in peripheral blood of 26 CVID patients and 16 healthy controls. The results show that the patients have reduced absolute counts of both subsets. However, the decreased numbers in peripheral blood were not reflected in reduced frequencies of CD34+ pDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-α or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9. The study represents the most thorough functional characterization to date, and the first to assess bone marrow progenitor output, of naturally occurring DCs in CVID. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.

AB  - Abstract The Seventh Tripartite Meeting of the Surgical Research Society held in conjunction with the Society of University Surgeons and the European Surgical Research Society took place on 6, 7 and 8 July 1988 at the University of Bristol. The meeting incorporated the 68th Meeting of the Surgical Research Society. A symposium entitled ?Screening for aortic aneurysm? preceded the free paper sessions. One hundred and ninety papers were read and the Patey Prize was awarded to Mr D. J. A. Scott for his presentation, entitled ?Application of multiple linear regression in the estimation of peripheral resistance?.

AB  - Summary Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) are the most frequent musculoskeletal pain syndromes. These conditions are often not distinct entities and may overlap. There is significant comorbidity of FMS with other functional somatic syndromes and mental disorders. Clinical assessment should therefore focus on the whole range of physical and somatic distress and associated disability. The clinical diagnosis of FMS and MPS is based on history (typical cluster of symptoms), complete physical examination and the exclusion of other somatic disease as cause of local, regional or widespread pain. There is strong evidence for the efficacy of aerobic exercise, balneotherapy, multidisciplinary therapy (exercise and psychological therapy) and specific pharmacological agents (amitriptyline, duloxetine, fluoxetine, milnacipran, paroxetine, pregabalin) in reducing some of the key symptoms of FMS. There is strong evidence for short term pain relief in MPS by needling and laser therapy; however, the role for these treatments in long term therapy awaits further research.
