AB  - Abstract Objective: To find out if the severity of acute pancreatitis or the surgical treatment of severe acute pancreatitis influences HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Design: Prospective open study. Setting: University hospital, Austria. Subjects: 9 consecutive patients with severe acute pancreatitis in need of operative treatment, 5 patients with mild acute pancreatitis, and 7 healthy volunteers. Interventions: Samples of 5 ml blood were taken daily into endotoxin free tubes at same time points. Surgical treatment for severe acute pancreatitis consisted of blunt necrosectomy, operative lavage, laparostomy, and open drainage. Main outcome measures: Correlation between HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes on the one hand and the severity of acute pancreatitis and operative treatment of severe acute pancreatitis, on the other. Results: In patients with severe acute pancreatitis expression of HLA-DR and CD14 was significantly downregulated both before and after operation (p < 0.0001; ANOVA), compared with patients with mild acute pancreatitis or healthy controls. However the expression of the two cell surface markers was not affected either by the first operation, or by the reoperations. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in acute pancreatitis the expression of cell surface markers on peripheral blood monocytes is related to the severity of disease but is not influenced by operative treatment.

AB  - Introduction Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is an elusive and complex neuropathic condition that is notoriously recalcitrant to treatment. The term ?CPP? encompasses a number of treatment-resistant conditions like pudendal neuralgia, interstitial cystitis, coccygodynia, vulvodynia. CPP has been presented neuromodulators attempting to utilize conventional spinal cord stimulation (SCS), with constant frustration and high explant rates. Contrary to SCS, dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) delivers targeted target to focal areas, does not rely on paresthesias, and is able to reliably capture body parts like the pelvis making it an ideal modality for the treatment of CPP. We present seven patients with intractable CPP, resistant to conventional treatment methods, all successfully treated with DRGS. Methods The case series includes seven patients with severe, CPP who failed to respond to a variety interventional treatments, and in some cases SCS. All seven patients were successfully trialed with DRGS utilizing leads placed over the bilateral L1 and S2 DRG's?to our knowledge, no publications describing either this particular lead configuration, or utilizing DRG stimulation on CPP, exist. Results Following treatment, all seven patients experienced significant pain relief as well as reduction in opioid consumption and some cases improvement with sexual function and urination. Four of these patients have been implanted and continue to self-report sustained pain relief with high-satisfaction and functional improvement. To date no explants or instances of loss of efficacy have occurred (>1 year since implant). Conclusion Like most neuropathic pain states, CPP is resilient, difficult to manage, and typically unresponsive to the traditional therapeutics and SCS. Our case series demonstrates no only that DRGS is potentially effective, long-term treatment modality for CPP, but that the L1/S2 lead placement is the configuration of choice despite distinct differences in etiologies of pain and location.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.
