AB  - A case report of stage IV neuroblastoma which presented with periorbital swelling and ecchymosis originally misdiagnosed as facial trauma. The child soon developed a sinister pancytopenia, which following extensive investigations was revealed to be due to an underlying neuroblastoma. Periorbital ecchymosis associated with neuroblastoma is termed ?raccoon eyes? and is a diagnostic trap for the unwary.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - A follow-up study of 14 young adults with complex regional pain syndrome type I. (Hospital Morvan, Brest, France) J Neurosci Nurs. 2000;32:83?88. This study evaluated the symptom experience and functional status of 27 young adults with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, now known as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I. All were originally diagnosed and studied 12 years ago. Only 15 subjects could be located; 14 participated in the research. A descriptive exploratory design was utilized. A tool was designed to gather data about daily living variables, psychological variables, and symptom variables. Although many questions required the use of Likert scales, there were some open-ended questions to capture the qualitative descriptions of the participant's symptom experiences. Findings contribute to the clinical literature about CRPS and its effect on clients over time. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This paper is a follow-up interview on 14 patients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I more than a decade ago. The author created a tool with the purpose of gathering data in 3 different aspects such as: current activity levels, psychosocial assessment, and symptom experiences. This data were gathered in a questionnaire form. The first 2 sections (current acting levels and psychosocial assessment) are questions to be answered on a 4-point Likert scale and the last part (symptom experiences) is an open-ended question section where the subject can answer in a more descriptive manner. What is particular about the population of patients in this study is the fact that all were diagnosed at an early age (childhood or as young adults). This yielded an interesting set of results. As far as current activity levels, more that two-thirds of the patients were able to perform basic daily living activities and at least 50% of them can perform more strenuous activities such as running, climbing stairs, and driving a car. The results above extrapolate well into the psychosocial assessment where greater than 90% considered themselves self-sufficient. Of interest was the fact that there was no depression or overwhelming psychiatric morbidity reported. This could be because at a younger age of onset for CRPS type I, more effective coping skills can be developed that would aid these patients in adaptation to daily life. It is not surprising that in symptom experience the most common was continuing pain, followed by limitations in range of motion. In summation, this study sheds light into an aspect that has not been researched in an extensive manner, which is a long-term follow-up of patients suffering from CRPS type I and how they adapted to daily life. Although conclusions reflect valid facts, the sample size is small and larger population including patients who develop CRPS type I at later stages in life may provide us with crucial information in a general set of patients.

AB  - Pain relief in complex regional pain syndrome due to spinal cord stimulation does not depend on vasodilation. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) Anesthesiology 2000;92:1653?1660. This study aimed to assess whether pain relief in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS after spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is, in fact, dependent on vasodilation. In addition, the study attempted to determine which of the potential mechanisms may cause the vasodilatory effect that is generally found after SCS. Twenty-four of 36 patients with unilateral CRPS responded to the test of SCS. Twenty-two of the 24 responders (hand, n = 14; foot, n = 8) who had undergone previous sympathectomy were enrolled in the study. In addition, 20 control subjects (10 controls for each extremity) were studied. By means of laser Doppler flowmetry, the skin microcirculation of the patients was measured bilaterally while the SCS system was switched off and while it was activated. Control subjects were tested only once. The ratio of the rest flow at heart level and the dependent position was defined as the vasoconstricted index. Both in affected hands and feet, patients were found to have lower vasoconstriction indices (P < 0.01) as compared with controls, indicating a decreased sympathetic tone. Applying SCS did not result in any microcirculatory change as compared with the baseline or the contralateral clinically unaffected side. Conclude that the study failed to show that SCS influences skin microcirculation in patients with CRPS and a low sympathetic tone. Therefore, it was also concluded that pain relief in CRPS due to SCS is possible without vasodilation. Because sympathetic activity was greatly decreased in the patients, these results support the hypothesis that the vasodilation that is normally found with SCS is due to an inhibitory effect on sympathetically maintained vasoconstriction. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. SCS probably provides pain relief independent of increases in blood flow to the affected area. There may be several weaknesses in this study. All patients underwent prior sympathectomy. As every pain management specialist knows, the results of these procedures are variable. That leaves a group of pain patients with CRPS I that is either predominantly sympathetically mediated or sympathetically independent, with variable degrees of sympathetic blockade. In addition, only part of the peripheral circulation is measured with a device which accuracy has not yet been confirmed. Many variables are introduced in this study making a statement that there are no differences between the treatment group and the control somewhat strong. In my opinion: pain relief in complex regional pain syndrome due to spinal cord stimulation may not depend on vasodilatation.

AB  - Summary Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provides circulatory and respiratory support; this takes place whilst efforts are made to produce the return of spontaneous circulation with the ultimate goal of recovering a neurologically intact patient. Most veterinary patients will cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) due to progressive systemic illness, trauma or other processes resulting in hospitalisation. A minimum of two personnel is required for effective CPR. The ideal team consists of: team leader, compressor, breather, drug administrator, and recorder. Resuscitation at the cellular level requires oxygen delivery to the vital organs. In recent years the sequence of airway-breathing-circulation has been changed to circulation-airway-breathing in all but known asphyxial causes. Advanced life support therapies are meant to enhance basic life support efforts and improve the chance of successful resuscitation. Atropine is an anti-cholinergic that counteracts the high vagal tone decreases in heart rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction seen in CPA.
