AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? Evoked phenomena in clinical neuropathic pain are viewed as a window into the underlying pathophysiology. They are also potential therapeutic targets. This study sought evidence for the effect on such evoked phenomena of currently used agents. Design.? We reviewed MEDLINE (1966?2006) and EMBASE (1980?2006) to locate all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials examining therapeutic responses of evoked neuropathic pain phenomena, including dynamic mechanical allodynia, pin prick hyperalgesia, and thermal allodynia. We also noted the methods of elicitation of these evoked pain phenomena. Results.? We found 40 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. A wide variety of methods was used to evoke neuropathic pain phenomena. For dynamic mechanical allodynia, there is some evidence for the efficacy of ketamine, alfentanil, and morphine, but only when administered intravenously. For other agents and other evoked pain phenomena, there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Conclusions.? There is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in treating evoked pain phenomena in clinical neuropathic pain states. There is little clinical evidence to either support or refute theoretical arguments for efficacy of specific agents in evoked neuropathic pain phenomena. More and larger trials are needed to examine these phenomena. Consensus is required with respect to methods used to elicit these evoked phenomena.

AB  - The past five decades have seen an improvement in the mortality and morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD) because of prophylaxis against infectious complications, improved and expanded red cell transfusions, implementation of hydroxyurea therapy, and advances in supportive care. Now that the majority of patients in the western hemisphere reaches adulthood, end organ diseases are frequent, which include vasculopathic complications such as chronic leg ulcers. The management of patients with leg ulcers requires the hematologist to lead a team of health care professionals, and investigates the presence of associated, but potentially still occult signs of vasculopathy, such as pulmonary hypertension, renal disease, priapism and retinopathy. These complications may be asynchronous, and long term careful screening is indicated, in order to ensure early diagnosis and intervention. It is crucial to address both the immediate consequences of pain, infection and disability, and long term effects on quality of life, employment and stigma associated with chronic ulceration. Recent insights into their pathophysiology may have practical implications. We propose a holistic approach to the management of patients' physical and emotional problems and mechanisms of ulcers formation and delayed healing. An overview of topical and systemic therapies for chronic ulcers is given, with the understanding that wound care therapy is best left to the wound specialists, medical and surgical, with whom the hematologist must keep an open line of communication. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines, our opinion is based on both a critical review of the literature and our personal clinical and research experience. Am. J.

AB  - Summary Telemedicine is the transmission of healthcare information over a distance using information and communication technologies (ICTs) for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, or management of a patient. This chapter provides a background for telepediatrics in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), explores the variety of telepediatric models of care that can be utilized and provides case study examples. Telemedicine can be delivered using different technologies. Videoconferencing is one of the main modalities of telemedicine. Store-and-forward is another modality of telemedicine. Regardless of the modality used for telemedicine they all rely on ICTs. It is important to examine both the availability of internet connectivity and devices to connect to the Internet in LMICs. Email-based telemedicine can facilitate store-and-forward telemedicine consultations in a large number of medical specialties and applications. There are a number of hosted telemedicine services suitable for use in LMICs.
