AB  - Peptic ulcers (PU) are the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They result in significant costs both to the patient and the health care system. Despite a decrease in the prevalence of H. pylori infection, the incidence of bleeding PU has not reduced. Resuscitation of the patient with a bleeding PU remains the foundation of management. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has evolved from initially a diagnostic tool to now also being a therapeutic modality. The endoscopic stigmata of a visible vessel or active bleeding have been validated as indicators of a high risk of adverse outcomes. Multiple endoscopic techniques have been developed to treat bleeding PU with these stigmata. The most effective and commonly used are thermal contact therapy (heater probe or bipolar electrocoagulation) and endoscopic clipping. They are each used either as monotherapies or combined with adrenaline injection. These techniques have been shown to reduce the rates of rebleeding, surgery and mortality. Early studies showed no benefit from the use of H2-receptor antagonists in patients with bleeding PU. In contrast, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) given after endoscopic haemostatic therapy as a bolus and then a subsequent 72?hr infusion, have been shown to significantly reduce the rates of rebleeding,, surgery and mortality compared to placebo. In summary, endoscopic techniques combined with pharmacological treatment with PPIs significantly improve outcomes in patients with bleeding PU with high risk endoscopic stigmata. These methods are widely available and are essential in the optimal modern management of bleeding PU.

AB  - Purpose:?? Lesions of the submandibular gland represent a pleomorphically diverse group making benign and malignant lesions difficult to differentiate from each other. The current series aims to identify the roles of pre-operative cytology and imaging with subsequent histopathology in the management of these lesions. Methods:?? Between 1998 and 2008 fifty-four patients, of median age 54?years (range 25?94), were retrospectively identified. Fifty patients underwent fifty-two surgical procedures involving the submandibular gland. The utility of imaging and cytology was analysed, and the accuracy of cytology correlated with histopathology. Results:?? Pathologies of resected specimens included: sialadenitis; 17 (32%), pleomorphic adenoma; 9 (17%), calculi; 8 (15%), lymphoma; 5 (10%) squamous cell carcinoma; 2 (4%), adenoid cystic carcinoma; 1 (2%) and other; 10 (20%). Twenty-eight patients (52%) underwent fine needle aspiration cytology/core biopsies; of these 25 proceeded to surgery. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of fine needle aspiration cytology correlation with histology were 88.0%, 71.4%, and 94.4% respectively. Overall, the complication rate was 9.6%. Conclusion:?? This series demonstrates histological outcomes in patients specific to the submandibular salivary gland for which there are few comparative series in the literature. The trans-cervical surgical approach to submandibular gland pathology is a safe and effective method with minimal morbidity. Combining investigative modalities and cytology optimises the diagnosis and management of submandibular salivary gland lesions.

AB  - Abstract On behalf of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the best available evidence regarding the validity of relevant body composition methods (eg, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA], ultrasound [US], and bioelectrical impedance analysis [BIA]) in clinical populations. The guidelines targeted adults >18 years of age with a potentially inflammatory condition or pathological end point associated with a specific disease or clinical condition. In total, 7375 studies were retrieved, and 15 DXA, 7 US, and 23 BIA studies provided applicable data. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the test method against a ?gold standard? reference. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria were used to separate the evaluation of the body of evidence from the recommendations. Based on a limited number of studies and expert opinion, DXA is recommended for the assessment of fat mass in patients with a variety of disease states; however, the validity of DXA for lean mass assessment in any clinical population remains unknown. No recommendations can be made at this time to support the use of US or BIA in the clinical setting, as data to support its validity in any specific patient population are limited in scope or by the proprietary nature of manufacture-specific BIA regression models to procure body composition data, respectively. Directions for future research are provided. These clinical guidelines were approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery Programs (EPR) have been shown to reduce mortality, morbidity and length of stay. Can similar results be produced in tertiary centres with the presence of complex colorectal cases? Method:?? 102 patients were prospectively analysed with a power calculation of 34 being established prior to commencement of the study. The average age was 66.6 (male: female ratio of 1:1). Data collection included demographics, operative procedure, pain scores, POSSUM scores, American Society of Anaesthiology (ASA) scores, and discharge times. All complications were documented. Results:?? 83 cases were open procedures and 19 laparoscopically, (3 were converted intra-operatively). The majority were anterior resection (47, [46.1%]) and right hemicolectomies (32, [31.3%]). The average overall discharge time was 11.75?days compared to 15.11 (p < 0.001) prior to commencement of the study in 2005. Anterior resections and subtotal colectomies (14.3 and 13.7?days respectively) had significantly longer lengths of stay compared to right hemicolectomies (10.7?days) [p < 0.001]. 56% patients were ASA grade 3 & 4 (50% and 6% respectively). A clear correlation with increasing ASA and discharge time was demonstrated (ANOVA p = 0.0004) with significant exponential rise with ASA greater than 2. POSSUM scoring demonstrated a positive correlation with prolonged hospital stay with increasing scores having worse discharge time. Conclusion:?? In the presence of complex major surgery and tertiary centre referrals an ERP is feasible producing an average saving of 3.36?days. The benefit is however less with increasing ASA and POSSUM Scores. It however still produced an average economic bed stay saving cost of $3700 per patient stay.

AB  - Background:?? Colonoscopy is the gold standard for investigating pathology of the large bowel. Numerous factors influence the efficacy of bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel preparation can lead to missed pathology. Timing of preparation, timing of procedure and patient bowel habit may have an influence on the quality of the preparation. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of cleansing of sodium picosulphate with different administration schedules and to evaluate whether patient's prior bowel patterns influenced quality of cleansing. Methods:?? 325 patients were interviewed prior to colonoscopy to evaluate prior bowel habit and timing of preparation administration. The quality of preparation was then assessed during colonoscopy. Further patient factors evaluated included patient tolerance, compliance and adverse reactions to preparation. Procedural factors evaluated included quality of cleansing and circular muscle hypertrophy. Procedure total time, caecal intubation time and withdrawal times were also recorded. A 5-point scale was used to assess quality of cleansing. Results:?? The quality of cleansing for individual bowel segments was worse for afternoon procedures (p < 0.05 for all segments), and for patients with prior constipation (p < 0.05 for transverse and descending segments). No correlation was found between the quality indicators (total duration, caecal intubation time, withdrawal times), colon length, circular muscle hypertrophy or presence of diverticula for cleansing quality. Conclusion:?? The quality of cleansing is significantly improved when bowel preparation is taken the day prior to colonoscopy. In addition patients with prior constipation demonstrated poorer cleansing.

AB  - Purpose:?? Burnout is the state of prolonged physical, emotional, and psychological exhaustion characteristic of individuals working in human service occupations. This study examines the prevalence of burnout among Younger Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), and its relationship to demographic variables. Methodology:?? In March 2008, a survey was sent via email to 1,287 Younger Fellows. This included demographic questions, a measure of burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and an estimate of social desirability (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale ? Form C). Results:?? The sample comprised 278 participants ? an overall response rate of 21.6%. Females exhibited higher levels of personal burnout and work-related burnout, but no significant difference in patient-related burnout. Younger Fellows in hospitals with less than 50 beds reported significantly higher patient-related burnout levels. An equal work division between public and private practice resulted in higher work-related burnout than concentration of work in one sector. Younger Fellows working more than 60?hours per week reported significantly higher personal burnout than those who worked less than this. There was no significant correlation between age, country of practice, surgical specialty and any of the burnout subscales. Conclusion:?? Female surgeons, surgeons that work in smaller hospitals, those that work more than 60?hours per week, and those with practice division between the private and public sectors, are at a particularly high risk of burnout. Further enquiry into potentially remediable causes for the increased burnout in these groups is indicated.

AB  - Purpose:?? Early identification of the disease severity in acute pancreatitis and focused management based on Ranson's criteria has shown to improved patients? outcomes in many trials. We introduced Ranson's criteria at Ipswich Hospital in 2007 and compared the patients? outcome using historical controls. Methodology:?? A retrospective chart analysis was undertaken on patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at Ipswich Hospital between 2006 and 2007. Ranson's criteria and treatment protocols were introduced in January 2007 and data was collected prospectively. Data was assessed for the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, transfers to tertiary centres, morbidity and mortality. Results:?? 33 patients were admitted with acute pancreatitis in 2006 compared to 76 patients in 2007. Ranson's criteria were not formally assessed in any patient prior to 2007. However, 88% of patients had Ranson's criteria scored with strict adherence to the treatment protocol since 2007. 13 patients were scored as severe (greater than 3) in 2007 compared to none in 2006. 6% of patients developed pneumonia compared to 14% in 2007. Length of stay was 5.5?days in 2007 versus 4.87?days in 2006. Five ICU admissions and 4 transfers to tertiary centres occurred in 2007 compared to one transfer with no ICU admissions in 2006. There was no mortality in 2006 compared to 2% in 2007. Conclusion:?? Use of Ranson's criteria enables us to tailor our treatment of acute pancreatitis. It is a clinically useful tool and strict adherence leads to quick severity stratification, improved management and better use of health care resources.

AB  - Purpose:?? Providing enteral supplements containing ?immunonutrition? has been proposed to decrease postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay for elective surgical patients. This meta-analysis was undertaken to elucidate the potential benefit of providing immune-enhanced nutrition in surgical patients. Methodology:?? A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing the use of perioperative immunonutrition with standard nutrition provision in elective adult surgical patients between 1990 and 2008. The variables analysed included mortality, total complications, infective complications, anastomotic leak and length of hospital stay. Results:?? 21 distinct studies were identified that met inclusion criteria involving 2135 patients (immunonutrition n = 1100; standard nutrition n = 935). The provision of immunonutrition was shown to be associated with significant reductions in the incidence of total postoperative complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69, p < 0.0001), postoperative infective complications (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37, 0.60, p < 0.0001), anastomotic breakdown (OR 0.43, 95% 0.25, 0.75, p = 0.003), and the duration of hospital stay (WMD ?2.95, 95% CI ?4.01, ?1.88, p < 0.0001) when compared to standard nutritional provision. No differences were seen between interventions with relation to mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41, 1.97. p = 0.8). Conclusion:?? Provision of immunonutrition in preference to standard nutrition was associated with clinically significant decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in the development of postoperative complications including those of infective origin and anastomotic breakdown but has no impact on mortality.

AB  - Background:?? Presacral lesions often present late because of non-specific presenting symptoms and imaging findings that are difficult to interpret. We present the clinical scenario and review of the literature. Methods:?? A plexiform neurofibroma presenting as a presacral mass is described, with the difficulties in diagnosis and investigation explored. Results:?? CT and MRI are useful imaging modalities in the diagnosis of an undifferentiated presacral mass and certainly contribute to eliminating some differential diagnoses and exploring characteristics of the lesion, but ultimately the need for a histological diagnosis and surgical excision is highlighted. Conclusion:?? Presacral masses are difficult to diagnose, assess and treat. Adequate imaging and histological confirmation are essential in their treatment.

AB  - Introduction:?? Lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (LGIH) is a major health burden. Although for the majority no intervention is required, where conservative management fails, radiological intervention is required to either localise or embolise the bleeding vessels. In recent years CT angiography (CTA) has increasingly been used for localisation. This study assesses the utilisation of this investigation in patients with acute LGIH. Methods:?? A review of all patients admitted to the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle with acute LGIH was performed and patients undergoing CTA selected. The utility and safety of CTA was assessed as well as a comparison made between positive and negative tests. Results:?? Between January 2005 and August 2008 there were 334 emergency admissions with LGIH of which 79 patients underwent CTA. In 30 (38%) patients, CTA localised an active bleeding site. Of the remaining 49 CTA, other pathology was identified in 8 (10%). Overall mortality was 5% and intervention rate was 9% (4 segmental colectomy and 3 selective angiography). There was no difference in rate of intervention or mortality between the CTA positive and negative groups. Transfusion requirement (4.28 vs. 2.34 units, p < 0.05) and haemodynamic instability at the time of CTA were higher in the positive CTA group. Conclusion:?? LGIH will resolve without intervention in the majority. CTA is safe and a positive test is not indicative of a higher intervention rate but provides a management strategy. We suggest it be performed on patients receiving more than 2 units of packed cells or those with haemodynamic instability.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.
