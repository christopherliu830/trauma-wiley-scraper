AB  - Purpose:?? Lesions of the submandibular gland represent a pleomorphically diverse group making benign and malignant lesions difficult to differentiate from each other. The current series aims to identify the roles of pre-operative cytology and imaging with subsequent histopathology in the management of these lesions. Methods:?? Between 1998 and 2008 fifty-four patients, of median age 54?years (range 25?94), were retrospectively identified. Fifty patients underwent fifty-two surgical procedures involving the submandibular gland. The utility of imaging and cytology was analysed, and the accuracy of cytology correlated with histopathology. Results:?? Pathologies of resected specimens included: sialadenitis; 17 (32%), pleomorphic adenoma; 9 (17%), calculi; 8 (15%), lymphoma; 5 (10%) squamous cell carcinoma; 2 (4%), adenoid cystic carcinoma; 1 (2%) and other; 10 (20%). Twenty-eight patients (52%) underwent fine needle aspiration cytology/core biopsies; of these 25 proceeded to surgery. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of fine needle aspiration cytology correlation with histology were 88.0%, 71.4%, and 94.4% respectively. Overall, the complication rate was 9.6%. Conclusion:?? This series demonstrates histological outcomes in patients specific to the submandibular salivary gland for which there are few comparative series in the literature. The trans-cervical surgical approach to submandibular gland pathology is a safe and effective method with minimal morbidity. Combining investigative modalities and cytology optimises the diagnosis and management of submandibular salivary gland lesions.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery Programs (EPR) have been shown to reduce mortality, morbidity and length of stay. Can similar results be produced in tertiary centres with the presence of complex colorectal cases? Method:?? 102 patients were prospectively analysed with a power calculation of 34 being established prior to commencement of the study. The average age was 66.6 (male: female ratio of 1:1). Data collection included demographics, operative procedure, pain scores, POSSUM scores, American Society of Anaesthiology (ASA) scores, and discharge times. All complications were documented. Results:?? 83 cases were open procedures and 19 laparoscopically, (3 were converted intra-operatively). The majority were anterior resection (47, [46.1%]) and right hemicolectomies (32, [31.3%]). The average overall discharge time was 11.75?days compared to 15.11 (p < 0.001) prior to commencement of the study in 2005. Anterior resections and subtotal colectomies (14.3 and 13.7?days respectively) had significantly longer lengths of stay compared to right hemicolectomies (10.7?days) [p < 0.001]. 56% patients were ASA grade 3 & 4 (50% and 6% respectively). A clear correlation with increasing ASA and discharge time was demonstrated (ANOVA p = 0.0004) with significant exponential rise with ASA greater than 2. POSSUM scoring demonstrated a positive correlation with prolonged hospital stay with increasing scores having worse discharge time. Conclusion:?? In the presence of complex major surgery and tertiary centre referrals an ERP is feasible producing an average saving of 3.36?days. The benefit is however less with increasing ASA and POSSUM Scores. It however still produced an average economic bed stay saving cost of $3700 per patient stay.

AB  - Background:?? Colonoscopy is the gold standard for investigating pathology of the large bowel. Numerous factors influence the efficacy of bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel preparation can lead to missed pathology. Timing of preparation, timing of procedure and patient bowel habit may have an influence on the quality of the preparation. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of cleansing of sodium picosulphate with different administration schedules and to evaluate whether patient's prior bowel patterns influenced quality of cleansing. Methods:?? 325 patients were interviewed prior to colonoscopy to evaluate prior bowel habit and timing of preparation administration. The quality of preparation was then assessed during colonoscopy. Further patient factors evaluated included patient tolerance, compliance and adverse reactions to preparation. Procedural factors evaluated included quality of cleansing and circular muscle hypertrophy. Procedure total time, caecal intubation time and withdrawal times were also recorded. A 5-point scale was used to assess quality of cleansing. Results:?? The quality of cleansing for individual bowel segments was worse for afternoon procedures (p < 0.05 for all segments), and for patients with prior constipation (p < 0.05 for transverse and descending segments). No correlation was found between the quality indicators (total duration, caecal intubation time, withdrawal times), colon length, circular muscle hypertrophy or presence of diverticula for cleansing quality. Conclusion:?? The quality of cleansing is significantly improved when bowel preparation is taken the day prior to colonoscopy. In addition patients with prior constipation demonstrated poorer cleansing.

AB  - Purpose:?? Burnout is the state of prolonged physical, emotional, and psychological exhaustion characteristic of individuals working in human service occupations. This study examines the prevalence of burnout among Younger Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), and its relationship to demographic variables. Methodology:?? In March 2008, a survey was sent via email to 1,287 Younger Fellows. This included demographic questions, a measure of burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and an estimate of social desirability (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale ? Form C). Results:?? The sample comprised 278 participants ? an overall response rate of 21.6%. Females exhibited higher levels of personal burnout and work-related burnout, but no significant difference in patient-related burnout. Younger Fellows in hospitals with less than 50 beds reported significantly higher patient-related burnout levels. An equal work division between public and private practice resulted in higher work-related burnout than concentration of work in one sector. Younger Fellows working more than 60?hours per week reported significantly higher personal burnout than those who worked less than this. There was no significant correlation between age, country of practice, surgical specialty and any of the burnout subscales. Conclusion:?? Female surgeons, surgeons that work in smaller hospitals, those that work more than 60?hours per week, and those with practice division between the private and public sectors, are at a particularly high risk of burnout. Further enquiry into potentially remediable causes for the increased burnout in these groups is indicated.

AB  - Purpose:?? Early identification of the disease severity in acute pancreatitis and focused management based on Ranson's criteria has shown to improved patients? outcomes in many trials. We introduced Ranson's criteria at Ipswich Hospital in 2007 and compared the patients? outcome using historical controls. Methodology:?? A retrospective chart analysis was undertaken on patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at Ipswich Hospital between 2006 and 2007. Ranson's criteria and treatment protocols were introduced in January 2007 and data was collected prospectively. Data was assessed for the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, transfers to tertiary centres, morbidity and mortality. Results:?? 33 patients were admitted with acute pancreatitis in 2006 compared to 76 patients in 2007. Ranson's criteria were not formally assessed in any patient prior to 2007. However, 88% of patients had Ranson's criteria scored with strict adherence to the treatment protocol since 2007. 13 patients were scored as severe (greater than 3) in 2007 compared to none in 2006. 6% of patients developed pneumonia compared to 14% in 2007. Length of stay was 5.5?days in 2007 versus 4.87?days in 2006. Five ICU admissions and 4 transfers to tertiary centres occurred in 2007 compared to one transfer with no ICU admissions in 2006. There was no mortality in 2006 compared to 2% in 2007. Conclusion:?? Use of Ranson's criteria enables us to tailor our treatment of acute pancreatitis. It is a clinically useful tool and strict adherence leads to quick severity stratification, improved management and better use of health care resources.

AB  - Purpose:?? Providing enteral supplements containing ?immunonutrition? has been proposed to decrease postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay for elective surgical patients. This meta-analysis was undertaken to elucidate the potential benefit of providing immune-enhanced nutrition in surgical patients. Methodology:?? A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing the use of perioperative immunonutrition with standard nutrition provision in elective adult surgical patients between 1990 and 2008. The variables analysed included mortality, total complications, infective complications, anastomotic leak and length of hospital stay. Results:?? 21 distinct studies were identified that met inclusion criteria involving 2135 patients (immunonutrition n = 1100; standard nutrition n = 935). The provision of immunonutrition was shown to be associated with significant reductions in the incidence of total postoperative complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69, p < 0.0001), postoperative infective complications (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37, 0.60, p < 0.0001), anastomotic breakdown (OR 0.43, 95% 0.25, 0.75, p = 0.003), and the duration of hospital stay (WMD ?2.95, 95% CI ?4.01, ?1.88, p < 0.0001) when compared to standard nutritional provision. No differences were seen between interventions with relation to mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41, 1.97. p = 0.8). Conclusion:?? Provision of immunonutrition in preference to standard nutrition was associated with clinically significant decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in the development of postoperative complications including those of infective origin and anastomotic breakdown but has no impact on mortality.

AB  - Background:?? Presacral lesions often present late because of non-specific presenting symptoms and imaging findings that are difficult to interpret. We present the clinical scenario and review of the literature. Methods:?? A plexiform neurofibroma presenting as a presacral mass is described, with the difficulties in diagnosis and investigation explored. Results:?? CT and MRI are useful imaging modalities in the diagnosis of an undifferentiated presacral mass and certainly contribute to eliminating some differential diagnoses and exploring characteristics of the lesion, but ultimately the need for a histological diagnosis and surgical excision is highlighted. Conclusion:?? Presacral masses are difficult to diagnose, assess and treat. Adequate imaging and histological confirmation are essential in their treatment.

AB  - Introduction:?? Lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (LGIH) is a major health burden. Although for the majority no intervention is required, where conservative management fails, radiological intervention is required to either localise or embolise the bleeding vessels. In recent years CT angiography (CTA) has increasingly been used for localisation. This study assesses the utilisation of this investigation in patients with acute LGIH. Methods:?? A review of all patients admitted to the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle with acute LGIH was performed and patients undergoing CTA selected. The utility and safety of CTA was assessed as well as a comparison made between positive and negative tests. Results:?? Between January 2005 and August 2008 there were 334 emergency admissions with LGIH of which 79 patients underwent CTA. In 30 (38%) patients, CTA localised an active bleeding site. Of the remaining 49 CTA, other pathology was identified in 8 (10%). Overall mortality was 5% and intervention rate was 9% (4 segmental colectomy and 3 selective angiography). There was no difference in rate of intervention or mortality between the CTA positive and negative groups. Transfusion requirement (4.28 vs. 2.34 units, p < 0.05) and haemodynamic instability at the time of CTA were higher in the positive CTA group. Conclusion:?? LGIH will resolve without intervention in the majority. CTA is safe and a positive test is not indicative of a higher intervention rate but provides a management strategy. We suggest it be performed on patients receiving more than 2 units of packed cells or those with haemodynamic instability.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Purpose:?? A sentinel case of missed rectal malignancy resulting in a poor outcome for a patient prompted a search for a process that ensures adequate follow up of all significant histopathology results. This paper aims to quantify the problem of inadequate histopathology follow up and develop an electronic tool and review process to ensure the patient's results are acted upon appropriately. Methodology:?? A Histopathology audit was undertaken at the Geelong Hospital between 2002 and 2006. Patients where inadequate follow up had occurred were identified. The situation for these patients was rectified and the risk quantified. An integrated electronic tool was then developed including a minimum data set. A review process was then tested to ensure adequacy of future follow up. Results:?? 6.3% (120/1912) of histopathology results in a 5?year period had been inadequately followed up. No further adverse outcomes were identified but each case was a potential time bomb for the patients who were not scheduled for clinical review (3.8%) or a recommended procedure (2.5%). A process of follow up has now been implemented and a minimum data set, procedure and electronic audit tool developed to assist with this process. Conclusion:?? Failure of adequate follow up of histopathology is a potential pitfall in any large health system. One such failure led to a disastrous outcome and a comprehensive audit suggested 6.3% of patients in the last 5?years were also at risk. We have established a review process we believe is reliable and developed an electronic tool to facilitate this process.

AB  - Objective:?? To determine whether serum antioxidant capacity measured by the electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) could resolve differences in severity of the inflammatory disease acute pancreatitis. Methods:?? Experimental animal study using male Wistar rats. Group 1 (baseline), immediate euthanasia with no surgical interventions; Group 2 (sham), identical surgical procedures to the pancreatitis groups but no intraductal infusion; Groups 3?5, acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 3%, 4% or 5% sodium taurocholate respectively. Terminal blood and pancreatic tissue samples for CV, biochemistry and histology were collected at 12?h (Groups 2?5). Results:?? There was a significant positive correlation of the first serum cyclic voltametric peak current maxima (CVi1) with pancreatic histological severity (Spearman r = 0.51, p = 0.007) as well as with a number of other markers of systemic disease severity, notably bicarbonate (r =?0.57, p = 0.002), base excess (r =?0.65, p < 0.001) urea (r =?0.68, p < 0.001) and calcium (r =?0.60, p = 0.008). CVi1 was superior at indicating the severity of the disease state compared to a standard method of total antioxidant capacity measurement. Conclusions:?? CV was found to be a simple, technique that could differentiate between the physiological and histological severities of acute pancreatitis. Further clinical studies are now justified to determine if point-of-care CV offers prognostic and treatment-monitoring advantages for severe acute inflammatory illnesses within the critical care setting.

This review examines the use of UHS in inguinal hernia repair and relation with postoperative groin pain. Methods:?? A retrospective audit of consecutive cases over one year (telephone and mailed questionnaires) was conducted. The recently validated IPQ (inguinal pain score) was used. A review of files and operative reports was also undertaken. Cases undergoing bilateral repair, or other operations simultaneously were excluded. Results:?? 59 patients (61%) participated in the audit, with a mean follow up of 11?months (range 5?16). 4 minor wound complications occurred. Higher pain scores appeared to correlate preoperatively with age and workers compensation status. Postoperative pain scores and limitation to functional status were low, and trended towards lower values in the UHS (ultrapro hernia system) repair group compared to the group who underwent repair with PHS (preceding week pain scores respectively ?UHS repair, mean 1.22, (95%CI 1.07?1.38); PHS 1.76, (95%CI 1.11?2.43)). The average time until pain disappeared in the groin was within one month (IPQ score of 1.27). For those patients still experiencing any pain, (14 of 59; 23.7%) it occurred on average, once per week for minutes to hours and was at a level that could be ignored. Conclusion:?? Inguinal hernia repair with UHS appears to be a safe procedure with minimal complications and a favourable postoperative chronic pain profile.
