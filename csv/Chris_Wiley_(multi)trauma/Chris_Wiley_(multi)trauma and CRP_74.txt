AB  - Introduction:?? Lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (LGIH) is a major health burden. Although for the majority no intervention is required, where conservative management fails, radiological intervention is required to either localise or embolise the bleeding vessels. In recent years CT angiography (CTA) has increasingly been used for localisation. This study assesses the utilisation of this investigation in patients with acute LGIH. Methods:?? A review of all patients admitted to the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle with acute LGIH was performed and patients undergoing CTA selected. The utility and safety of CTA was assessed as well as a comparison made between positive and negative tests. Results:?? Between January 2005 and August 2008 there were 334 emergency admissions with LGIH of which 79 patients underwent CTA. In 30 (38%) patients, CTA localised an active bleeding site. Of the remaining 49 CTA, other pathology was identified in 8 (10%). Overall mortality was 5% and intervention rate was 9% (4 segmental colectomy and 3 selective angiography). There was no difference in rate of intervention or mortality between the CTA positive and negative groups. Transfusion requirement (4.28 vs. 2.34 units, p < 0.05) and haemodynamic instability at the time of CTA were higher in the positive CTA group. Conclusion:?? LGIH will resolve without intervention in the majority. CTA is safe and a positive test is not indicative of a higher intervention rate but provides a management strategy. We suggest it be performed on patients receiving more than 2 units of packed cells or those with haemodynamic instability.

AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy has become the procedure of choice for acute appendicitis at our hospital. It provides ideal training in a variety of laparoscopic techniques. It is both safe for patients and good for the community by improving the skills of surgical trainees. Methods:?? We reviewed the prospective audit of one junior registrar's first 150 consecutive cases of laparoscopic appendicectomy, after supervision for the first five cases. Results:?? 150 patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy over a period of 27?months. Ages ranged from 14 to 72 with a mean of 28. A standard 3 port technique was used, utilizing mostly suture loops, or occasionally linear staplers to tackle the appendix base. Of 124 patients with confirmed appendicitis, 44 (35%) had perforated, possibly reflecting delay in access to operating theatre in a busy public hospital. Despite this, only two post operative abscesses occurred, and both resolved after percutaneous drains. Hospital stay ranged from 2?7?days (Mean 2, Median 3.5?days). Senior surgical assistance was required in only two patients, once for laparoscopic repair of a serosal tear, and once for conversion for an inflammatory mass subsequently shown to be a carcinoma. Analysis of the cohort in three groups of fifty: early, mid, and late in the series demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both operative time and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy is the ideal training operation. After some initial supervision the trainees can perform surgery unsupervised and gain experience in a wide variety of surgical techniques. Clinical acumen and operative times improve with experience.

AB  - Purpose:?? Mechanical Bowel Preparation (MBP) is often used by surgeons for patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colectomy (LC) due to the concern that small lesions normally palpable at open surgery may not be seen at the time of laparoscopic surgery. This study sought to determine whether preoperative marking of the colonic primary at the time of colonoscopy with Spot? could overcome this concern. Methodology:?? All patients suitable for a LC had Spot? marking performed at their colonoscopy. One millilitre of Spot? marking was injected submucosally in 3 positions around the circumference of the lumen at least 5?cm distal to the lesion. The first 100 LC performed by the surgeon for lesions were audited for the purpose of this study, and MBP was not used while all patients received preoperative immunonutrition. Results:?? Overall mortality was 0%. The anastomotic leak rate was 2% (1 reoperation, 1 low output fistula). Conversion rate was 23%. Spot? marking was successfully identified at laparoscopy in all 100 cases. No cases were converted as a result of failure to identify the marking, however 1 case required an extension in the final incision due to the fact the Spot? marking had been placed proximal to the lesion. Anastomoses were performed ?across? the Spot? marking on 3 occasions with no untoward effect. Conclusion:?? Spot? marking is a safe and effective way to mark lesions in the colon in order to facilitate LC without the need for MBP.

AB  - There is increasing use of CT in intestinal obstruction to delineate those patients requiring expeditious surgical intervention from those in whom conservative management is appropriate. We sought to assess the accuracy of CT in predicting those patients for whom conservative management would suffice. A mixed prospective-retrospective series had 75 patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a CT performed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if there was an immediate indication for surgery eg peritoneal irritation or shock. A positive diagnosis was defined as suitability for conservative management based on CT absence of an obstructing lesion and/or progression of contrast. A negative diagnosis was defined as a high-grade obstruction, signs of strangulation or a lesion requiring operation eg volvulus or tumour. Sixty-two cases (82.7%) had a history of abdominal surgery. Forty-one (54.7%) underwent operative intervention during their index admission. Diagnostic accuracy measures for CT in predicting successful conservative management were: sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 77.5%, positive predictive value 78% and negative predictive value 91.2%. In those with prior abdominal surgery, these results were 96.7%, 71.9%, 76.3% and 95.8% respectively. CT is highly effective in detecting bowel obstruction cases that do not require operation and also in predicting those cases that actually do. These measures are slightly improved when selecting patients with previous abdominal surgery. CT scanning may therefore be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm for acute bowel obstruction. Future studies may benefit from more standardised assessment criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - Purpose:?? ACPO often occurs in patients with serious comorbidities and can result in high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the current practice of treatment of pseudo obstruction in the era of neostigmine in a single metropolitan hospital. Method:?? A retrospective review of prospective hospital databases was undertaken to identify patients with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction and gather demographic information. Further information was retrieved from patient files. Results:?? 133 patients were identified with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction from June 1996 to December 2008. The median age was 68.5 (range 17?95). There were 80 (60%) males. Overall median length of stay was 37?days with a mortality rate of 9%. For conservative treatment or neostigmine (CN), endoscopic decompression (E), surgery (S) groups, the mortality rates were 9.5%, 8.6% and 6.2% respectively, p = 0.36. There were 94 patients in the CN group, 16 (12%) required surgery (S) and 23 (17%) had endoscopy (E), p = 0.36. The median time to diagnosis from admission was 10?days (CN), 0?days (E) and 7?days (S); p = 0.13. The most frequent mode of diagnosis was gastrograffin enema for CN (43), AXR for E (9) and CT abdomen for S (7). It was noted that 44 (33%) patients had unrelated surgery within the last 30?days prior to the current admission. Surgery for complications was required including 7 colectomies (44%) and 5 caecostomies (31%). Conclusion:?? Surgery remains crucial as a treatment modality for pseudo-obstruction in the era of neostigmine. The majority of operations performed at our institution for pseudo-obstruction were colectomies, which reflects a high rate of complications in our cohort of patients.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.

AB  - Rationale Many recent studies suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system play a protective role in the impairment of vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cell. Aims The study aims to determine whether tissue kallikrein is efficacy for preventing the long-term in-stent restenosis after stenting of symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery M1 segment. Design This is a Phase II, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. In line with SAMMPRIS stenting indications, patients (n?=?90) with the symptomatic the middle cerebral artery M1 segment stenosis ≥70% and successfully treated with stent will be enrolled. Eligible patients will be randomized using computer generated numbers, and allocated to receive tissue kallikrein treatment or not. Patients in tissue kallikrein treatment group will be prescribed with intravenous infusion of tissue kallikrein (0·15 PNAU/d, dissolved in 100?ml saline) for 7 days after stenting and then oral administration of pancreatic kallikrein enteric-coated tablet (240?U, 3/d) to the end of study. As the foundation treatment, all the enrolled patients will receive aspirin (100?mg/d), clopidogrel (75?mg/d), and atorvastatin (20?mg/d) for the first 6 months and continue with the combination of aspirin and atorvastatin at the previous dosage. Study outcomes Patients will be evaluated at 1, 6 and 12 months after stenting. The primary outcomes are the in-stent restenosis rate, new stroke or aggravation of the previous ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the severe stenotic artery. Secondary outcomes include stroke of other artery territories, myocardial infarction and vascular death. Modification of stroke knowledge, exercise and diet habit, smoking cessation and available laboratory data will also be recorded. Conclusion As our pilot study, tissue kallikrein would be expected to prevent the long-term in-stent restenosis after stenting of the symptomatic middle cerebral artery dramatically.

AB  - Abstract Aim Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, poor function and predisposing to cancer recurrence. Earlier diagnosis and intervention can minimize systemic complications but is hindered by current diagnostic methods that are non-specific and often uninformative. The purpose of this paper is to review current developments in the field and to identify strategies for early detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage. Method A systematic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included ?anastomosis? and ?leak? and ?diagnosis? or ?detection? and ?gastrointestinal? or ?colorectal?. Papers concentrating on the diagnosis of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak were identified and further searches were performed by cross-referencing. Results Computerized tomography CT scanning and water-soluble contrast studies are the current preferred techniques for diagnosing anastomotic leakage but suffer from variable sensitivity and specificity, have logistical constraints and may delay timely intervention. Intra-operative endoscopy and imaging may offer certain advantages, but the ability to predict anastomotic leakage is unproven. Newer techniques involve measurement of biomarkers for anastomotic leakage and have the potential advantage of providing cheap real-time monitoring for postoperative complications. Conclusion Current diagnostic tests often fail to diagnose anastomotic leak at an early stage that enables timely intervention and minimizes serious morbidity and mortality. Emerging technologies, based on detection of local biomarkers, have achieved proof of concept status but require further evaluation to determine whether they translate into improved patient outcomes. Further research is needed to address this important, yet relatively unrecognized, area of unmet clinical need.

AB  - Background:?? The aim is to compare the outcomes of surgical management of large bowel emergencies. The traditional treatment of Hartmann's resection was compared to the new modalities of Colonic stenting for malignant obstruction and laparoscopic washout for perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. Methods:?? This paper is a retrospective review of 112 consecutive large bowel emergencies presenting to The Tweed Hospital and John Flynn Private Hospital warranting surgical intervention during the 8?year period 2000?2008. Patients with obstruction from cancer and perforation from diverticulitis were included. Patients with volvulus, pseudo-obstruction, bleeding, stercoral ulceration and prolapse were excluded. Patients with non urgent colonic stenting were also excluded. Results:?? The patient groups were comparable for age, ASA and pathology after exclusions. 57 patients underwent a Hartmann's (obstruction 23, perforation 34) vs. 55 patients undergoing stent for obstruction 21, or washout for perforation 34. Significant differences were observed in the mortality rates, Hartmann's 11/57 (19%) vs. stent and washout 2/55 (37%). Also length of stay: Hartmann's 15?days vs. stent and washout 6?days. Hartmann's was required to salvage 2 failed stents and 6 failed washouts. In 16 of 26 washouts and 11 of 17 stents patients underwent delayed elective resection. Conclusion:?? Patient selection, technical expertise and long learning curve were all aspects that influenced the early results of stenting and washout. Hartmann's is no longer the preferred treatment option for left sided colonic emergencies.

AB  - Purpose:?? To investigate intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, in both rat intestinal ischaemia reperfusion injury, and in human necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Methodology:?? Plasma was collected from anaesthetized rats that underwent intestinal ischaemia reperfusion (IIR) injury and from control rats undergoing sham laparotomy. In a separate study, plasma and urine was collected from infants with NEC, and from control infants with non-abdominal diagnoses. iFABP was measured in urine and plasma using a commercially available ELISA. SMA was detected in plasma using a western blot technique. Results are median [IQR] and compared by Mann-Whitney test unless otherwise stated. Results:?? Animal model: Plasma iFABP was significantly higher in the IRI group compared with control group (IRI 32.4 [29.2] ng/ml vs. control 3.8 [3.3] ng/ml; p < 0.01). SMA became detectable in IRI plasma during reperfusion (p < 0.01 compared with pre-ischaemia, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test), but never in the control group. Human NEC Study:?? Urinary iFABP was significantly higher in the NEC group (2.1 [3.9] pg/nmol) compared to controls (1.1 [0.7] pg/nmol, p, < 0.05). Furthermore plasma and urinary iFABP correlated with extent of intestinal damage at laparotomy, and decreased with NEC resolution. SMA was detectable in the plasma of infants with multifocal or panintestinal NEC, but in neither focal nor non-operative disease. Conclusion:?? FABP and SMA are markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, and may offer clinically relevant information in the diagnosis and management of severe intestinal disease.

AB  - Introduction:?? The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for patients presenting with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) suggest patients should undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal tract examination in addition to coeliac serology. Studies suggest that in approximately 20% of patients no diagnosis is made. In these patients subsequent management and risk of underlying malignancy remains unclear. In our unit all patients initially negative following investigation undergo an abdominal CT scan. Aim To determine 1) cancer detection and overall disease detection rates for patients referred with IDA on the cancer pathway 2) Subsequent outcomes of patients with no diagnosis made after initial investigations. Methods:?? Patients referred between Jan 2002 ? Jan 2005 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to 1) diagnosis following initial investigations 2) addition diagnosis following abdominal CT 3) Eventual outcome 3?years following presentations. Results:?? 111 patients were reviewed. Following initial investigation 12 colorectal and 2 gastric cancers were identified. 63% of patients had a diagnosis following initial investigations. Three patients were diagnosed with underlying malignancy following abdominal CT. 38 patients had no diagnosis, non reattended over a 3?year period with significant pathology. Conclusion:?? BSG guideline investigations with addition abdominal CT is sufficient to detect disease in patients with IDA.
