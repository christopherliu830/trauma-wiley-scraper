AB  - Abstract Aim Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, poor function and predisposing to cancer recurrence. Earlier diagnosis and intervention can minimize systemic complications but is hindered by current diagnostic methods that are non-specific and often uninformative. The purpose of this paper is to review current developments in the field and to identify strategies for early detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage. Method A systematic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included ?anastomosis? and ?leak? and ?diagnosis? or ?detection? and ?gastrointestinal? or ?colorectal?. Papers concentrating on the diagnosis of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak were identified and further searches were performed by cross-referencing. Results Computerized tomography CT scanning and water-soluble contrast studies are the current preferred techniques for diagnosing anastomotic leakage but suffer from variable sensitivity and specificity, have logistical constraints and may delay timely intervention. Intra-operative endoscopy and imaging may offer certain advantages, but the ability to predict anastomotic leakage is unproven. Newer techniques involve measurement of biomarkers for anastomotic leakage and have the potential advantage of providing cheap real-time monitoring for postoperative complications. Conclusion Current diagnostic tests often fail to diagnose anastomotic leak at an early stage that enables timely intervention and minimizes serious morbidity and mortality. Emerging technologies, based on detection of local biomarkers, have achieved proof of concept status but require further evaluation to determine whether they translate into improved patient outcomes. Further research is needed to address this important, yet relatively unrecognized, area of unmet clinical need.

AB  - The article presents studies performed before, during and after a marathon run (42 195 m) in a 32-year-old man who underwent a bilateral lung transplantation because of end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) 15 months prior to the race. Before the run his FEV1 was 81% predicted, compared with 19% predicted before the operation, and his maximal oxygen uptake was 31.9 ml/kg?1/min?1. He completed the New York City Marathon 1998 without major problems in 7 h 8 min 50s. Pulmonary tests, biochemical changes and endocrine responses indicated transient changes, mostly as expected in healthy marathon runners. The case demonstrates that physiological trainability and psychological will power following a successful bilateral lung transplantation can transform a chronically ill CF patient into a robust marathon runner.

AB  - Introduction:?? Surgical teaching for clinical medical students is often undertaken across multiple clinical campuses. There are concerns heterogeneity of clinical experience may result in heterogeneity of learning outcome achievements. To avoid this, we have utilised standardised learning materials and tutorials across four hospital campuses. Methods:?? Using a feedback questionnaire, clinical experience from assigned hospitals was collected, including a question on influence of clinical experience on future career choice. This was analysed for inter-hospital differences. Clinical experience was also assessed by analysis of individual student portfolios. Students were administered a centralised standardised formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) during rotations. We analysed OSCE results from 2005 to 2008 for internal reliability and correlation with final written examination grades on a hospital-by-hospital basis. Results:?? Analysis of student feedback results and portfolios identified inter-hospital differences in clinical experience. Students indicated that clinical experiences had influence on decision to pursue future surgical careers. The OSCE had a good level of internal reliability (Cronbach's-alpha 0.62?0.75). No significant inter-hospital difference in OSCE results was found using one-way analysis of variance. OSCE results had strong correlations with final examination grades. Conclusions:?? Heterogeneity of clinical experience across different teaching settings does not translate into heterogeneity in achievement of learning outcomes when teaching materials are standardised. Consistent with previous published data, undergraduate clinical experience may influence future career choices.

AB  - Purpose:?? Stoma formation is a standard procedure in gastrointestinal surgery; however, the incidence seems to remain high. Here, we performed a prospective study on 137 patients with ileostomy or colostomy in order to identify potential risk factors. Methodology:?? 137 patients received stomas and were prospectively followed up four times after surgery. Early and late stoma complications, potential risk factors, and QOL were recorded using a modified SF-36 form. Results were subjected to statistical analysis and discussed with the view onto the current literature. Results:?? 72 patients received a colostomy and 65 patients an ileostomy. There was a complication rate of 55.5% (n = 76). 53 patients had early, 44 patients had late, and some had both early and late complications. Early complications occurred less than two months after surgery and included necrosis (16.1%), abscess (13.9%), and dehiscence (10.9%). Late complications included parastomal hernia (11.7%), chronic peristomal skin alteration (8.8%), stenosis (6.6%), prolaps (3.6%), and retraction 0.7%). 15 patients with late stoma complications needed surgery. High body mass index, emergency procedure, and omitted preoperative stoma marking were associated with significant higher risks for developing stoma complications. The availability of a stoma nurse greatly influenced outcome and QOL. Conclusion:?? Stoma complications are not rare and the surgeon should pay special attention to details of the technique. QOL of stoma patients is greatly influenced by specially trained stoma nurses. The identified risk factors have to be considered in order to reduce the incidence of stoma complications in the future.

AB  - Abstract Recent advancements in bioanalytical techniques have led to the development of novel and robust diagnostic approaches that hold promise for providing optimal patient treatment, guiding prevention programs and widening the scope of personalized medicine. However, these advanced diagnostic techniques are still complex, expensive and limited to centralized healthcare facilities or research laboratories. This significantly hinders the use of evidence-based diagnostics for resource-limited settings and the primary care, thus creating a gap between healthcare providers and patients, leaving these populations without access to precision and quality medicine. Smartphone-based imaging and sensing platforms are emerging as promising alternatives for bridging this gap and decentralizing diagnostic tests offering practical features such as portability, cost-effectiveness and connectivity. Moreover, towards simplifying and automating bioanalytical techniques, biosensors and lab-on-a-chip technologies have become essential to interface and integrate these assays, bringing together the high precision and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques with the connectivity and computational power of smartphones. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of clinical smartphone diagnostics and its contributing technologies, as well as their wide range of areas of application, which span from haematology to digital pathology and rapid infectious disease diagnostics.

AB  - Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin - the prohormone of calcitonin - has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections and for improving decisions about antibiotic therapy. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with acute respiratory infections and different settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs). Objectives The aim of this systematic review based on individual patient data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2011, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011) to identify suitable trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care/guidelines. Trials were excluded if they exclusively focused on paediatric patients or if they used procalcitonin for another purpose than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment. Data collection and analysis Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days. For the primary care setting, treatment failure was defined as death, hospitalisation, ARI-specific complications, recurrent or worsening infection, and patients reporting any symptoms of an ongoing respiratory infection at follow-up. For the ED setting, treatment failure was defined as death, ICU admission, re-hospitalisation after index hospital discharge, ARI-associated complications, and recurrent or worsening infection within 30 days of follow-up. For the ICU setting, treatment failure was defined as death within 30 days of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of antibiotics and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount of antibiotic days divided by total number of patients)), length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients, length of ICU stay for critically ill patients, and number of days with restricted activities within 14 days after randomisation for primary care patients. For the two co-primary endpoints of all-cause mortality and treatment failure, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. The hierarchical regression model was adjusted for age and clinical diagnosis as fixed-effect. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We fitted corresponding linear regression models for antibiotic use. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and ARI diagnosis to assess the consistency of our results. Main results We included 14 trials with 4221 participants. There were 118 deaths in 2085 patients (5.7%) assigned to procalcitonin groups compared to 134 deaths in 2126 control patients (6.3%) (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23). Treatment failure occurred in 398 procalcitonin group patients (19.1%) and in 466 control patients (21.9%). Procalcitonin guidance was not associated with increased mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting, or ARI diagnosis. These results proved robust in various sensitivity analyses. Total antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced overall (median (interquartile range) from 8 (5 to 12) to 4 (0 to 8) days; adjusted difference in days, -3.47, 95% CI -3.78 to -3.17, and across all the different clinical settings and diagnoses. Authors' conclusions Use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure. Antibiotic consumption was significantly reduced across different clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. Further high-quality research is needed to confirm the safety of this approach for non-European countries and patients in intensive care. Moreover, future studies should also establish cost-effectiveness by considering country-specific costs of procalcitonin measurement and potential savings in consumption of antibiotics and other healthcare resources, as well as secondary cost savings due to lower risk of side effects and reduced antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin testing to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections Unnecessary antibiotic use significantly contributes to increasing bacterial resistance, medical costs and the risk of drug-related adverse events. The blood marker procalcitonin increases in bacterial infections and decreases when patients recover from the infection. Hence, procalcitonin may be used to support clinical decision making for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients with a clinical suspicion of infection. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that such a strategy works, particularly in patients with an infection of the respiratory tract. However, most of these individual studies did not include enough patients to allow for a conclusive assessment about safety (low statistical power). Thus, the risk for mortality and severe complications associated with procalcitonin-guided decision making remained unclear. This systematic review included individual patient data from 14 randomised controlled trials with a total of 4211 participants. When looking at these combined data, we found no increased risk for all-cause mortality or treatment failure when procalcitonin was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in participants with acute respiratory infections compared to control participants. However, we found a consistent reduction of antibiotic use, mainly due to lower prescription rates in primary care and lower duration of antibiotic courses in emergency department and intensive care unit patients. This analysis is limited to adult patients with respiratory infections excluding patients who were immuno-compromised (i.e. HIV positive, those receiving immuno-suppressive therapies or chemotherapy). Most trials were conducted in Europe and China and similar studies in other countries including the United States are warranted.
