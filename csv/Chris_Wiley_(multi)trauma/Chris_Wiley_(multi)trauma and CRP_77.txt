Bertram 1 , Gary Mathern 2 , Helen Cross 3 and Maria Thom 4 ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom and 4 Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom ) Summary: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been synonymous with hippocampal sclerosis, such that the consensus is that the removal of the latter cures the former. There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.

AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - PURPOSE: A prospective cohort study was conducted to test our ability to identify chronically ill patients at near term risk of death by asking their primary care physician (PCP) the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of CHF or COPD?' METHODS: Patients were eligible for inclusion if 1) their clinic chart problem list carried a diagnosis of CHF or COPD, 2) they had been hospitalized within the past two years with primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF or COPD, or 3) direct identification by their PCP. Chart review was used to exclude patients erroneously carrying these diagnoses (e.g. coding errors), inactive patients (deceased or changed providers) and those patients with normal ejection fractions or not requiring scheduled ?-2 agonist and anticholinergic bronchodialator therapy. Patients were then stratified on the basis of their PCP's response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD?' All patients screened and stratified by the question were followed for the primary endpoint of death. RESULTS: The initial data query identified 190 patients with CHF and/or COPD. A chart review excluded eight inactive patients and thirty-one patients who did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria for significant disease. Of the remaining 151 patients, there were 72 whose PCP answered that he/she would not be surprised if the patient died from CHF and/or COPD in the next year. Within nine months, nine of these patients have died from complications of their CHF or COPD. There have been no deaths in the 79 patients whose PCP answered that they would be surprised if their patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD. (p-value < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF and/or COPD at risk of near term death can be differentiated from those who are not at high risk by the PCPs'response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of their CHF and/or COPD?' Such screening may be useful to more efficiently target palliative services and end of life care planning to patients with advanced CHF and/or COPD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Physical activity (PA) has been shown to prevent many conditions and treat many others. While it is an effective treatment for peripheral vascular disease (PVD), no studies have analyzed the effect of PA in preventing PVD. METHODS: Men and women in the Framingham Heart Study have been examined biannually since 1948 for the presence of PVD and other cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as well as for CVD risk factors (smoking, Metropolitan weight, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy). PA was assessed in 1956?58 using the previously validated Framingham Physical Activity Index. Subjects were ranked based on weighted PA levels, then grouped into quartiles. We examined the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up, adjusting for baseline levels of CVD risk factors and for the presence of other CVD. We included the 1745 men and 2220 women free of PVD and CVD at baseline who answered the physical activity questions and survived to at least the first follow-up. RESULTS: Among those free of other CVD, the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up was 4.3% and 5.3% in men and 2.3% and 4.5% in women. Including those who developed other CVD first, the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up was 6.6% and 11.1% in men and 3.9% and 7.9% in women. For both men and women, there was no difference in the incidence of PVD between the least active quartile and any of the three more active quartiles. This lack of a difference held up in both the analyses adjusted only for age and in those adjusted for CVD risk factors. There was also no difference whether or not patients with other CVD were included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that while PA may be an effective treatment for PVD, it does not appear to prevent PVD.
