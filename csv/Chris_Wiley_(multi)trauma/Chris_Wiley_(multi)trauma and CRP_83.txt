AB  - Abstract The reduction of the incidence, detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage (AL) continues to challenge the colorectal surgical community. AL is not consistently defined and reported in clinical studies, its occurrence is variably reported and its impact on longterm morbidity and health-care resources has received relatively little attention. Controversy continues regarding the best strategies to reduce the risk. Diagnostic tests lack sensitivity and specificity, resulting in delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity. Intra-operative fluorescence angiography has recently been introduced as a means of real-time assessment of anastomotic perfusion and preliminary evidence suggests that it may reduce the rate of AL. In addition, concepts are emerging about the role of the rectal mucosal microbiome in AL and the possible role of new prophylactic therapies. In January 2016 a meeting of expert colorectal surgeons and pathologists was held in London, UK, to identify the ongoing controversies surrounding AL in colorectal surgery. The outcome of the meeting is presented in the form of research challenges that need to be addressed.

AB  - Abstract Key content Most ovarian cysts in children and adolescents are benign. Incidence of large ovarian cysts usually peaks in the first year of life and around menarche; approximately 30% of girls will present with pain. Gynaecologists, paediatric surgeons and general surgeons may manage ovarian cysts. There is a lack of standardised protocols and guidance, so most girls are managed based upon an individual clinician?s judgement, preference and experience. Wherever possible, the operation of choice for benign cysts is laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy with ovarian preservation. This review provides an evidence-based tool for the management of ovarian cysts in children and adolescent girls. Learning objectives To identify ovarian pathology using appropriate imaging in emergency and elective situations. To know that, where possible, a multidisciplinary approach between gynaecologists, radiologists and paediatric surgeons is optimal. To be vigilant for malignant tumours and perform ovarian-sparing surgery for suspected benign conditions. Ethical issues There are long-term reproductive consequences of inadvertently removing one or both ovaries. Unnecessary surgery has an effect on patients? physical and mental wellbeing.

AB  - Abstract Although intra-dialytic hypertension (IDH) has been noted in clinical settings for many years, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed IDH incidence in our center and the correlation between postdialysis volume state and IDH. One hundred thirty-one maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were enrolled in our study, and bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and echocardiography (ECG) were recorded. In addition, demographic data were collected, and laboratory examinations were conducted. The patients were grouped into four groups according to the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between predialysis and postdialysis. The incidence of IDH was 10.7%. The proportion of extracellular water to total body weight (ECW/TW), as evaluated by BIA, was significantly higher in the IDH group than in the other three groups both in pre-and post-dialysis. In particular, postdialysis SBP was highest in the highest tertile interval of ECW/TW. In addition, among the four groups, left ventricular volume (LVV) was highest in the IDH group. Binary logistic analyses revealed that predialysis SBP, postdialysis ECW/TW and LVV were independent risk factors of intradialytic hypertension. When predicting IDH, the AUC of the ROC curve was higher for ECW/TW combined with LVV (0.752, 95% CI 0.613?0.896) than for either LVV or ECW/TW alone. Our study further showed that post-dialysis volume expansion is an important factor for the development of IDH.
