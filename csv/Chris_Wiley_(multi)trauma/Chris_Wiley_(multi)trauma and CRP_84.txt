J Clin Periodontol 2010; 37: 928?936. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01606.x. Abstract Purpose: Implant prosthodontic treatment outcomes for patients suffering from autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with or without concomitant connective tissue diseases (CTD) were evaluated. Material and Methods: Thirty-four female patients' (25 isolated RA; nine RA+CTD) implant survival/success rate, peri-implant conditions (marginal bone loss, pocket depth, plaque index, gingiva index and bleeding index) and incidence of prosthodontic maintenance were retrospectively evaluated. Results: Implants evaluated presented a high implant survival (100%) and a 3.5-year success (93.8%) rate during the follow-up programme (mean 47.6 month) without difference between isolated RA (94.6%) and RA and concomitant CTD (92.3%), respectively. In isolated RA, acceptable marginal bone resorption (mean: 2.1?mm; SD: 0.5?mm), pocket depth (mean: 2.8?mm; SD:3.2?mm) and healthy soft-tissue conditions (plaque/bleeding/gingiva index Grade 0 in 80%) were noticed. However, patients with RA+CTD presented increased bone resorption (mean: 3.1?mm; SD: 0.7?mm) and more vulnerable soft-tissue conditions (higher bleeding index) differing significantly to patients with isolated RA (p<0.01). Peri-implant parameters were significantly influenced by the patients' underlying disease (RA, RA+CTD; Kruskal?Wallis test, Jonckheere?Terpstra test). Conclusions: In contrast to isolated RA, in RA patients with concomitant CTD, differences in the peri-implant parameters such as pronounced marginal bone resorption and bleeding may be anticipated and appear to be significantly influenced by the patients' underlying disease.

AB  - Brachial plexus anesthesia with verapamil and/or morphine. (Baystate Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine, Springfield, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:379?383. This study examined the analgesic effects of administering morphine, verapamil, or its combination into the brachial plexus sheath with lidocaine in 75 patients undergoing upper extremity orthopedic surgery. All patients received brachial plexus anesthesia with 40 mL of 1.5% lidocaine and epinephrine 5 ?g/mL. Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 groups: Group 1 received IV saline; Group 2 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg; Group 3 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; Group 4 received IV morphine 5 mg and verapamil 2.5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; and Group 5 received verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution. Postoperatively, patients rated their pain (0?10) at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. Patients were instructed to take 1 acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone 5 mg tablet every 3 h whenever the pain score exceeded 3. Analgesic duration was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with morphine (Groups 3 and 5) (P < 0.005). The total 24 h acetaminophen/oxycodone was also less in Groups 3 and 5 (P < 0.03). Duration of anesthesia (time of abolition of pinprick response) was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with verapamil (Groups 4 and 5) (P = 0.002). Conclude that the addition of verapamil to the brachial plexus block with lidocaine can prolong the duration of sensory anesthesia, but it had no effect on analgesic duration of 24-h analgesic use. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. It is well established that calcium channel blockers potentiate analgesic effects of both local anesthetics and opioids. A desire for improvement of the quality and duration of brachial plexus blockade has led many investigators to study various agents in addition to standard local anesthetics. This interesting double-blinded study involving 82 patients scheduled for elective upper extremity orthopedic surgery involved 5 groups. Interestingly, the combination of verapamil and morphine via the brachial plexus did not provide any additional analgesic effect, which is different than previous studies. The subjectivity of telephone data and the relatively small sample size in each arm of this study make statistically significant findings harder to ascertain and relevant changes in clinical practice less convincing. Further, the authors do not appropriately note the complexity of calcium channel pharmacology and its overall role in opioid as well as local anesthetic modulation. Future studies with more precise endpoints for efficacy and duration are warranted if clinical practice is to be altered and accepted by the practitioner.

AB  - Tip-holed spinal needle: a new design concept. (Sir Salimullah Medical College and Mitford Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:403?407. This article discussed new technology regarding the production of finer spinal needles and described a new spinal needle tip design. Complications associated with dura-arachnoid puncture for spinal anesthesia were taken into account. Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) and needle bending are stated as being significant complications. Although pencil-point needles significantly reduce PDPH, it is stated that these needles also have their limitations such as obstruction of the delivery port by tissues affecting both cerebrospinal fluid flash back and drug delivery. The problem of tip bending was also addressed. At the center of the discussion was the newly designed spinal needle tip that was created to overcome the disadvantages of other spinal needles. Analyzing the performance of the existing needles, the conclusion was drawn that the criteria of an ideal spinal needle may be as follows: (1) the external diameter of the needle should be as thin as possible and the tip should be a dural fiber-spreading variety; (2) the shaft and tip should be capable of withstanding forces during needle placement; and (3) it should also have a drug delivery hole that does not weaken the needle or become obstructed by tissue. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This article introduces a new type of needle for performing spinal anesthesia techniques. According to the authors, classic Quincke-type needles are associated with postdural puncture headache (PDPH), while side port blunt needles may be associated with mechanical problems such as back flow or having tissue obstruct side port. Therefore, the authors designed a new type of needle that is pencil point in shape, but the removal stylet is the component that forms the pencil point. When the stylet is removed, the needle has a conical distal shape with the opening at the end. The authors believe that this ?new spreading beveled needle tip? will help alleviate problems with PDPH as well as the problems associated with side port holes. While the idea is very intriguing, it remains to be seen how successful the needle will be.

AB  - Preventing postoperative pain by local anesthetic instillation after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery: a placebo-controlled comparison of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. (Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Paris, France) Anesth Analg 2000;91:403?407. This study tested the hypothesis that local anesthetics instilled at the end of laparoscopic gynecologic procedures are able to prevent postoperative pain at wake-up and during the first 24 h. A total of 180 patients were randomly assigned into three groups to receive an intraperitoneal instillation of 20 mL of either bupivacaine 0.5% (Group B), ropivacaine 0.75% (Group R) or saline (Group S) at the end of surgery. All patients received analgesia with acetaminophen and ketoprofen IV infusions. Pain was assessed by using a 0-10 graded numerical scale (NS) every 5 min in the postanesthesia care unit and IV morphine was administered if NS was> 4. Assessment of pain continued every 4 h on the ward, and subcutaneous morphine was injected if needed to keep the NS score <4. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was rated on a 4-point scale. The morphine consumption at wake-up and over the first 24 h was significantly lower (P<0.05) in Group B (mean, 0.92 mg at wake-up; 3.08 mg over 24 h) and in Group R (mean, 0.25 mg at wake-up; 0.69 mg over 24 h), than in Group S (mean, 4.18 mg at wake up; 12.93 mg over 24 h). The morphine-sparing effect of ropivacaine was significantly greater than that of bupivacaine. Both local anesthetics were effective in the prevention of PONV. Conclude that local anesthetics should be instilled in all gynecologic patients at the end of all laparoscopic procedures.

AB  - Small-dose clonidine prolongs postoperative analgesia after sciatic-femoral nerve block with 0.75% ropivacaine for foot surgery. (University of Milan, Milan, Italy) Anesth Analg 2000;91:388?392. This study evaluated the effects of adding small-dose clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine during peripheral nerve blocks, 30 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing hallux valgus repair under combined sciatic-femoral nerve block were randomly allocated in a double-blinded fashion to receive block placement with 30 mL of either 0.75% ropivacaine alone (Group Ropivacaine, n = 15) or 0.75% ropivacaine plus ?g/kg clonidine (Group Ropivacaine-Clonidine, n = 15). Hemodynamic variables, oxygen saturation, and levels of sedation, as well as the time required to achieve surgical block and time to first analgesic request, were recorded by a blinded observer. Time to surgical blockade required 10 min in both groups. Patients in the Ropivacaine-Clonidine Group were more sedated than patients in the Ropivacaine Group only 10 min after block placement. No differences in oxygen saturation and hemodynamic variables, degree of pain measurement at first analgesic request, and consumption of postoperative analgesics were observed between the two groups. The mean time from block placement to first request for pain medication was shorter in Group Ropivacaine (13.7 h; 25th?75th percentiles: 11.8?14.5 h) than in Group Ropivacaine-Clonidine (16.8; 25th?75th percentiles: 13.5?17.8 h) (P = 0.038). Conclude that adding 1 ?g/kg clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine provided a 3-h delay in first request for pain medication after hallus valgus repair, with no clinically relevant side effects.

AB  - Analgesic mechanisms of ketamine in the presence and absence of peripheral. (Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan) Anesthesiology 2000;93:520?528. In this study, the authors investigated the contribution of the supraspinal monoaminergic descending inhibitory system to ketamine analgesia for acute nociception and inflammation-induced hyperalgesia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The paw withdrawal latencies to radiant heat stimuli were measured to assess the thermal nociceptive threshold. The analgesic effects of intrathecal or intraperitoneal ketamine were examined in the rats that received unilateral intraplantar carrageenan and in those that were untreated. In addition, it was examined whether pretreatment with intrathecal yohimbine or methysergide inhibited the analgesic effects of ketamine. Using an intrathecal microdialysis method, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid were measured after intraperitoneal ketamine in both saline- and carrageenan-treated rats. In the untreated rats, intraperitoneal but not intrathecal ketamine produced antinociceptive effects in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with intrathecal yohimbine or methysergide inhibited these antinociceptive effects. Intraplantar carrageenan significantly reduced paw withdrawal latencies on the injected paw, but not on the contralateral paw. Both intraperitoneal and intrathecal ketamine reversed the shortened paw withdrawal latencies on the injected side in a dose-dependent manner without any effects on the contralateral side. Neither yohimbine nor methysergide inhibited these antihyperalgesic effects. In analyses of monoamines, the magnitiute of increase in monoamines after intraperitoneal ketamine was significantly smaller in the carrageenan-treated rats than in the saline-treated rats. Conclude that these results demonstrated that ketamine produced antinociceptive effects through an activation of the monoaminergic descending inhibitory system, whereas, in a unilateral peripheral inflammation-induced hyperalgesic state, the monoaminergic system did not contribute to the antihyperalgesic effects of ketamine. The mechanisms of the antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic properties of ketamine are different.

AB  - Epidural infusion of ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia after major orthopedic surgery. (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands) Anesthesiology 2000;93:395?403. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine administered by 72-h epidural infusion to provide postoperative analgesia. Twenty-eight patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery during combined epidural and general anesthesia received a bolus dose of ropivacaine (50 or 70 mg), followed by constant-rate (10 mL/h) epidural infusion of ropivacaine 2 mg/mL (Group 1) or 3 mg/mL (Group 2). Total and unbound plasma concentrations of ropivacaine and pipecoloxylidide and plasma concentrations of α1-acid glycoprotein were determined. The urinary excretion of ropivacaine and major metabolites was measured. Results showed that total plasma concentrations of ropivacaine increased steadily during infusion and unbound ropivacaine concentrations reached average steady levels of approximately 0.06 and 0.07 mg/l. Total and unbound concentrations of pipecoloxylidide increased to 1.0 ± 0.4 and 0.4 ± 0.2 mg/l (Group 1) and 1.2 ± 0.4 and 0.5 ± 0.1 mg/l (Group 2) after 72 h infusion. α1-Acid glycoprotein concentrations initially decreased, but thereafter increased steadily to approximately twice the baseline values. Conclude postoperative increases in plasma α1-acid glycoprotein concentrations enhance the protein binding of ropivacaine and pipecoloxylidide, which causes divergence of total and unbound plasma concentrations.

AB  - Recurrent rejection of a spinal cord stimulation system. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) Contact Dermatitis 2000;42:304?305. This case report involved a 52-year old male reflex sympathetic dystrophy patient. This brief report describes a patient who responded to spinal cord stimulation positively, but who could not continue to undergo this treatment because of inflammatory-type reactions of unknown pathophysiology. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a case report communication describing a patient who responded to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) positively, but who could not continue to undergo this modality because of inflammatory-type reactions of unknown pathophysiology. Once signs and symptoms of infection with negative bacteriological cultures had occurred for 2 consecutive times, the authors suspected contact hypersensitivity to materials of the SCS system to be the cause of rejection. Although a very rare condition, allergic reactions to cardiac pacemakers have previously been reported. In this case, a striking feature was the lack of any visible skin reaction such as rash, erythema, local swelling, or pruritus.

AB  - Applying the American Pain Society's QA standards to evaluate the quality of pain management among surgical, oncology, and hospice inpatients in Taiwan. (Taipei Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan) Pain 2000;87:43?49. The purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to apply the American Pain Society (APS) outcome questionnaire to examine and compare the quality of pain management provided in surgical, oncology, and hospice inpatient units in the Taipei area of Taiwan, and second, to provide baseline data of pain management quality in advance of the implementation of national guidelines for cancer pain management. Data revealed that hospice patients reported that they received pain medication within 15 min after they complained of pain. However, a large number of patients never asked for pain medication during hospitalization. Moreover, most patients never requested medication changes even when their perception was that their medication was not effective. The findings of this study may provide support for the effectiveness of hospices in Taiwan in pain management and provide information on the validity of the APS quality standards.

AB  - Gabapentin enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in healthy volunteers. (Dr. Margarete Fischer Bosch Institut fuer Klinische Pharmakologie, Stuttgart, Germany) Anesth Analg 2000;91:185?191. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study investigated the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction of Gabapentin (GBP) and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Morphine (60 mg, controlled release) or placebo was administered at 8:00 a.m., and GBP (600 mg) or placebo was administered at 10:00 a.m., thus comparing the analgesic effect of placebo + GBP (600 mg) with placebo + placebo and morphine (60 mg) + GBP in comparison to morphine plus placebo by using the cold pressor test. The duration and intensity of the side effects were assessed by using visual analog scales. The analgesic effect was evaluated by the change in the area under the curve of pain tolerance. Placebo + GBP did not present any significant analgesic effect compared with placebo + placebo. A siginificant increase in pain tolerance was observed comparing the combination of morphine and GBP with morphine and placebo. The observed adverse events after placebo + GBP were not significantly different compared with placebo + placebo. Morphine + placebo led to the expected opioid-mediated side effects. They were significantly more pronounced compared with placebo + placebo, but did not differ significantly compared with the combination of morphine + GBP. Concerning the pharmacokinetic variables of morphine and its glucuronides, no significant difference between morphine + placebo and morphine + GBP was observed, whereas the area under the curve of GBP significantly increased, and apparent oral clearance and apparent renal clearance of GBP decreased when morphine was administered concomitantly. These results suggest 2 different sites for the pharmacokinetic interaction?1 at the level of absoption and the other at the level of elimination. The study reveals both a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between morphine and GBP, leading to an increased analgesic effect of morphine + GBP. These results and the good tolerability of GBP should favor clinical trials investigating the clinical relevance of the combination of morphine and GBP for treating severe pain.

AB  - Pure trigeminal motor neuropathy: a case report. (Korea University Medical Center, Guro-gu, Korea) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:995?998. A 38-year-old man complaining of progressive weakness and wasting of the right masticatory muscles after a bout of mild cold symptoms is presented in this case report. No sensory symptoms were present. History, neurologic examination, electrophysiologic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain led to the diagnosis of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The cause may have been an autoimmune reaction to a viral infection. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article is a case report of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. Trigeminal motor neuropathy is defined as a trigeminal motor paralysis accompanied by no trigeminal sensory signs or other cranial nerve involvement. The author described the history of the patient and their work up including examination, laboratory tests, and electro diagnostic examinations, which all pointed to the pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The strength of this case report is the detailed description of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve and the muscular innervations of the mandubular branch. The authors attributed the motor neuropathy to a possible post viral infection autoimmune response that predominantly affected the motor division of the trigeminal nerve. They have stressed that all other potential causes of motor neuropathy should be ruled out including malignancy in mass lesions.

AB  - Paraspinal electromyography in high lumbar and thoracic lesions. (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2000;79:336?342. This study aimed to use needle electromyography in the paraspinal muscles to localize the root level of a radiculopathy. Nine cases of clinically proven, isolated high lumbar or thoracic disk herniations of patients who underwent MiniPM were collected. Four were from a prospective study of 114 persons with low back pain (MiniPM had 100% sensitivity to magnetic resonance imaging-documented high disks). In the most medial ?S? column, mean MiniPM scores were 0.7 for the level above the radiologically documented lesion (3.1 at the lesion and 1.6, 1.6, and 1.1 at the 3 spinous processes below the lesion). Similar numbers were obtained in the ?M? column (slightly lateral), with no significant differences between S and M. Differences were significant between and at the level of the lesion for S (P < 0.06) and M (P < 0.01), and between the lesion level and 3 levels below for the M column (P < 0.01). Conclude that paraspinal electromyography has a higher than previously reported sensitivity for high lumbar lesions. Electromyography using MiniPM can localize some radiculopathies. The individual cases suggest that, consistent with the anatomy of the caudi equina, thoracic lesions and lateral lumbar lesions denervate only at 1 level, but more central lumbar lesions also denervate distally innervated paraspinal muscles. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This study is designed to assess the sensitivity of many MiniPM for higher-level rediculopathies, ie, lower thoracic and high lumbar, and to determine if findings are specific to the root level involved. The MiniPM is thought to assess the multifidus portion of the paraspinal muscles that are innervated from L2 to the sacrum. The clinical protocol tests the paraspinal extensively and provides a numerica score, thus eliminating some subjectivity of the EMG. The study demonstrates that MiniPM has good sensitivity for high lumbar and thoracic lesions and provides information on the level of the lesion independent of limb EMG. After reviewing the study, I agree with the authors that MiniPM is in itself not diagnostic for radiculopathy, but is only an additional test to help support other neuro physiological studies when evaluating for radiculopathy. It is not specific for diagnosing radiculopathy.

AB  - Aerobic fitness testing in patients with chronic low back pain?Which is the best test? (New England Medical Center, Boston, MA) Spine 2000;25:1704?1710. In this study, 30 participants with chronic low back pain performed three symptom-limited maximal exercise tests: a treadmill, an upper extremity ergometer, and a bicycle ergometer. The tests were administered in randomized order. Heart rate was continuously monitored and oxygen consumption in terms of mL/kg/minute was measured by indirect calorimetry each 30 seconds. The statistical difference among the tests was highly significant (P < 0.0001). The treadmill test yielded the highest peak and predicted oxygen consumption followed by the bicycle and the upper extremity ergometer test, respectively. Conclude that the treadmill test is the best test for measuring aerobic fitness levels in patients with chronic low back pain. It yielded the highest peak oxygen consumption compared with the other tests, coming closest to measuring maximal oxygen consumption. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. Aerobic conditioning has been a component of several treatment approaches in the reduction of back pain disability. The specific contribution of aerobic fitness achieved through these approaches is not always known. Chronic pain patients tend to be inactive. As a result of this inactivity muscles become inefficient at using oxygen and this results in a loss of muscle endurance and cardiac output. The purpose of this study was, 1) to determine which testing protocol yields the highest peak values of VO2, heart rates, and respiratory changes ratio in a sample of patients with CLBP; 2) to determine whether the VO2 measures between the tests are significantly different from each other; 3) to determine which factors limit performance in each of these tests; and 4) to compare values of peak VO2 and predicted VO2 max with aerobic fitness values published for normal subjects. Chronic low back pain was defined as pain persisting for 3 months or more. Patients were excluded from this study if they were taking medications that influenced heart rate or blood pressure or if they had coexisting major medical disease, amputations of one or more extremities, or acute upper or lower extremity muscular skeletal pain that would interfere with exercise testing or acute psychiatric illness. Thirty participants with chronic low back pain performed 3 symptom limited maximal exercise tests: a treadmill, upper extremity ergometer, and a bicycle ergometer. These tests were randomly administered and heart rate was continuously monitored along with oxygen consumption. Of the 3 tests, the treadmill test is the most functional because of its uses in walking, a function of everyday life. This advantage to bicycle testing is that most Americans are unaccustomed to bicycle riding. Many of the patients reported increased burning in the thigh and buttocks for sitting on a hard saddle. Most clinics have access to a treadmill making this a practical test. The treadmill test is, thus, the best measure of cardiovascular performance; deconditioning of these patients expressed itself as early fatigue of peripheral muscles due to inactively, and limiting their performance on the bicycle and UBE test.
