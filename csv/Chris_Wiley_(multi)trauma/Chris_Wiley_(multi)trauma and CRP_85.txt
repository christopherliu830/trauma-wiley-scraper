AB  - Use of computed tomography for maxillary nerve block in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. (Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Mibu, Tochigi, Japan) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:417?419. A report of a 90-year-old woman who had a 30-year history of episodic pain in her right maxillary region is presented. An attempt to block the nerve with classic technique was made, but eliciting paresthesia could not identify the nerve. In addition, bleeding was noted after repeated attempts. To minimize complications and confirm the correct position of the needle tip, the block was planned with a suprazygomatic approach using computed tomography (CT) guidance. The needle was inserted without paresthesia. The CT scan showed the needle tip was placed at the entrance of the pterygopalatine fossa and the distribution of contrast medium spread appropriately around the pterygopalatine fossa. After confirming the clinical effect and lack of complications of the block using the local anesthetic, 0.5 mL of 7% phenol was injected. The technique resulted in complete sensory loss in the area innervated by the maxillary nerve and did so without complications. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article in which the authors describe their technique for treating trigeminal neuralgia. The authors were faced with a significant problem, which was to perform a maxillary nerve block in a patient with difficult anatomy. The approach and technique were clearly thought out with an excellent result. The axial cuts demonstrate needle position under CT scan and the appropriate spread of contrast material through the pterygopalatine fossa.

AB  - The addition of dilute epinephrine produces equieffectivenes of bupivacaine enantiomers for cutaneous analgesia in the rat. (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:410?416. This study investigated the effectiveness for cutaneous analgesia of bupivacaine (Bup) stereoisomers in male rats. As a model of infiltration anesthesia, inhibition of a nocifensive reflex by subcutaneous injection of 0.6mL of different concentrations of R-, S-, and racemic-Bup was evaluated quantitatively by the fraction of times a pinprick failed to evoke a nocifensive motor response. R-Bup was more potent in the extent of the block; however, S-Bup had a longer-lasting action at smaller doses. This significant difference was apparent when R-Bup and S-Bup were administered in equipotent doses of 0.06% and 0.075%, respectively. Co-injection of epinephrine (Epi) with these equipotent doses enhanced and prolonged the blocking effects of both Bup stereoisomers, although the dilutions of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 Epi itself induced partial, transient analgesia. At 1:2,000,000 dilution, Epi alone had no analgesic effect; however, when co-injected with the shorter-acting R-Bup (0.06%), Epi prolonged its blocking effect to equal the duration of the block evoked by equipotent S-Bup (0.075%). Conclude that R-Bup is more potent for cutaneous analgesia and that the longer duration of the block by S-Bup probably originates from vasoconstrictor activity.

AB  - Sympathetic-sensory coupling after L5 spinal nerve lesion in the rat and its relation to changes in dorsal root ganglion blood flow. (Christian-Albrechts-Universität, Kiel, Germany) Pain 2000;87:335?345. In rats 3-56 days after L5 spinal nerve lesion, the authors of this study tested the responses of axotomized afferent fibers recorded in the dorsal root of the lesioned segment to norepinephrine (NE, 0.5 ?g/kg) injected intravenously and to selective electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST). In some experiments, blood flow was measured in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by laser Doppler flowmetry. The majority of lesioned afferent fibers with spontaneous activity responded to neither LST stimulation (82.4%) nor NE (71.4%). In those that did react to LST stimulation, responses occurred only at high stimulation frequencies and they could be mimicked by nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor drugs (angiotensin II, vasopressin). Excitatory responses to LST stimulation were closely correlated with the stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG. Therefore, the activation of lesioned afferents might be brought about indirectly by an impaired blood supply to the DRG. To test this hypothesis, a strong and sustained baseline vasoconstriction in the DRG was induced by blocking endothelial nitric oxide synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) applied systemically. L-NAME enhanced baseline vascular resistance in the DRG about threefold and also increased stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions. After L-NAME, the majority of axotomized neurons with spontaneous activity were activated by LST stimulation (76%) or NE (75%). Again, activations closely followed stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG provided that a critical level of vasoconstriction was exceeded. Inhibitory responses to LST stimulation were generally rare and could be reversed to activation by prolonged stimulation or after L-NAME. These results show that sympathetic-sensory coupling occurs only in a minority of axotomized afferents after L5 spinal nerve injury. Like previous studies, they cast doubt on the notion that L5 spinal nerve lesion is a good model for sympathetically maintained pain. Since responses of lesioned afferent neurons to LST stimulation and NE could be provoked with high reliability after inducing vasoconstriction in the DRG, and since they mirrored stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions in the DRG, it appears that in this model the association of sympathetic activity with afferent discharge occurs mainly when perfusion of the DRG is impaired. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Animal research has revealed that massive ectopic afferent discharge is generated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following nerve injury. This source of ectopic firing is in addition to activity that may be generated at the nerve injury site (Tinel sign). The combined impulse barrage is almost certainly an important cause of neuropathic pain. It has been discovered recently that the intensity of the ectopic DRG barrage is modulated by sympathetic efferent activity. This is a potential link between sympathetic activity and symptomatology in sympathetic related pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy. But what is the mechanism of the sympathetic-sensory coupling? Considerable evidence indicates that axotomized DRG neurons become abnormally adrenosensitivity. Habler et al now point out an additional, indirect, coupling mechanism ? modulation of intrinsic DRG blood flow. That is, sympathetic activity may reduce DRG blood flow inducing partial ischemia, with the ischemia causing neural excitation. This finding may also have broader implications as spinal pathology can also compromise DRG blood flow. Might low back pain and sciatica, for example, derive from this same process? It is surprising that ectopic firing in the DRG has played so little part in clinical thinking and practice in patients with neuropathic pain. So far.

AB  - Perfusion of the mechanically compressed lumbar ganglion with lidocaine reduces mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in the rat. (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR) J Neurophysiol 2000;84:798?805. This study used an animal model of lumbar radiculopathy to investigate the neurological mechanisms of cutaneous hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. The rat L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was chronically compressed by inserting a hollow perforated rod into the intervertebral foramen. The DRG was constantly perfused through the hollow rod with either lidocaine or normal saline delivered by a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Behavioral evidence for neuropathic pain after DRG compression involved measuring the incidence of hindlimb withdrawals to both punctate indentations of the hind paw with mechanical probes exerting different bending forces and to light stroking of the hind paw with a cotton wisp. Behavioral results showed that for saline-treated control rats: the withdrawal thresholds for the ipsilateral and contralateral paws to mechanical stimuli decreased significantly after surgery and the incidence of foot withdrawal to light stroking significantly increased on both ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws. Local perfusion of the compressed DRG with 2% lidocaine for 7 days at a low flow-rate (1 ?l/h), or for 1 day at a high flow-rate (8 ?l/h) partially reduced the decrease in the withdrawal thresholds on the ipsilateral foot, but did not affect the contralateral foot. The incidence of foot withdrawal in response to light stroking with a cotton wisp decreased significantly on the ipsilateral foot and was completely abolished on the contralateral foot in the lidocaine treatment groups. Conclude that compression of the L5 DRG induced central pain syndrome that included bilateral mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Results also suggest that a lidocaine block, or a reduction in abnormal activity from the compressed ganglia to the spinal cord, could partially reduce mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Tonic compression of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in animal preparations, and presumably also in man, causes sensory cells to become electrically hyperexcitable. The resulting spontaneous discharge is a cause of ongoing paresthesias and pain. Many believe that in addition, this ectopic activity can trigger and maintain central sensitization in the spinal cord, resulting in tactile hypersensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in the body parts innervated by the ganglion. This second effect of ectopic DRG activity, however, is controversial. Zhang and collaborators now provide strong new support for this idea by showing that lidocaine infusion into the DRG, with consequent block of the ectopic DRG firing, considerably reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia for the duration of the infusion (weeks). Here is a novel therapeutic approach that deserves a try.

AB  - Effect of peripheral morphine in a human model of acute inflammatory pain. (Hvidovre University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark) BR J Anaesth 2000;85:228?232. This study used a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design in a human model of acute inflammatory pain (heat injury). Eighteen healthy volunteers were studied who each received morphine locally (2 mg), morphine systemically (2 mg), or placebo on three separate study days. The subjects received morphine infiltration subcutaneously (s.c.) 1 h before heat injury (47°C, 7 min) and naloxone infiltration s.c. (0.2 mg) 2.5 h after the heat injury. Hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli were examined using von Frey hairs and thermodes, and pain was rated using a visual analogue scale. The burns produced significant hyperalgesia, but local morphine infiltration neither reduced pain during the burn, nor primary or secondary hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli after the burn. Conclude peripherally applied morphine had no acute antinociceptive effects in this human model of acute inflammatory pain. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. This study is well controlled for placebo effect and the systemic effect of subcutanuously injected morphine. One of the few criticisms that can be made is the amount of narcotic injected. This may not be enough to bind to a sufficient number of receptors. One would expect some role for peripheral opioid receptors. The other comment would be that this type of injury (mainly small fiber involvement in this case) does not represent all types of nociception and, therefore, the peripheral action of morphine can not be excluded for different types of nociception. But overall this is a convincing study, consistent with the literature.

AB  - Prospects for the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia in herpes zoster patients. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S90?100. This review discussed the results of recent studies that have identified risk factors for the development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and have implicated several peripheral and central mechanisms in its pathophysiology. These risk factors and mechanisms of PHN provide a basis for hypothesizing that combining antiviral therapy with analgesic treatment beginning as soon as possible after the onset of herpes zoster would reduce the risk of PHN beyond that achieved by antiviral therapy alone. Conclude this treatment approach would be expected to reduce the risk of PHN in herpes zoster patients by attenuating acute pain and thereby preventing the initiation of central mechanisms of chronic pain.

AB  - Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: an update. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Drugs 2000;59:1113?1126. This article provided an update on recent developments in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also been demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated. Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred antidepressant for treatment of PHN. The topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as effective as tricycline antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments for patients with PHN.

AB  - A validated, practical classification procedure for many persistent low back pain patients. (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) Pain 2000;87:89?97. This article discussed the development of a simple procedure for assigning persistent low back pain (LBP) patients to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive, hierarchically organized classes. This procedure relies on the spatial distribution of a patient's pain and the results of straight leg raise tests to make the assignment. The procedure was applied to a large group of patients who sought treatment for persistent LBP at several university affiliated tertiary care clinics, and found that the resulting 4 classes of patients were significantly different from one another in their presentation, and in the way they were evaluated and treated by physicians. Conclude that the procedure may have practical research and clinical applications.

AB  - Simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness. (University of California, Sacramento, CA) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:938?943. This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects, and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. Measurement of 3 tasks was performed on a work simulation device on 2 different days separated by 1 week. Associations between work task performance and previously reported strength measures in 6 muscle groups by hand-held dynamometry (HHD) were examined. This study was conducted in the human performance laboratory of a university and consisted of a convenience sample of ambulatory outpatients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, type I (n = 9), myotonic muscular dystrophy (n = 10), and able-bodied controls (n = 11). Mean between-session differences for work simulation tasks ranged from ?11% to +4% for peak torque and from ?12% to +12% for total work; test sessions did not differ significantly for either patient or control groups. All groups had between-session intraclass correlation coefficients usually> 0.80, which indicated good consistency. In general, correlations between peak torque during work simulation and HHD were strongest in the control group. Conclude that persons with neuromuscular weakness reliably performed the simulated work tasks examined in this investigation. Work simulation tasks may be a useful tool to assess muscular performance in persons with neuromuscular weakness. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article addresses something that is very important when evaluating patient progress during rehabilitation. It is common in rehab to evaluate muscle groups and to determine a muscular performance by using isolated muscle group testing. The problem with this is that it doesn't necessarily correlate with tasks that patients perform on a day-to-day basis. The purpose of the study was to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. The work simulation tasks included knob-turning (alternating pronation and supination), linear motion (alternating push/pull motion), and lever arm (push-down motion). This study did accomplish its goals. The peak torque and total work measured in work simulation tasks did not differ significantly between test and retest sessions for either the patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness or the control groups. This study addresses an issue that other studies have not. Just because a patient shows improvement in strength measure by hand held dynamometry does not necessarily mean that he or she will be able to accomplish tasks that are performed at home. The main goal of rehabilitation is for patients to be able to perform activities of daily living around the house and at work. If this is not accomplished then their rehabilitation is for naught.

AB  - Epidural catheter tip cultures: results of a 4-year audit and implications for clinical practice. (Royal Adelaide Hospital and University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:360?367. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of routine microbiological culture of epidural catheter tips after use in acute pain management, and to identify patterns of culture result with respect to both indications for, and duration of, epidural catheterization. Over a 4-year period, when acute pain service (APS) protocol required epidural catheter tips to be sent for microbiological culture on removal, APS saw 1,810 patients who had received epidural analgesia. The records of the patients were reviewed. Culture results were available for 1,443 (79.7%) patients: 1,027 catheter tips (71.2%) were sterile, while 416 (28.8%) were positive for at least 1 type of microorganism. Clinically, no epidural space infections were identified. The highest positive culture rates were found from epidural catheters used in treatment of pain from fractured ribs or fractured pelves. The lowest incidences occurred in elective orthopedic and thoracic surgery. The proportion of epidural catheters with positive culture results steadily increased with the duration of catheterization, but there were no clinically significant differences for catheters left in situ for either 3 or 4 days. Conclude that a significant proportion of epidural catheter tips may be ?culture positive? after removal. It is suggested that this probably represents colonization of the skin at the catheter insertion site and subsequent contamination of the catheter tip on removal of the catheter. The large number of ?culture positive? tips in the absence of clinically identifiable epidural space infection suggests that routine culture of epidural catheter tips is clinically irrelevant in the vast majority of cases, and that it is not a good predictor of the presence of an epidural space infection. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. Clinically relevant epidural catheter-induced infection is quite rare with the largest study on this topic revealing 1/505,000 catheter placements. This retrospective study involved the insertion of 1810 epidural catheters. At the time of insertion, full aseptic precautions were employed. When the catheters were removed, they were cultured and it was revealed that 28.8% were positive for at least 1 organism. This prevalence is relatively consistent with other published studies. The most common organism found was coagulase negative staphylococcus. Interestingly, not one of these patients developed an epidural abscess. The authors speculate that the relatively common prevalence of organism positive cultures was related to poor sterile technique at the catheter insertion site at the time of placement and/or removal. The authors conclude that epidural catheter contamination in the vast majority of cases is clinically irrelevant. In as much as epidural abscess can have vital clinical implications, it behooves the practitioner to adhere to strict sterile techniques even though the likelihood of infection is extremely low. Certainly, this study reinforces the fact that routine culture of epidural catheter tips is not a good predicator of epidural space infection.

AB  - A deltoid motor response is a satisfactory endpoint for successful block. (Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:356?359. This study investigates the notion that a deltoid twitch may be just as effective as one in the biceps for predicting a successful motor block. Patients (N = 160) scheduled for shoulder surgery were studied prospectively. Interscalene blocks (ISBs) were performed using neurostimulation according to our standard technique. Twitches of the deltoid or biceps or both, whichever appeared first, were accepted and used as the endpoint for needle placement and injection of local anesthetic. Motor block success, i.e., patient inability to lift the arm against gravity, and minutes to motor block onset were recorded. Of the 160 ISBs performed, a biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients. In 54 patients, a deltoid twitch was elicited and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid contraction were elicited simultaneously. The failure rate did not differ widely among the groups; there was 1 failed motor block in the deltoid group and none in the other groups. There was no statistically significant difference in onset times between the 3 muscle twitch groups. Conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as a biceps twitch in determining accurate needle placement for ISB and in predicting successful motor block. Acceptance of a deltoid twitch during ISB eliminates the need for further probing and may translate into better patient acceptance and in a smaller risk of needle-induced nerve damage. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. Interscalene brachial plexus block provides a valuable technique for shoulder surgery. The literature is in agreement with elicitation of paresthesias versus peripheral nerve stimulation. The literature is somewhat unclear regarding deltoid muscle versus biceps twitch as a satisfactory endpoint, prior to injection of local anesthetic. This prospective study involved 160 patients presenting for elective shoulder surgery. A biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients; 54 had a deltoid twitch, and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid twitch were elicited. There was no statistically different onset time in the 3 groups; however, the failure rate did not differ in the 3 groups either (only 1 patient in the deltoid group had a failed block). The authors conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as one in the biceps at ensuring a successful interscalene brachial plexus block and that repositioning is not warranted if either muscle group is elicited. The authors should be applauded for this study because it strongly suggests that essentially any elicitation of deltoid or biceps twitch will result in a highly successful and clinically useful block.

AB  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. (Hospital Morvan, Brest, France) Ophthalmology 2000;107:1507?1511. This randomized, double-blinded study compared the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir in immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. One hundred ten immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus diagnosed within 72 h of skin eruption were treated; 56 were allocated to the valaciclovir group and 54 to the acyclovir group. Patients randomized to the valaciclovir group received 2 500-mg tablets of valaciclovir 3 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo twice daily. Patients in the acyclovir group received 1 800-mg tablet of acyclovir 5 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo 3 times daily for 7 days. Main outcome measures included the frequency, severity, and duration of ocular complications, patient records of zoster-associated pain, and the outcome of skin lesions. Tolerance was also assessed on the incidence and types of adverse effects and changes in laboratory parameters. The analysis was mainly descriptive and performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus were similar in the valaciclovir and acyclovir treatment groups. The main complications were conjunctivitis (54% and 52%, respectively), superficial keratitis (39% and 48%, respectively for punctate keratitis; 11 in each group for dendritic keratitis), stromal keratitis (13% in each group) and uveitis (13% and 17%, respectively). The long-term outcomes of these ocular complications were favorable and similar in both treatment groups. Pain duration, severity, and outcome of skin lesions were similar between groups. Most patients reported prodromal pain. After 1 month, 25% of the patients in the valaciclovir group and 31% in the acyclovir group still reported pain. The percentage of patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia decreased during follow-up. The tolerance to acyclovir and valaciclovir was comparable and considered good. The most frequent adverse events were vomiting and edema of the eyelids or face (3%?5%). Three serious adverse events not linked to the study drugs occurred. Valaciclovir is as effective as acyclovir in preventing ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, including conjunctivitis, superficial and stromal keratitis, and pain. Tolerability of the 2 drugs is similar, but the dosing schedule of valaciclovir is simpler. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study comparing the efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and its ophthalmologic complications and sequelae between valaciclovir and acyclovir. The initial review of the incidence and the associated ophthalmologic complications of untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus is concise and educational for physicians who do not interact with these kind of patients frequently. As pain physicians, it is part of our daily practice to deal with patient compliance to the medication treatment we prescribe. In this sense, this article provides comparison between 2 medications that are very similar in the efficacy profiles as well as their control of complications, but with acyclovir there is question of whether patients might be more compliant to the lower dosing frequency of valaciclovir. Results overall are similar between both drugs, but in terms of complications, although not statistically significant, the percentage is consistently lower with valaciclovir than acyclovir. The fact stated in this article regarding the bioavailability of valaciclovir being similar to that of intravenous acyclovir may account for this. The high incidence of irreversible ophthalmic complications such as anatomical loss of an eye (50%?70%) in untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus makes the question of patient compliance with treatment a crucial one. As physicians, we may not realize that for a patient there might be a significant difference between interrupting their daily life 3 times to take a medication instead of 5 times. In summation, this is a well-designed study with valid conclusions that would impact our practice of medicine.

AB  - Bruno Guignard, Anne Elisabeth Bossard, Carole Coste, et al:Intraoperative remifentanil increases postoperative pain and morphine requirement. (Hôpital Ambroise Paré, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) Anesthesiology 2000;93:409??417. The study tested the hypothesis that intraoperative remifentanil administration results in acute opioid tolerance that is manifested by increased postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Fifty adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to 2 anesthetic regimens: (1) the remifentanil group or (2) the desflurane group. All patients were given a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg morphine 40 min before the end of surgery. Morphine was initially titrated to need by postanesthesia care nurses blinded to group assignment. Subsequently, patients?who were blinded to group assignment?controlled their own morphine administration. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded for 24 postoperative h. The results indicated that the mean remifentanil infusion rate was 0.3 ± 0.2 ?g · kg?1· min?1 in the remifentanil group, which was significantly greater than in the desflurane group. Intraoperative hemodynamic responses were similar in each group. Postoperative pain scores were significantly greater in the remifentanil group. These patients required morphine significantly earlier than those in the desflurane group and needed nearly twice as much morphine in the first 24 postoperative h: 59 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 43?71) versus 32 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 19?59; P<0.01). Conclude that relatively large-dose intraoperative remifentanil increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption. These data suggest that remifentanil causes acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia.

AB  - Valaciclovir: a review of its use in the management of herpes zoster. (Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) Drugs 2000;59:1317?1340. This study compared the effectiveness of valaciclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily for 7 days) and aciclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was found to alleviate zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. A 14-day regimen of valaciclovir showed no significant advantage over the 7-day regimen. A smaller trial in Japanese patients focusing primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster confirmed the similar efficacy of valaciclovir and aciclovir in the 7-day regime. Valaciclovir and aciclovir demonstrated similar efficacy for the control of cutaneous lesions and ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Starting treatment later than 72 h after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of valaciclovir on the duration of zoster-associated pain, suggesting that valaciclovir might be effective when given later than previously thought. However, valaciclovir should ideally be given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. Valaciclovir was well tolerated with nausea and headache as being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of the agent was similar to that seen with aciclovir or famciclovir. Conclude that the efficacy of valaciclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster has been confirmed and extended by follow-up studies in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in Japanese patients, and in the wider primary care setting. Valaciclovir is at least equivalent to, and better in certain parameters than, aciclovir and appears to have similar efficacy to famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a review article on the antiviral drug valaciclovir. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is commonly treated with the antiviral drug aciclovir. However, aciclovir has a low oral bioavailability that limits its efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was developed in order to have a more readily absorbed oral antiviral drug. When valaciclovir was compared to aciclovir in a large study, it was noted that valaciclovir was as effective in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. It was also noted valaciclovir alleviated zoster associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. Also, there was no significant advantage of treating valaciclovir 14 days versus 7 days; therefore, a 7-day regimen is recommended. In a smaller trial from Japan that focused primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster, there was also confirmation of similar efficacy of aciclovir and valaciclovir in a 7-day regimen. The similarity in efficacy was not only for cutaneous lesions but also for ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. In a large controlled trial, they compared valaciclovir and famciclovir. This showed similar efficacy in resolution of acute herpes zoster rashes shortening the duration of postherpetic neuralgia. It was purposed in the article that the therapeutic window for beneficial treatment with valaciclovir and zoster associated pain may be wider that previously though. It is still recommended that valaciclovir be ideally given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. However, starting treatment after 72 hours after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of the valaciclovir on duration of zoster associated pain. Valaciclovir is known to be well tolerated with nausea and headache being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of valaciclovir is similar to aciclovir or famciclovir. The purpose of this review was to present an overview of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in the assessment of pain in herpes zoster in comparison with known agents of aciclovir, famciclovir, and/or placebo. It is concluded that valaciclovir is an efficacious agent in the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. It's at least as efficacious as aciclovir and has similar efficacy to famciclovir. It is well tolerated with a similar side effect profile as aciclovir and famciclovir.

AB  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine: results of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (Center for Headache Management, Springfield, PA) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:782?789. This clinical trial determined the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace productivity loss. Adult migraine sufferers self-injected 6 mg of sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the first 4 h of a minimum of an 8-h work shift. Outcome measures included productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2 h after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work performance, and time to headache relief. A total of 206 patients underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the workplace. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median productivity loss 2 h after injection compared with placebo (25.2 versus 29.9 min, respectively) (P = 0.14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo (36.8 versus 72.6, respectively) (P = 0.001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients experienced shorter return to normal work performance at 2 h and across the work shift. Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients experienced headache relief 1 h after injection compared with placebo-treated patients. Conclude that across an 8-h work shift, sumatriptan was superior to the placebo in reducing productivity loss due to migraine.
