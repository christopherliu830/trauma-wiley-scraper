AB  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine: results of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (Center for Headache Management, Springfield, PA) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:782?789. This clinical trial determined the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace productivity loss. Adult migraine sufferers self-injected 6 mg of sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the first 4 h of a minimum of an 8-h work shift. Outcome measures included productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2 h after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work performance, and time to headache relief. A total of 206 patients underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the workplace. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median productivity loss 2 h after injection compared with placebo (25.2 versus 29.9 min, respectively) (P = 0.14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo (36.8 versus 72.6, respectively) (P = 0.001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients experienced shorter return to normal work performance at 2 h and across the work shift. Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients experienced headache relief 1 h after injection compared with placebo-treated patients. Conclude that across an 8-h work shift, sumatriptan was superior to the placebo in reducing productivity loss due to migraine.

AB  - Ethical considerations in the treatment of pain in a hospice environment. (Hospice Rozenheuvel, Rozendaal, The Netherlands) Patient Education and Counseling 2000;41:47?53. This article discussed some specific ethical problems encountered in hospice practice. Patient's autonomy with all its advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Ethical considerations with regard to risk taking and the treatment of pain are discussed. The needs of the patients are central to the discussion. Myths regarding opioids and pain therapy goals are addressed, as are approaches to treating intractable pain and dealing with patients who request assisted death. Acceptance of death may result in an active and creative attitude. Conclude that although scientific evidence of the processes taking place is still lacking, the modern hospice may be seen as a complementary, mainstream institution contributing to the development of whole medicine.

AB  - P.A. Mallinder, J.E. Hall, F.G. Bergin, P. Royle, D.J. Leaper: A comparison of opiate- and epidural-induced alterations in splanchnic blood flow using intraoperative gastric tonometry. (North Tees Hospital, Hardwick, Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, UK) Anaesthesia 2000;55:659?665. This study assessed the ability of tonometry to measure differential effects of opiate and epidural analgesia on splanchnic blood flow. Forty patients for elective colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to receive epidural infusion or intravenous morphine. Gastric mucosal PCO2, pHi, standard pHi, PCO2 gap, and pH gap were measured after induction and on termination of surgery. These parameters were within normal limits at the end in most cases and there was no significant difference between the groups. The complication rate was similar in both groups and was not correlated with low pHi, but was correlated with blood loss. A difference in splanchnic perfusion was not demonstrated between the two groups. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. This study concerns the assessment of splanchnic blood flow measured indirectly and noninvasively in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The tonometer is a modified gastric tube terminating in a silicone balloon, which can be filled intermittently with either air or saline. With this technique, it is possible to measure gastric mucosal CO2 (PgCO2) and intramucosal pH and pH gap using a modified Henderson-Hasellbach equation, thus indirectly providing an estimate of splanchnic blood flow. These parameters were measured after induction and upon termination of surgery in 2 groups of patients randomly allocated to receive either intravenous morphine (10 mg) or epidural bupivacaine to achieve a T5 sensory level of blockade. The authors were unable to demonstrate a difference in splanchnic perfusion as assessed with tonometry between the 2 groups.

AB  - The impact of spinal problems on the health status of patients: have we underestimated the effect? (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire) Spine 2000;25:1509?1514. This prospective study involved 17,774 patients who consulted spine centers and aimed to qualify the effect that spinal diagnoses have on patient's physical functional status (SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score) compared with other common conditions and to qualify the effects of comorbidities on physical functional status in spine patients. The study patients were a mean of 47.5 years of age, 54.7% were female, 52.3% had lumbosacral diagnoses, and 82% has had 3 or more months of pain. The population had a mean PCS score of 30.4 ± 9.95 (SD) compared with 50.0 ± 10.00 for the general United States population. The more comorbidities in a patient, the lower the PCS score (Spearman rank correlation = ?0.27). The 5 comorbid conditions that lowered the PCS the most included congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Conclude the PCS score is greatly affected in patients with spinal problems. The study population's OCS was lower or similar to the PCS for patients with other illnesses reported in the literature. Further, the presence of comorbidity in spine patients adds to the burden of spinal conditions on functional status.

AB  - Endocrine consequences of long-term intrathecal administration of opioids. (University of Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium) J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2000;85:2215?2222. This study involved 73 patients (29 men and 44 women) receiving opioids intrathecally for nonmalignant pain who were enrolled for extensive endocrine investigation. At the time of hormonal determination, the mean duration of opioid treatment was 26.6 ± 16.3 months; the mean daily dose of morphine was 4.8 ± 3.2 mg. The control group consisted of 20 patients (11 men and 9 women) with a comparable pain syndrome, but not treated with opioids. Decreased libido or impotency was present in 23 of 24 men receiving opioids. The serum testosterone level was below 9 nmol/L in 25 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The free androgen index was below normal in 18 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The serum LH level was less than 2 U/L in 20 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). Serum FSH was comparable in both groups. Decreased libido was present in 22 of 32 women receiving opioids. All 21 premenopausal females developed either amenorrhea or an irregular menstrual cycle, with ovulation in only 1. Serum LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were lower in the opioid group. In all 18 postmenopausal females significantly decreased serum LH (P < 0.001) and FSH (P = 0.012) levels were found. The 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion was below 20 ?g/day in 14 of 71 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.003). The peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was below 180 ?g/L in 9 of 61 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the nonopioid group (P = 0.002). The insulin-like growth factor I sd score was below ?2 sd in 12 of 73 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.002). The peak GH response to hypoglycemia was below 3 ?g/L in 9 of 62 subjects and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.010). Thyroid function tests and PRL levels were considered normal. No metabolic disturbances were recorded, apart from significantly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.041) and elevated total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P = 0.008) in the opioid group compared to the control group. Supplementation with gonadal steroids improved sexual function in most patients. Conclude of all patients receiving intrathecal opioids, the large majority of men and all women developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, about 15% developed central hypocorticism, and about 15% developed GH deficiency. These findings suggest that further investigations are required to determine the need for systematic endocrine work-up in these patients and the necessity for substitutive therapy.

AB  - Lateral cervical epidural catheter placement for continuous unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:313?317. This article discussed the use of a laterally directed cervical epidural catheter for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. The technique was used in a series of 30 patients to produce unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. A case report of a patient treated with this technique and a description of the technique as well as the results from the series are presented. The method included placement of an epidural catheter at the C6-7 vertebral interspace; the needle bevel and catheter were directed to the affected side in a woman with a history of complex regional pain syndrome of the right upper extremity. A unilateral block was shown with the technique by anatomic parameters (unilateral contrast dye spread), physiologic parameters (unilateral Horner's syndrome), and symptomatic parameters (unilateral, subjective neural block). One patient treated with the technique had bilateral effects; however, no patient had a predominant block on the contralateral side and no complications developed. The case report showed results that were typical of the series of 30 patients. Conclude that the laterally directed cervical epidural catheter was an effective technique to produce continuous unilateral analgesia and sympathetic block.

AB  - The effects of intrathecal morphine encapsulated in l- and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline liposomes on acute nociception in rats. (University of California, San Diego, CA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:423?428. This study evaluated the antinociceptive effects of morphine encapsulated in liposomes of two isomeric phospholipids, l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (l-DPPC) and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (d-DPPC), in comparison with morphine in saline. Sprague-Dawley rats with chronic lumbar intrathecal catheters were tested for their acute nociceptive response using a hindpaw thermal escape test. Their general behavior, motor function, pinna reflex, and corneal reflex were also examined. The duration of antinociception was longer in both liposomal morphine groups than in the free morphine group. The peak antinociceptive effects were observed within 30 min after intrathecal morphine, l-DPPC or d-DPPC morphine injection. The rank order of the area under the effect-time curve for antinociception was l-DPPC morphine> d-DPPC morphine> morphine. The 50% effective dose was: 2.7 ?g (morphine), 4.6 ?g (l-DPPC morphine), and 6.4 ?g (d-DPPC morphine). d-DPPC morphine had fewer side effects for a given antinociceptive AUC than morphine. Conclude that l-DPPC and d-DPPC liposome encapsulation of morphine prolonged the antinociceptive effect on acute thermal stimulation and could decrease side effects compared with morphine alone. Comments by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. One would intuitively expect that encapsulation of a drug would prolong its duration of action and reduce systemic side effects. However, the results of this study taken in the context of studies with the encapsulation of other opioids indicate that the physical/chemical properties of the opioid can have an important influence on the results of encapsulation. For example, the investigators have demonstrated that encapsulation of alfentanyl had only a modest effect on its duration of action, presumably because of the ability of the lipophilic alfentanyl to rapidly defuse through the membranes of the liposomes. One question the study leaves open is whether or not the material used for encapsulation has consistent effects on its own. The investigators previously found that intrathecal delivery of l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline resulted in a steroid-sensitive allodynia. However, in the present study the investigators did not observe this. Thus, there is much to be learned about the science and art of drug encapsulation for therapeutic purposes in humans.

AB  - D. Sheffield, P.L. Biles, H. Orom, W. Maixner, D.S. Sheps: Race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC) Psychosomatic Medicine 2000;62:517?523. The purpose of this study was to determine race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. Pain perception was measured using a suprathreshold evaluation of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli in 27 whites (14 men and 13 women) and 24 African-Americans (12 men and 12 women). Blood pressure, depressive symptoms, anxiety state levels, and negative mood were assessed before pain testing to examine whether they might account for any sex or race differences in pain perception that emerged. African-Americans rated the stimuli as more unpleasant and showed a tendency to rate it as more intense than whites. Women showed a tendency to rate the stimuli as more unpleasant and more intense than men. In addition, systolic blood pressure was inversely related to pain intensity. After statistically adjusting for systolic blood pressure, sex differences in pain unpleasantness were reduced and sex differences in pain intensity were abolished; race differences were unaltered. These differences in pain perception may be associated with different pain mechanisms: in the case of sex, differences in opioid activity and baroreceptor-regulated pain systems; in the case of race, unmeasured psychological characteristics are suggested by the larger differences in ratings of pain unpleasantness than pain intensity. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study where the authors look to elucidate whether there was a difference in cutaneous pain perception determined by race or sex. In general, it is a very well-designed study where 2 different groups were evaluated, 1 of 27 whites and 1 of 24 African-Americans with close to half and half distribution of men and women. Pain perception was measured using pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli. Five different temperatures were used on each subject ranging from 45°C to 49°C. The pain scoring was carried upon a scale from 0 to 150 represented as a line where the evaluated subject had to mark the line at a certain height according to their pain perception. The conclusions reached in the study show that, in general, whites rated the thermal stimuli less painful than African-Americans. The results show a tendency for men to rate the thermal stimuli as less painful than women did. One of the interesting findings in this study was that the pain differences between men and women were diminished after statically adjusting for systolic blood pressure level. However, the pain intensity and the pain differences after adjusting for systolic blood pressure were unaltered for race differences. In addition, it was also found that pain perception and pain rating was inversely proportional to systolic blood pressure. The hypoalgesia caused by increased systolic blood pressure is a poorly understood mechanism. Several studies have shown that in hypertensive rats there is increased opioid activity in brain tissue. These studies have suggested that at the increase of the pain threshold in subjects who have elevated blood pressure may be related to opioid activity. It is important to mention that in order to establish a definite correlation between systolic blood pressure elevation and the decreased pain perception more studies have to be done. Another important point in this study is the influence of psychological factors on pain perception. In general, it was seen that individuals that were psychologically rated as depressive had a higher rating of the pain compared to individuals that tested as high for anxiety.

AB  - Regional pain syndrome: a distinct clinical entity associated with HLA-DR13. (Leiden University Medical center. Leiden, The Netherlands) Ann Neurol 2000;48:113?116. This report discussed 26 patients with a distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome that progressed toward a multifocal or generalized tonic dystonia. The dystonia initiated distally, involved mainly flexor muscles, and was associated with sensory and autonomic symptoms. Dryness of the eyes or mouth and bladder and bowel disturbances were frequently reported. There was no increase in the familial prevalence of autoimmune-mediated disease. Compared with controls, a significant elevation of HLA-DR13 was found in the patients. Thus, HLA-DR13 may be a factor indicating susceptibility to this distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathic pain: from mechanisms to symptoms. (Christian-Albrechts-Univerität Kiel, Kiel, Germany) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S12?20. This review concentrates on the several independent pathophysiological mechanisms in both the peripheral and central nervous system that are responsible for sensory symptoms as well as spontaneous and evoked pains in peripheral neuropathies. These mechanisms can operate in concert in a single disease entity and also in a single patient. Distinct pathophysiological mechanisms lead to specific sensory symptoms, for example, dynamic mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. It is also possible that the pain-generating mechanism and the symptoms change during the course of the disease. A thorough analysis of sensory symptoms may reveal the underlying mechanisms that are mainly active in a particular patient. The treatment of neuropathic pain is currently unsatisfactory. In the future, drugs will be developed that address specifically the relevant combination of mechanisms. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This is an excellent article, which will be a landmark in the approach to the treatment of neuropathic pain. There are several pathophysiological mechanisms, which can cause sensitive symptoms and spontaneous or evoked pain. Mechanical or thermal hyperalgesia is caused by peripheral sensitization. Pinprick hyperalgesia is correlated to the ?wind-up? phenomenon. Allodynia has multiple triggering factors: central sensitization, central reorganization and loss of inhibitory control. Paresthesia is explained by ectopic discharges due to the accumulation of Na+ channels, as with stabbing or paroxysmal pain. A hot or burning pain can be explained by peripheral sensitization and loss of inhibitory mechanisms. This explains why not all painful syndromes respond with the same efficacy to a given treatment. Neuropathic pain can occur in very different forms. For instance, a diabetic neuropathy can be associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia, or with burning and paroxysmal pain. A different treatment is required for each of these symptoms. From now on, we must use a different criterion to label painful neuropathic syndromes. Keeping to the above example, we shall distinguish between diabetic neuropathy with allodynia and diabetic neuropathy with burning pain.

Advice on the development of a palliative care plan and on working with parents and children is also provided. Barriers to the provision of effective pediatric palliative care and potential solutions are identified. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the development and broad availability of pediatric palliative care services based on child-specific guidelines and standards. Such services will require widely distributed and effective palliative care education of pediatric health care professionals.

AB  - Intertester reliability of the McKenzie evaluation in assessing patients with mechanical low back pain. (Sunny Brook 30:368?389. In this study, patients were assessed simultaneously by 2 physical therapists trained in the McKenzie evaluation system. The therapists were randomly assigned as examiner and observer. Agreement was estimated by Kappa statistics. Forty-five subjects (47 ± 14 years), composed of 25 women and 20 men with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain were examined. The agreement between raters for selection of the McKenzie syndromes was K = 0.70, and for the derangement subsyndromes was K = 0.96. Interrater agreement for the presence of lateral shift, relevance of lateral shift, relevance of lateral component, and deformity in the sagittal plane was K = 0.52, 0.85, 0.95, and 1.00, respectively. Intertester agreement on syndrome categories in 17 patients under 55 years of age was excellent with K = 1.00. Conclude that a form of low back evaluation, using patterns of pain response to repeated end range spinal test movements, was highly reliable when performed by 2 properly trained physical therapists. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This article intends to address the ability for therapists to agree on a low back pain diagnosis using the McKenzie technique of classification. It is important for this study to select a clear clinical diagnosis in order to establish rationale for patient management and determine a prognosis. Another purpose for this study was to agree on the relevance of sagittal and frontal plane deformities using McKenzie methods in assessing patients with back pain. The subjects included adult patients with a history of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain. Patients were referred by general practitioners or specialists for treatment at an outpatient department where the study was conducted. The examination consisted of taking a history, observational evaluation of the range of motion, and completion of a specified tests movements in the sagittal, frontal, and combined planes. Subjects were allowed to communicate only with the assessor. A total of 46 patients with a history of low back pain agreed to complete the assessment. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those 55 years of age and older and those younger than 55. McKenzie identifies only 3 mechanical syndromes: 1. Postural, 2. Dysfunction, 3. Derangement. Each of these syndromes were divided into separate subsyndromes according to location of the pain and presence or absence of spinal deformities. The study concluded that therapists trained in use of the McKenzie evaluation system can be highly reliable in reaching the same conclusion in respect to classifying patients into diagnostic syndromes and subsyndromes, especially in patients under the age of 55. In contrast to other published studies, the importance of advanced training for interpretation of symptom behavior definitely leads to selection of the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Relationship between functional evaluation measures and self-assessment in nonacute low back pain. (Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada) Spine 2000;25:1817?1826. In this study, two hypotheses were examined: range of motion and velocity are controllable and inherently correlated with self-assessment; complex spinal coordination patterns such as range of lordosis cannot be controlled and are independent of self-assessment. Self-assessment questionnaires were administered, and indexes of spinal motion and coordination were measured through skin marker kinematics. The correlation between self-assessments and biomechanical measures was determined. Self-assessments of function were significantly correlated with parameters prone to regulation: range of motion, velocity, and load lifted. In contrast, little correlation was found with measures of complex spinal coordination less susceptible to conscious or affective regulation, namely, range of lordosis, and estimated segmental mobility. This effect was magnified with increased load. Self-assessment scores were significantly poorer among insurance referrals, regardless of functional status. Conclude that simple parameters of the functional examination, such as range of motion and velocity, are strongly correlated with cognitive state, and thus the information they supply is less than ideal. Complex spinal coordination is a better indicator of the degree of spinal dysfunction and enhances the process of differentiating between pain, disability, and functional impairment. Comment by Phillip S. Sizer Jr., MEd, PT. Numerous approaches to the evaluation of lumbar spine disorders have been proposed. Self-reported disability scales are frequently implemented, but outcomes can be influenced by patient psychological factors. ROM tests have been frequently used for disability rating, but difficulty is encountered in detecting submaximal patient effort. These investigators evaluated the relationships between the Quebec Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and other self-assessment measures, simple functional measures, and coordination patterns using the Spinoscope. From these measures the investigators attempted to elucidate a more accurate objective measure of biomechanical impairment independent from affective or self-assessment influences. The outcomes illustrated that, while simple ROM and velocity measures were strongly correlated with subjective index scores, complex spinal coordination measures were not correlated with the same self-assessment outcomes. Additionally, the authors suggested that simple ROM does not ensure biomechanical normalcy in movement. Furthermore, they suggested that complex coordination measures that include Range of Lordosis (ROL) and Estimate of Inter-segmental Mobility (EISM) may serve as a better compliment to the clinical examination findings associated with lumbar conditions. Finally, they suggested that loading the spine during coordination testing further distances the outcomes from the subjective influence of pain and other factors. These measures may be superior to traditional measures for accurate diagnosis and return-to-work decisions with patients suffering from seemingly vague conditions, such as nonspecific low back pain.

AB  - The role of physical exercise and inactivity in pain recurrence and absenteeism from work after active outpatient rehabilitation for recurrent or chronic low back pain: A follow-up study. (DBC International, Vantaa, Finland) Spine 2000;25:1809?1816. This study analyzed the role of physical exercise and inactivity on long-term outcome after active outpatient low back rehabilitation. One hundred twenty-five patients with low back pain, who had participated in a 12-week active low back rehabilitation program, were asked about subjective pain and disability on the average of 14 months after the treatment. The outcomes were defined as a recurrence of persistent pain and work absenteeism, and a survival or failure analysis was performed between those who had continued exercising and who had been physically inactive. Recurrences of persistent pain during the follow-up period were fewer (P = 0.03) among those who had maintained regular exercise habits after the treatment than among those who had been physically inactive. Similarly, work absenteeism was less (P < 0.01) among physically active than among physically inactive persons. However, patients with good outcome in pain reduction after low back pain rehabilitation were more likely to participate in physical exercise. Conclude that exercises are beneficial after guided treatment in the maintenance of the results of active treatment for recurrent chronic low back pain in the long term, but those with less favorable outcome in rehabilitation are less likely to participate in exercises afterward. In active treatment programs, it is recommended that exercises be incorporated after the guided treatment. Comment by Phillip S. Sizer Jr., MEd, PT. Historically, clinicians have instructed their patients to use trunk exercise to reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms and functional losses associated with low back pain (LBP). Through the years increasing evidence has supported this notion. However, fewer investigators have evaluated the impact of exercise after the rehabilitation process has been completed. This investigation performed this evaluation and found that regular, postrehabilitation exercise improved long-term outcomes for patients who had previously suffered from LBP. Specifically, the investigators reported that ongoing exercise performed after an active outpatient rehabilitation program reduced recurrence of symptoms and absenteeism from work, especially after 1 year postonset. Additionally, these benefits did not appear to differ for those involved in self-guided exercises versus those participating in a guided program with back-specific devices in an outpatient treatment unit. This very interesting article reveals several pearls for the practitioner. First, subjects were not recruited on a voluntary basis, so to avoid attracting a group with good self-motivation to alleviate their prevailing symptoms. This measure allows the outcomes to be applicable to a varied clinical population. Secondly, although the results favored the use of a guided program with back specific devices over self-guided exercise, there were no statistical differences between the 2 approaches. Thus, patients can benefit from self-monitored exercise even when they do not have access to a guided program using specific devices. Finally, the investigators revealed that poor clinical rehabilitation outcomes predicted postrehabilitation inactivity and reduced success with posttreatment exercise. Thus, the effectiveness of the rehabilitation process may influence patient's activity level and success of exercise after rehabilitation.
