AB  - Neurotoxicity of intrathecally administered tetracaine commences at posterior roots near entry into the spinal cord. (Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:372?379. This study examined the histopathologic effects of intrathecally administered tetracaine. Sixty Wistar rats randomly received either 20%, 10%, 5%, 3%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0% tetracaine dissolved in 10% glucose solution or no solution via a chronically implanted intrathecal catheter. The spinal cord at L1, posterior and anterior roots and cauda equina were excised 5 days later, sectioned, processed, and prepared for light and electron microscopic examinations. Rats treated with tetracaine at 10% or 20% developed lesions in the posterior white matter and posterior roots. Rats injected with 3% or 5% tetracaine developed lesions, which began in the posterior roots close to the spinal cord and extended to the posterior white matter. The lesions were characterized by axonal degeneration. Injections of 1% of tetracaine did not cause any pathological changes. The results suggest that the initial target of intrathecal tetracaine neurotoxicity may be the posterior roots at their entry into the spinal cord, where the axons are devoid of myelin sheath and thus represent a sensitive area for neurotoxic change. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The reassuring aspect of this study is that no significant lesions were found when rats were given clinically used concentrations of tetracaine. The investigators do make a case that clinically used concentrations of tetracaine might be neurotoxic in humans based on the observation that the duration of action of tetracaine is shorter in rats than in humans. The distribution of the lesions is curious in that 10% tetracaine produced lesions in the posterior rootlets and in the posterior rootlet entry zone, but did not produce lesions in the fasciculus gracilis. The implication is that rootlets posterior to lamina L1 (the L1 segment that was examined) that were destroyed do not project into the fasciculus gracilis. One would expect that destruction of lamina L2 posterior rootlets that projected into the fasciculus gracilis would produce lesions visible at the EM level at L1 5 days after damage. The absence of lesions in the L1 fasciculus gracilis puzzles me. I am also puzzled by the suggestion that all posterior rootlets loose their myelin sheath just before entry into the posterior white matter of the spinal cord (Obersteiner-Redlich zone). To my knowledge, most posterior rootlets do not have this nonmyelinated zone and; therefore, the absence of the myelin would make only a portion of the posterior rootlets vulnerable to tetracaine neurotoxicity as suggested by the authors. In short, there are some anatomical relationships that do not fit with the distribution of lesions described by the investigators.

AB  - Acute tolerance to continuously infused alfentanil: the role of cholecystokinin and N-methyl-D-aspartate-nitric oxide systems. (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:110?119. To test the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) and N-methyl-D-aspartate-nitric oxide (NMDA-NO) systems in the development of acute tolerance to analgesia during alfentanil IV infusion, experiments were conducted in rats with the use of an infusion algorithm designed to maintain a constant plasma level of the opioid for 4 h. The degree of acute tolerance was determined on the basis of decline in the level of analgesia measured with a tail compression test. CCKB receptor antagonists (proglumide, CI-988, and L-365,260) and NMDA-NO cascade inhibitors (dizocilpine and NO synthase inhibitor) were administered before the start of alfentanil infusion. Use of 30 mg/kg proglumide, 10 mg/kg CI-988, and 1 mg/kg L-365,260 attenuated acute tolerance at 1 h of alfentanil infusion by approximately 60%, 55%, and 70%, respectively, and by the end of the 4-h infusion by 50%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. Use of 0.1 mg/kg dizocilpine and 10 mg/kg NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester attenuated acute tolerance at 1 h of alfentanil infusion by approximately 65% and 65% and by the end of the 4-h infusion by 30% and 0%, respectively. Comparison of the results with CCKB receptor antagonists and inhibitors of NMDA-NO cascade demonstrates that both groups provide more or less similar degrees of attenuation of acute tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of alfentanil, and none of these drugs completely prevents tolerance development.

AB  - The treatment of neuropathic pain: antidepressants and opioids. (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S49?S55. This article reviewed the scientific data on antidepressants and opioids, which are largely confined to randomized controlled trials in two neuropathic pain conditions that have proved to be good models for clinical investigation. A review of literature was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database regarding postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. The use of the older antidepressants such as amitriptyline in neuropathic pain was extensively supported by the literature. However, newer randomized controlled trials supported the use of opioids. Conclude that first-line therapy for neuropathic pain may be either an older generation antidepressant such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline or the anticonvulsant gabapentin. For refractory cases, chronic opioid therapy may be the only avenue of relief, and evidence is accumulating that this approach is safe if proper guidelines are observed.

AB  - Natural history of individuals with asymptomatic disc abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging: predictors of low back pain-related medical consultation and work capacity. (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) Spine 2000;25:1484?1492. This prospective study involved 46 asymptomatic individuals who had a high rate of disc herniations (73%) that were observed for an average of 5 years. Four classes of variable were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Disc herniations and neural compromise did not significantly worsen at follow-up, whereas disc degeneration progresses in 17 individuals (41.5%). Minor episodes of low back pain occurred in 19 individuals (41.3%), 6 of whom had to seek medical treatment and 5 of whom had to stop work temporarily. The requirement for low back pain-related medical consultation was predicted with high accuracy by listlessness, job satisfaction, and working in shifts (P < 0.001). Work capacity was best predicted by physical job characteristics, job disaffection, and working in shifts (P < 0.001). Conclude that physical job characteristics and psychological aspects of work were more powerful than magnetic resonance imaging-identified disc abnormalities in predicting the need for low back pain-related medical consultation and the resultant work incapacity. However, the conclusions are still preliminary, and replication of the findings in larger and more representative study samples is needed.

AB  - Reoperations after lumbar disc surgery: a population-based study of regional and interspecialty variations. (National Research and Development Center for Welfare and Health (STAKES), Helsinki, Finland) Spine 2000;25:1500?1507. This study aimed to explore rates of reoperation after lumbar disc surgery and their regional and interspecialty variations. Patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery from 1987 to 1995 were identified in the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Data on the patient's initial disc operations, subsequent operations, and cause-of-death records were linked using personal identification codes. The Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazard model were used to analyze risks of reoperation after initial surgery and for neurosurgical and orthopedic patients of university hospitals. Out of 25,359 surgical patients with herniated lumbar discs, 12.3% underwent subsequent lumbar operations corresponding to the cumulative risk of 18.9% in the 9-year follow-up. Reoperation rates increased during the study period with the recent patient cohorts exhibiting risks. The reoperation risk showed a systematic geographic variation: the higher the regional disc surgery rate, the higher the reoperation risk. Overall, neurosurgical patients had a higher reoperation risk than orthopedic patients, but it was not a uniform finding. Conclude that the reoperation risk after disc surgery increased during the study period and was higher in hospital catchment areas with higher overall discectomy rates. The reoperation rates varied among the university hospitals, but tended to be higher for neurosurgical rather than for orthopedic patients.

AB  - Managing spasticity in pediatric cerebral palsy using a very low dose of botulinum toxin type A: preliminary report. (Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand) Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2000;79:320?326. This study was conducted to determine if very low doses of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) could reduce spasticity and improve gait in cerebral palsied children when combined with rehabilitation therapy. The trainable (IQ> 80), ambulatory, spastic diplegic or hemiplegic cerebral palsied children, with no fixed contractures in at least one limb, were selected for this study. Patients with a score of 3 on a modified Ashworth scale received 0.5 units of BTX-A/kg/muscle. Patients with an Ashworth score of 4 received 1.0 BTX-A/kg/muscle. After BTX-A injection, all patients received rehabilitation therapy and plastic ankle and foot orthoses for walking. Both groups exhibited improvement in Ashworth score and in gait within 72 h of injection with botulinum toxin. Beneficial effects persisted for 10 to 12 months in most patients, with 3 patients exhibiting benefits for at least 20 months. Conclude that a very low dose of BTX-A combined with rehabilitation therapy resulted in a long-lasting decrease in spasticity and an improvement in gait in children with cerebral palsy.

AB  - Lumbar plexus clock reduces pain and blood loss associated with total hip arthroplasty. (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genéve, Geneva, Switzerland) Anesthesiology 2000;93:115?121. In this study, 60 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive general anesthesia with (plexus group, n = 30) or without (control group, n = 30) a posterior lumbar plexus block. The block was performed after induction using a nerve stimulator, and 0.4 mL/kg bupivacaine, 0.5%, with epinephrine was injected. General anesthesia was standardized, and supplemental fentanyl was administered per hemodynamic guidelines. Postoperative pain and patient-controlled intravenous morphine use were serially assessed for 48 h. The proportion of patients receiving supplemental fentanyl intraoperatively was more than 3 times greater in the control group (20 of 30 vs. 6 of 29, P = 0.001). In the postanesthesia care unit, a greater than fourfold reduction in pain scores was observed in the plexus group and ?rescue? morphine boluses were administered 10 times less frequently. Pain scores and morphine consumption remained significantly lower in the plexus group until 6 h after randomization. Operative and postoperative (48 h) blood loss was decreased modestly in the treated group. Epidural-like distribution of anesthesia occurred in 3 of 28 plexus group patients, but no other side effects were noted. Conclude that posterior lumbar plexus block provides effective analgesia for total hip arthroplasty, reducing intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirements. Blood loss during and after the procedure is diminished. Epidural anesthetic distribution should be anticipated in a minority of cases. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. The benefits of regional anesthetic techniques are well established for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. For example, it is common knowledge to the clinical anesthesiologist that regional anesthesia results in reduced blood loss as well as a reduction in thromboembolic events postoperatively. This interesting study considered a posterior lumbar plexus block since a significant portion of the hip is innervated via branches of the lumbar plexus. A randomized, double-blinded trial of 60 consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia was performed. Thirty patients had general anesthesia alone and 30 patients had general anesthesia with the lumbar plexus block. Pain scores and morphine consumption postoperatively were evaluated over a 48-h period. Patients in the control group required supplemental narcotic (20/30) versus those in the lumbar plexus block group (6/30). No BIS monitor was employed simply with the end point of additional analgesic being an increase in blood pressure or heart rate greater than 130% of the baseline. Epidural-like distribution of anesthesia occurred in 3 of 28 patients receiving the block. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar in both groups and pain scores were significantly lower until the 6-h period postoperatively. There was a block-associated reduction in hemorrhage. These results are not surprising; however, it would be unlikely that this block would be done in a repeated series and the authors describe a continuous catheter-based technique, which they have presented in abstract form for longer-term postoperative pain relief. The associated complications with this block must be weighed with these positive and predictable findings. The complexity of proper placement of this block compared with other regional techniques and its potential side effects would make this block difficult to implement in the operating room. The authors should be complemented for this study and great consideration for its potential benefits in clinical practice should be considered.

AB  - Generating a learning curve for pediatric caudal epidural blocks: an empirical evaluation of technical skills in novice and experienced anesthetists. (Institute of Anesthesiology, Lucerne, Switzerland) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:385?388. The aim of this study was to assess the number of caudal blocks needed to guarantee a high success rate in performing caudal epidural analgesia in children. The technical skills of 7 residents in anesthesiology who performed caudal blocks were evaluated during 4 months using a standardized self-evaluation questionnaire. At the start of the study period, the residents had no prior experience in pediatric anesthesia or in performing caudal epidural blocks. All residents entered the pediatric rotation after a minimum of 1 year of training in adult general and regional anesthesia. The blocks were rated using a binary score. For comparison, the success rates of 8 experienced staff anesthesiologists were collected during the same period using the same self-evaluation questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed by generating individual and institutional learning curves using the pooled data. The learning curves were calculated with the aid of a least-square fit model and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by a Monte-Carlo procedure with a bootstrap technique. The success rate of residents was 80% after 32 procedures (95% confidence interval of 0.59 to 1.00). The pooled success rate of the staff anesthesiologists was 0.73 (mean) with a standard deviation of 0.45, which was not statistically different from the success rate of the residents. Conclude that high success rates in performing caudal anesthesia in pediatric patients can be acquired after a limited number of cases. Success rates of residents learning this procedure are comparable to the results of the staff anesthesiologists.

AB  - Motor blockade by brachial plexus block in the sheep. (Université de Rennes, Rennes, France) Anesthesiology 2000;93:292?294. This report aimed to evaluate the approach of the brachial plexus block in a sheep model using bupivacaine. Blocks were performed with electrical stimulation using a 50mm insulated needle. When muscle twitches were elicited with 0.5-mA impulses, drug solutions were injected over a 1-min period. Nerve stimulation and injection of methylene blue were performed in two sheep that were killed 2 h later for postmortem anatomic control of setting injection. Twenty-three nerve stimulations were achieved; the brachial plexus was reached in less than 5 min and within 5-cm depth (range, 1.5?4.5 cm). Sheep cadaver dissection showed no visible vital structure in close proximity to the site of injection. Dissection records confirmed that the brachial plexus anatomy of sheep was close to that of humans. An optimal distribution of contrast medium was obtained with 30-mL volume. Usually 1?2 min was sufficient to recover from anesthesia and to allow motor evaluation. No apparent sign of cardiac or central nervous system toxicities were recorded with any dose (0.5?4.3 mg/kg). All animals demonstrated a complete recovery, and no sequelae were recorded. Conclude that the brachial plexus block was performed easily in sheep and produced a motor block that varied in a dose-related fashion. This model may be useful for assessing regional anesthesia of new drugs and/or new drug delivery. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. Two questions ran through my mind as I read this manuscript. One, is there a need for an animal model for brachial plexus block, the other, is the sheep the model of choice? The investigators state that ?laboratory animal studies are necessary models for the assessment of new drugs and/or drug delivery systems used in regional anesthesia.? They indicate that with the exception of sciatic nerve block in rats, there are few data in the literature. This does not directly answer the question of whether or not there is a need for an animal model for brachial plexus block evaluation. To be positive, assume there is a need and then move to the question of whether or not the sheep would be the appropriate model. The investigators describe variations between the sheep and humans with respect of the origin of the brachial plexus and the phrenic nerves. What is not stated is that the gross anatomical morphology of humans and sheep are quite different, which may or may not be significant. Again to be positive, assume that the difference is not significant. If we accept that there is a need for an animal model and that the sheep is a suitable model, then we must ask what is it we want to do with the model? It would have been helpful if the investigators provided some suggestions for future studies. While recognizing the importance of animal models in advancing the science and art of regional anesthesia, I believe there is limited need for an animal model to evaluate brachial plexus block and have reservation regarding the utility of sheep as a model for such studies. I believe that most inquiries regarding brachial plexus block can be conducted safely on humans.

AB  - Effects of radolmidine, a novel α2-adrenergicagonist compared with dexmedetomidine in different pain models in the rat. (University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland) Anesthesiology 2000;93:473?481. This study determined the antinociceptive and sedative effects of radolmidine in different models of acute and chronic pain. Dexmedetomidine and saline served as controls. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied in acute pain (tail flick), carrageenan inflammation, and the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain. Mechanical allodynia was assessed with von Frey filaments, cold allodynia with the acetone test, and thermal hyperalgesia with the paw flick test. Locomotor activity-vigilance was assessed in a dark field. Dexmedetomidine and radolmidine were administered intrathecally in doses of 0.25 ?g, 2.5 ?g, and 10 ?g. In the tail flick test, radolmidine showed a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect, being equipotent compared with dexmedetomidine. In carrageenan inflammation, intrathecal doses of 2.5 ?g or 5 ?g of dexmedetomidine/radolmidine produced significant antinociception compared with saline (P < 0.01). The two drugs were equianalgesic. In the neuropathic pain model, an intrathecal dose of 5 ?g dexmedetomidine-radolmidine had a significant antiallodynic effect compared with saline (P < 0.01). The 2 drugs were equipotent. Intrathecal administration of both dexmedetomidine and radolmidine dose dependently decreased spontaneous locomotor activity-vigilance, but this effect was significantly smaller after intrathecal administration of radolmidine than after intrathecal dexmedetomidine. Conclude radolmidine and dexmedetomidine had equipotent antinociceptive effects in all tests studied. However, radolmidine caused significantly less sedation than dexmedetomidine, probably because of a different pharmacokinetic profile.

AB  - Longitudinal quantitative measures of the natural course of low back pain. (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) Spine 2000;25:1950?1956. This prospective study compared traditional self-report measures of low back pain recovery with quantitative measure of recovery. Sixteen occupational and 16 non-occupational patients with low back pain were recruited. Recovery was monitored prospectively every 2 weeks for 3 to 6 months, using subjective work status, pain symptoms, activities of daily living, and objective functional performance probability (trunk kinematics). Return to work underestimated the percentage of subjects impaired, as compared with all other outcome measures. Symptoms, activities of daily living, and functional performance probability all showed similar patterns of recovery for 0 to 12 weeks. At 14 weeks, there was a lag in functional performance recovery. Both symptoms and activities of daily living indicated that 80% of the population was recovered, whereas functional performance indicated the figure to be 68%. Conclude that the objective kinematic functional performance measure of recovery quantifies a different aspect of impairment not evaluated by traditional subjective measures. Use of several outcome measures may lead to a better understanding of low back pain recovery or residual impairment, which may minimize the risk of recurrent injury. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. This study evaluates several traditional and not so traditional quantitative measures in the recovery of low back pain. The authors hypothesize that a better understanding of the natural course of low back pain (LBP) recovery may provide the knowledge necessary to prevent high cost recurrent low back injuries. But the relationship between acute low back pain, its recovery, and the subsequent recurrence of LBP is not studied here at all. However the study offers some other interesting information. The traditional outcome measure ?back to work? is a very insensitive one. It depends on the job rather than the severity of the LBP. A relatively new functional outcome measure was introduced: the lumbar motion monitor, a device that evaluates trunk kinematics. This measure seems more important in later stages of recovery.

AB  - Sympathetic innervation and function in reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) Ann Neurol 2000;48:49?59. This study examined sympathetic neurocirculatory function and the role of sympathetic postganglionic nerve traffic in maintaining the pain in 30 patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Most had had the condition for more then 1 year, and 14 had undergone sympathectomy for the pain. Positron emission tomographic scanning after administration of 13N-ammonia was used to assess local perfusion, and 6-[18F]fluorodopamine was used to assess sympathetic innervation. Rates of entry of norepinephrine in the regional venous drainage (spillovers) and regional plasma levels of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (the immediate product of the rate-limiting enzymatic step in norepinephrine biosynthesis) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (the main neuronal metabolite of norepinephrine) were measured with and without intravenous trimethaphan for ganglion blockade. 13N-ammonia-derived radioactivity was less on the affected side than on the unaffected side, whereas 6-[18F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity was symmetrical. Thus, perfusion-adjusted 6-[18F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity was higher on the affected side. Norepinephrine spillover and smaller arteriovenous increments in plasma levels of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dihydroxyphenylglycol did not differ significantly between affected and unaffected limbs, although 4 patients had noticeably less norepinephrine spillover and smaller arteriovenous increments in plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol on the affected side. Trimethaphan decreased the pain in only 2 of 12 nonsympathectomized patients. The results indicate that patients with chronic unilateral reflex sympathetic dystrophy have decreased perfusion of the affected limb, symmetrical sympathetic innervation and norepinephrine synthesis, variably decreased release and turnover of norepinephrine in the affected limb, and failure of ganglion blockade to improve the pain in most cases. These findings suggest augmented vasoconstriction, intact sympathetic terminal innervation, possibly impaired sympathetic neurotransmission, and pain usually independent of sympathetic neurocirculatory outflows.

AB  - Anticonvulsants (antineuropathies) for neuropathic pain syndromes. (University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, WI) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S67?72. This review concentrated on randomized clinical trials of anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain syndromes. The discussion included the use of phenytoin, benzodiazepines, valproic acid, lamotrigine, and gabapentin (GBP). GBP has a favorable side effects profile, and based on the results of these studies, it should be considered a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. GBP mechanisms of action are still not thoroughly defined, but GBP is effective in relieving indexes of allodynia and hyperalgesia in animal models. It still remains to be seen whether GBP is as effective in other painful disorders. One small clinical trial with lamotrigine demonstrated improved pain control in trigeminal neuralgia. Evidence in support of the efficacy of anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain continues to evolve, and benefits have been clearly demonstrated in the case of GBP and carbamazepine. More advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain syndromes should further our opportunities to establish the role of anticonvulsants in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. The clinical efficacy of anticonvulsants is clearly established after years of use in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. However, there are few controlled studies to support their clinical efficacy. Not all anticonvulsant drugs have the same mode of action, which explains why their relief of the different symptoms of neuropathic pain (allodynia, hyperalgesia, burning pain, etc.) is varied. Gabapentine is a first-choice drug for relieving allodynia and hyperalgesia, but it is usually less effective for decreasing paresthesia and dysaesthesia. This article does not refer to clonazepam (a benzodiazepine acting on GABA, which is useful in stabbing pain) or topiramate. The latter is an antiepileptic drug with a good profile for the treatment of neuropathic pain. It has a triple action mechanism: Na+ channel blockade, increased GABA transmission, and antagonism of the kainate-glutamate/AMPA.

AB  - New analgesics for neuropathic pain: the lidocaine patch. (North Shore University Hospital, Syosset, NY) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S62?266. This article reviewed the basis for the development of the lidocaine patch and reviewed the reports of the clinical studies published. Potential uses of the lidocaine patch for other conditions in addition to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) were also discussed. Conclude that it has been clearly established that the lidocaine patch is a safe and effective treatment for PHN and it is recommended as a first-line treatment based on demonstrated efficacy, quick onset of action, lack of systemic effects, and ease of use with other treatments. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. Intravenous lidocaine is used in pain units for the transient relief of chronic neuropathic pain. If the analgesic result is satisfactory, some physicians start treatment with a lidocaine analogue, oral mexylithene. However, the latter drug is not always well tolerated and its efficacy (in my opinion) is far lower than that of intravenous lidocaine. The recently marketed lidocaine patch is a highly recommended therapeutic alternative if we are considering long-term treatment with lidocaine. Topical agents act locally (skin, soft tissues, peripheral nerves) and do not cause high blood levels (no higher than 0.6 micgr/mL). Topical 5% lidocaine decreases the ectopic discharges from peripheral afferents, reducing nociceptive input to the CNS. There are few side effects and the main indication is postherpetic neuralgia and all those syndromes with peripheral neuropathic pain. The relief that can be expected after using topical 5% lidocaine is not complete, and it can be associated with other types of drugs (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, analgesics, etc.) to obtain a synergistic effect.

AB  - Signs of neuropathy in the lower legs and feet of patients with acute intermittent porphyria. (University of Umeå, Umeå, Sweden) J Intern Med 2000;248:27?32. A total of 356 patients were registered and 339 of them (95%) participated in this neuropathy study. The chronic neurological signs were symmetrical and similar to those in type 1 diabetic patients. Significant impairment was found concerning perception, EDB test, lower leg pain, ankle and knee tendon reflexes, but not concerning dry feet, loss of forefoot arch and hammer toes, on comparing patients with manifest versus latent acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). The neurological signs were more severe in the diabetic patients (n = 298). Five AIP patients had permanent quadriplegia after severe attacks. Conclude that patients with manifest AIP had significantly more signs of distal chronic, symmetrical neuropathy of the axonal type than did patients with latent AIP. More grave neurological lesions appear to develop after severe attacks.

AB  - Effect of electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves on neuropathic pain. (Inabe Orthopedic Clinic, Inabe, Japan) Spine 2000;25:1886?1892. Responses of wide dynamic range neurons in the lumbosacral dorsal horn to input from C fibers were studied in urethane chloralose-anesthetized cats. The posterior tibial nerve and sciatic nerve were stimulated simultaneously to examine the effect on the C fiber responses elicited by superficial peroneal nerve stimulation. Simultaneous stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve and sciatic nerve was performed with superficial peroneal nerve C fiber stimulation. This study demonstrated that electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves leads to inhibitory input to the pain pathways at the spinal cord level.

AB  - Extended ?three-in-one? block after total knee arthroplasty: continuous versus patient-controlled techniques. (St. Luc Hospital, Brussels, Belgium) Anesth Analg 2000;91:176?180. This prospective, randomized, doubled-blinded study assessed the efficacy of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) techniques for an extended ?3-in-1? block after total knee arthroplasty. A total of 45 patients were divided into 3 groups of 15. Over 48 h, all patients received 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 ?g/mL clonidine via a femoral nerve sheath catheter in the following manner: as a continuous infusion at 10 mL/h in Group 1; as a continuous infusion at 5 mL/h plus PCA boluses (2.5 mL/30 min) in Group 2; or as PCA boluses only (10 mL/60 min) in Group 3. Pain scores, sensory block, supplemental analgesia, bupivacaine consumption, side effects, and satisfaction scores were recorded. Pain scores and supplemental analgesia were comparable in the three groups. Bupivacaine consumption was significantly less in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (P < 0.01), and in Group 3 than in Group 2 (P < 0.01). Side effects and satisfaction were comparable in the 3 groups. Conclude that extended ?3-in-1? block provides efficient pain relief after total knee arthroplasty and that, compared with a continuous infusion, PCA techniques reduce the total anesthetic consumption without compromise in patient satisfaction or visual analog scale scores. Of the 2 PCA techniques tested, PCA boluses (10-mL lockout; time 60 min) of 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 ?g/mL clonidine was associated with the smallest local anesthetic consumption, and is, therefore, the recommended extended ?3-in-1? block technique. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study, the authors studied the efficacy of the 3 in 1 block in a group of patients that had undergone total knee arthroplasty. Patients were allocated to 3 groups; all patients had a catheter implanted in the femoral sheath. Over 48 h all patients received 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 ?g/mL clonidine. Group 1 received the mixture as a continuous infusion at 10 mL/h. Group 2 received a continuous infusion at 5 mL/h plus PCA boluses (2.5 mL/30 min). Group 3 received 10 mL of solution per 60 min. Pain scores, supplemental analgesia side effects, and patient satisfaction were comparable in all groups. Bupivacaine consumption was significantly lower in Group 2 and Group 3 as compared to Group 1 (P < 0.01). Of the PCA techniques studied, the regimen involving 10 mL per h was associated with the lowest local anesthesia consumption and is, therefore, the recommended technique for extended 3 in 1 block.
