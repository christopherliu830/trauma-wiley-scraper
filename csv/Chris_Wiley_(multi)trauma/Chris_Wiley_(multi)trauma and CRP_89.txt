AB  - Objective There is a widely recognised need to develop effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers to aid the development of disease-modifying treatments, to facilitate early diagnosis and to improve clinical care. This overview aims to summarise the utility of key neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD, before focusing on the latest efforts to identify informative blood biomarkers. Design A literature search was performed using PubMed up to September 2011 for reviews and primary research studies of neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography and amyloid imaging), CSF and blood-based (plasma, serum and platelet) biomarkers in AD and mild cognitive impairment. Citations within individual articles were examined to identify additional studies relevant to this review. Results Evidence of AD biomarker potential was available for imaging techniques reflecting amyloid burden and neurodegeneration. Several CSF measures are promising, including 42 amino acid ?-amyloid peptide (A?42); total tau (T-tau) protein, reflecting axonal damage; and phosphorylated tau (P-tau), reflecting neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Studies of plasma A? have produced inferior diagnostic discrimination. Alternative plasma and platelet measures are described, which represent potential avenues for future research. Conclusions Several imaging and CSF markers demonstrate utility in predicting AD progression and determining aetiology. These require standardisation before forming core elements of diagnostic criteria. The enormous potential available for identifying a minimally-invasive, easily-accessible blood measure as an effective AD biomarker currently remains unfulfilled.

AB  - Involvement of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 but not IL-8 in the development of heat hyperalgesia: effects on heat-evoked calcitonin gene-related peptide release from rat. (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany) J Neurosci 2000;20:6289?6293. In this study, the rat skin model was used to investigate the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on the basal and heat-evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CCRP) from nociceptors in vivo. In contrast to the excitatory effects of cytokines observed in vivo, none of the cytokines tested evoked any CCRP release at normal skin temperature of 32°C. However, the cytokines IL-1?, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 but not IL-8 induced a pronounced and transient sensitization of the heat-evoked CGRP release from nociceptors in vitro. This heat sensitization was dose dependent, with EC50 for IL-1? of 2.7 ng/mL and for TNF-α of 3.1 ng/mL. The maximum IL-1? effect reached almost 600% of the heat-evoked release, and the maximum TNF-α effect induced a rise in CGRP release of 350%. In contrast to IL-1? and TNF-α, IL-6 did not induce heat sensitization when applied alone, but was only effective in the presence of soluble IL-6 receptor. This suggests a constitutive expression of signaling receptors for TNF and IL-1? and the signal transduction molecule gp 130, but not IL-6 receptor or IL-8 receptor. Furthermore, the acute cytokine signaling observed was independent of transcriptional pathways because sensitization occurred on short latency in vitro and under conditions that excluded chemotactic accumulation of immune cells from blood vessels. Conclude that interleukins may play an important role in the initiation of heat hyperalgesia in inflammation and neuropathy. Comment by Marshall Devor, PhD. Impulses in nociceptive afferents signal pain to a conscious brain, but in addition, they have an efferent, effector role in peripheral tissue. Specifically, impulses arriving at a sensory ending may cause the release of various peptides and other potential inflammatory mediators, affecting local tissue circulation and the trophic state of the tissue. Oprée and Kress show that specific cytokines can facilitate this release by lowering the temperature required to evoke release of the calcitonin gene-related peptide. If the temperature required were lowered to basal tissue temperature, a real possibility, then the peptides would be released on a tonic basis at normal body temperature. This could be a mechanism for the disruption of normal tissue integrity in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - Phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees: an epidemiological study. (University Hospital Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands) Pain 2000;87:33?41. This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees in The Netherlands. Additionally, the relationship between phantom pain, phantom sensations, and prosthesis use in upper limb amputees was investigated. One hundred twenty-four upper limb amputees participated in the study. Subjects were asked to fill out a self-developed questionnaire scoring the following items: date, side, level, and reason of amputation, duration of experienced pain before amputation, frequencies with which phantom sensations, phantom pain, and stump pain are experienced, amount of trouble and suffering experienced, respectively, related to these sensations, type of phantom sensations, medical treatment received for phantom pain and/or stump pain, and the effects of the treatment, self medication, and prosthesis use. The response rate was 80%. The prevalence of phantom pain was 51%, of phantom sensations 76%, and of stump pain 49%; 48% of the subjects experienced phantom pain a few times per day or more. Moderate to severe suffering from phantom pain was experienced by 64% of the respondents. A significant association was found between phantom pain and phantom sensations (relative risk 11.3) and between phantom pain and stump pain (relative risk 1.9). No other factors associated with phantom pain or phantom sensations could be determined. Only 4 patients received medical treatment for their phantom pain. Phantom pain is a common problem in upper limb amputees that causes considerable suffering for the subjects involved. Only a small number of subjects are treated for phantom pain. Conclude that further research is needed to determine factors associated with phantom pain.

AB  - Use of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for the documentation of synergy between tramadol and metamizol. (Hospital Universitario del Mar, Barcelona, Spain) Br J Anaesth 2000;85:217?223. This study involved 101 posthysterectomy patients who received at the time of analgesia request (TAR) tramadol (100 mg, Group I) or metamizol (1.2 g, Group II) alone, or combined in 1:1 (Group III), 1:0.3 (Group IV), or 1:3 (Group V) ratio. After 15 min, they received the same treatment by IV patient-controlled analgesia. Pain intensity (VAS-PI), analgesic consumption, and adverse effects were assessed at TAR, and periodically for 24 h. Data were analyzed using interaction indexes and isobolograms. All treatments produced equivalent VAS-PI, percent efficacy, and adverse effects; all other treatments were addictive. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. Synergistic interactions either beneficial or adverse between analgesic drugs remains to be studied quantitatively. The authors propose a new method to quantitate such interactions; this is based on analgesic requirements (IV-PCA) and pain intensity (VAS-PI). Data were analyzed using interaction indexes and isobolograms. Isobols are graphic representations of equally effective doses of 2 or more agents. The mean doses of each drug that produces a given response are plotted on the axes of the graph. A zero interaction line (isobol) connects these isoeffective doses in the axis. Using this approach the authors studied 101 posthysterectomy patients. Patients received at the time of analgesia request (TAR) tramadol (100 mg, Group I) or metamizol (1.2 g, Group II), alone or combined 1:1 (Group III), 1:0.3 (Group IV) or 1:3 (Group V). All treatments produced equivalent VAS-PI, percent efficacy, and adverse effects. Drugs combined in 1:1 ratio synergy became evident both for the analgesic and adverse effects; all other treatments were additive.

This study describes the treatment of a 49-year-old woman who received a kidney transplant from a cadaver donor and was treated with tacrolimus. Three months later, the patient complained of severe pain in her lower limbs that affected both knees and ankles. Bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance were consistent with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. Laboratory tests that included creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, calcium, phosphate, urate, alkaline phosphatase, and parathormone were normal or near normal. Tacrolimus levels were around 13 ?g/mL. Clinical improvement appeared slowly and spontaneously during the following 3 months, without appreciable changes in the tacrolimus level. Conclude that in kidney transplant patients, tacrolimus could be a risk factor for the development of a reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.

AB  - Neurovascular decompression for idiopathic tarsal tunnel syndrome: technical note. (Fuji Brain Institute and Hospital, Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2000;69:87?90. This study evaluates the efficacy of neurovascular decompression for patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS). Twelve feet from 9 patients with idiopathic TTS were treated. The patients were aged 52?78 years (mean 64.6 years), and all of them complained of pain or dysaesthesia of the sole of the foot. The posterior tibial nerve was freed from the attached arteriovenous complex (posterior tibial artery and veins). The dissected nerve had a flattened appearance in all of the patients, suggesting nerve compression by the adjacent arteriovenous complex and superficially by the flexor retinaculum. A graft of fat was inserted as both a cushion and an antiadhesive between the vessels and the nerve to achieve neurovascular decompression. Patients on whom neurovascular decompression was performed had resolution or lessening of symptoms in their feet. Neither wound infection nor recurrence of symptoms was found during the follow-up period (mean 26.8 months). Conclude neurovascular compression syndrome plays a part in idiopathic TTS, and adding neurovascular decompression to resection of the flexor retinaculum is effective. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. The surgical outcome of idiopathic tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) has been reported less than ideal and worse than that attributable to tarsal coalition tumor or ganglion. The authors considered necessary the development of a new technique in the surgical treatment of this syndrome assuming that neurovascular compression plays a part in idiopathic TTS. They treated 12 feet from 9 patients on whom neurovascular depression with a graft of fat adding resection to the flexor retinaculum was effective for the resolution or lessening of pain and paresthesia in all cases during a mean follow-up period of 26.8 months without complications.

AB  - Pain experience of children with headache and their families: a controlled study. (University of Turku, Turku, Finland) Pediatrics 2000;106:270?275. This study reported the pain sensitivity of children with headache and their family members as well as the prevalence of recurring aches, psychosocial life, and family environment of children with headache at preschool age. A representative population-based sample of 1443 families expecting their first child was followed over 7 years. A screening questionnaire relating to the child's headache was sent to parents of a representative sample of 1132 6-year-old children. Of 144 children suffering from headache, 106 (76%) were examined and interviewed clinically. Ninety-six children (58 migraine and 38 tension-type headache children) with primary headache and matched controls were included in further examinations. Children with headache were more often extremely sensitive to pain according to their parents, were more excited about physical examinations, cried more often during blood sampling or vaccination, avoided play or games more often because they were afraid of hurting themselves, and had recurring abdominal and growing pains more often than did control children. The fathers of children with headache were more often extremely sensitive to pain. Children with headache reacted with somatic symptoms, usually with pain and functional intestinal disorders in stress situations, felt more tired, and had more ideations of death during the previous month. More mothers of tension-type headache children than those of migraine children reported that they were considerably sensitive to pain. Tension-type headache children had a poorer family environment; the family atmosphere was more often unhappy and the relationship between parents was more often distant than in families of children with migraines. Conclude that in addition to somatic factors, it is important to consider the child's pain sensitivity, reaction to various stress situations, and family functioning when studying childhood headache. The child's coping mechanisms can be supported by information given by the parents. School entry can be considered a suitable period for careful investigation into possible occurrence of headache and also for giving information about headache and its management

AB  - The effects of the single or multiple injection technique on the onset time of femoral nerve blocks with 0.75% ropivacaine. (University of Milan and IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy) Anesth Analg 2000;91:181?184. This study evaluated the effect of the injection technique on the onset time and efficacy of femoral nerve block performed with 0.75% ropivacaine. A total of 30 patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery were randomly allocated to receive femoral nerve blocakade with 0.75% ropivacaine by using either a single injection (Single group, n = 15) or multiple injection (Multiple group, n = 15). Nerve blocks were placed by using a short-beveled, Teflon-coated, stimulating needle. The stimulation frequency was set at 2 Hz, and the intensity of the stimulating current, initially set at 1 mA, was gradually decreased to <0.5 mA after each muscular twitch was observed. In the Single group, 12 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine was slowly injected, as soon as the first muscular twitch was observed. In the Multiple group, the stimulating needle was inserted and redirected, eliciting each of the following muscular twitches: contraction of vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis. At each muscular twitch, 4 mL of the study solution was injected. Placing the block required 4.2 ± 1.7 min in the Multiple group and 3.4 ± 2.2 min in the Single group (P = 0.02). Onset of nerve block required 10 ± 3.7 min in the Multiple group and 30 ± 11 min in the Single group (P < 0.0005). Propofol sedation was never required to complete surgery; although 0.1 mg fentanyl at trocar insertion was required in 2 patients of the Multiple group (13%) and 9 patients of the Single group (60%) (P = 0.02). Conclude that searching for multiple muscular twitches shortened the onset time and improved the quality of femoral nerve block performed with small volumes of 0.75% ropivacaine. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. This study is concerned with the onset of femoral nerve block utilizing 0.75% ropivacaine in 2 groups of 15 patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. The optimal site for injection was identified by the electrically evoked muscular twitch at the quadriceps. In 1 group, 12 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine was injected as soon as a muscle twitch was evoked. In the second group, 4 mL of local anesthetic was injected only after a specific response was elicited at the vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus laterallis. Onset of the nerve block required 10 ± 3.7 min. in the multiple injection group, whereas in the single group, onset of the nerve block took 30 ± 11 min. The authors concluded that searching for multiple twitches shortened the surgical anesthesia and improved the quality of neural blockade.

This report discusses the first case of zygoapophyseal joint cyst-induced radicular pain successfully treated with therapeutic selective nerve root block. A 56-year-old dentist presented with pain involving the lateral thigh, lateral calf, and foot dorsum that worsened with standing and walking. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine showed a cyst emanating from the right L4-L5 zygoapophyseal joint, resulting in central canal and lateral recess stenosis. The patient was treated with 2 fluoroscopically guided therapeutic L5 selective nerve root blocks. The patient remained pain free at 18-month follow-up.

AB  - Shoulder pain as an unusual presentation of pneumonia in a stroke patient: a case report. (University of Chicago Hospitals, Chicago, IL) Arch Med Phys Rehabil 2000;81:827?829. An 89-year-old woman with right hemiparesis secondary to ischemic lacunar infarction who developed sudden onset of right shoulder pain on the fifth day of inpatient rehabilitation is discussed in this case study. The pain was severe, limiting range of motion (ROM) and participation in therapy. Extensive investigations to rule out subluxation, fracture, connective tissue disease, RSD, and pulmonary embolism were negative. Ultimately, her shoulder pain and decreased ROM completely resolved with antibiotic treatment for right lower lobe pneumonia. Conclude that her symptoms were possibly referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation transmitted via right C4 sensory axons in the phrenic nerve, which shares the same dermatome as the right acromion area. This case was an unusual presentation of pneumonia in an elderly woman with hemiplegia. The authors recommend that pneumonia be considered in differential diagnoses of shoulder pain.
