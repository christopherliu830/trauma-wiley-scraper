AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Summary A 74-year-old woman presented with an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titre-negative, treatment-responsive Wegener's granulomatosis confined to the integument. She initially presented with a painful left postauricular nodulo-ulcerative lesion with chronically discharging sinuses. This lesion was effectively treated with a short, 3-month course of cyclophosphamide and 24 months of oral prednisone. After 5 months in remission, she developed further similar ulcers, in addition to painless nodules on her ankles and feet bilaterally. These lesions resolved with an extra 32 months of high-dose oral prednisone therapy before complete remission. At most recent review, there was no evidence of disease recurrence 21 months after ceasing all active treatment. Histology demonstrated a granulomatous inflammation. No systemic disease progression to the upper respiratory tract, lung or kidney was detected. This case highlights the importance of being aware of atypical or partial presentations of Wegener's granulomatosis. This diagnosis needs to be considered with patients presenting with a culture-negative chronic ulcer, where malignancy and trauma have been excluded. This will avoid unnecessary surgery and ensure early diagnosis and effective treatment of a disease that is disfiguring and usually fatal if inappropriately treated.

PY  - 2019
AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the interpretation of radiographs and blood tests from a rheumatological perspective. Multi-system disease implies concurrent signs and symptoms in multiple organ systems. Its identification is often followed by tests to exclude infections and malignancy since their treatment and prognosis varies. The diagnostic pathway then goes down the route of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). SARDs include conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and connective tissue diseases like systemic lupus erythematosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitides and so on. This diagnosis often involves treatment with potent immunosuppressive drugs which, if an infection has not been excluded can cause serious harm. Focusing on the bones, one will have to look for evidence of demineralisation, erosions, joint space narrowing and new bone formation, for example osteophytes.

AB  - Abstract Background Mediastinitis following pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with significantly high morbidity and mortality. Method In our review, 21 studies from 1986 to 2011 (12 retrospective studies, eight prospective studies, and a multi-institutional study) including 44,693 pediatric cardiac patients were analyzed. Results and Conclusion Younger age, malnutrition, preoperative respiratory tract infection, high American anesthesiology score, longer duration of surgery, prolonged ventilation, and ICU stay were definite risk factors for mediastinitis. Early primary closure over drains, vacuum-assisted closure, muscle flap, and omental flap remain the most frequently performed treatments for post-sternotomy mediastinitis. Vacuum-assisted closure has emerged as the technique of choice in recent years. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12243 (J Card Surg 2014;29:74-82)

AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - Spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) N Engl J Med 2000;343:618?624. This randomized trial involved patients who had had reflex sympathetic dystrophy for at least 6 months. Thirty-six patients were assigned to receive treatment with spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy, and 18 were assigned to receive physical therapy alone. The spinal cord stimulator was implanted only if test stimulation was successful. The intensity of pain was assessed (on a visual-analogue scale from 0 cm [no pain] to 10 cm [very severe pain]), as well as the global perceived effect (on a scale from 1 [worst ever] to 7 [best ever]), functional status, and the health-related quality of life. The test stimulation of the spinal cord was successful in 24 patients; the other 12 patients did not receive implanted stimulators. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the group assigned to receive spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy had a mean reduction of 2.4 cm in the intensity of pain at 6 months, as compared with an increase of 0.2 cm in the group assigned to receive physical therapy alone (P < 0.001 for comparison between the 2 groups). In addition, the proportion of patients with a score of 6 (?much improved?) for the global perceived effect was much higher in the spinal cord stimulation group than in the control group (39% vs. 6%, P = 0.01). There was no clinically important improvement in functional status. The health-related quality of life improved only in the 24 patients who actually underwent implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Six of the 24 patients had complications that required additional procedures, including removal of the device in 1 patient. Conclude in carefully selected patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy, electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life. Conmment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a well-written article describing a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which is also known as complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I). The results show clearly that in carefully selected patients suffering from this pain syndrome, SCS can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life compared to patients treated only with physical therapy. Functional status did not improve in either group of patients as SCS treats pain, but not the disease itself. The authors note that the improvement in the overall score for health-related quality of life was derived mainly from the alleviation of pain as in the study population, pain was the primary source of distress. This study represents a major reference for pain doctors and neurosurgeons treating CRPS and chronic pain.

AB  - Microinvasive transaxillary thoracoscopic sympathectomy: technical note. (Presbyterian University Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA) Neurosurgery 2000;46:1254?1258. This report describes a two-port transaxillary thoracoscopic approach for thoracic sympathectomy that maximizes working space, improves manipulative ability, and enhances visualization of the surgical field. Positioning of the patients was optimized to displace the scapula posteriorly, widen the avenue of approach to the sympathetic ganglia, and create a more direct route to the target. The semi-Fowler position permitted the lung apex to fall away from mediastinal structures, obviating a separate retraction port. A 30-degree endoscope allowed an unobstructed view of surgical progress, and anatomic relationships were manipulated in a temporal sequence to facilitate dissection. Microinvasive transaxillary sympathectomy was performed successfully in 13 patients, all of whom had a good outcome without complications. Conclude the modifications implemented increase the speed and safety of thoracoscopic sympathectomy while minimizing complications. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. Thoracic sympathectomy is an accepted means of treating hyperhidrosis, Raynaud's disease, causalgia major and other autonomically mediated syndromes. The authors describe a two-port transaxillary thoracoscopic approach that maximizes working space, improves manipulative ability, and enhances visualization of the surgical field, advocating a lateral decubitus semi-Fowler position. A total of 13 patients were treated, 11 with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I)) and 2 with palmar hyperhidrosis. Interestingly, the authors excellent outcomes for CRPS I, not reflecting the experience of most practitioners. Thoracoscopic sympathectomy is evolving quickly since first described by Klux in 1951. From a technical standpoint, the authors describe a useful procedure of endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy that is worthy of further investigation as the series is limited to only 13 patients and in a larger series come complications would be encountered.

AB  - The emergency department (ED) is at the front line of hospital pressure injury (PI) prevention, yet ED clinicians must balance many competing clinical priorities in the care of seriously ill patients. This paper presents the current biomechanical and clinical evidence and management considerations to assist EDs to continue to develop and implement evidence-based PI prevention protocols for the high-risk emergency/trauma patient. The prevention of hospital-acquired pressure injuries has received significant focus internationally over many years because of the additional burden that these injuries place on the patient, the additional costs and impact to the efficiency of the hospital, and the potential for litigation. The development of a PI is the result of a complex number of biomechanical, physiological, and environmental interactions. Our understanding of the interaction of these factors has improved significantly over the past 10 years. We have demonstrated that large reductions in PI incidence rates can be achieved in critical care and general hospital wards through the application of advanced evidence-based prevention protocols and believe that further improvement can be achieved through the application of these approaches in the ED.

AB  - Summary At least 1 in 10 deaths in the older population are caused by infectious disease. The commonest infections are urinary tract infection, pneumonia and cellulitis. Susceptibility to infection increases due to changes in the immune system, exposure to pathogens in hospitals and care institutions, frailty and decreased physiological reserve. Infection often presents with a change in mental and functional status rather than typical signs of localised infection. Antibiotic stewardship is important in the older adult due to the risks of drug side effects and interactions, antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Particular features of this chapter include: Recognising atypical presentations of infection and sepsis in older people Investigations in the older person with a suspected urinary tract infection Differential diagnoses of cellulitis Indications to consider escalation of care

AB  - Figure?1 Outcomes following infusion at 4 weeks and 6 months?Group mean scores Purpose of the study:? A prospective before and after audit to assess the outcome following ketamine infusions for chronic pain at 4 weeks and 6 months following treatment. Methods:? After ethics committee approval data relating to demographics, pain scores and SF-36 Health surveys were collected pre, 4 weeks post and 6 months post infusion for all patients admitted for inpatient ketamine infusions over a 12-month period. All numerical data were analysed using Wilcoxon's Signed Ranks test. Differences were considered significant at P?<?0.05. Results:? ?? 14 patients (10 female, 4 male: median age 35 years, range 25?65 years). Low back pain (n?=?8), CRPS upper limb (n?=?2), CRPS lower limb (n?=?1), neck pain (n?=?1), shoulder pain (n?=?1), pelvic pain (n?=?1). ?? 14 patients were followed up at 4 weeks, one lost to follow-up at 6 months. ?? Median infusion duration of 6 days (range 3?10 days). ?? Maximum infusion rate?median of 20?mg/hour (range 12?32?mg/hour). ?? One infusion terminated due to dysphoric side effects. ?? VAS (visual analogue score)?decreased a median 63% (range 0?100%) or median 4/10 (95% CI 2/10?6/10) by the conclusion of the infusion. ?? Average weekly VAS prior to infusion had decreased by 20% (range 0?80%) or a median of 2.5/10 (95% CI 1/10?4/10) at 4 weeks post infusion. ?? Average VAS had decreased by a median 10% at 6 months (range 0?71%) which was not significant. Conclusions:? This small heterogeneous group of chronic pain patients demonstrated baseline SF-36 scores 1.5?2 standard deviations below the US population mean of 50 across all scales, indicating disabling global ill health. Ketamine infusions were generally well tolerated and produced significant reductions in reported pain scores by the end of treatment. Pain reduction had diminished by 4 weeks, however there remained a significant improvement in several scales particularly those relating to mental health. This raises the possibility that ketamine may exert a short to medium term anti-depressant effect. There was no significant improvement in any measure at 6 months.

AB  - Abstract Objective To study the joint distribution and 2-year outcome of patients with recent-onset monoarthritis. Methods Adult patients with clinically apparent monoarthritis of ≤16 weeks? duration were included in a multi-center 2-year longitudinal study. Clinical characteristics, joint distribution, development of chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease (CIRD), as well as classification according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (2010 RA criteria) were studied. Predictors for development of CIRD were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results The knee (49.3%), ankle (16.7%) and wrist (14.1%) were the most frequently affected joints among the 347 included patients. Ninety-one patients (26.2%) developed CIRD during follow-up; 21 (6.1%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and 16 (4.6%) with psoriatic arthritis. Longer duration of joint swelling, joint localization, and ACPA- and RF positivity were independent predictors of CIRD. Six of 58 (10.3%) patients with ankle monoarthritis and 21 of 49 (42.9%) patients with wrist monoarthritis developed CIRD during follow-up. The 2010 RA criteria captured all patients diagnosed with seropositive RA at an early stage, mostly within three months. Conclusion Approximately one-fourth of patients with recent-onset monoarthritis developed CIRD over 2 years. Patients presenting with ankle arthritis rarely developed CIRD, whereas patients presenting with wrist arthritis more frequently did so. Longer duration of joint swelling and ACPA- and RF positivity were also predictive of CIRD. Our findings facilitate early identification of monoarthritis patients with unfavorable prognosis.
