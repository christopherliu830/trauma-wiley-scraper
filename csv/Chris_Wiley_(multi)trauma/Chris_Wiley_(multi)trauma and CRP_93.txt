AB  - Purpose? To evaluate children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy treated with botulinum toxin A (Botox)injections to assist with the management of contracted muscles and joints as well as co-contraction. Methods? Since September 2004, 20 children have been treated. The median age at treatment was 2.1 years (range 7 months to 11 years). As experience was gained, the total dose of Botox increased from 4 to 10 units per kg. Results? 12 patients were treated primarily for restriction of passive external rotation at the shoulder at an average age of 24 months (range 7 to 42 months). This group had the most impressive gains which became apparent within a week of injection. There was a high level of parental satisfaction with an improvement in passive range and increased ease of physiotherapy. Six had excellent and 4 had good results. The two patients who had little improvement had clear indications for surgery. Seven (58%) of these 12 patients went on to have a repeat injection , in 2 cases with a higher dose, aiming to achieve further gains. Five patients were treated for co-contraction of the latissimus dorsi and/or teres major were aged 8 months and from 8 to 11 years. They reported minor gains.All five patients who had triceps injections had improved elbow flexion. One patient had an over active biceps injected with minor benefit. Conclusion? It is hoped that persistent physiotherapy assisted by botulinum toxin A injections targeting internal rotators can reduce gleno-humoral joint dysplasia, posterior subluxation and the need for open procedures. Shoulder subluxation identified by ultrasound should be further imaged with CT or MRI and be considered for an open procedure.

AB  - The hand is one of the most commonly injured parts of the body, however in a climate of increasingly reduced anatomical teaching, junior doctors are ill equipped to assess and describe hand injuries they encounter in their Emergency Department rotations. Hand and Plastic surgery registrars are often very busy and can find it time consuming to extract the information they require from junior doctors. Their workload can be managed significantly more effectively with clear, concise and accurate descriptions of hand injuries. This study was designed to assess the effect of a visual ?hand chart? on junior doctor's assessment and description of common hand injuries. The chart illustrates basic underlying anatomical structures and their relevant surface landmarks, together with the appropriate anatomical terms to describe them. Two groups of 25 junior doctors were tested. Group A were shown a set of 10 digital images of simple hand injuries and asked to transcribe what they would say to the on call hand surgeon. Group B were given the visual ?hand chart? and tested in a similar fashion with the same set of images. Group A was later retested with the ?hand chart? and a second set of 10 images. Simple demographic information was also collected from participants asking their year since graduation and any prior experience with hand surgery. A marking key was used to score participants answers and the results were analysed using the students t-test. Significant differences were found between the groups suggesting that the hand chart was a valuable aid in communication. It may thus prove useful in wider contexts, such as remote and rural medical stations.
