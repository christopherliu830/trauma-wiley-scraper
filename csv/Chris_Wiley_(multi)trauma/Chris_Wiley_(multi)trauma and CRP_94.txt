AB  - The hand is one of the most commonly injured parts of the body, however in a climate of increasingly reduced anatomical teaching, junior doctors are ill equipped to assess and describe hand injuries they encounter in their Emergency Department rotations. Hand and Plastic surgery registrars are often very busy and can find it time consuming to extract the information they require from junior doctors. Their workload can be managed significantly more effectively with clear, concise and accurate descriptions of hand injuries. This study was designed to assess the effect of a visual ?hand chart? on junior doctor's assessment and description of common hand injuries. The chart illustrates basic underlying anatomical structures and their relevant surface landmarks, together with the appropriate anatomical terms to describe them. Two groups of 25 junior doctors were tested. Group A were shown a set of 10 digital images of simple hand injuries and asked to transcribe what they would say to the on call hand surgeon. Group B were given the visual ?hand chart? and tested in a similar fashion with the same set of images. Group A was later retested with the ?hand chart? and a second set of 10 images. Simple demographic information was also collected from participants asking their year since graduation and any prior experience with hand surgery. A marking key was used to score participants answers and the results were analysed using the students t-test. Significant differences were found between the groups suggesting that the hand chart was a valuable aid in communication. It may thus prove useful in wider contexts, such as remote and rural medical stations.

AB  - The function of the replanted parts can be improved if attention to reconstruction techniques is carried out. These reconstructive techniques are: 1) adequate debridement and shortening, 2) stable skeletal fixation, 3) strengthened tendon repairs, 4) quality nerve repair, 5) extensive vascular anastomosis, 6) complete skin coverable, and 7) Early intensive active rehabilitation. 1)? The debridement should be generous and the shortening judicious. More than 50% of the skin should be in direct contact, and direct anastomosis of some of vessels should be possible. 2)? The skeletal stabilization should be of good very quality that will allow free mobilization of the joints. 3)? The repair of the tendons should take advantage of the excess length for a strengthen repair. Some degree of active mobilization should be make possible. 4)? Primary nerve grafting or nerve transfer should be considered if there is loss of nerve length. 5)? Vascular repair should be on the basis of as many as possible the number of arteries and veins that can be found for anastomosis. 6)? Any residual skin defect should be planned for a proper resurfacing within the next 5 to 10 days. 7)? Early intensive active rehabilitation should be prescribed. Gradual active ROM for tendon gliding should be instituted with in the first week. The function of the replanted digit and hand has continued to improve with the reconstructive approach. With further experience the reconstructive approach can be done in all cases with confidence.

AB  - In the year 2000 a surgical service for infants with obstetric brachial plexus palsy commenced at Middlemore Hospital in Auckland. This remains the only service available in New Zealand with the two founding surgeons remaining as its current providers. We present the seven-year history of this service, the lessons learned from both primary and secondary reconstructive procedures and consider the direction for future treatment.

AB  - Purpose? To evaluate patients with cerebral palsy treated with botulinum toxin A injections to assist with the management of contracted muscles and joints as well as co-contraction. Methods? Since 1998, 40 limbs have been treated. The average age was 14 years (range 4 to 33 years) and the average dose given was 107 units (range 50 to 200 units). Digital flexors were injected in 26 limbs, elbow flexors in 18, wrist flexors in 17, thumb adductors in 13, pronator teres in 9, intrinsics in 3, shoulder abductors in 2 and ECU in one limb. All patients were injected under a general anaesthetic, allowing for an assessment of fixed contractures. Padded plaster casts were applied, putting the injected muscles on full stretch before the reversal of anaesthesia and were maintained for approximately 3 weeks. Thermoplastic splits were then wore 23?hrs per day for a further three weeks. Splints were serially modified to achieve progressively more extension as the flexion contractures were corrected. Simultaneous surgical procedures such as tendon lengthening and transfers were performed in 14 limbs. Results? The results in the elbow flexors were disappointing. The finger, thumb and wrist flexors have responded extremely well, despite fixed flexion deformities being documented under anaesthesia in the majority of patients. Conclusion? It is estimated that the muscle bellies have been elongated by 3 to 4?cm either by the lengthening of, or addition to the sarcomeres. The results in these patients are vastly superior to that which could be obtained surgically.

AB  - Congenital hand is a complex and vast subject therefore classification is very necessary for the purpose of teaching, communication and guide treatment. The first comprehensive and yet user friendly classification was proposed by Swanson et al. in 1976. This classification based on etiopathogenic is popularly known as the ?IFSSH 7 groups classification?. (I) Failure of formation: transverse or longitudinal (II) Failure of differentiation (III) Polydactyly (IV) Overgrowth (V) Undergrowth (VI) Amniotic band syndrome (VII) Generalized skeletal syndromes. However this classification was found not able to satisfactorily classify 20?30% of cases. Other classifications based on genetic defects, teratogenic sequence and syndromics were being introduced previously and continue to be used parallel with the IFSSH classification. Furthermore the classification continue to be besieged by multiple morphological types of deformity in a same hand. Ogino introduced the JSSH expanded classification to address some of the deficiencies of the IFSSH classification. For a beginner in treating congenital hand, it is indeed daunting, as the variations in morphology, the degree of severity and functional deficit even in the same diagnosis can be very different. It is usual to find further sub classifications. For the purpose of guiding treatment, I propose the concept of deformity/ deficiency index. Group I) The imbalance/ small in size II) Extra digits III) Mal positioned/ Mal-aligned IV) Poor/ No function V) Total absent. The residual functional decreases from group I to V. And similarly the reconstruction becomes complex and difficult.
