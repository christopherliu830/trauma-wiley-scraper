AB  - Abstract Aim A spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare paediatric bacterial infection, with possible devastating neurological sequelae. We explored localisation in the cervical segment, which is unusual, but more dangerous, than other SEAs. Methods We describe 22 cases (12 male) of paediatric SEAs without risk factors: 21 from a literature search from 2000 to 2017 and a 30-month-old boy with a spontaneous cervical SEA due to Group A Streptococcus. Results The average age was eight years and the symptoms were mainly fever, back pain and motor deficit, with an aetiological diagnosis in 68%. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in six patients, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in two, Staphylococcus aureus with unknown susceptibility patterns in three and Group A Streptococcus in four. All patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and most abscesses were localised in the thoracic and lumbar areas. More than half (59%) underwent surgery to remove pus and granulation tissue and nine were just treated with antimicrobial therapy for an average of 5.3 weeks. Most patients had good outcomes. Conclusion SEAs were underestimated in children due to the rarity and spectrum of differential diagnoses. Timely diagnosis, immediate antibiotics, spinal magnetic resonance imaging and prompt neurosurgical consultations were essential for favourable outcomes.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? We wish to report the case of a 5-year-old boy who had an interscalene catheter placed under ultrasound guidance. There is low level evidence to support the use of ultrasound when performing peripheral nerve blocks in adults and children. We will discuss the technique and an unusual complication with the catheter. Methods:? A 5-year-old, 20 kilogram, ASA I child was scheduled for a humeral osteotomy. Following induction of general anaesthesia an interscalene catheter was placed using both a nerve stimulator and ultrasound guidance. The catheter threaded easily and a dose of 7?ml 0.5% Ropivicaine was injected down the catheter, followed by another 3?ml at the end of surgery. Results:? The child had a successful sensory block and required only simple analgesia (oral paracetamol and ibuprofen) post-operatively. Of interest we were unable to elicit appropriate muscle twitches with the nerve stimulator despite good visualization of the brachial plexus and needle with the ultrasound. In addition, after a short period post-operatively we were unable to inject local anaesthetic down the catheter and it was subsequently removed. Following removal we found blood clot occluding all but one of the catheter side holes. Conclusions:? Ultrasound guidance was used to place an interscalene catheter in a 5-year-old?to date, the smallest child having this procedure in our hospital. Although the block was successful the catheter became occluded by clot. We have been unable to find other reports of this problem in the literature. Using ultrasound has the potential to reduce the risk of complications when placing interscalene catheters, particularly in children. Furthermore, this case illustrates that the use of a nerve stimulator may not guarantee adequate localization of the nerves during neural blockade.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? The mechanism of tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase is unknown. We determined the effect of bolus and continuous intravenously administered fentanyl on blood pressure and heart rate changes during in upper and lower limb surgeries under general anesthesia. Methods:? This study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee and was performed in a randomised and prospective fashion. Patients were divided into three groups: patients in GOP group (n?=?5) received no fentanyl throughout anaesthesia, patients in GOPF-B group (n?=?5) received bolus infusion of fentanyl 200?300?µg after tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase appeared apparently and in patients in AOPF-C group (n?=?5) received continuous infusion of fentanyl at the rate of 1?3?µg/kg/h to maintain the effect site concentration (Ce) of 1.5?2.0?ng/ml. Anesthesia was maintained with N2O 33% in oxygen or Air 50% in oxygen and propofol was target-controlled infused with Diprifusor at Ce of 2.5?3.5?µg/ml .Fentanyl Ce was simulated with Palmacokinetics developed by S.Uchida (National Cardiovascular Center). BIS was monitored in all patients and maintained at 40?60. Results:? In GOP group tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase appeared 45?60 minutes after the start of tourniquet inflation. In GOPF-B group, tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase was attenuated apparently after fentanyl was bolus administered. In GOPF-C group, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and BIS showed no statistically significant changes between 15 minutes and 90 minutes after the start of tourniquet inflation (P?<?0.05). Conclusions:? Both bolus and continuous intravenously administered fentanyl were effective to attenuate tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase. It is the first report of determining intravenously administered fentanyl, one of ?-opioids, was effective to attenuate tourniquet-induced blood pressure and heart rate increases under general anesthesia.

AB  - Background Spinal tuberculosis is the most common form of musculoskeletal tuberculosis. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is increased in cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. MMP-1 plays a curial role in extracellular matrix degradation during the progression of tuberculosis. Although the 1G/2G polymorphism in MMP-1-1607 influences its transcription, its role in spinal tuberculosis remains unknown. Methods Healthy controls and patients with spinal tuberculosis of Han ethnicity were recruited between January 2010 and May 2016. The MMP-1-1607 1G/2G polymorphism was genotyped using the Sequenom mass Array polymorphism analysis system. Results The genotypes of 1G/1G, 1G/2G, and 2G/2G were found in 13.7%, 53.6%, and 32.8% of patients, and 12.2%, 37.4%, and 50.4% of controls, respectively. The 1G/2G genotype were more common in cases than in controls (P=2.05E-04). The 1G allele showed an association with an increased risk for spinal tuberculosis when compared to 2G allele (P=.004). 1G genotypes, having at least one 1G allele, were associated with the risk of developing spinal tuberculosis (1G/1G+1G/2G vs 2G/2G: OR=2.084, 95%CI=1.401-3.100, P=2.65E-04). Conclusion 1G genotypes of the MMP-1-1607 may be associated with susceptibility to spinal tuberculosis in Southern Chinese Han population.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? Use of controlled release morphine for chronic non-cancer pain has risen greatly during the last decade. The literature provides evidence of its efficacy in the short term but is more equivocal for long-term use. In the light of the limited evidence base, the potential problems associated with long term opioid use, the placebo responsiveness of pain, and the difficulty of generalizing randomised controlled trials on heterogenous populations to individual patients, the authors felt that single subject (N of 1) trials may be a useful means by which patients and health professionals could make clinical judgements. We also felt that conducting N of 1 trials with multiple crossovers on a medication with frequent side effects and abstinence symptoms presented specific methodological challenges worthy of review. Methods:? Patients taking regular opioids prior to the trial were withdrawn in an open label fashion and were opioid free for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to a single crossover open label trial. This was followed by a titration phase in which patients were commenced at 10?mg twice daily of controlled release morphine (MS Contin) and were allowed to increase the dose to as high as 50?mg twice daily, to a level at which clinical improvements were noted without significant side effects. The open and double blind trials were then conducted at this dose. Pain, sleep, an overall measure of helpfulness, depression, anxiety, stress and activity interference were all measured during the second of each two-week period. In those with significant improvements on the open label trial, a four crossover, double blind randomized controlled trial, lasting a total of 16 weeks, was undertaken, with measures taken in the second week of each period. Patients, naïve to regular opioid use prior to the study, moved straight to the open label trial. Results:? Seventeen patients were enrolled in the study, and ten completed the randomized controlled trial. Three patients, one of whom was taking regular opioids prior to the commencement of the study, withdrew from the trial after the open label crossover because of a lack of benefits on the controlled release morphine and side effects. A further four patients withdrew during the double blind component of the single subject trial, two because of recurrent abstinence symptoms with each rotation to placebo, one because of increased pain levels on placebo, and one because of side effects as well as unrecognised recurrent withdrawals. A further three, of the ten patients who completed the trial suffered from significant withdrawal symptoms with each rotation placebo. In each case of recurrent withdrawals the patients had been taking regular opioids for prolonged periods prior to entering the study. Four of the six patients did not recognize their withdrawal symptoms as such, including abstinence related pain. All results of the double blind trials were recorded at significant levels of greater than .01 because of the multiple outcomes and comparisons. In spite of the universal use of stool softeners, seven of the ten patients who completed the trial had more side effects on the active rotations compared to placebo. The combination of withdrawal symptoms and side effects meant that nine of the ten (90%) subjects who completed the trial were effectively unblinded. Seven of the ten (70%) patients had significant reductions in pain, of whom six chose to continue on opioids. One chose to withdraw because of significant side effects demonstrated in the trial, although the difference only reached the .05 level. Five of the ten (50%) showed significant improvements in sleep. In all cases those patients with improved sleep also showed significant reductions in pain. Seven out of the ten patients had significant improvements in overall measures of helpfulness (the same patients who had significant reductions in pain). Conclusions:? Whilst the general principles of N of 1 trials can usefully be applied to opioid use in chronic non-cancer pain a number of limitations have been demonstrated. Firstly, in the absence of an ?active? placebo blinding is limited because of side effects. Secondly, abstinence symptoms were common in spite of the multiple crossovers and the limited time on the opioid using this study design. Both issues would potentially favour positive results in the trial. Despite explanation of the possibility of abstinence symptoms, as part of the consenting process to the study, subjects commonly attributed them to unrelated illness or underlying pain. It is our opinion that multiple crossover placebo N of 1 trials are inappropriate for controlled release morphine because of the frequency and severity of abstinence symptoms.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To investigate the transfer of rac-tramadol and its rac-O-desmethyl metabolite into transitional milk, to estimate the absolute and relative infant doses via milk, and to assess unwanted effects in the breastfed infant. Methods:? Tramadol HCl (100?mg six hourly) was administered to 75 breastfeeding mothers for postoperative analgesia on days 2?4 after caesarian section. Three samples of transitional milk and one of plasma were collected over 6?14 h following the 4th dose. Tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Milk/plasma ratio (M/P) was calculated, and absolute infant dose and relative infant dose were calculated by standard methods. The behavioral characteristics of the exposed breastfed infants and a matched control group of infants not exposed to tramadol were also studied. Results:? Mean (95% CI) M/P was 2.2 (2.0?2.4) for tramadol and 2.8 (2.5?3.1) for O-desmethyltramadol. Average concentrations in milk across a 6 h dose interval at steady-state were 748 (681?815) mcg l?1 for tramadol and 203 (188?217) mcg l?1for O-desmethyltramadol. Estimated absolute and relative infant doses were 112 (102?122) mcg?kg?1 day?1 and 30 (28?32) mcg?kg?1 day?1, and 2.24 (2.04?2.44)% and 0.64 (0.59?0.69)% for tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol respectively. The exposed infants and control breastfed infants had similar characteristics, including Apgar scores at birth and Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores (NACS) on days 3?4 after birth. Conclusions:? The absolute infant doses for tramadol and its active metabolite combined were around 14% of the child therapeutic dose for tramadol. The combined relative infant dose of 2.88% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose was also low. The similarity of NACS in exposed infants and controls suggests that there were no clinically significant effects on infant well-being. We conclude that short-term maternal use of tramadol during establishment of lactation is safe for the breastfed infant.
