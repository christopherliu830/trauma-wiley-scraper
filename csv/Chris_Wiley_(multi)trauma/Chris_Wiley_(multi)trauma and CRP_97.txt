AB  - Background Spinal tuberculosis is the most common form of musculoskeletal tuberculosis. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is increased in cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. MMP-1 plays a curial role in extracellular matrix degradation during the progression of tuberculosis. Although the 1G/2G polymorphism in MMP-1-1607 influences its transcription, its role in spinal tuberculosis remains unknown. Methods Healthy controls and patients with spinal tuberculosis of Han ethnicity were recruited between January 2010 and May 2016. The MMP-1-1607 1G/2G polymorphism was genotyped using the Sequenom mass Array polymorphism analysis system. Results The genotypes of 1G/1G, 1G/2G, and 2G/2G were found in 13.7%, 53.6%, and 32.8% of patients, and 12.2%, 37.4%, and 50.4% of controls, respectively. The 1G/2G genotype were more common in cases than in controls (P=2.05E-04). The 1G allele showed an association with an increased risk for spinal tuberculosis when compared to 2G allele (P=.004). 1G genotypes, having at least one 1G allele, were associated with the risk of developing spinal tuberculosis (1G/1G+1G/2G vs 2G/2G: OR=2.084, 95%CI=1.401-3.100, P=2.65E-04). Conclusion 1G genotypes of the MMP-1-1607 may be associated with susceptibility to spinal tuberculosis in Southern Chinese Han population.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? Flupirtine is an established clinical analgesic for mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain states. It has recently been shown to be a KCNQ 2?3 potassium channel opener. These experiments were performed to see if this property could be useful in treating more severe pain states characterised by central sensitisation with the drug either given alone or in combination with morphine. Methods:? Experiments were performed in rats in an observer blinded fashion with vehicle controls. Non sedating doses of flupirtine, morphine and combinations containing both drugs were defined using the rotarod technique. Dose response relationships were determined for non sedating doses of both drugs given alone and together in combination in causing antinociception in three nociception paradigms: electrical pain; carrageenan paw inflammation; streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy. Results:? Flupirtine and morphine when given alone caused slight to moderate antinociception in all three paradigms. Flupirtine also caused significant increases in morphine antinociception in all three models. In carrageenan paw inflammation complete reversal of carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia was caused by 10?mg/kg flupirtine in combination with 0.4?mg/kg morphine. These doses of the two drugs were ineffective when given alone but the combination caused complete antinociception in this model of inflammatory pain. In the diabetic neuropathy model (see figure) morphine 3.2?mg/kg given alone caused significant antinociception but the size of that response was significantly less than that caused by a lower dose of morphine (1.6?mg/kg shown to be ineffective when it was given alone) given in combination with flupirtine 10?mg/kg (p?<?0.001; one way ANOVA). Conclusions:? Flupirtine should be investigated as an adjunct analgesic with opioids for the management of patients with severe pain states involving central sensitization.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? This study was designed to provide data on the efficacy, dose response, incidence and duration of adverse effects of flupirtine in the treatment of cancer-related neuropathic pain. Methods:? This was an 8-day, open label, dose escalation study of inpatients in a palliative care unit. After ethics committee approval, patients with moderate to severe neuropathic pain in spite of opioid treatment received an initial dose of flupirtine 100?mg four times daily (QID). This dose could be escalated by 100?mg QID every 2 days to a maximum of 300?mg QID. Efficacy measures included: 11 point scales measuring average pain and worst pain; a neuropathic pain discriminant score; 11 point scales for quality of life activities and a score of percentage pain relief (0?100%). Results:? Ten Patients were recruited into the study; only one patient was withdrawn because of side effects thought to be due to the flupirtine. There were significant reductions of average pain (p?=?0.0008), worst pain (p?=?0.0168) and neuropathic pain discriminant scores (p?<?0.0001; see figure). There were also significant improvements in the quality of life measures (p?=?0.0017), a reduction of adverse symptoms (p?=?0.0017) and an increase in percentage pain relief (p?=?0.0078). Additionally there occurred a statistically non-significant downward trend in opioid use. Eight patients elected to continue to take flupirtine after the trial, two taking 200?mg QID and the others 100?mg QID. Of these eight, six said that flupirtine was of considerable help and two said that it helped only a little. Conclusions:? Flupirtine is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by cancer when used in combination with opioids. This compound merits further investigation for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with other etiologies.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify problems in the biopsychosocial model when applied to people in pain and to explore a resolution. Methods:? Critical analysis of the literature concerning the theory and application of biopsychosocial models to the practice of pain medicine Results:? The biopsychosocial model for understanding illness has generated the IASP definition of pain, two simpler conceptual frameworks, and three explanatory schemata for pain. However, in the absence of a theory of living systems that seeks to understand how the different domains of these schemata interact with each other, these attempts have been caught in circular argument and have been unable to transcend either biomedical reductionism or the perpetuation of body-mind dualism. In particular, the implication that pain is a ?thing? separate and distinct from the body not only bears little relationship to the lived experience of pain but also emphasises the inherent problem that arises when an observer attempts to reduce the experience of the pain of ?the other? to predictable parameters. Conclusions:? The self-referentiality of living systems (through their qualities of autopoiesis, non-centrality and negentropy) sees pain ?emerge? in unpredictable ways that defy any reduction of the lived experience to any particular ?thing.? Pain therefore constitutes an aporia,a space and presence that deny us access to its secrets. We suggest a project in which pain may be approached in the clinical encounter through the engagement of two autonomous self-referential beings from which new therapeutic possibilities can arise. We see three challenges to be met in this project: to accept that the pain of another person is irreducible to its neuronal correlates; to acknowledge all the principles which characterise autonomous biological systems; and to allow a rapprochement between the world of the clinician and the world of the person in pain.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? Endogenous opioid peptides such as methionine enkephalin (ME) and neuropeptides such as substance P (SP) are involved in modulating pain sensitive neurons. Recent studies have used human peripheral tissue such as dental pulp to investigate the effects whether inflammation and decay affect neuropeptide levels, this study investigates whether ME and SP levels are altered in inflamed human tooth pulp. Methods:? After Ethics Committee approval, ME and SP were extracted in 250?µl of 0.5M acetic acid from the tooth pulp of 8 patients: 4 with healthy pulps and 4 with inflamed pulps. We used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC?MS) to detect changes in peptide concentration in the extracts. Peptide levels were compared to standard curves for each peptide, each sample was run in triplicate. Results:? Both ME (1.20?ng/µl) and SP (1.86?ng/µl) were present in healthy pulp, and the levels of both peptides were significantly increased in inflamed tissue (4.37?ng/µl) for ME and 6.90?ng/µl for SP (P?=?0.029 and P?<?0.001 for ME and SP respectively). Figure?1 illustrates the changes in peptide levels in inflammation compared to a healthy status. 1 Graph shows the concentration of ME and SP in both experimental groups (n?=?8). *Significant difference compared inflamed with control group (P?=?0.029 for ME and P?<?0.001 for SP). Conclusions:? Inflammation in teeth can lead to severe pain in patients. We have, for the first time, identified an elevation of an endogenous opioid in inflamed human teeth, providing further evidence for endogenous analgesic mechanisms that may be therapeutically manipulated.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To evaluate the acceptability of a disposable patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) device (Go Medical Industries, Subiaco, Western Australia) by questionnaire. Methods:? Institution ethical approval was obtained. Twenty female patients requiring post operative intravenous analgesia for open abdominal surgery were prospectively recruited. Fifty members of the nursing staff and 15 anaesthesia personnel who were familiar with the device were also asked to complete a questionnaire. Data were entered onto a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2002) and the findings analysed by an independent biostatistician. Results:? Completed questionnaires were received from 20 patients (response rate 100%); 11 anaesthetists (73%) and 41 nurses (82%). Satisfaction with the device was high, with 50% of medical staff having a satisfaction score of 80 or more and 50% of patients and nursing staff a satisfaction score of 90 or more. Patients gave median scores of 10 (0?10 scale) for ?ease of use? and ?willingness to use again.? Features most liked were portability and ease of use (reported by 73% and 46% of anaesthetists and 44% and 27% of nurses). Anaesthetists most disliked equipment failure and lack of tamper proofing (55% and 36% respectively) and nurses lack of reliability, slow filling and difficulty assembling (all 12%). Conclusions:? The Go Medical PCIA device provides a lightweight portable option for post operative patient controlled analgesia. It is simple to use, is associated with high staff and patient satisfaction, but has some limitations.

AB  - The National Prescribing Service (NPS) in collaboration with State DUE Groups is undertaking a quality improvement initiative aimed at improving Acute PostOperative Pain management (the APOP project) in 63 Australian hospitals. Following discussions between NPS and ANZCA, it was decided to undertake a national survey of key acute pain service (APS) contacts to aid development of educational messages for the APOP project. The ANZCA Trials Group research co-ordinator and NPS supported survey development and processing. Purpose of the study:? To gain an understanding of what expert acute pain service clinicians see as common prescribing errors and poor pain management practice in the postoperative patient, and to investigate the degree of consensus which exists for specific aspects of basic analgesic prescribing, monitoring and documentation. Methods:? A postal questionnaire consisting of an open question regarding prescribing errors and 27 opinion statements was sent to 144 key APS contacts across Australia. This group included medical and nursing co-ordinators and a small group of clinical pharmacists with expertise in acute pain management. Opinion statements covered a range of topics including prescribing of opioids, tramadol, NSAIDs, and paracetamol, patient monitoring, and discharge medications. Results:? A response rate of 74% was achieved, with extensive use of the open question and comments space. Common areas of concern included both under- and overdosing of opioids, use of multiple opioids via multiple routes, inappropriate dose intervals and under-use of paracetamol. There were high levels of agreement regarding several opinion statements, particularly the inappropriate use of pethidine, but divergent views on others, such as the maximum daily dose of tramadol. Conclusions:? The survey provided information to the APOP project by identifying areas of educational need, highlighting specific analgesic prescribing practices judged to be correct by most experts as well as highlighting those where there is a lack of consensus.

AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - Abstract Background Authors were assigned the task to develop case definitions for periodontitis in the context of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions. The aim of this manuscript is to review evidence and rationale for a revision of the current classification, to provide a framework for case definition that fully implicates state-of-the-art knowledge and can be adapted as new evidence emerges, and to suggest a case definition system that can be implemented in clinical practice, research and epidemiologic surveillance. Methods Evidence gathered in four commissioned reviews was analyzed and interpreted with special emphasis to changes with regards to the understanding available prior to the 1999 classification. Authors analyzed case definition systems employed for a variety of chronic diseases and identified key criteria for a classification/case definition of periodontitis. Results The manuscript discusses the merits of a periodontitis case definition system based on Staging and Grading and proposes a case definition framework. Stage I to IV of periodontitis is defined based on severity (primarily periodontal breakdown with reference to root length and periodontitis-associated tooth loss), complexity of management (pocket depth, infrabony defects, furcation involvement, tooth hypermobility, masticatory dysfunction) and additionally described as extent (localized or generalized). Grade of periodontitis is estimated with direct or indirect evidence of progression rate in three categories: slow, moderate and rapid progression (Grade A-C). Risk factor analysis is used as grade modifier. Conclusions The paper describes a simple matrix based on stage and grade to appropriately define periodontitis in an individual patient. The proposed case definition extends beyond description based on severity to include characterization of biological features of the disease and represents a first step towards adoption of precision medicine concepts to the management of periodontitis. It also provides the necessary framework for introduction of biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis.
