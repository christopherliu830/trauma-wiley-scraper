AB  - Introduction Suspensory apparatus injuries are common in dressage horses. Studies demonstrate that surface type affects hoof forces and distal limb kinematics of equine athletes. Because synthetic race surfaces have lower stiffness and limb loads than dirt surfaces, it was hypothesized that dressage horses have less fetlock hyperextension on a synthetic surface than a dirt surface. Methods Two-dimensional, high-speed videos (250?Hz, 2?ppcm) of 6 dressage horses (ages 8?13; 5 males, 1 female) during extended trot on dirt and synthetic surfaces (6 trials (strides) per horse per surface) were digitized (low-pass Butterworth filter, 15?Hz). Fetlock and solar hoof angles determined from skin and hoof markers were compared between surfaces using a mixed model ANCOVA that accounted for horse velocity (saddle billet marker) and repeated horse measures. Surface mechanical behaviors were characterized using a track testing device. Maximum force, time to maximum force, maximum displacement, resting rebound, maximum vertical rebound, average stiffness, and maximum load rate were compared between surfaces and time of day (morning, afternoon) using a general linear model ANOVA. Results Maximum and toe off fetlock angles were greater on the synthetic surface compared to dirt (??=?2°, P?=?0.070). Mean maximum fetlock angle on the synthetic surface was 260°. The maximum load rate of the synthetic surface was 5 times greater than the dirt surface (P?=?0.0086). Conclusions Synthetic surfaces were designed to reduce injuries in equine athletes. Because suspensory apparatus elongation is largely dependent on fetlock extension, it is possible that suspensory apparatus strain is greater on synthetic surfaces. Thus, surface design may require more refinement to promote injury prevention based on horse discipline and gait.

AB  - Introduction To enhance expressiveness and regularity of the tölt, Icelandic horses are commonly shod with excessively high and long hooves. The aim of this study was to objectively assess the effect of shoeing on distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint moments of the left forelimb during break-over at walk, tölt and trot. Methods Twelve sound Icelandic horses accustomed to exercise with a rider on a treadmill were assessed with hooves trimmed and shod according to the standards of normal shoeing and with long and high front hooves; besides the 20?x?8?mm steel shoes, this condition included pads and packing material used in competition. Vertical ground reaction forces (GRFz) were measured with an instrumented treadmill. Time of break-over was determined kinematically. Measuring systems were started synchronously; sampling frequency was 480?Hz. Measurements were taken at 1.34?±?0.04?m/s (walk), 3.89?±?0.10?m/s (tölt), and 3.90?±?0.10?m/s (trot). The DIP joint moment arm was determined on size-calibrated latero-medial radiographs of the left front hoof. Differences were tested using a t-test (walk) or repeated measures ANOVA (tölt, trot). Results In the condition with the long and high hooves, DIP joint moment was increased by 18.5% at walk (P<0.001), 17.3% at tölt (P<0.001) and 13.4% at trot (P?=?0.017) although vertical GRFz at break-over was not statistically different between the two shoeing conditions. The increase could be attributed to the 22.7% increase of the lever arm. Conclusions High hooves with long toes may have negative implications for the health of the palmar structures of the distal foot.

AB  - Introduction The aims of this study were to quantify the morphological differences between uneven feet, and to evaluate the biomechanical locomotor consequences compared to horses with even feet, considered as normal. Methods Eight anatomical parameters that quantified conformational differences in the distal forelimbs of horses with a varied range of hoof asymmetries (n?=?36, of which 2 were lame) were compared using discriminant analysis. Forefeet were subjectively scored for unevenness by one clinician. Kinetics and distal limb kinematics of clinically sound horses (n?=?34; the 2 lame horses were excluded) were collected at trot and compared between even (n?=?13) versus uneven (n?=?21) forefeet and between all feet when classified as flat, medium and upright using MANOVA/ANOVA. The relative influence of contralateral differences in hoof angle and of absolute hoof angle on functional parameters was analyzed by multiple regression (P<0.05). Results Unevenness was best determined by the differences in dorsal hoof angle between the forefeet. In uneven footed horses, the flatter foot showed a significantly larger maximal horizontal braking and vertical ground reaction force, a larger vertical fetlock displacement and a suppler limb spring. A steeper hoof angle was linearly correlated with an earlier braking-propulsion transition. No significant differences were found between individual flat, medium or upright feet. Conclusions The conformational differences between the forefeet were more important for loading characteristics than the individual foot conformation. The contralateral differences in vertical force could in fact imply an early, subclinical sign of lameness developing in the steeper forefoot, as these differences were smaller than those reported for subtle, clinically evident lamenesses.

AB  - Introduction We have observed major back-shape changes over time in some horses, the speed of which may be influenced by work-type, skeletal maturity, nutrition and saddle-fit. Currently, there are no longitudinal data quantifying changes in back-shape and no objective data assessing the importance of each variable. The objectives were to: quantify back-shape changes over time; describe the effects of age, breed, weight, work-discipline, saddle-management and pain elicited on palpation. Methods Preliminary data from 98 sport horses in regular work in an on-going one-year longitudinal study. Weight and management changes were recorded. The thoracolumbar shape was measured at T18, T13 and T8 using a Flexible Curve Ruler [1] every two months. Ratios were calculated for each site for the widths 3?cm and 15?cm ventral to the dorsal midline. Differences in back-shape were determined using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Chi-square test was used to assess associations between categorical variables, Spearman rank correlation for continuous variables, Mann-Whitney-U for continuous variables with binary outcomes and Kruskal-Wallis to assess ≥3 groups. Results T8 and T18-ratios were significantly different after two months (P<0.001) and T13 after four months (P?=?0.004). Decreased ratio at T8 was related to ill-fitting saddles (P?=?0.005), saddles tipping back (P?=?0.020), pain on palpation (P?=?0.032) and greater age (P?=?0.004). Increased T18-ratio was associated with weight gain (P<0.001), more prevalent in stallions and geldings than mares (P?=?0.035) and in dressage horses than other disciplines (P?=?0.043). Conclusions Back-shape can change within two months, the speed and direction of which are influenced by saddle-fit, age and bodyweight. Pain elicited on palpation of the back may indicate that changes have occurred. Thus saddle-fit should be reassessed.

AB  - Introduction There are few data on training horses used for show jumping (SJ) in practice. This study presents such data and relates it to changes of VLa4 during an outdoors season (VLa4?=?speed at which a blood lactate concentration of 4?mmol/l is achieved). Methods The training of 19 SJ (11 managed by professional trainer, PSJ, and 8 by amateur riders, ASJ) was documented and related to changes of VLa4. All horses were submitted to 3 standardized exercise tests (SET) to calculate VLa4: April/May, June/July, September: SET1, SET2, SET3. Noted daily were: Minutes of turn-out on pasture, of walking in horse-walker, of lungeing and of specific exercise (gymnastics, jumping and others). Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA (Fisher's test as applicable) or linear regression. Results The duration of the specific exercises ranged between 30?60 minutes. PSJ were exercised less often and duration of each specific exercise was lower than for ASJ (P?=?0.01). Considering all horses, the VLa4 increased between SET1 and SET2 when the duration of exercise and gymnastics was longer and the number of days on pasture higher (P<0.05 both). These relationships became not significant when groups were analysed separately. The VLa4 of ASJ increased between SET2 and SET3 when horses were kept on pasture for more time (P<0.05, r2?=?0.64). The VLa4 of PSJ tended to increase with a higher percentage of jumping days between SET1 and SET2 (P?=?0.08, r2?=?0.30), and with longer duration of jumping exercise sessions between SET2 and SET3 (P?=?0.06; r2?=?0.33). Conclusions The information may help to improve the training of show jumpers. Ethical Animal Research Horse owners gave consent for these procedures within a veterinary monitoring system.

AB  - Introduction There is relatively little information concerning physiological factors affecting show-jumping performance. This study examined the relationship between show-jumping exercise, muscle soreness, serum muscle enzyme activity and blood lactate concentration. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up and after jumping a 15 fence course (1.35?1.45?m) once on day one and twice on day two; on day three the second round was an 8 fence jump-off. Veterinary and physiotherapy assessments of muscle soreness were performed daily before and after exercise. An international coach graded jumping technique. Blood was obtained before and on two occasions after jumping (1 minute, two hours) for measurement of serum CK and AST, and blood lactate concentration. Data were analysed using regression procedures or Spearman correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<0.05). Results Blood lactate significantly increased one minute after jumping on all three days (P?=?0.003 for all). When two rounds were jumped, lactate was significantly lower after the second round compared to the first (P?=?0.006, P?=?0.014). There was a positive correlation between blood lactate one minute after jumping and number of faults scored daily and overall (R2?=?0.61; P<0.01), decreased jumping technique grade (R2?=?0.69; P<0.01) and increased gluteal muscle soreness on day two (r?=?0.75; P?=?0.012). Plasma CK activity one minute, and 2 hours after jumping was significantly higher than before jumping on all days (P<0.01). Conclusions Horses with higher blood lactate concentrations after jumping demonstrated decreased jumping performance and were more likely to display muscle soreness.

AB  - Introduction Racehorses suffering from subclinical diseases are frequently kept in training until they fail expectations during competition. The diagnosis of medical causes of poor performance remains challenging in the field. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of subclinical causes of poor performance in working Thoroughbreds (TB) and to determine which clinical field tests could most appropriately identify them. Methods During the course of a training session, a complete clinical screening was performed in 11 healthy controls (C) and 38 poor performing (PP) TB without obvious clinical signs. Exercising ECG and GPS monitoring, blood sample analysis including oxidative stress markers, Doppler echocardiography, respiratory function testing (RFT), post-exercise endoscopy, tracheal wash (TW) and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. Statistics included ANOVA and Spearman's test (P<0.05). Results Subclinical causes of PP included muscular, respiratory and cardiac disorders. Variables derived from velocity and HR showed significant differences between groups. Lower airway diseases (LAD) were the most frequently diagnosed (33/38), causing significant differences in RFT. Endoscopic observations correlated with TW cytology, but unlike BAL analysis, were insufficient to diagnose all LAD cases. Supra- or ventricular premature beats were present only in the PP group but were not associated with echocardiographic abnormalities. Glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in PP. Conclusions Velocity, ECG and HR monitoring during a training session can be used as non-specific predictive indicators of performance, help assess functional consequences of diseases and guide ancillary diagnostic investigations. As LAD is highly prevalent, BAL sampling would be indicated in any case of poor performance. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Ethical committee of the University of Liege.

AB  - Introduction Elimination of CO2 from skeletal muscle (mCO2) during exercise is important for the regulation of intramuscular [H+] ([mH+]). Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyses the hydration/dehydration reaction of CO2 to facilitate its elimination. We hypothesised that extracellular CA inhibition and subsequent increase in PCO2 will result in increased m[H+] and decreased exercise performance. Methods Six horses were exercised on a treadmill until fatigue without (Con) and with acetazolamide (CA inhibitor) treatment (Acz; 30?mg/kg, 30?min before exercise). Arterial and mixed-venous blood was sampled, and biopsies collected from gluteal muscles at fatigue. Whole blood (wb) arteriovenous difference across the muscle (a-v) of [Na+], [K+], [Cl?], [Lac?], [SID], and PCO2, mCO2 and m[H+] were determined. Paired t-test was used to assess statistical significance (P<0.05). Results Duration of exercise to fatigue was not affected by Acz. Compared to Con, Acz increased mCO2 (Con 16.5(mean) ±?3.6(SE), Acz 20.5?±?2?mmol/L) and mixed-venous and arterial PCO2 but had no effect on VCO2. No difference was observed in m[H+] between Con (118?±?18?nmol/L) and Acz (99?±?16?nmol/L). Acetazolamide did not affect plasma [H+]. Based on the a-v differences Acz increased [Na+]wb and [K+]wb release, increased [Cl-]wb uptake and did not affect [Lac-]wb release by the muscle. Acz decreased a-v[SID]wb (Con 6.2?±?2.8?mmol/L, Acz ?0.3?±?2?mmol/L). Conclusions Although PCO2 and mCO2 were elevated no difference in [mH+] was observed. An increase in m[H+] due to elevated mCO2 was attenuated by strong ion fluxes between intramuscular and vascular spaces. Strong ion exchanges are important in attenuating m[H+] and maintaining exercise performance.

AB  - Introduction Many jurisdictions measure plasma tCO2 to determine if racehorses may have been administered exogenous alkalinizers illegally (?milkshakes?). Our hypothesis was that plasma tCO2 test results vary within a racing jurisdiction due to inter-day instrument variability. Methods Individual or daily mean plasma tCO2 test results from New York (n?=?584) and Maine (n?=?443) Standardbreds and California Thoroughbreds (n?=?23,686) were obtained through legal discovery in adjudicated cases where trainers were accused of tampering with horses resulting in tCO2 concentrations ≥37.0?mmol/L. Daily results were grouped by days on which no horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (LOW) or days on which at least one horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (HIGH). HIGH days were further subsampled by eliminating ?positive? test results ≥37.0?mmol/L (MODIFIED HIGH). With P<0.05 considered significant, differences between groups were compared by Student's t test for means and Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test for medians. Results HIGH tCO2 means (32.9?±?2.6, 35.2?±?3.4, 32.6?±?2.7) and medians (32.9, 35.4, 32.6) for all 3 jurisdictions were higher than LOW means (31.7?±?2.3, 31.9?±?4.3, 31.5?±?0.7) and medians (31.8, 32.9, 31.5) (P<0.001). Even when ?positive? tests ≥37.0 were eliminated, MODIFIED HIGH means (32.5?±?2.2, 33.6?±?2.6, 32.4?±?2.5) and medians (32.7, 34.2, 32.5) were still higher than LOW (P<0.001). Conclusions Unless the population tCO2 mean varies significantly daily, it must be concluded that instrument variability resulted in day-to-day differences in plasma tCO2 test results. Without appropriate quality control including correction of individual suspect results to a contemporaneous standard curve, horse trainers may be accused unfairly of tampering when day-to-day instrument variability contributes to positive plasma tCO2 test results.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to determine whether serum anti-oxidant defenses are impaired by endurance exercise and to investigate possible correlation with performance in the race. Methods Blood samples were obtained from 23 Arabian or half-Arabian horses (6 years old) the day before (T0) and 30 minutes after (T1) a 90-km race. Performance records available included speed, heart rate 10 and 30 minutes after arrival and the rating by veterinarians based on recovery and gait (5 categories from ?eliminated? to ?excellent?). Absorbance at 413?nm (A413), at 650?nm (A650) and absorbance of Rose Bengal (RB) were measured in sera at T0 and T1 (a higher absorbance means a lower antioxidant capacity). Relationships between blood variables and between T0 values and race results were evaluated using correlation analysis and means comparisons. Results All horses finished the race with an average speed of 16.3?km/h. Three horses were eliminated for lameness, one was excellent and the others were distributed between the other three categories. After the race, a significant increase of RB, A413, A413-A650, PT and CK (P<0.001) was observed. At T0, RB and CK were significantly correlated (r?=?0.52, P<0.01). At T1, absorbance values were significantly correlated with muscle enzymes and haptoglobin (r?=?0.50?0.67, P<0.05). The speed of the horse was negatively correlated with RB at T0 (r?=??0.42, P<0.05). No significant difference in absorbance values could be detected between the recovery categories. Conclusions A higher resistance to oxidative stress was observed before the race in the best performing horses.

AB  - Introduction Electrolyte supplementation prior to exercise is known to benefit both performance and recovery; however its effects on acid-base status remain not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to use the physicochemical approach to provide a comprehensive time-course of the acid-base alterations that occur following pre-exercise electrolyte supplementation in horses. It was hypothesized that electrolyte supplementation will attenuate the alkalosis occurring with prolonged moderate intensity exercise. Methods In a randomized crossover experiment four conditioned mares were given, via nasogastric tube, 3?L of a commercial electrolyte solution (ES; designed to fully replace sweat electrolyte and fluid losses), or water alone (Control), 1 hour before they exercised on a treadmill at 30% VO2max until voluntary fatigue (inability to keep pace with belt speed). Blood was sampled from jugular venous catheters at frequent intervals before, during, and until 20?h of exercise recovery, and analyzed for all dependent and independent plasma acid-base variables. Differences (P<0.05) over time and between groups were assessed by 1- or 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results Horses exercised for 57.5?±?10.3 and 72.5?±?17.0?min and lost 2.73?±?0.82 and 4.63?±?1.35?L in Control and ES trials, respectively. ES horses had lower pCO2 and total carbon dioxide (TCO2) concentrations during exercise and early recovery. Control horses exhibited decreased [H+]. pCO2 was the primary contributor to changes in [H+] and [TCO2], while there were no differences in strong ion difference ([SID]) or total weak acid concentration ([Atot]). Conclusions Electrolyte supplementation prior to prolonged exercise leads to sustained effects on equine acid-base variables, even in the absence of significant changes in plasma electrolytes or hydration.

AB  - Introduction Exercise causes several physiological changes resulting from autonomic and hemodynamic adaptations, but there are few reports about the behaviour of blood pressure (BP) during physical activity in horses, as well as the effect of training on BP. Methods 9 untrained Arabian horses underwent two treadmill evaluations (before and after 90 days of aerobic training at 60% HRmax) at 6% incline with incremental speed increases every 3 minutes (commencing at 2.5?m/s and reaching 12.5?m/s). The facial artery was cannulated with a 20?G catheter and systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were recorded with a multiparameter monitor (GE Dash 3000 model). Data were evaluated by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures and Bonferroni multiple comparison (P<0.05). Results During initial evaluation SBP increased in a gradual and uniform manner as speed increased, reaching a maximum of 208?mmHg at a speed of 10?m/s. After training, SBP behaved similarly during treadmill evaluation, however values were lower until 10?m/s (P<0.001), and the maximum value of SBP obtained was 218?mmHg at 12.5?m/s. DPB was not significantly different (P?=?0.124). MAP emulated the behaviour of SBP (P?=?0.012). Conclusions A decrease in SBP and MAP during identical treadmill evaluations before and after 90 days of aerobic exercise (60% HR max) indicated that training decreased cardiac effort required for the maintenance of physical activity.

AB  - Introduction Increasing cardiac dimension with endurance training is well known in adult athletes. However, adaptation of the heart to training in growing Arabian type horses is less well documented. Methods During the national finals for young endurance horses, standardized echocardiographic examinations were performed before the races by two experienced examiners. In 2011 left ventricle (LV) was assessed in 74 horses aged 4-years (18), 5-years (33) and 6-years (23). In 2012 left atrial (LA) dimensions and the great heart vessels were measured in 122 horses aged 4-years (32), 5-years (40) and 6-years (50). Data were normally distributed; age groups and gender were compared by one-way ANOVA (Holm-Sidak test for multiple comparisons, significance P<0.05); relationships between echocardiographic dimensions and body weight (BWT) were assessed by linear regressions. Results BWT was highest in 5-year old horses. LV dimensions increased with age, but for most measurements the difference was significant only for the group of 6-year old horses. The stroke volume (SV) increased (P?=?0.0016) and the heart rate decreased (P?=?0.06) with increasing age, leading to a constant cardiac output in all age groups. There was a weak relationship between BWT and SV. Two dimensional LA measurements increased between 4 and 5 years but remained constant between 5 and 6 years. LA area measurements and LA functional indices showed no evolution between the groups. Aortic dimension increased with age but pulmonary artery dimension showed no such increase. No influence of gender on echocardiographic dimensions and function could be found. Conclusions Great heart vessels, LA and LV dimensions showed different growth patterns between 4 and 6 years of age.

AB  - Introduction Field exercise tests (FET) can assist design of individualized training programs. Although FETs have been used in other breeds, there are limited reports for Quarter horses (QH) and cross-bred QH which are widely used in traditional Venezuelan equestrian activities. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of an FET in cross-bred Quarter horses in Venezuela. Methods Six horses (3 stallions and 3 mares) performed a FET consisting of a four-step incremental increase in speed (91?±?10; 136?±?3; 271?±?20; 439?±?43?m/min). Each cycle lasted 3 to 5?min with 3 minutes of rest between each. Environmental temperature was 32°C. Heart rate and speed were recorded (Polar Equine RS800CX?) and the speed to reach a heart rate of 200 and 170 beats/min was calculated by linear regression. The rate of heart rate decline was determined 5 minutes after the last step. Linear regression analysis, descriptive statistics and an unpaired t- test (Graph Pad Prism 5.0) were utilized to identify gender differences (P<0.05). Results Gender did not influence the results. V200 and V170 were slightly higher in stallions (617?±?98 and 465?±?66?m/min, respectively) than in mares (511?±?60 and 387?±?60?m/min, respectively). The rate of heart rate decline was slightly more rapid in mares (25?±?7 beats/min) compared to stallions (13?±?5 beats/min). Conclusions Although a low number of horses were evaluated, these preliminary data suggest that gender has limited influence on fitness of cross-bred Quarter horses used in local Venezuelan equestrian activities under tropical environmental conditions. The mean V200 and V170 values obtained were lower than those reported for Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds, but similar to those reported in young racing Quarter horses.

AB  - Introduction During racing, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a major source of energy for muscle contraction. Assessment of muscle OXPHOS capacity by high-resolution respirometry (HRR) might identify animals with altered energy metabolism and consequently increased risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER). Methods Prospective cohort study. Ten healthy French Standardbreds in active training, aged 4?7 years, recruited at the start of a competitive racing season, underwent a standardised field exercise test with determination of speed at onset of lactate accumulation (VLa4) and measurement of serum creatine kinase activity (CK) two hours post-exercise. Triceps brachii muscle microbiopsies were obtained for determination of OXPHOS and electron transfer system (ETS) capacities with HRR. Associations between HRR variables and occurrence of ER over the following four months of racing were analysed using univariate logistic regression. Results Two horses developed ER during the study period: one within one month of recruitment, another presented multiple minor episodes over the season. For these ER horses OXPHOS/ETS ratio was lower, and Complex I/Complex I?+?II ratio and Complex I /Complex II ratio were higher than non-affected horses in the study (perfect prediction of occurrence of ER with ratio of ≤0.74, ≥0.60 and ≥0.715 respectively). VLa4 for ER horses was within the range of non-affected horses. Post-exercise CK was within normal limits for all horses in the study. Conclusions OXPHOS and ETS capacities and their derived ratios indicate dysfunctional muscle energy metabolism whereas VLa4 and CK were unremarkable in horses subsequently affected by ER.

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a missense, gain-of-function mutation in the equine skeletal muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1). Affected horses have excessive glycogen storage, amylopectate-like inclusions in their muscle and higher muscle glycogen synthase activities (GS) than controls. GS is normally allosterically-regulated by glucose-6-phosphate and enzyme activity is reduced by phosphorylation. We hypothesised that the higher GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses might be due either to 1) increased expression or reduced degradation of the mutant enzyme or 2) due to reduced phosphorylation. Methods Semimembranosus muscle samples were biopsied from 4 homozygotes (HH), 13 heterozygotes (RH) and 12 control (RR) Belgian Draught horses. Samples were analysed for glycogen content and GS activity. Western immunoblotting was used to examine expression of total and phosphorylated forms of GS, GSK3? and GLUT4. Data was analysed using non-parametric ANOVA statistical tests with post-hoc Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Results PSSM1 affected heterozygotes and homozygotes had significantly higher muscle glycogen contents than controls (RR vs. RH P?=?0.005, RR vs. HH P?= 0.041) and GS activity was significantly higher in PSSM1-affected homozygotes than in heterozygotes and control horses (P?=?0.03). Although there was no difference in total GS expression between groups, there was significantly more expression of GS phosphorylated at site 2?+?2a in PSSM1-affected horses in comparison with controls (P?=?0.009). Conclusions Our data suggest that increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses is not associated with increased expression or degradation of the mutant enzyme and occurs despite increased phosphorylation of GS at site 2?+?2a. Alternative mechanisms, including aberrant ligand binding might account for the increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected muscle.

AB  - Introduction Muscle glycogen is a potentially limiting substrate for horses during intense exercise. Low-starch, high-fat concentrates have become popular for performance horses, but their effect on muscle glycogen usage and repletion is unclear. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses were studied in a 3?x?3 Latin Square design to measure the effect of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC), fat and fiber intake on glycogen repletion following intense exercise. Horses were fed isocaloric, isonitrogenous rations that supplied high (HS), medium (MS) or low (LS) NSC intake. The horses were fed 1.25% BW/d grass-hay and 1.0% BW/d concentrate. These rations provided 45%, 36% and 18% of total digestible energy (DE) from NSC, 11%, 15% and 23% of total DE from fat, and 30%, 33% and 45% of total DE from fiber. During each 1-month period horses were trained for three weeks on a high-speed treadmill followed by a three-day glycogen-depletion period comprising multiple bouts of intense exercise. Muscle biopsies were taken before and 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-depletion. A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed on day 1 of the depletion period. Results During the SET, lactate was lower in LS compared to MS or HS (P<0.05). Heart rate, plasma glucose, VO2, VCO2 were unaffected by treatment. Muscle glycogen depletion averaged 33%, 30%, and 36% in the HS, MS and LS treatments. Muscle glycogen repletion was significantly lower in the LS group 72 hours post exercise (P<0.05). Conclusions Low NSC concentrates may not provide enough substrate for glycogen repletion following multiple bouts of intense exercise.

AB  - Introduction In Thoroughbreds, genetic variation in myostatin (MSTN g.66493737C/T) is highly predictive of optimum race distance and influences mRNA expression, precocity, skeletal muscle development, two-year-old earnings, speed variables and skeletal muscle fibre type. The aim of this study was to investigate MSTN variation associations with VO2peak in untrained yearling Thoroughbreds. Methods Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbred yearlings (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) from one flat racing yard (November-December). Data was collected as horses freely travelled up an all-weather gallop (2% incline) with no rider. VO2 was measured using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask and associated customized software validated for field testing. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded. MSTN genotypes were determined using a customised Taqman SNP genotyping assay. Tests of association between genotype and phenotype were performed using PLINK software. Results Average exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, and HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm. MSTN genotypes and VO2peak based on 6 breaths were n?=?16 CC, VO2peak?=?119.49?±?21.8; n?=?22 CT, VO2peak?=?116.40?±?-27.2; n?=?3 TT, 115.08?±?20.2.There was no association (P>0.05) between genotype and VO2peak. Conclusions In yearling Thoroughbreds no association between MSTN genotype and untrained peak oxygen consumption was observed. This may be a function of the small number of TT genotype individuals evaluated or a reflection of a requirement for MSTN-associated skeletal muscle entrainment in VO2peak changes resulting from a period of exercise training. Such changes may be associated with MSTN genotype and this requires further investigation. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.

AB  - Introduction PGC-1α and irisin, encoded by the PPARGC1A and FNDC5 genes, play key roles in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise. PPARGC1A gene expression is induced by exercise and has been shown to upregulate FNDC5 expression. Higher levels of FNDC5 have been observed in young male human athletes compared to sedentary controls. FNDC5 gene expression has also been shown in some species to be modulated by myostatin (MSTN), a growth factor that limits muscle hypertrophy. In horses MSTN variation (g.66493737C>T) affects gene expression and racing performance. Thoroughbreds homozygous for the C-allele have significantly higher levels of MSTN?mRNA than homozygous T?:?T horses. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of PPARGC1A and FNDC5 in skeletal muscle to exercise and investigate the relationship with MSTN genotype. Methods Skeletal muscle (gluteus medius) biopsies were taken from untrained yearling Thoroughbreds (n?=?27) at rest and after a ten month period of training at two-years-old. Skeletal muscle gene expression was measured using real-time qRT-PCR assays and data was analysed using qBase software. Results A significant increase in both PPARGC1A (P?=?0.0001, FC?=?1.82) and FNDC5 (P?=?0.039, FC?=?1.72) was observed post-training. A significant positive correlation was found between FNDC5 and PPARGC1A expression levels post training (P?=?0.01, R2?=?0.22). There was no relationship between PPARGC1A or FNDC5 gene expression and MSTN genotype. Conclusions These data indicate a coordinated role for PGC-1α and irisin in the skeletal muscle response to exercise in Thoroughbred horses. Their known roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and brown fat metabolism suggest important roles in the adaptive response to exercise, which is independent of MSTN-determined muscle type.

AB  - Introduction NaHCO3 has been administered prior to racing in an attempt to enhance performance but it remains unclear whether potential ergogenic effects may be due to increased buffering capacity or expanded extracellular fluid volume. Methods Solutions of 1?g/kg of NaCl, KCl, NaHCO3, or KHCO3 in 8?L of water were administered via a nasogastric tube 60?min prior to a high intensity treadmill exercise test (12?m/s to fatigue) to 4 horses in a randomized fashion. Changes in mixed venous plasma electrolyte concentrations (NOVA Biomedical analyser) and run time to fatigue were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Administration of Na and K salts increased Na and K concentrations before and during maximal exercise, respectively. Administration of bicarbonate salts attenuated acidosis and the decrease in bicarbonate concentration during exercise, as compared to Cl salts. Of interest, run time to fatigue was longer (P<0.001, power?=?0.98) after administration of KCl (5.1?±?0.6?min) as compared to both bicarbonate salts (3.7?±?0.6 and 3.6?±?0.8?min for NaHCO3 and KHCO3, respectively), but was not different than run time after NaCl administration (4.3?±?0.8?min). Conclusions Preloading with large amounts of Na and K salts produced expected changes in mixed venous Na and K concentrations but preloading with bicarbonate did not improve performance. Observation of longer run times to fatigue after administration of NaCl or KCl was unexpected and warrants further investigation.
