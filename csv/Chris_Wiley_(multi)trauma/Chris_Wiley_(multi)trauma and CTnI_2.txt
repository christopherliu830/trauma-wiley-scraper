AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Cardiac troponins are sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. The troponin concentration can be thought of as a quantitative measure of the degree of injury sustained by the heart, however, it provides no information on the cause of injury or the mechanism of troponin release. Conventionally, the cardiac troponins have been used for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in humans and have become the gold standard biomarkers for this indication. They have become increasingly recognized as an objective measure of cardiomyocyte status in both cardiac and noncardiac disease, supplying additional information to that provided by echocardiography and ECG. Injury to cardiomyocytes can occur through a variety of mechanisms with subsequent release of troponins. Independent of the underlying disease or the mechanism of troponin release, the presence of myocardial injury is associated with an increased risk of death. As increasingly sensitive assays are introduced, the frequent occurrence of myocardial injury is becoming apparent, and our understanding of its causes and importance is constantly evolving. Presently troponins are valuable for detecting a subgroup of patients with higher risk of death. Future research is needed to clarify whether troponins can serve as monitoring tools guiding treatment, whether administering more aggressive treatment to patients with evidence of myocardial injury is beneficial, and whether normalizing of troponin concentrations in patients presenting with evidence of myocardial injury is associated with reduced risk of death.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?The World Class Development Programme is funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, through Exchequer and National Lottery funds, via UK Sport.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Human carriers of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated sarcomeric mutations have abnormal collagen metabolism before overt left ventricular hypertrophy is detectable. This study investigated whether differences in collagen biomarkers were present in blood samples of ragdoll cats positive for the MYBPC3:R820W mutation compared with negative controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cats were recruited for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening using echocardiography and genotyping. Circulating markers of collagen turnover (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CITP; type I collagen degradation] and N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen [type III collagen synthesis]) and cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I) were measured. Correlation between concentrations of collagen biomarkers and echocardiographic variables was analysed, and collagen biomarker concentrations were compared between MYBPC3 mutation positive and negative cats, without left ventricular hypertrophy. RESULTS Linear regression analyses showed that genotype was independently associated with CITP concentration. CITP was higher in mutation carriers (25?·?4?µg/L, interquartile range 16?·?0?29?·?2?µg/L) than non-carriers (14?·?6?µg/L, interquartile range 9?·?38?19?·?2?µg/L; P?=?0?·?024). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Circulating CITP was higher in MYBPC3-positive ragdoll cats than negative controls and may indicate altered collagen metabolism. Further studies are necessary to determine whether alterations in circulating collagen biomarker concentration relate to an early stage of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
