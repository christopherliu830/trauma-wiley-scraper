AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Synovial fluid (SF) is located in joint cavities, tendon sheaths and bursae. In joints it comprises a serum filtrate with additional contributions from articular cartilage, synovium and bone. Low molecular weight metabolites represent the end product of the cell regulatory processes. Synovial fluid represents a potential source of disease specific metabolites that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and be used in its early diagnosis. Objectives We hypothesise that there are different metabolomic profiles that can be identified in early OA SF and some of these metabolites are potential biomarkers. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Synovial fluid was used from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 9 normal and 9 OA Thoroughbred horses following macroscopic, microscopic and synovitis scoring. SF was analysed with Proton (1H)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with a 600?MHz Avance III equipped with a cryoprobe and chilled sample-jet autosampler. The software we use is Topsin 3.1 and IconNMR 4.6.7. The following methods were used in order to identify changes in lipids and small molecules; 1D Nuclear Overhauser Effect, Longitudinal Encode-decode and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill. Data analysis was undertaken using unsupervised statistical methods and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results The results demonstrated clustering on principle component analysis between normal and OA samples. Seven metabolites were identified as significantly different in OA P<0.05; mobile lipid 1, methyl group, 2 lactates, proline and 2 citrates. Furthermore total lipid load correlated very closely to Mankin's scoring. Using IPA we identified metabolic pathways relating to altered glycolysis in early OA. Conclusions We identified the metabolic fingerprint of early OA which may allow for better phenotyping of disease states and thereby facilitate targeting of improved treatment regimes.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Accurate diagnosis of chronic foot pain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows appropriate case selection for palmar/plantar digital neurectomy (PDN). Objectives To report follow-up for chronic foot pain treated by PDN, with and without MRI diagnosis. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods The electronic patient records of all animals that underwent PDN were reviewed. Follow-up was obtained from owners using a structured postal/telephone questionnaire. Chi squared/Fisher's exact tests or 2-sample t tests were used, with statistical significance set as P<0.05. Results One hundred and nine PDN cases were undertaken. Follow-up response rate was 72.5%. From these 79 cases, 52 had MRI (MRI+) and 27 did not (MRI?). There was no significant difference in case distribution between the 2 groups: predominantly horses, Warmbloods, geldings, used for full competitions, except MRI+ were younger than MRI? (median 9.99 and 11.71 years respectively, P?=?0.004). Median follow-up time for MRI+ was 31.4 months, and for MRI? was 36.8 months. There was no significant difference in outcome. In total, 78.9% MRI+ achieved their intended use, compared with 73.1% MRI?. For those intended for exercise, 83.7% MRI+ reached a level of exercise, compared with 87.5% MRI?. Median length of exercise maintenance was 25.2 months for MRI+ and 24.0 months for MRI?. For MRI+ there was one suspected and one confirmed neuroma and 4 neuritis cases. Two MRI? animals developed neuritis. Complications requiring euthanasia occurred in 2 MRI? cases: complete rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon in a bilateral forelimb lameness and one previous chronic laminitic with solar prolapse. Conclusions These results are comparable with previous reports of 80% of MRI+ returning to previous athletic use for 20 months. Achievement of intended use, length of exercise maintenance and complication rate was similar with and without MRI diagnosis, although both catastrophic complications occurred in animals which did not undergo MRI.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Although fasciolosis is an important livestock disease worldwide, the public health importance of human fasciolosis has increased in recent years and it is recognised as an important re-emerging zoonotic disease, its epidemiology and pathogenicity in donkeys, and the epidemiological role they may play have not been determined. Objectives To investigate the epidemiology and pathogenicity of fasciolosis in donkeys. Study design Cross-sectional coprological and retrospective post-mortem study. Methods Faecal samples collected from 803 randomly selected working donkeys from the central region of Ethiopia were analysed by a sedimentation-centrifugation-flotation technique. Further data on liver-flukes and associated pathologies were obtained by routine post mortem examinations of 112 donkeys, subjected to euthanasia on welfare grounds or died. Data were analysed using a generalised linear model and multivariate binary logistic regression in R statistical package with significance level of statistical tests set at P<0.05. Results Infection prevalences of 44.4% and 41.9% were obtained in coprologically and post mortem examined donkeys, respectively, irrespective of their age. Both Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica were identified with the mean infection intensity of 30 flukes. Older donkeys (≥8 years) were found harbouring a significantly higher worm burden (P<0.0001). Gross and histopathologies of hyperplasia and thickening of the bile ducts, fibrosis of large portal areas and irregular bile duct proliferation and hypertrophy were noted. Conclusions The high infection prevalence of fasciolosis and the associated hepatic pathologies in working donkeys shows not only the susceptibility of donkeys and the impact it has on their health, but also indicates the important role they can play in the epidemiology of both livestock and human fasciolosis. These further demonstrate the need for these animals to be considered in the overall epidemiological studies and for sound control strategies and prevention of fasciolosis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Regional adiposity on the neck crest has been linked to increased risk of developing equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). However, little is known about inherent metabolic differences between adipose tissues. Objectives To investigate innate differences between adipose tissue from neck crest compared to abdominal, mesenteric, and tail head in horses with no diagnosis of EMS. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Seven horses with no history of metabolic disorders were subjected to euthanasia for nonclinical reasons. They were selected randomly (5 geldings/2 mares; age 6?26 years; 110?165?cm height; BCS 3?8) and included with owners' consent. Adipose tissue was collected from neck crest, abdominal tissue, small intestine mesentery, and tail pad. mRNA expression of insulin-associated genes GLUT1, GLUT4, INSR and RBP4, and inflammation-associated genes SAA, TNFα, IL-1?, IL-6, MCP-1 and PAI-1 were investigated using RT-qPCR. Morphology and adipocyte size were investigated by histology. Release of non-essential fatty acids (NEFA) was investigated before/after adrenaline stimulation in 4 horses. Results No significant differences were found in mRNA expression of metabolic and inflammation related genes between tissues. Adipose tissue from neck crest was more heterogeneous than abdominal fat (P?=?0.001) and mesenteric fat (P?=?0.01). Neck crest adipocytes were similar in size to abdominal adipocytes, and larger than adipocytes from tail head and mesentery. Basal levels of NEFA release were not different between tissues. Adrenaline stimulation caused a significant release of NEFA from visceral fat (abdominal P?=?0.03; mesenteric P?=?0.048). Conclusions This preliminary study introduces new metabolic genetic markers and NEFA to the field of metabolic research. No innate differences were shown for neck crest fat except in histology. Further studies in a case?control study design are needed to determine if neck crest fat is a risk factor for EMS.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Thyroid hormones (THs) decrease with age in healthy dogs and cats, although they tend to remain within established reference ranges. Thyrotropin (TSH) is increased in elderly people, with or without mild alterations in THs. Objectives To test the hypothesis that geriatric horses will have lower THs and/or higher TSH compared with younger horses. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Resting THs and TSH, and responses to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were compared between young and old horses. Data from 71 normal, healthy horses that had participated in prior research projects were examined, and found to contain 42 horses 3?10 years of age, 16 horses >15 years and 10 horses >20 years. All samples had been assayed in the same previously validated radioimmunoassays. Statistical analysis was performed with commercial software. Results Although lower, THs were not significantly different between young and old horses when compared with the Mann?Whitney rank sum test. However, TSH concentration was significantly higher in horses aged >20 (median 0.52?ng/ml) or >15 years (0.44?ng/ml) compared to younger horses (0.33?ng/ml). TRH stimulation tests were performed in 19 of the younger horses, 7 of the horses >20, and 11 of the horses >15. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA on ranks revealed no significant differences in TH responses to TRH. The TSH response to TRH appeared to be slightly greater in the older horses, but did not quite reach significance (P?=?0.06). Conclusion Similar to reports in elderly humans, aged horses have higher serum TSH concentrations than younger horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Respiratory disease is a common cause of morbidity in geriatric horses, with a high prevalence of respiratory clinical signs; increasing with increasing horse age. However, owners frequently do not attribute these signs to disease and may not seek veterinary attention. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in the British geriatric equine population using a risk-screening questionnaire (RSQ) and identify factors associated with RAO. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Owners of geriatric horses/ponies enrolled in a previous cohort study were sent a postal questionnaire, combining a validated RSQ with questions regarding management, preventive healthcare, and respiratory-specific clinical signs. An RSQ score of >0.87 was the positive cut-off for RAO. Factors associated with RAO were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The useable response rate was 43.1%, providing data for 285 horses/ponies (median age 23.3 years). Coughing within the preceding year (27.0%) was the most prevalent owner-reported clinical sign. Among the study population, the apparent prevalence of RAO using the RSQ was 20.7%. 10.5% of horses/ponies were reported to have veterinary-diagnosed RAO (median age at diagnosis 13 years), of which 33.3% had a positive RSQ score. Data from 273 animals were included in the multivariable model, and factors associated with increased risk of RAO were ridden exercise ≥4 days/week (odds ratio [OR] 3.64; P?=?0.005) compared to no exercise; residing on a farm (OR 4.99; P?=?0.04) compared to residing on the owner's home premises and having had a respiratory infection within the past 12 months (OR 4.87; P<0.001). Conclusions Risk-screening questionnaire score-determined RAO prevalence was considerably higher than the proportion of animals previously diagnosed with RAO. This suggests under-diagnosis of respiratory problems in geriatric horses, much of which may be unrecognised or undiagnosed RAO. Risk factors identified differ from those previously reported for the general equine population. Ethical animal research:?This study was granted institutional ethical approval from the University of Liverpool and the Animal Health Trust. Return of a completed postal questionnaire was taken as informed owner consent.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Bronchopneumonia caused by Rhodococcus equi is an important disease of young horses throughout the world. Although early diagnosis and treatment improves the prognosis, this also increases the amount of antimicrobial usage and therefore increases the likelihood of resistance developing. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the level of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents of 97 virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates. Study design Analysis of archived samples. Methods Virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates were collected between 1991 and 2014 from clinically affected horses and from air samples collected in the breathing zone of foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed using a disc diffusion assay with a panel of agents. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and neomycin using a novel resazurin-based microtitre assay. Results Resistance to rifampicin was detected in 3 of the isolates (2 collected in 2013 and one in 2014) by both methods. The MIC for these isolates was 64??g/ml (n?=?2) and 16??g/ml (n?=?1). All isolates collected prior to 2013 had MICs<0.125??g/ml, which was the limit of detection in this assay. Although no isolates were resistant to tetracycline, there was a general increase in MIC in isolates collected in recent years. No isolates were resistant to either neomycin or erythromycin, with MIC values ranging between 0.25 and 2??g/ml for neomycin and 0.125?1??g/ml for erythromycin. Conclusions The success of the macrolide-rifampicin combination relies on the synergistic action of these 2 agents. Resistance to rifampicin will reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. It is of serious concern that the resistant isolates were all recently collected. Hopefully, recent research will lead to fewer asymptomatic foals receiving antimicrobials which will in turn reduce the likelihood of ongoing development of resistance.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Gastric ulceration is an important cause of morbidity in horses. Currently, gastroscopy is the only reliable antemortem method for definitive diagnosis; however, it is unsuitable as a screening test because it is expensive, invasive and time-consuming. Sucrose permeability testing represents a simple, economical, non-invasive alternative to gastroscopy for screening purposes, and the feasibility of this approach in the horse has been reported [1]. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose as a screening test for gastric ulceration. Study design Cross-sectional design. Methods One hundred and one adult horses with and without naturally occurring gastric ulcers were studied. The diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose for detection of gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min after administration of 1?g/kg bwt of sucrose via nasogastric intubation was assessed with ROC curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Sucrose concentration in blood was compared with gastroscopy as the gold standard; and sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were calculated across a range of sucrose concentrations. Cut-off values were selected manually to optimise sensitivity. Results The prevalence of gastric ulcers was 83%. The AUC?±?95% CI for blood sucrose concentration when used to distinguish between horses with and without gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min was 0.592 (0.441?0.744) and 0.615 (0.469?0.761) respectively. Sucrose concentrations of 4.70??mol/l at 45?min; and 4.57??mol/l at 90?min were selected as optimal cut-offs. Using these cut-offs, Se ranged from 64.4% to 77%; and Sp ranged from 42.9% to 50%. Conclusions Blood sucrose is neither a sensitive nor specific test for detecting gastric ulcers in adult horses with naturally occurring ulcers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Training and rehabilitation techniques which improve core muscle strength are beneficial for improvement of dynamic stability of the equine vertebral column. The Equiband? system, consisting of resistance bands attached to a customised saddle pad, is suggested to provide constant proprioceptive feedback during motion to encourage recruitment of abdominal and hindquarter musculature. Objectives To quantify the effect of the Equiband? system on back kinematics and movement symmetry. Study design Longitudinal intervention study. Methods Quantitative analysis of back movement and gait symmetry before/after a 4-week exercise programme. Inertial sensor data was collected from 7 horses at Weeks 0 and 4 of a fixed exercise protocol. Analysis with and without the Equiband? system was completed at trot in hand on a hard surface, and for both reins on the lunge on a soft surface. Six back kinematic and 3 movement symmetry parameters were calculated according to published methods. Movement symmetry values were side-corrected to allow comparison between reins on the lunge. A mixed model (P<0.05) evaluated the effects of the Equiband? system over time, and trotting direction on back kinematic and movement symmetry parameters. Results The Equiband? system significantly reduced (all P<0.02) roll, pitch and mediolateral displacement in the cranial-mid thoracic region. Across all horses, back displacement and range of motion values were significantly greater (P<0.01) on the lunge than in a straight line, movement symmetry was consistent with having corrected all horses to be left-sided. Conclusion Preliminary results suggest the Equiband? system may aid dynamic stabilisation of the vertebral column.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Horses run on curves during training and competition, and are often trotted in circles to assist lameness diagnosis. The effects of moving on a curve on tendon strain in the distal limb are not known. Objectives To investigate the effect of curve running on the tendons and ligaments of the equine distal limb. Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Cadaver forelimbs from 6 Thoroughbred horses were loaded on a forceplate using a hydraulic ram. Limbs were loaded to 17?33?N/kg on a flat surface and with medial and lateral wooden wedges under the hoof to simulate curve running with the limb being on the inside and outside of a curve, respectively. Tendon length was measured for the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons (SDFT and DDFT), accessory ligament of the DDFT (ALDDFT), the suspensory ligament body (SL) and the medial and lateral suspensory ligament branches (SBM and SBL) using motion capture. A mixed effects model was used for data analysis. Results Under most loading conditions SL was under most strain and DDFT least. For a medial 15° wedge SDFT was under 0.4% greater load than SL (P?=?0.04). SBM was under 0.48% greater strain than SBL with a lateral 20° wedge (P?=?0.01), and SBL was under 1.37% greater strain than SBM with a medial 20° wedge (P<0.01). Conclusions Curve running leads to increasing and asymmetrical strain on the suspensory ligament branches. This difference is unlikely to be sufficient to cause injury, but may assist lameness diagnosis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diffusion of local anaesthetic solution after a mid-pastern ring block has not been investigated. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following injection of radiodense contrast medium as performed for a mid-pastern ring block. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. One and a half ml radiodense contrast medium was injected over the medial or lateral palmar digital nerve at the level of the proximal aspect of the ungular cartilages. A dorsal ring block was performed on the ipsilateral side, 1.5?cm proximal to the palpable palmar aspect of the proximal eminence of the middle phalanx, using 2 or 5?ml contrast medium. Both forelimbs were injected on 2 days (48 injections). Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately, 10 and 20?min after injections. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After dorsal injections the contrast medium was distributed in a diffuse patch over the ipsilateral half of the proximal phalanx (PP), extending proximally over the half of the length of PP in all limbs (greatest proximal extension: 89.0% of the length of PP [from distal] after 2?ml, 94.2% after 5?ml). There was significant proximal diffusion in the first 10?min after injection and significant dorsal diffusion between all time points (P<0.01). There was significant positive association between injected volume and the proximal extension of the dorsal contrast patch (P?=?0.01). The median dorsal diffusion was to the dorsal midline of PP; 5?ml contrast medium resulted in significantly greater dorsal diffusion than 2?ml (P<0.01). The dorsal and the palmar contrast patches did not merge. Conclusions Diffusion to the proximal aspect of P1 occurred even after injection of only 2?ml contrast medium. Fetlock region pain may be influenced by a mid-pastern ring block. Ethical animal research:?Written consent had been obtained from a representative of the horses' owner prior to starting the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The measurement of immunoglobulins is important in foals, as individuals with evidence of failure of passive transfer are at increased risk of infection and death during the first month of life. Objectives To identify which test is most suitable for determining the foal's IgG concentration as applied in practice. A distinction was made between hospitalised foals and healthy low risk foals in the field. Study design Prospective study including 46 foals <7 days old, divided into 4 groups based on age and health status. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated manually. Significance was set at P<0.05. Methods Several screening tests were compared to the IgG concentration measured by turbidimetric immunoassay: serum and plasma total protein, albumin and protein spectrum including gamma globulin concentration (GGC) measured by chemistry analyser, total protein by refractometer, glutaraldehyde coagulation test and a semi-quantitative enzyme immunoassay (SNAP). IBM SPSS Statistics 20A was used. A one-way ANOVA with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for determining significant differences among tests and between groups. Correlations between the turbidimetric immunoassay and the screening tests were calculated using linear regression with a 95% CI. Results Group differences were not found. The most accurate alternative test was the combination of total serum protein measured by a chemistry analyser (R 0.83) and GGC (R 0.84) with sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 100% and 95 and 93% respectively. A total serum protein of ≥49?g/l and a GGC of ≥6?g/l corresponded with an IgG concentration of ≥8?g/l. Conclusions According to this study, the most reliable alternative test suitable in a clinical setting for the determination of IgG concentration was measuring total serum protein by a chemistry analyser in combination with serum GGC.

AB  - Reasons for performing study When managing strangles in horses, it is crucial to detect chronic infection with Streptococcus equi (SE), i.e. silent carriers. Objectives Evaluate diagnostics for SE carriers over time in a farm. Study design Longitudinal observational study. Methods Sixty-three Icelandic horses isolated on an island were studied 4 to 26 months after remission of acute strangles, including repeated clinical examination and collection of blood, nasopharyngeal lavage (NPL), and guttural pouch lavage (GPL) samples. Twenty-two horses were treated with penicillin locally and systemically. Serology for S.?equi was examined by iELISA [1]. Nasopharyngeal lavage and GPL samples were investigated for S.?equi and S.?zooepidemicus by real-time PCR [2]. Results Thirty-three per cent were SE carriers after 15 months, despite repeated penicillin treatment. In 16/18 carriers, GPL samples were PCR-positive, but not NPL samples, whereas the opposite was true in 2 horses. Several carriers with persistent aerocystitis were not detected by 3 consecutive NPL samples. Five of 18 carriers were seronegative (27.8%) at 15 months. Following conservative treatment, 7 of these 18 carriers were still carriers at 20 months, 8 were negative, and 3 were lost for sampling. Only GPL samples were positive at this point, and only 1/7 carriers were seropositive. Conclusions To detect chronic carriers of strangles, RT-PCR analysis from both GPL and NPL samples may be necessary. Serological screening at individual level often misses individual carriers in long-term cases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Pleural effusion (PE) is reported to occur most commonly secondary to bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses, with neoplastic effusions contributing the minority of cases. The majority of these reports originate from America and Australia, where long distance transport of horses, a recognised risk factor, appears to occur more frequently. Anecdotally, neoplastic PE is more commonly diagnosed in the UK. Objectives To describe the causes of PE in horses resident in the UK, and to identify potential markers that can help differentiate between infectious and neoplastic causes of PE. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods Medical records from 4 referral hospitals in southern England were searched for horses diagnosed with PE. Information gathered from medical records included signalment, diagnosis (infectious vs. neoplastic), admission physical examination and biochemical findings, and characteristics of the effusion (volume, cell count, total protein [TP] concentration). Statistical comparisons were made between the neoplastic and infectious group using appropriate testing. Results Seventy horses were identified, of which 28 (40%) were neoplastic and 42 were infectious. Horses with infectious effusions were significantly younger (median 7 vs. 13 years; P?=?0.002) and had significantly smaller volumes of pleural fluid drained at admission (9.8 vs. 32.3?l; P<0.001). Horses with infectious PE had a significantly higher rectal temperature (38.6 vs. 38.2°C; P?=?0.03), fibrinogen concentration (7.8 vs. 5.7?g/l; P?=?0.02) and serum amyloid A concentration (223 vs. 104?mg/l; P?=?0.02). Pleural fluid characteristics identified a significantly greater cell count and TP concentration in horses with infectious PE (47?x?109/l vs. 3.4?x?109/l; P<0.001; 54 vs. 31?g/l; P?=?0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that in the UK neoplastic effusions account for a greater proportion of PE than previously reported. A large volume of PE in an older horse with a low cell count and TP concentration should increase the index of suspicion of neoplasia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is a common reason for owners to seek veterinary treatment for their working equids in Morocco. There is no information available regarding cultural, religious or educational barriers to obtaining treatment or about the typical workload of these animals which may predispose them to colic. Objectives To characterise the typical workload and feeding regimens of working equids in Morocco; to characterise the ability of owners to recognise the clinical signs and causes of colic; and to identify specific barriers to the veterinary treatment of colic. Study design Questionnaire-based survey. Methods A standardised, structured questionnaire was administered, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter, to the owners of working equids presenting their animals to 2 centres run by SPANA (The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad). Participation was voluntary and informed consent was obtained prior to the interview. Results All of the 102 participants that completed questionnaire were male. Ninety-eight owners used their animals for pulling carts, with 12% of animals working 7 days per week. 14% of animals were offered water by their owner once per day and 2% every other day. 25% of animals were loose and allowed free to feed unsupervised when not working. 29% of owners were not able to name any cause of colic and 25% did not recognise any clinical signs; only 12% associated colic with gastrointestinal pain. 83% of owners would not seek veterinary treatment due to financial constraints if free treatment at SPANA centres were not available. Conclusions Colic remains a common problem amongst working equids in Morocco. Improved knowledge of management factors associated with colic and how to recognise abdominal pain may reduce the incidence of colic and improve prognosis. The findings presented can be used to inform and develop owner education programmes. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all owners and was delivered in the native language. No details identifying the owner were recorded. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine gastric glandular disease (EGGD) is a common condition, for which the underlying pathophysiology is undetermined. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies have been proposed as a method for adapting therapy. Objectives To evaluate diagnostic information obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Methods Twenty-one horses undergoing elective humane slaughter were subjected to gross examination of the glandular mucosa. Glandular pathology was graded using EGUS Council guidelines from digital camera images. Mucosal biopsies were obtained using a ?single-bite? (1.8?mm; A and 2.4?mm; B) or ?double bite? technique (2.4?mm; C) using endoscopic biopsy instruments. Tissue was formalin fixed, processed and stained using standard protocols. Inflammatory infiltrates visualised histologically were graded (mild, moderate or severe) and compared with ulcer grade. Full thickness biopsies were also obtained adjacent to the biopsy site and of other visual lesions and inflammatory cell counts were compared with mucosal biopsies using ICC. Results Full thickness samples were artefact free and allowed visualisation of all layers. Mucosal biopsy samples contained mucosa in all samples, submucosa in 55% (C), 61% (A) and 66% (B) of samples and glands in 50% (B), 66% (A) and 100% (C). Samples from A were too small for histological assessment (33%) and tissue damage was commonly seen in A and B (n?=?8 and n?=?10) when compared with C (n?=?3). Horses with normal glandular appearance (grade 0; n?=?7) mostly demonstrated mild gastritis (n?=?5). Severe gastritis was identified in mild EGGD (grade 1/2), whilst mild and moderate gastritis was identified in all EGGD grades. There was no histological evidence of ulceration or erosion. There was poor agreement between cell numbers and sampling techniques (ICC<0.29). Conclusions These data show lack of ulcerative pathology and instead inflammation in EGGD. Lesion appearance is a poor indicator of underlying severity. Mucosal biopsies offer limited value in predicting underlying disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The bacteria Clostridium botulinum has been associated with equine grass sickness (EGS); however, the effect on the wider horse's gut microbiome is currently unknown. Objectives To characterise the bacterial dysbiosis that occurs within the gut microbiome of horses with EGS and to identify and quantify Clostridium botulinum within the faecal microbiota of the affected horses. Study design Case?control study. Methods Faecal samples were collected from horses with a histological diagnosis of EGS and matched controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted and sequenced to characterise the microbial communities in the group. Faecal samples were collected from a total of 33 horses over 2 years. This included 13 EGS cases, 14 matched controls and 6 hospital controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted from samples and the v4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. DNA was sequenced on the MiSeq platform and data was analysed using QIIME. Differences in community profile between the 3 groups of horses were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Results There was a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes bacteria in horses with EGS compared to the 2 control groups. Discriminant analysis identified bacterial genera Desulphovibrio and Veillonella and the bacterial species Veillonella parvula as increased in abundance. There was no noticeable increase in C.?botulinum in the faecal microbiome of EGS horses in this study. Conclusions The dysbiosis characterised by bacterial sequencing showed a similar shift to that identified previously in colitis horses and human inflammatory bowel disease. It is currently unclear how Verrucomicrobia bacteria are linked to grass sickness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by The University of Liverpool ethics committee. Owner informed consent was obtained before sampling. Sources of funding:?The Equine Grass Sickness Fund and The University of Reading. Competing interests:?None declared.
