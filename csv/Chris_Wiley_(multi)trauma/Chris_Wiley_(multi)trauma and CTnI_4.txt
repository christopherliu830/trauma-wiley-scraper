AB  - Reasons for performing study Metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension overload is increasingly being recognised in dressage horses and, like forelimb suspensory ligament injury, tends to be seen in horses with extravagant trot steps. However, there is limited understanding of the effects of different paces within the trot on forelimb movement, therefore it is difficult to advise rationally on prevention or management of these types of injury. Objectives To compare forelimb kinematics of collected and medium or extended trot in dressage horses. Study design Prospective study. Methods Twenty mixed-breed dressage horses (age 9?±?4 years; height 168?±?6?cm; weight 600?±?63?kg; median competition level?=?advanced medium) were tested at collected and medium/extended trot (age and training level dependent) in a straight line on an artificial surface ridden by their own rider at sitting trot. Four strides of each pace were recorded using high speed motion capture (240?Hz). Markers were placed on the horses' forelimbs at predetermined anatomical sites. Fetlock, carpus, elbow and shoulder angles were derived at midstance. Descriptive statistics and mixed effect multilevel regression analyses were performed on the data. Results Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased at medium compared with collected trot (coefficient: 5.70; CI 2.58?8.82; P<0.01) and extended compared with collected trot (coefficient: 8.59; CI 5.16?12.02; P<0.01). Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased when carpus extension angle (coefficient: 0.61; CI?=?0.4?0.82; P<0.01) and shoulder flexion angle were increased (coefficient: 0.18; CI 0.01?0.33; P<0.05). Conclusions Fetlock extension increased when the horses performed lengthened trot paces, more in extended than medium trot. The loading of the carpus and shoulder were related to fetlock extension, suggesting that lengthened paces affect the loading of the entire forelimb. Lengthened paces may be contraindicated in horses with fetlock hyperextension or suspensory ligament injury; they may be a potential risk factor for these injuries. Interaction with the surface could also have a role that could be further investigated. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Health Trust ethical review committee.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Yellow fat disease or steatitis is characterised by a local or general inflammation of fat tissue and is occasionally found in horses. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide range of nonspecific clinical signs. Objectives To describe clinical signs, treatment, outcome and ultrasonographic findings in horses with steatitis. Study design Retrospective study (January 2008 to January 2015). Methods History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Results Twenty cases (18 horses, 2 donkeys; 9 mares, 9 stallions, 2 geldings) were retrieved from 13,707 patient records. Mean age was 1.6 (±?0.8) years (range 1 month?3.5 years). All cases appeared between October and February except for one (August). History included dullness, recumbency, decreased appetite and weight loss. Fever, ventral oedema, stiff/painful gait and painful neck were found. Low haematocrit, low vitamin E and selenium and increased levels of creatinine kinase and particularly lactate dehydrogenase were almost consistent findings. On ultrasound, ventral oedema was found. Subperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, coronary and caudal mediastinal fat showed homogenously increased echogenicity. Especially the subperitoneal fat was surrounded by oedema or free fluid. Increased amounts of abdominal, thoracic and pericardial fluid were often found. Fat biopsies were taken in the neck or from the retroperitoneal fat in the ventral flank. In all horses where fat biopsy was taken (n?=?13), steatitis was confirmed. Treatment consisted of selenium and vitamin E (intra-muscular injection followed by oral treatment) supplementation and anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone or prednisolone parenteral or oral) for at least 1?4 weeks. Fourteen animals (70%) survived. Full recovery took about 2?6 months. Conclusions Yellow fat disease may be underdiagnosed because of the nonspecific clinical signs. Ultrasound was extremely helpful for making a diagnosis. Recovery was rather slow but was achieved in 70% of the animals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Subpalpebral lavage (SPL) systems are commonly used to facilitate treatment of ophthalmic conditions in the horse, are placed in differing positions and are associated with various complications. Objectives To evaluate differences in complication rates between SPL placement in the upper vs. lower eyelid and factors associated with development of complications. Study design Retrospective, clinical study. Methods Clinical records from the Royal Veterinary College (2000?2013) were evaluated. Data collated included age, breed, sex, clinician, training, ophthalmic condition, pharmacological agents administered, catheter position, duration of placement, where the catheter was managed (hospital/home) and any complications observed. Data was initially interrogated using chi-squared tests and then binary logistic regression models built to evaluate these factors. Results Data was obtained from 135 horses aged 6 days to 30 years. Duration of SPL was 3?60 days (median 8; IQR 7?15). Complication rates were lowest for medicine residents (10%), when compared with interns (42%), medicine clinicians (27%) and surgeons (16%). There was no difference in complication rate between SPL management at home (15.4%) compared with the hospital (16.1%; P?=?0.94). Position of catheter placement was influenced by stage of training (P?=?0.04; boarded clinicians were more likely to place in lower eyelid) and associated with duration of treatment (P?=?0.03; longer treatment times with SPLs in upper eyelid). Complications were associated with catheter position (P?=?0.03; upper 12.8%; lower 22.2%), antimicrobial administration (P?=?0.008; 13.2% when used; 25.0% when not) and plasma administration (P?=?0.004; 30.4% when used; 13.0% when not). Conclusions Subpalpebral lavage placement in the upper eyelid was associated with fewer complications. Use of antimicrobials appeared protective against complications and plasma should only be administered when indicated as it was associated with increased complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Normal radiographic anatomy of the juvenile donkey foot has not been reported previously. Objectives To provide a radiographic survey of the anatomical development of the donkey foot from 0 to 2 years of age. Study design Radiographic survey. Methods The right front foot of 9 donkey foals born in the spring of 2012, housed and fed in the same conditions, were radiographed every month for the first 6 months of age and every 3 months for the following 18 months. Latero-medial radiographs with and without barium markers at the coronary band and anterior-posterior radiographs of both front feet were obtained during weightbearing. Radiographs were obtained at 55?kV and 3?mAs with mobile x-ray equipment (Gierth RHF 200?ML, Examion DR810). Results The distal physis of the metacarpus (McIII) was closed at the mean age of 17.8 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The proximal physis of the proximal phalanx was closed at the mean age of 15.5 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The distal physis appeared as a clear radiolucent line at 2 weeks of age and was still visible subtly at 24 months. The proximal physis of the middle phalanx was closed at the mean age of 10.7 months (SD: 11.5, 19). The distal physis was visible at birth but closed at 4 days. Conclusions Based on our results, it seems that physes close at an older age in the donkey foal than in the horse.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Hypoglycin A (HG) appears to cause atypical myopathy (AM), but to our knowledge, detection of HG in affected and unaffected horses and concurrently in plants that they were exposed to has not previously been reported. Objectives To investigate HG in samples from horses exposed to Acer pseudoplatanus (European sycamore maple) and in such plant material, at the time of clinical cases of AM in the herd. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Blood was collected from 2 horses with AM and 22 clinically healthy co-grazing horses in 2 Swedish farms within one week of onset of signs (May 2014) and one month later, after horses were moved to other pastures. Ten healthy control horses from unaffected farms were sampled once. Samaras, seedlings, flowers and leaves from Acer pseudoplatanus and from Acer platanoides L (Norway maple) were collected from affected pastures. Hypoglycin A was analysed using chemical derivatisation with dansyl chloride (DNS) and ultra high performance liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Hypoglycin A was detected as derivatised compound HG-DNS [M+H]+ with selected reaction monitoring. Results Hypoglycin A was detected in the horses affected with AM, and also in 20 out of 22 co-grazing horses. One month later, a surviving case horse and 9/20 co-grazing horses were still positive for HG. Controls from other farms were negative for HG. Hypoglycin A was detected in plant material from Acer pseudoplatanus, but not from Acer platanoides L. Conclusions Horses grazing in pastures with HG-containing Acer pseudoplatanus were positive for HG in blood, and some showed severe signs of myopathy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The morphology of the dorsal (DCB) and ventral (VCB) nasal conchal bullae, including their cellulae, drainage and histology, are poorly described. The recent recognition that these bullae can become infected, causing chronic unilateral nasal discharge has stimulated interest in these structures. A more complete understanding of their anatomy would be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of their disorders. Objectives To document the structure, drainage and histology of the equine DCB and VCB. Study design Descriptive. Methods Fourteen fresh cadaveric horse heads, were transected sagittally midline and dissected to expose the nasal conchal bullae. The dimensions of each bulla, the number of drainage apertures, the number of cellulae and orientation of the septae were recorded. Representative samples were collected for histopathology. Results The mean lengths of the DCB and VCB were 77.7?mm (range 48?105?mm) and 57.1?mm (range 34?86?mm) respectively; equivalent to 13.8% and 10.2% of skull length, respectively. The mean widths of the DCB and VCB were 28.5?mm (range 21?35?mm) and 28.2?mm (range 13?41?mm) respectively; equivalent to 5.1% and 5% of skull length respectively. The median number of drainage apertures from the DCB and VCB were 2 and 1 respectively. The median number of cellulae within the DCB and VCB were 3 and 2, respectively. No communications were identified between the DCB and VCB and the adjacent paranasal sinuses. Histology revealed that the bullae consisted of ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar epithelium supported by a glandular submucosa often overlying turbinate bone and, variably, hyaline cartilage. Conclusions The morphology of the equine nasal conchal bullae is quite variable. The DCB is generally a more complex structure than the VCB, containing more septae, cellulae and drainage apertures. This more detailed description of DCB and VCB anatomy will hopefully facilitate successful treatment of their disorders.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early identification of surgical cases of colic is critical to improving outcome and welfare. There have been a number of studies on diagnostic tests for colic, evaluating a range of tests to differentiate between medical and surgical cases. Objectives To systematically review and appraise the evidence on diagnostic tests for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS quality assessment tool. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to equine colic; 976 related to diagnostic tests, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Of these, 16 papers reported on peritoneal fluid parameters, 21 on blood parameters, 10 on blood and peritoneal parameters, 3 on physical and blood parameters and one study on urine parameters. A range of different parameters were evaluated, with the majority of tests only being evaluated in single studies. None of the studies met QUADAS criteria 1 (representative spectrum of patients), 7/29 studies met criteria 2 (description of selection criteria) and 10/29 studies met criteria 9 (description of reference standard). Conclusions There are currently no published studies which use appropriate methodology to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test in differentiating medical and surgical colic. This made direct application of the QUADAS tool challenging; predominantly due to the lack of a pre mortem ?gold standard? reference diagnostic test for colic. Very few studies enrolled a randomised selection of patients and there was also a propensity to case?control study design, both increasing the risk of bias and under/overestimating diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Rasping of sharp enamel points (SEPs) is the most common procedure performed at routine dental examinations; however, there is little evidence to prove the true clinical significance of SEPs [1]. Maxillary SEPs are thought to cause buccal ulceration and pain on external palpation of the cheeks. Mandibular SEPs are thought to cause lingual ulceration. Objectives To examine associations between the presence of SEPs on the cheek teeth rows and the presence of pain on palpation of the cheeks and buccal and/or lingual ulceration. Study design Retrospective clinical case series. Methods Clinical records of routine dental examination performed by 8 veterinary surgeons in a single first opinion practice were examined. Presence of SEPs, buccal and/or lingual ulceration and pain on palpation of the cheeks (externally) were recorded. Chi squared tests were used to examine whether horses exhibiting pain on palpation or oral ulceration were significantly more likely to have SEPs present. Results Prevalence of buccal SEPs was 84.8% and prevalence of lingual SEPs was 84.3%. Five hundred and forty-eight horses (6.0%) had signs of pain on palpation. Prevalence of buccal ulceration was 5.9%. In contrast, only 0.2% of horses had visible lingual ulceration. Buccal ulceration and pain on palpation were significantly associated with presence of buccal SEPs (P<0.001 for both). Lingual ulceration was not significantly associated with lingual SEPs (P<0.0001). Conclusions Buccal SEPs are common and often result in pain and buccal ulceration. Routine rasping would appear to be justified. Lingual SEPs are common but rarely cause lingual ulceration. The value of routine rasping of lingual SEPs is therefore questionable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lameness negatively affects the welfare of horses; it often coexists with thoracolumbar pain. The mechanisms linking the two are not well understood. Objectives To document thoracolumbar movement in subjectively sound horses comparing straight lines with circles on left and right reins; to relate these observations to the objectively determined symmetry/asymmetry of hindlimb gait. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Fourteen non-lame horses were trotted in straight lines and lunged on a 10?m diameter circle on left and right reins and inertial sensor data collected at landmarks: withers, 13th (T13) and 18th thoracic vertebrae, 3rd lumbar vertebra, tubera sacrale, left and right tubera coxae. Data were processed using published methods [1]; pitch and roll, dorsoventral and lateral motion and symmetry within each stride were assessed. Results Dorsoventral motion during one stride had a sinusoidal pattern with 2 oscillations. The greatest amplitude and symmetry (119?±?4?mm, 96?±?1% in straight lines vs. 127?±?5?mm, 94?±?1% in circles) occurred at T13. Circles induced greater rotation around the transverse axis (>1.3°, P?=?0.002) and movement in a lateral direction (>16?mm P?=?0.002), greater dorsoventral amplitude and asymmetry; however, the latter differences were nonsignificant. There were no significant differences between reins. The difference in the left and right hindlimb stance phases and the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar were significantly associated. Greater circle-induced upward movement of a tuber coxae during the contralateral hindlimb stance was associated with greater circle-induced asymmetry of the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar (P?=?0.04). Conclusions Moving on a circle induces measurable changes in thoracolumbar movement compared with moving in straight lines, associated with alterations in the hindlimb gait.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is common in equids, with a high risk of re-injury associated with changes in tendon stiffness. In vivo measurement of limb stiffness has been shown to correlate with tendon stiffness after injury [1] but requires kinematic analysis which is impractical in a clinical setting. We have developed a simple system for measuring limb stiffness statically, which could be used as a tool for monitoring SDFT healing. Objectives To validate a goniometric measurement of limb stiffness. Study design Cross sectional study. Methods Initially, forelimb stiffness indices were determined at the walk for 6 equids using a validated kinematic analysis [1]. Limb stiffness indices were then calculated using portable floor scales to record ground reaction force (GRF), and an electrogoniometer to record metacarpophalangeal joint angle. Goniometric limb stiffness indices were subsequently measured in 11 horses ranging from 2 to 20 years of age, with no clinical evidence of SDFT injury. Strength and significance of correlation and agreement between the measurement methods was assessed and association between limb stiffness, limb (left vs. right), weight and age of horse and were calculated. Results There were strong positive correlations between GRF and joint angle (R2?=?0.98) and between the static and kinematic methods (R?=?0.78, P<0.01). There was a positive correlation between limb stiffness and weight (R2?=?0.85, P<0.01), but no association with age or limb. Conclusions This study validated the measurement of limb stiffness in a clinical setting. The positive correlation of limb stiffness and weight supports the theory of an optimised limb spring [2] for energy-efficient cursorial locomotion which may, in turn, provide a clinically-relevant measure of running efficiency and therefore the quality of tendon healing post injury.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The birthweight of Thoroughbred foals has increased in recent years. It is unknown whether this is associated with increased broodmare obesity or endocrine dysfunction. Objectives To determine insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations in obese and non-obese Thoroughbred mares throughout gestation and to investigate their association with foal birthweight. Study design Prospective, cohort study. Methods Fifty-seven pregnant Thoroughbred mares were included in the study. From 40 days post-breeding, body condition score (BCS), weight and venous blood samples were obtained every 60 days throughout gestation. Feed was withheld for 6?h before blood sampling. Serum/plasma insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations were measured using validated/standard methods. Foal birthweight was recorded. Association of hormone or triglyceride concentration with time, BCS and birthweight were analysed using a linear mixed effects model. A Pearson correlation co-efficient was calculated between hormone or triglyceride concentration, BCS and birthweight. Results Serum insulin concentrations were significantly greater (P<0.05) at 0?59 days compared with 240?299 days and at 60?119 days compared with 180?359 days gestation. 55% of mares had BCS?≥?7. There was 1.5% incidence of fasting hyperinsulinaemia throughout gestation and no association of fasting insulin concentration with BCS. Leptin concentration was significantly (P<0.0001) greater at 180?239 days compared with all other time points and was significantly (r?=?0.29, P<0.0003) correlated with BCS. Triglyceride concentration was significantly (P<0.02) greater at 240?299 days compared with earlier time points but was not associated with BCS. Foal birthweight was significantly positively correlated with BCS (r?=?0.13, P<0.001) and inversely correlated with leptin concentration at 60?119 days and 240?299 days gestation (r?=??0.64, P<0.05). Conclusions Mare BCS correlated with foal birthweight such that obese mares had heavier foals. Significant fasting hyperinsulinaemia was not identified in this population. Increased leptin concentration in early and late gestation was associated with decreased foal birthweight and may be useful to predict foal birthweight.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In cases of laminitis, an increased muscle force or contracture of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) is suggested, but evidence-based research is lacking. Objectives To test if the DDFM of laminitic equines shows an increased muscle force detectable by needle-EMG including Interference Pattern Analysis (IPA). Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Three groups consisted of Group 0 (control): 6 Royal Dutch Sport horses, 3 Shetland ponies and one Welsh pony (healthy, sound adults, mean?±?s.d. weight 411?±?217?kg). Group 1: 3 Royal Dutch Sport horses, one Friesian, one Haflinger, one Icelandic horse, 2 Welsh ponies, one miniature Appaloosa and 6 Shetland ponies (adults, mean?±?s.d. weight 310?±?172?kg) suffering from acute or chronic laminitis. EMG measurements including firing frequency (F) and IPA parameters Turns/Second (T), Amplitude/Turn (M) and Ratio M/T (R) were performed. ANOVA was used to analyse data. P values of P<0.05 were considered significant. Results Mean?±?s.d. F of Group 0 and Group 1 was 53?±?11 and 72?±?21?Hz, mean?±?s.d. T was 112?±?57 and 106?±?42, mean?±?s.d. M was 284?±?51 and 254?±?38??V and mean?±?s.d. R was 0.39?±?0.17 and 0.42?±?0.16%, respectively. The firing frequency of Group 1 was significantly higher compared to Group 0 (P?=?0.02), whereas other differences were not significant. Conclusions In human medicine, an increased firing frequency is a characteristic of increased muscle force [1,2]. Thus, the increased firing frequency of the DDFM in case of laminitis suggests an elevated muscle force. As all parameters show a high variance, a repeated study including a larger test group is advised. Ethical animal research:?Data collection from controls was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Utrecht University, approval number 2008.III.07.061 and 2013.III.01.012.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Blackthorn (Prunus spinosus) is recognised as causing infections and tissue reactions. Objectives To describe the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of blackthorn plant thorn synovitis in the horse. Study design Case series. Methods All cases in this prospective study presented with acute onset synovitis within 24?h of thorn penetration, had a standardised clinical assessment, surgical treatment and aftercare. Surgical treatment was performed within 24?h of presentation under general anaesthesia, using a 2-stage procedure: Stage 1: perisynovial technique. Ultrasound guided placement of a 20 gauge 35?mm needle marker that is used as a guide for electrosurgical dissection onto perisynovial thorn fragments. Stage 2: endoscopic technique. Using standard and novel portals to locate and remove thorn fragments and debris from synovial structures. Results Thirty-five cases met the study inclusion criteria over a 24 month period. Mean lameness score on presentation was 4/5 (range 1?5). The most commonly affected structures were fetlock joints (11/35) and tendon sheaths (10/35). Mean synovial fluid total protein was 50.5?g/l (range 18?116), and TNCC was 158?x?109 (range 21?412) on presentation and 12?x?109 (range 1?46) at 48?h post operatively. All synovial fluid cultures were negative. All horses were sound (grade 0) at 5 days post operatively and all returned to full work. Conclusions There are a limited number of case series of blackthorn injury in humans; however, the consensus is that surgical treatment is required for a successful outcome. The 2-stage surgical procedure described, achieved accurate identification and removal of thorn material in all cases. In contrast to previous studies on synovial sepsis, these cases had a positive outcome despite high pre- and post operative synovial fluid total protein and TNCC. These findings suggest that thorn synovitis cases have a different aetiology from synovitis originating from sepsis or contamination.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Triamcinolone is commonly used in equine practice for the treatment of orthopaedic conditions. A serious potential adverse effect of triamcinolone is laminitis. However, evidence for the risk of laminitis associated with triamcinolone use is limited. Objectives To determine the risk of laminitis within 90 days of triamcinolone administration and compare with the risk of laminitis in a veterinary-attended horse population. Study design Retrospective study of clinical records. Methods Text mining and data extraction was performed using content analysis software (SimStat-WordStat v.6) on a database of anonymous digital clinical records from a convenience sample of North American equine practices (n?=?9). Medical records were retrieved using a dictionary of keywords for 3 groups of horses: 1) treated with triamcinolone, 2) age and practice matched control population (no triamcinolone) and 3) all laminitic horses. Records of horses within Groups 1 and 2 were mined for evidence of laminitis within a 90-day period of treatment or a random date respectively. Data manipulation and analysis was performed using R v3.0.0 (R Development Core Team). The prevalence of laminitis within all groups was determined and relative risk of developing laminitis determined by single logistic regression. Results The clinical records of 225,777 horses were examined. Overall prevalence of laminitis within the database was 1.1% (n?=?2533). Triamcinolone was administered to 12.4% (n?=?27,898) horses and 0.07% of treated horses (n?=?20) developed laminitis. In the control population (n?=?56,695), 0.2% of horses (n?=?134) developed laminitis. The risk of developing laminitis was significantly lower in the triamcinolone treatment group than the control population (OR 0.3 95%CI, 0.18?0.48 P<0.001). Conclusions Triamcinolone treatment does not increase the overall risk of a horse developing laminitis. However, further investigation of risk factors for laminitis in the 20 horses identified by this preliminary study is warranted to aid development of evidence-based treatment guidelines.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Effective diagnosis of equine laminitis is necessary to allow prompt instigation of palliative and therapeutic treatments, yet there has been limited work regarding diagnostic accuracy. Objectives To compare the prevalence of clinical signs in laminitis and non-laminitis lamenesses to evaluate the capabilities of discrimination for differential diagnosis. Study design Analytical epidemiological study. Methods Veterinary practitioners completed a pre-designed checklist of laminitis-associated clinical signs identified by literature review, for equine lameness of any origin. A case was defined as a horse/pony with veterinary-diagnosed, clinically apparent laminitis, attended by a participating practitioner. Associations between clinical signs and case/control status were tested by logistic regression with adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with veterinary practice as a fixed effect, and Wald P-value calculated. Multivariable analysis using graphical classification tree-based statistical models allowed comprehension of the prevalence in the data associated with particular clusters of clinical signs. Results Data were collected for 588 laminitis cases and 201 non-laminitis lamenesses. The overall prevalence of specific clinical signs ranged from 2.7% for ?sole prolapse? to 85.0% for ?lame at trot?. Differences in prevalence ranged from ?14.1% for ?lame at trot? (more common in controls) to +71.9% for ?short stilted gait at walk? (more common in cases). Five clinical signs had a difference in prevalence of greater than +50%: ?reluctance to walk?, ?short, stilted gait at walk?, ?difficulty turning?, ?shifting weight? and ?increased digital pulse?. Bilateral forelimb lameness was the best discriminator (92% of animals with this clinical sign had laminitis). The additional presence of increased digital pulses improved this to 99%. Flat/convex sole, shifting weight and short stilted gait at walk were also useful discriminators. Conclusions This is the first study to provide information aiding diagnostic hypothetico-deductive reasoning based on clinical signs to differentially diagnose laminitis from other lamenesses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In man, pulmonary veins (PV) are of major importance in atrial fibrillation pathophysiology as ectopy often originates in atrial myocardial sleeves extending in the PV wall. In addition, PV size on ultrasound is used to assess left atrial volume overload. In horses, PV anatomy and ultrasound have hardly been studied. Objectives To study PV anatomy and establish a standard approach for echocardiographic identification of the PV from a right and left parasternal view. Study design Anatomical and echocardiographic description. Methods Firstly, post mortem left atrial and PV silicone corrosion casts were made in 10 horses to investigate normal PV anatomy. Secondly, left and right parasternal ultrasound images and silicone casts were made in 3 horses, to compare images and casts. Results Four major PV ostia were identified on the casts, draining specific lung areas. From a right parasternal longitudinal view, ostium III was identified between the right atrial wall and right pulmonary artery, and ostium II left-dorsal to it. From a left parasternal oblique short-axis view, ostium III, its antrum and side-branches were used as anatomical landmarks (adjacent to the right atrial wall). Slightly more caudal, ostium II was visualised with, in one horse, its antrum and 2 branches. Ostium I was only seen in one horse, slightly ventral to ostium II. Ostium IV was always identified in cross-section on a left short-axis view, left to the pulmonary artery bifurcation. Conclusions A standard echocardiographic approach allows identification of pulmonary veins in adult horses. Left oblique and short axis views were superior although right long-axis views also showed ostiums II and III. These data allow reference values to be established for pulmonary venous size and flow, and to investigate new treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic remains a life-threatening condition in the horse. Ischaemia and reperfusion following correction of small intestinal strangulation may produce oxidative stress. The ability to withstand oxidative stress depends on antioxidant levels and may be linked to horse survival. Objectives To measure peripheral antioxidant levels in horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy with small intestinal strangulation. Study design Case?control study. Methods Blood and plasma were collected from horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for small intestinal strangulation and stored at ?80°C. Controls involved non-colic horses. Total plasma glutathione was measured spectrophotometrically at 412?nm using the 5,5?-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) reaction. Samples containing scavenger (to remove reduced glutathione, GSH) were used to measure oxidised glutathione (GSSG). Glutathione reductase (GR) activity (u/l) was measured as the rate of GSH production at 412?nm. Glutathione peroxidise (GPx) activity (u/l) was measured as the change in optical density (340?nm) following the consumption of NADPH after GSSG production. All assays were purchased from BioAssay Systems (Hayward, California). Clinical data including arterial blood gas analysis were collected on admission. Results Glutathione reductase activity in horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions was significantly reduced compared to control horses (12.2?±?1.1?u/l vs. 15.9?±?0.8?u/l, P?=?0.03, n?=?6) whereas GPx activity did not significantly differ between colic and control horses (155.7?±?48.7?u/l vs. 167.3?±?30.1?u/l, P?=?0.84, n?=?6). Total glutathione, reduced or oxidised glutathione did not differ significantly between control and colic horses. A positive correlation existed between GR activity and Ca2+ (r?=?0.93) and K+ (r?=?0.75) whereas a strong negative correlation was present between GR activity and HCO3? (r?=??0.92) and PaCO2 (r?=??0.96). Conclusions Reduced plasma glutathione reductase activity with small intestinal strangulation indicates oxidative stress and may be related to systemic electrolyte/bicarbonate abnormalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists such as prucalopride are used as human prokinetics, since activation of 5-HT4 receptors on intestinal cholinergic neurons facilitates acetylcholine release. 5-HT4 receptors, linked to adenylyl cyclase, act via generation of cAMP. None of the 4 in vitro studies on 5-HT in horses provided evidence for neuronal 5-HT4 receptors, but none used the protocol as described in human studies [1?4]. Objectives To investigate whether functional 5-HT4 receptors are present in the equine small intestine. Study design and methods In vitro organ bath set up, applying electrical field stimulation (EFS) in longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips. Results Results were similar in both muscle layers. In the presence of 0.3?mmol/l NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 0.3??mol/l apamine, excluding effects of the inhibitory transmitters NO and ATP, EFS induced voltage-dependent on-contractions; these were neurogenic as they were abolished by 3??mol/l tetrodotoxin. At a voltage inducing 50% of the maximal amplitude, the submaximal EFS-induced contractions were cholinergic as atropine (1??mol/l) abolished them. Prucalopride (0.3??mol/l) did not increase the amplitude of these submaximal EFS-induced contractions. Even in the presence of the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, previously shown to enhance the effect of neuronal 5-HT4 receptors by inhibiting breakdown of their 2nd messenger cAMP [5], prucalopride (3??mol/l) had no influence. Also 5-HT (10??mol/l), a full agonist at 5-HT4 receptors, tested in the presence of methysergide and granisetron to exclude interaction with other 5-HT receptor subtypes, did not enhance EFS-induced submaximal contractions. Conclusions There is no evidence for presence of 5-HT4 receptors on the cholinergic neurons of the equine small intestine. These results question the application of 5-HT4 prokinetic drugs in horses.
