AB  - Reasons for performing study Infrared imaging is becoming popular as an aid to traditional diagnostic tools, its repeatability under practically relevant conditions is still discussed. Objectives We hypothesise that time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity affect thermography readings, and that there is no difference between values from left and right side. Study design Repeated thermography in a convenience sample. Methods Fifteen sound horses were thermographically imaged at 3 time points in the same day (08.00, 12.00 and 16.00?h). Images were taken of the following regions: neck, carpus, distolateral thoracic limbs (cranial and tendon areas), thoracolumbar, pelvis, hock and pelvic limb tendons. Relative humidity and ambient temperature were recorded for each session. Results There was a significant difference between the temperature readings during the 3 imaging sessions in all areas (Friedman and Kruskal?Wallis; all P<0.014). Ambient temperature and relative humidity correlated with thermography readings in the caudal imaging areas (P<0.008 [temperature], P<0.032 [humidity]) of the horses, with an exception of one hock reading, but not in all cranial areas (P<0.365 [temperature], P<0.992 [humidity]) (Spearman's Rho). All but 2 regions (minimum values in the carpus and thoracic tendon areas in the morning session, (P?=?0.033, 0.034) did not show significant difference between left and right sides at the same time of day (all P>0.057). Conclusions Time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity must be considered when using infrared imaging. Variations between the left and right sides of the horse can occur and should be considered during the analysis of pathological asymmetry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an electrophysiological technique used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) to evaluate the functional integrity of the descending motor fibres in the spinal cord. Successful application of the technique was reported in horses with spinal cord compression. However, limited data are available on the correlation of TMS with histopathological changes. Objectives To determine sensitivity of TMS for assessing the integrity of the spinal cord in horses with compressive lesions of the spinal cord. Study design Case series. Methods The study was conducted on 6 horses with spinal ataxia grade III-V/V admitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. The horses underwent TMS, radiography of the cervical or thoracolumbar vertebral column, and myelography (4/6). All horses were subjected to euthanasia and the spinal cord examined histopathologically. Results In 5/6 horses MMEPs with abnormal onset latencies in both extensor carpi radialis muscles and cranial tibialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a cervical spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed cervical vertebral malformation (4/5) with cervical vertebral canal stenosis (3/5) and tumour/osteomyelitis (1/5). In 1/6 horse MMEPs with normal onset latencies in extensor carpi radialis muscles and prolonged onset latencies in tibialis cranialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed deformation of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae. Myelography showed reduction in dural diameter and dorsal contrast column (4/4). Histopathological examination of the spinal cord confirmed compressive type lesions in all 6 horses with degenerative changes in the white matter of all funiculi, ballooning of myelin sheets, swollen axons, loss of axons and astroglial activation. Conclusions In this case series abnormal function of descending motor pathways as registered by TMS showed 100% sensitivity with the histopathological characteristics of compressive lesions in the spinal cord, but the number of horses is limited and further research is warranted.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Limited information exists on distribution of local anaesthetic solution following palmar digital nerve blocks. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves using 2 different volumes of contrast medium and 2 different injection sites. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves were performed at the level of or 2?cm proximal to the proximal aspect of the ipsilateral ungular cartilage, using 1.5 or 2.5?ml radiodense contrast medium. In total 96 injections were performed. Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately after injections and 10 and 20?min later. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After distal injections, the contrast medium was more localised around the injection site; after proximal injections the contrast patch had greater proximal-distal length. The greatest proximal diffusion was to 31.7% of the length of the proximal phalanx (from distal) after distal injections and to 70% after proximal injections. The larger volume resulted in significantly greater proximal diffusion than the smaller volume at the distal, but not at the proximal injection site (P<0.01). There was significant proximal diffusion with time after proximal and distal injections (P<0.01). In most limbs numerous radiopaque lines of various thickness extended proximally from the contrast patches; subjectively, their number and thickness were greater at the distal injection site. Conclusions Palmar digital nerve blocks at the level of the ungular cartilage using ≤2.5?ml local anaesthetic solution may improve proximal interphalangeal joint and pastern region pain. If using a more proximal site, distal fetlock region pain may be improved. Due to diffusion into lymphatic vessels, too small a volume at the distal injection site may not provide sufficient analgesia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A quantifiable measure of muscle activity related to the cervical spine may provide further understanding and evidence based support for chiropractic techniques. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a noninvasive method of measuring muscle activity of the splenius muscle when the horse is at rest. Objectives To determine if there is a relationship between objective measurable muscle parameters and misalignments and muscle tension in the equine cervical spine. Study design Controlled paired randomised study. Methods Privately owned horses (n?=?14), of mixed sex, age and mean height 157.8?cm were selected and assigned a group by matching work, management regime, age, sex and breed. The treatment group (n?=?7) underwent manual chiropractic treatment following palpation. The control group underwent palpation only. A Delsys 4 sensor system was used for data collection. Probes were positioned on the muscle halfway between C1/C2 joint and the crest on the left and right sides, between the tendon insertion and the motor point to maximise signals. sEMG readings were taken at immediately before (0) and after palpation (PP) and 30?min later (30). Data were tested for normality and variance by one-way ANOVA and paired t test. Results Post treatment, there was a significant decrease (P<0.01) in sEMG activity for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There was a significant decrease (P<0.05) in sEMG for right side for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There were no such significant effects for the control group. The majority (83%) of horses had atlas rotation and tilt to the right. Conclusions This preliminary study supports use of sEMG as a means of assessing muscle activity of equines and suggests a statistically significant reduction in splenius muscle activity is observed following manual chiropractic treatment although the benefit to the horse is unknown.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?≥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?≥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin ≥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype.

AB  - Reason for performing study Measurement of lactate in horses with colic has been described for over 20 years. Objectives To systematically review the evidence on the use of plasma and/or peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS scoring system. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to colic; 32 studies related to the use of lactate in the diagnosis of colic, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using QUADAS. Both papers investigated the use of plasma and peritoneal lactate to identify strangulating intestinal lesions. Both were cross-sectional studies, and together they evaluated a total of 71 horses with confirmed strangulating lesions. Appraisal of the studies using the QUADAS tool was performed. Both papers met QUADAS criteria relating to study design and data analysis, but the QUADAS tool did highlight some limitations in terms of sample and control groups in both papers. Data analysis varied, with one study developing a model to predict the presence of a strangulating lesion, which included peritoneal lactate and other measurements, and the other study assessing optimal predictive values associated with concentrations of peritoneal lactate. Both studies concluded that peritoneal lactate was a more useful diagnostic test than blood lactate. Conclusions Despite the large numbers of publications reporting use of lactate, only a small number used study designs considered suitable for evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy as proposed by the Cochrane Library. Although the current evidence is limited, there is agreement on the value of peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for strangulating intestinal lesions. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ethmoidal infection with Aspergillus spp. is rarely reported in horses. Three horses suffering from unilateral infection with Aspergillus spp. of the ethmoid with varying underlying conditions are described. Study design Case series. Methods Diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the ethmoid (presence of white mycotic plaques on a layer of thick yellow mucus) and confirmed by fungal culture (A. fumigatus) and/or cytology. Clinical details and outcome were obtained from the medical records and by contacting owners. Results Horse 1 and 2 had a progressive ethmoid haematoma (PEH) and had been treated for over 5 months with repeated formalin injections (one horse after initial surgical debulking of the PEH that also invaded the maxillary and sphenopalatine sinuses) before the infection with Aspergillus was diagnosed. The third horse, presented with poor performance and nasal discharge, had congenitally abnormal anatomy of the right dorsal nasal passage and right ethmoids. In the 2 horses with PEH the mycotic plaques were removed transendoscopically successfully. After 6 weeks the infection was no longer present at endoscopy in both horses (follow-up endoscopy: Horse 1 no relapse >16 months and Horse 2 no relapse >7 months). In the third horse, it was not possible to remove all mycotic plaques, therefore systemic treatment with itraconazole (3?mg/kg bwt q. 12?h for 8 weeks orally) was started. After 8 weeks, the clinical signs had resolved and endoscopy showed that the Aspergillus infection had cleared (follow-up: no relapse >14 months). No side effects were seen with systemic itraconazole treatment. Conclusions In horses with underlying ethmoidal conditions, secondary infection with Aspergillus spp. may occur. Transendoscopic removal of the mycotic plaques alone may be successful and if this approach is not feasible or unsuccessful, systemic treatment with itraconazole can be considered.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recent studies evaluating owner sound horses have identified a large proportion of horses with motion asymmetries but the prevalence, type and magnitude of asymmetries have not been investigated. The increasing use of objective lameness evaluation necessitates a further characterisation of the differences between lameness and motion asymmetries. Objectives To investigate prevalence, and quantify type and magnitude of motion asymmetries during straight-line trot in riding horses, perceived sound by their owners. Study design Cross-sectional prospective study. Methods Vertical head and pelvic movement symmetry was measured in 220 Warmblood riding horses, all functioning in daily work and considered sound by their owners; 100 of these individuals had been included in a previous report [1]. Body-mounted uni-axial accelerometers were used and differences between maximum and minimum head (HDmax, HDmin) and pelvic (PDmax, PDmin) vertical displacement between left and right forelimb and hindlimb stances were calculated during straight-line trot. Previously used symmetry thresholds (absolute differences >6?mm for the head and >3?mm for the pelvic variables) were used. Results The thresholds for symmetry were exceeded for 159 horses (72%) for at least one variable, HDmax (n?=?41, mean 12.7?mm, s.d. 5.5), HDmin (n?=?58, mean 14.3?mm, s.d. 7.1), PDmax (n?=?87, mean 6.5?mm, s.d. 3.10), PDmin (n?=?77, mean 5.7?mm, s.d. 2.1). Contralateral and ipsilateral concurrent fore- and hindlimb asymmetries were detected in 41 and 49 horses, respectively. Conclusions A surprisingly large proportion (72%) of horses perceived as sound by their owner showed movement asymmetries during straight-line trot. It is not known to what extent these asymmetries are related to pain or mechanical abnormalities as opposed to ?normal variation? and this leads to 2 potential welfare problems ? either too many horses in training are actually ?lame? or many horses categorised as ?lame? have no locomotor system disease. Ethical animal research:?This study was conducted within guidelines of the participating sites institutional animal care and use procedures (C 206/10, C48/13) and informed consent for data collection was obtained from the horse owners prior to the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It has been suggested that ultrasonography is unreliable for the detection of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) based on comparison between ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance images. Objectives To compare ultrasonography with gross and histopathological post mortem examination in horses with PSD diagnosed based on the response to local anaesthesia and ultrasonography. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Nineteen horses with hindlimb PSD were humanely destroyed. The ultrasonographic abnormalities were graded prospectively as mild, moderate or severe based on predefined criteria. Thirty-seven lame limbs were examined grossly and 36 suspensory ligaments (SLs) were examined histologically. The histological images were graded blindly based on predefined criteria (0?3 for each tissue type; 0?=?normal, 3?=?severe abnormality). Descriptive statistics were performed. Results Ultrasonographic lesions were graded moderate in 31/38 (81.6%) and severe in 7/38 (18.4%) limbs; in 4/36 (11.1%) limbs adhesion formation between the proximal aspect of the SL and the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon was predicted. Gross post mortem examination revealed substantial adhesions between the proximal aspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissues in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs; in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs there were adhesions between the body of the SL and the mid plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone, extending distally in 6 (16.2%) limbs. Histology revealed abnormalities (grades 1?3) of the collagenous tissue in 25/36 (69.4%) limbs. Muscle was abnormal (grades 1?3) in 35/36 (97.2%) limbs and adipose tissue (grades 1?3) in 16/36 (44.4%) limbs. Neural abnormalities (grades 1?3) were seen in 23/36 (63.9%) limbs and vascular changes (grade 1 and 2) in 2/36 (5.6%) limbs. In 1/36 limbs no abnormality was detected. Conclusions Ultrasonography was reasonably reliable for the detection of SL pathology based on histology as a gold standard, but the ability to detect gross adhesions was limited.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Sagittal plane slab fractures of the third carpal bone are a recognised injury in the racehorse. One study [1] reported 32 horses with sagittal fractures, 69% raced again. Surgical management appeared beneficial, with all horses that underwent inter-fragmentary compression racing again. Objectives To document the success rate following sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone in UK-based racehorses, and to compare conservative and surgical management. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Inclusion criteria were Thoroughbred racehorses with a simple sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone. Exclusion criteria were comminuted fractures, radial carpal bone fractures and short incomplete linear lucencies. Fractures were classified as complete, incomplete or uncertain. Time from injury to next race was recorded. Success rates were compared by Fisher's exact test. Results Forty horses were identified. Two were subjected to euthanasia and 3 have <6 months follow-up. Eleven were managed nonsurgically of which 4 (36%) were complete (5 uncertain) and 7 (64%) raced, 154?508 days following injury (median 242 days). Twenty-seven horses underwent surgery to place a single 3.5?mm (n?=?26) or 4.5?mm (n?=?1) lag screw under arthroscopic guidance, of which 18 (67%) were complete. Thirteen (48%) raced again 147?711 days following surgery (median 256 days) P?=?0.48. Of 23 horses with complete fractures 13 (57%) raced again, compared with 5/15 (33%) horses with incomplete fractures P?=?0.2. Of horses with complete fractures, 10/18 (55%) underwent surgery and raced again compared to 3/4 (75%) horses managed conservatively P?=?0.62. Conclusions The results confirm that the prognosis for athletic function is favourable but do not suggest that surgery is beneficial, or necessary for complete fractures. The numbers managed conservatively are small and it was not clear radiographically if the fracture was complete in 5/11 horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Previous studies show the effect of toe or heel wedges on tendon strain but there is little understanding of the effect of other shoe types. Objectives To quantify the effect of different shoeing conditions on the strain in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), distal check ligament (ALDDFT) and suspensory ligament (SL). Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Twelve equine cadaver forelimbs were loaded onto a force plate mimicking stance phase. Markers were placed proximally and distally in each tendon structure and tracked using a motion capture system and strain was calculated. Tendon strain was determined for the following conditions: barefoot, glue on heart bar and aluminium racing plates with and without packing material. Data were analysed using a mixed effects model. Results Significant variation in strain was observed between tendons. The DDFT had the lowest strain, then the ALDDFT, SDFT and SL. Glue on heart bar shoes significantly increased SDFT and SL strain compared to barefoot for the same leg force. Aluminium racing plates without packing material increased ALDDFT and SDFT strain and with packing material increased ALDDFT and SL. Conclusions Shoe selection should be based on minimising strain in the tendon with greatest injury risk. Aluminium racing plates with packing material may be most appropriate for the majority of racehorses as they do not significantly increase SDFT strain.

Gelatins could provide useful substitutes for HES should similar adverse effects be identified in horses. Objectives To compare the effects of a 4% modified fluid gelatin (MFG) with a 130/0.4 6% tetrastarch (TES) on haemodilution, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), haemostasis and renal parameters in healthy ponies. Study design Randomised crossover. Methods Three treatments (A?=?10?ml/kg bwt TES, B?=?10?ml/kg bwt MFG and C?=?20?ml/kg bwt MFG) were administered to 6 healthy ponies with a one-week washout period. Packed cell volume (PCV), total serum protein (TSP), COP, platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thromboelastography (TEG) were measured at baseline and at multiple time points up to 24?h post infusion. Serum creatinine, urine specific gravity (USG), urine protein:creatinine (UPC), urine GGT:creatinine (UGC) and urine sediment examination (USE) were performed before and 24?h after each treatment, and one week after the final treatment. Results All treatments caused significant haemodilution and increases in COP with treatment C having a significantly greater effect on PCV than other treatments. The platelet count decreased with all treatments and was significantly lower for treatment C compared with treatment B. No significant differences were observed in any TEG parameter within or between treatments. No significant differences in PT, aPTT or fibrinogen were observed between treatments. Serum creatinine, UGC and UPC did not change significantly pre- and post study. USG and USE remained within normal limits. Conclusions 4% MFG could be considered as an alternative to 130/0.4 6% TES for volume expansion and oncotic support. Neither MFG nor TES were associated with clinically significant adverse effects on haemostasis or renal parameters.

AB  - Reasons for performing study New therapeutic strategies to modulate immune responses in human and equine allergic airway diseases are under extensive investigation. Stimulation of Treg cells with immune modulating agents is a novel therapeutic option. Objectives The aim of this field study was to compare the effects of a nebulised nanoparticulate CpG immunotherapy (CpG-GNP) with and without specific allergens. Study design Longitudinal clinical study comparing 2 therapeutic options. Methods Twenty RAO-affected horses were divided into 2 treatment groups (CpG alone and CpG with allergens). Two specific allergens were selected for each horse according to anamnesis and a functional in vitro test. Treatments were given by nebulisation 7 times and the horses were examined 3 times: baseline (I), after the treatment course (II), and after 6 weeks later (III). Clinical parameters, indirect intrapleural measurement, arterial blood gas, amount of tracheal mucus and neutrophil percentage were evaluated. Results CpG alone resulted in a significant improvement in clinical parameters and a significant reduction of tracheal mucus after treatment and at 6 weeks post treatment. After CpG plus specific allergens, there was significant improvement of 70% of examined parameters. However, there were no significant differences in the results compared with CpG-GNP treatment alone. Conclusions There were no significant differences between treatment groups. CpG-GNP immunotherapy alone produced a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory parameters and may have potential as for treatment of equine and human allergic inflammatory airway diseases. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the regional legal agency for animal experiments of the Government of Bavaria, Germany (No. 55.2-1-54-2531-31-10). Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Partly supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Germany) (GE'2044/4-1).

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little data on BALF cytokine profiles are available from racehorses with IAD; cytological diagnosis being most frequently made from one lung only per horse. Objectives To compare cytokine mRNA expressions and protein concentrations in BALF from both lungs of horses with unilateral IAD-consistent cytology. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods As part of a larger study, 250?ml saline was randomly instilled in one lung and 500?ml in the contralateral lung of 30 clinically healthy Standardbred racehorses. This procedure was repeated 72?h later, inversing the volume per lung. Cytological cut-off values for IAD diagnosis was neutrophil proportions >10% when instilling 250?ml. For these samples, mRNA expression and concentrations of IL-1?, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-? were determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Results Eleven horses had BALF with IAD- and CTL-consistent cytology from, respectively, each lung, and were enrolled in the study (22 samples). Data were not significantly influenced by the sampling day, and BALF total cell counts or cytokine concentrations were not significantly different among lungs. Relative mRNA expression of IL-1? (3.887?±?3.082; P?=?0.01) and IL-10 (3.225?±?1.710; P?=?0.005) were significantly higher in BALF of IAD- compared to CTL consistent lungs (respectively 1.408?±?1.118 and 1.488?±?1.393); and also correlated to neutrophil proportions (respectively r?=?0.54; P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.65; P?=?0.001). Conclusions Differences in cytokine mRNA expression were associated with IAD- or CTL consistent BALF cytology in the same racehorses in training. These findings suggest that specific local immune reactions or regulation within the lower airways should be considered in IAD. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Regional Animal Ethic Committee, and informed consent was provided by all horse owners.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is the most common equine emergency problem, and one of the main causes of equid deaths. The horse owners' ability to recognise colic is a critical first step in determining case outcome. Objectives To assess equine owners' knowledge and recognition of colic. Study design Online questionnaire of horse owners. Methods An online survey was designed to evaluate owners' approach to colic in the horse. The survey included questions on owner demographics, their recognition of colic (including owner's opinions of their ability to recognise colic, their approach, and their recognition of colic using case vignettes), and their knowledge of normal ranges for clinical parameters. Descriptive and chi squared statistical analysis was performed. Results The survey was completed by 1061 UK respondents. Six per cent of owners thought they could recognise all types of colic, 61% said they could recognise most cases and 30% said they could recognise some but not all cases. Owners said they would assess faecal output (73% of respondents), gastrointestinal sounds (69%), respiratory rate (62%) and heart rate (50%) in horses with suspected colic. One fifth (22%) of owners would call a vet immediately without assessing any parameters. Many respondents either did not know, or provided incorrect estimates of normal values for clinical parameters: 30.4% were ?unsure? of the normal heart rate and 35.5% gave heart rate values which were outside reference ranges; only 24.5% gave appropriate values for normal respiratory rates and only 31% gave normal temperature values. There was no statistical significance between participants' age, educational qualifications, or their experience with horses and their knowledge of normal clinical parameters. Conclusions Owners varied in their approach and ability to recognise colic, and many had significant gaps in their knowledge of normal parameters. Educational materials and/or training to assist owners could help address these issues. Ethical animal research:?The study did not involve animal research. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The questionnaire was conducted in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act, and the British Educational Research Association's Revised Ethical Guidelines for Educational Research (2004).

AB  - Reasons for performing study Inflammation is key in the development of post operative ileus in rodents, with a similar pathogenesis likely occurring in other species. Dexamethasone reduces inflammation and therefore could help reduce post operative ileus in the horse. Objectives To determine if dexamethasone reduces post operative ileus in horses with small intestinal disease, and assess the effect on incisional health and short-term survival. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Fifteen horses that underwent small intestinal resection and anastomosis were given 0.1?mg/kg bwt dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX). Data from a comparable number of horses that did not receive dexamethasone (NoDEX) was collected retrospectively and sequentially. Horses were matched for the type of resection performed. Fisher's Exact and Student's t tests were used for data analysis. Results There was no significant difference in the amount of nasogastric reflux (litres) (DEX 8.06?±?17.12, NoDEX 10.02?±?24.03, P?=?0.39) produced or in the number of horses that produced nasogastric reflux post operatively. There was no difference in survival to discharge. The severity of incisional discharge/infection was significantly different between groups when scored 0?3 (0 being no discharge and 3 being severe discharge/infection), (P?=?0.01), in favour of DEX (2/15 horses affected) vs. NoDEX (7/15). Conclusions Dexamethasone did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the incidence of post-operative ileus. Administration of a single dose of dexamethasone does not appear to have a detrimental effect on short-term survival or on incisional complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infiltrative disease of the intestine is an important cause of weight loss in the horse. Infiltration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the intestinal wall and intestinal fibrosis cause changes in the integrity of the intestinal wall. This may lead to altered intestinal permeability which can be measured using the contrast medium iohexol. Objectives To determine if iohexol intestinal permeability, as evaluated by serum iohexol concentration, could be used to differentiate between healthy horses and horses with infiltrative disease of the large colon. Study design Prospective non-randomised controlled clinical trial. Methods Six healthy adult horses and 4 horses with chronic infiltrative disease of the large colon were used in the study. Infiltrative disease was confirmed on post mortem in all cases, and included alimentary lymphoma and mycobacterial granulomatous enterocolitis. Following a 16-h fast, each horse was dosed with 1.0?ml/kg bwt of iohexol as a 10% solution via nasogastric intubation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480?min after dosing. Iohexol concentration was determined using HPLC-UV and the differences between the groups were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. Results There was a statistically significant difference in iohexol serum concentration between the diseased and nondiseased horses (P?=?0.001). The overall difference in the mean iohexol concentration between the 2 groups was 6.07 (95% CI 3.19?8.96)??g/ml, however there appeared to be a trend towards increasing difference at later time points (240, 300, 360?min). Conclusions The iohexol permeability test has potential as a diagnostic tool for estimation of intestinal permeability in horses with infiltrative intestinal disease. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the test can be used to determine the site of intestinal pathology, predict the prognosis and potentially evaluate the response to treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season. Restoration of fertility in this study was lower than that previously reported and potential reasons for this include limited pre-surgical diagnostic testing, differing prior pathologies or reasons for sub-fertility, and case selection.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine whether horses could become infected with cyathostomins when bedded in deep litter straw. Objectives The specific objective of the study was to determine whether cyathostomin eggs could hatch and develop to infective larval stages on straw bedding. Study design Experimental study. Methods Four horticultural incubators were set up to simulate 3 straw bedding scenarios, and one grass turf control. Faeces were placed on 12 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass over a 17-day period. The plots within incubators A, B, and C contained dry straw, watered straw, and deep litter straw, respectively. Plot 1 of each incubator contained a faecal pat of a horse that tested negative for strongyle eggs ? these were to serve as negative control plots. Plots 2 and 3 of each incubator contained a faecal pat from horses that had average faecal worm egg counts (FWEC) of 269 epg and 921 epg, respectively. A thermostat within each incubator was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 20°C. Results No L3 larvae were recovered from the control plots of each incubator, and none were recovered from any of the plots within Incubator A. L3 larvae were first detected on plots 2 and 3 of Incubator B on Day 8, and on plot 3 of incubators C and D on Day 10. Conclusions It is evident that equine Cyathostominae can develop to infective L3 larvae on straw bedding, but only when the straw is moist. Therefore, it may be speculated that a horse bedded in deep litter straw may become infected by ingesting the infective L3 larvae contaminating the straw. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.
