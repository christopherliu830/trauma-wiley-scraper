AB  - Reasons for performing study Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF), causing epizootic lymphangitis (EZL), is endemic in parts of Africa including, Ethiopia, Senegal and Gambia. Despite its high prevalence, impact on animal welfare and socio-economic importance, there is little evidence upon which to build practical disease control strategies. The performance and availability of diagnostic tests currently used by clinicians is problematic. Methods such as pattern recognition of clinical signs and microscopy lack specificity and other reported methods are either not commercially available or not readily feasible in these settings (e.g. culture). This is a significant barrier to further understanding this disease within endemic countries. Objectives To validate a nested PCR method to confirm the presence of HCF in equine clinical samples. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Twenty-nine horses with suspected EZL were included from topographically varied regions of Ethiopia. Clinical data, lesion location drawn onto equine silhouettes, blood samples and aspirates of pus from cutaneous nodules were obtained before treatment provided by SPANA clinic. Blood and clinical data were collected from a further 20 horses with no cutaneous EZL lesions. Giemsa stained impression smears of pus were examined microscopically. Aliquots of heat-inactivated pus and blood were inoculated onto Whatman FTA cards and imported to the UK with Defra approved licensing. A nested PCR targeting the ITS region, was used to identify samples containing HCF and PCR products were sequenced. Results HCF was confirmed in heat-inactivated FTA card pus samples from 24 horses, additionally, 23 blood samples were positive from EZL suspected cases. Bioinfomatic analyses suggested that there was diversity within the ITS region among these HCF products. Conclusions These PCR techniques allow the rapid diagnosis of HCF directly from equine clinical samples. The identification of HCF in blood raises questions about the pathogenesis of HCF in horses and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Atrial fibrillation is a common equine arrhythmia. Quinidine alone, or with digoxin are common treatments. Studies on outcome in Warmblood populations in which duration of the AF is often unknown are limited. Objectives To identify the factors that are associated with the success of full treatment cardioversion with oral medication, and establish whether there are differences in these factors between institutions. Study design Retrospective case series using patient records of Equine University Clinic of Utrecht University and Rossdales Equine Hospital, Newmarket. Methods Forty-nine horses treated with quinidine were identified (29 Warmbloods, 20 Thorougbreds, 1 Anglo-Arabian). Details of signalment, history, duration physical examination and echocardiography including left atrial size and presence of mitral regurgitation were retrieved. Clinical details including mean weight, age and left atrial size were compared between clinics using independent samples t test. Association between variables and cardioconversion were evaluated in a backwards logistic regression using Akaike's information criterium (AIC) and odds ratios were calculated. Factors were sex, clinic, breed, mitral regurgitation, duration and poor performance. Covariates were age, weight and the size of the left atrium. Significance was set at 0.05. Results Fifty-one horses (mean age 8.8?s.d. 4.5 years) were treated with quinidine sulfate, 18 also received digoxin. Eighty per cent converted to sinus rhythm. In 8 horses the known duration was less than 3 months. The only factor associated with successful treatment was the use of digoxin in combination with quinidine sulfate (odds ratio 12.4; 95% CI 2.61 and 91.85 according to AIC analysis). Conclusions In this retrospective case series, there is much potential for bias in the data; however, the use of digoxin in addition to quinidine was associated with improved conversion rates regardless of breed even though AF duration was unknown in most horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Every year, several equine influenza (EI) epidemics are reported worldwide. Equine influenza vaccination is the most efficient method of prevention; however, not all horses develop sufficient immunity after EI immunisation, increasing the risk of infection, infectious virus excretion and the spread of the disease. Objectives This study aimed to better understand poor vaccine response mechanisms during the primary EI vaccination. Study design Cohort study. Methods The EI humoral immune response was measured in 118 Thoroughbred foals set in 3 different stud farms (SF#1 to SF#3) after the primary course of EI vaccination. All foals were immunised with a recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, following the vaccine manufacturer's recommendations. The age at first vaccination was 4 to 8 months. Sera were tested by single radial haemolysis (SRH) against the A/equine/Jouars/4/2006 EIV strain (Florida clade 2) at the time of the first vaccination (V1), 2 weeks and 3 months after the second immunisation (V2), 2 days and 3 months after the third immunisation (V3). Results Short (V2?+?2 weeks) and mid-term (V3?+?3 months) SRH antibody levels were statistically different between the stud farms (P-value?=?0.0011 and 0.003, respectively), with SF#1<SF#3<SF#2 and SF#1 SRH antibody titres below the protection threshold (i.e. 85?mm2) at all time points studied. SRH antibody levels induced by EI vaccination were related to the age of foals at the first immunisation (SF#1 median age 143 days, SF#2 median age 181 days and SF#3 median age 156 days), but were independent of the presence of maternal derived antibodies (MDA; P-value 0.41). Given the results in SF#1, a booster immunisation (V4) was brought forward to restore protective levels of antibody. Conclusion Independently of the presence of MDA, the age of foals at first immunisation plays an important role in the establishment of adequate antibody levels. Ethical animal research:?All animal work received ethical approval, and consent was obtained from the owners. Sources of funding:?This study was supported by the Basse-Normandie Region council (France) and the European Regional Development Fund. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - 1 Koichi Akaike, 2 Shigeya Tanaka, 3 Shin-ichi Imamura, 1 Hideshi Tojo, 1 Motofumi Kasugai, 1 Hideyuki Matsukubo, 1 Tatsuro Yamaguchi, 1 Norihiko Sakoda, and 1 Akira Sano ( 1 Department of Psychiatry, Field of Social and Behavioral Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental, Kagoshima, Kagoshima, Japan ; 2 Neurosurgery, Tanaka Neurosurgical Clinic, Kagoshima, Kagoshima, Japan ; and 3 Department of Neurosurgery, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental, Kagoshima, Kagoshima, Japan ) Rationale: Previously we reported that hippocampal transection attenuated kainic acid (KA)?induced acute amygdalar seizures. (Akaike et.al, 2001, Imamura et. al., 2001, 2003). The prior studies suggested that such changes of epileptogenicity are related to neurotransmitters, whereas the biochemical mechanism including monoamine changes in this procedure remains obscure. In present study, we investigated the effect of hippocampal transection on KA?induced acute amygdalar seizures by evaluating intrahippocampal changes of monoamine. Methods: Sixteen male Wistar rats were prepared for this study. Stereotactic operation was performed under pentobarbital anesthesia (40 mg/kg i.p.). For microinjection, a stainless steel cannula with an inner needle guide was inserted into the left basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA). The rats were also divided into two groups: controls (without transection + KA injection, n = 8), TR group (with transection + KA injection, n = 8). Hippocampal transection was performed by using ? Neurotransecter; ? a flexible arc-shaped blade (diameter, 0.2 mm) made from shape memory alloy placed inside a straight guide cannula (diameter, 0.8 mm). Hippocampal transection was done according to our previous methods (Imamura et al., 2001). On the seventh days after operation, all rats received 1.0mg of KA solution. Two hours after KA injection, animals were decapitated and the ipsilateral hippocampus were removed, then separated to dorsal and ventral portions. Intrahippocampal monoamine including noradrenaline (NA), homovanillic acid (HVA), dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) then were quantitatively measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Data were analyzed statistically between TR group and controls by using Student's t-test. Results: Comparing with the dorsal hippocampus, intrahippocampal monoamine in the ventral hippocampus were higher. According to 5-HT and 5-HIAA in TR group were higher in controls, especially in the ventral hippocampus. The rest were unaltered. Conclusions: The effect of hippocampal transection in acute amygdalar seizures is likely to be associated with the changes of 5HT and 5HIAA.

Anschel, 2 Bernd Foerster, 3 Tetsuya Yuasa, 2,4 Helene Benveniste, 5 Zhong Zhong, 2 James Hainfeld, and 2 Avraham Dilmanian ( 1 Neurology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY ; 2 Medical, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY ; 3 Engineering, University of Yamagata, Yamagata, Japan ; 4 Anesthesiology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY ; and 5 Physics, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY ) Rationale: The use of radiosurgery to non-invasively treat epileptic foci is currently an active topic of clinical and preclinical research. Modalities such as proton beams, Gamma Knife and Cyber Knife have allowed for some recent advances over the traditional linear accelerator. A primary limitation of these techniques remains unwanted damage to brain and other tissues outside of the targeted area. We report the use of parallel x-ray microplanar beams in an ?interlaced? geometry to deliver a dose to a 3.8 x 3.8 x 3.8 mm3 region of the rat's cerebrum. It has been established that arrays of parallel, synchrotron-generated x-ray microplanar beams (microbeams) spare normal tissue, including the CNS. Interlaced microbeams have the advantage, over conventional beams, of a) sparing the normal CNS outside the target, and b) having an extremely sharp dose fall off at the edge of the target volume. Methods: A normal rat brain was focally irradiated in vivo to study the method's efficacy in precisely necrotizing brain tissue. The rat was positioned vertically using a plastic stereotactic frame, and was irradiated with two orthogonal arrays of 1 mm beam thickness and 1.36 mm beam spacing on-center. The interlaced volumes width was 3.8 mm and its height was 3.7 mm (i.e. 3 microplanar beams in the array). The rat was irradiated superior-to- inferior and laterally with 100 Gy in-beam incident dose although one microplanar beam in the superior-to-inferior irradiation inadvertently delivered a higher dose. The rat was imaged using a 9.4 T MRI at regular intervals. Results: The results show a gradually developing lesion at the site of the interlaced beams. The lesion began as a high T2 signal only, but advanced to include a central area of low T1 and T2 signal within 2 months. No lesion was observed in the other side of the brain which was exposed to non-interlaced microbeams only. Figure 1 shows a T2 weighted image taken 7 weeks post treatment. Conclusions: Interlaced MRT is an effective method to create focal brain microlesions. This technique may allow the future treatment of epileptic foci not accessible by surgical or more traditional radiosurgical means. (Supported by NIH NINDS grant NS43231, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, U.S. Department of Energy.) 1,2 Stephane Auvin, 1 Don Shin, 1 Justin Miyamoto, and 1,3 Raman Sankar ( 1 Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 2 Pediatric Neurology, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France ; and 3 Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Prolonged febrile seizures and status epilepticus (SE) have been implicated as predisposing factors for temporal lobe epilepsy and/or hippocampal sclerosis. Inflammatory responses have been shown to have long term consequences on the developing brain following kainic acid. We have previously shown an age specific pattern of neuronal injury following lithium-pilocarpine (LiPC) induced SE. Here, we assess the contribution of varying degrees of inflammation in the immature rat brain. Methods: Rats were pretreated 16?20hr with 3mEq LiCl (i.p.), followed by 60mg/kg PC (s.c.) to induce SE at postnatal day 14 (P14). In order to induce an inflammatory response, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected i.p. at 10?g/kg or 50?g/kg, two hours prior to the induction of seizures. Rats were monitored for behavioural onset of SE and only those that reached at least stage 3 (modified Racine scale) were included. Four doses of LPS were studied: SE with saline injection (SE), SE+LPS 10?g/kg (SE+LPS10), SE+LPS 50?g/kg (SE+LPS50), and SE+LPS 250?g/kg (SE+LPS250). Rats were killed 24hr after the start of SE, and their brains cut at 8 microns for cell counts using H p < 0.05). No differences in counts were observed among the groups in CA3, hilus and dentate granule cells. Conclusions: We have previously demonstrated that prolonged LiPC SE in P14 rat pups does not result in substantial hippocampal neuronal injury beyond area CA1 and that a small population of these animals go on to exhibit spontaneous seizures. Inducing an inflammatory response does not seem to exacerbate injury in those resistant regions at this age, but does worsen the neuronal population, CA1, that is vulnerable in the lithium-pilocarpine model of SE. Furthermore, the level of inflammation can contribute to the amount of neuropathological sequelae. Whether the exacerbation of this injury has long term consequences is under investigation. (Supported by AEAC Association (SA), NS046516  and 2 Psychology, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, PE, Canada ) Rationale: We have previously reported on a seizure-like syndrome (NIS-L) in adult rats treated with low doses of kainate agonists during postnatal development. NIS-L is characterized by reproducible behavioural sequelae reminiscent of a stage 2 seizure, that manifests on exposure to a novel environment, such as the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Analysis of hippocampal cytoarchitecture in 17 month old rats expressing NIS-L has revealed hippocampal changes that resemble those observed in conventional animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), including mossy fiber sprouting (abnormal growth of dentate granule cell axons) in the inner molecular layer (IML) of the dentate gyrus and in the stratum oriens of area CA3. The purpose of the current study was to explore this abnormal axonal growth in younger animals and in greater detail. Methods: SD rats were injected daily with either saline (n = 23) or subconvulsive doses of the kainate agonist domoic acid (n = 25) from post-natal day 8?14. When the animals reached adulthood two-thirds of each treatment group where exposed to the MWM and the incidence of the NIS-L syndrome was recorded. Hippocampal anatomy was then analyzed using Timm's stain for mossy fiber sprouting (15 sections per animal). Sprouting was assessed using density analysis software in conjunction with a standard qualitative scale. Mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) was assessed in the IML of the dentate gyrus, as well as in the stratum oriens and stratum lucidum of area CA3. Separate analyses were conducted for the dorsal, mid and ventral portions of the hippocampus. Results: Results indicated that drug treated animals displayed increased IML MFS in the mid (F = 9.457; p = .004) and ventral (F = 8.063; p = .007) but not the dorsal (F = 1.632; p = .208) portions of the hippocampus. A significant increase in Timm's staining in treated animals was also detected in the stratum lucidum of area CA3 in the middle portion of the hippocampus (F = 7.715; p-.008). No significant increase in Timm's staining was detected in the stratum oriens of area CA3. Conclusions: These results confirm previous findings that perinatal injections of very low doses of kainate agonists produces increases in MFS in the IML of the dentate gyrus. Treated animals also display increased Timm's staining in the stratum lucidum of area CA3. However, unlike previous results in aged animals, no increase in MFS in the stratum oriens of area CA3 was detected in young adult animals. We conclude that treated animals display patterns of seizure-like behaviour and MFS that closely mimic those seen in clinical cases of TLE. (Supported by Natural Sciences and Egineering Research Council of Canada Atlantic Innovation Fund (ACCBR) Prince Edward Island Health Research Program, UPEI.) 1 Edward Bertram, 1 John Williamson, 1 Michael Johnson, and 2 Peter Edelbroek ( 1 Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; and 2 Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry, Epilepsy Institute of the Netherlands (SEIN), Heemstede, Netherlands ) Rationale: Although there has been a consensus that the use of animal models with spontaneous seizures to identify new therapies may enhance the discovery process for new drugs, there are a number of technical issues that may limit or prevent the implementation of this approach. One of the greatest impediments is the maintenance of steady drug levels in the blood throughout the day over multiple days to ensure that there will be adequate levels in the system at the time the animals may have unpredictable spontaneous seizures. We describe a method for chronically administering antiepileptic drugs and measuing levels while the animals are on continuous video EEG monitoring. Methods: Adult male rats with chronic limbic epilepsy following an episode of limbic status epilepticus were implanted with bilateral bipolar hippocampal electrodes and an intraperitoneal catheter. Through a linked fluid swivel/electrical swivel the animals underwent continuous EEG monitoring while receiving a continuous infusion of the study antiepileptic (phenobarbital, phenytoin). Each dose was infused for two weeks, and at the end of this period blood levels were taken by collecting 25 microliters of tail blood on filter paper and measuring with a standardized mass spectrometry analysis. Results: To each drug there was a clear dose response effect with reduction in seizure frequency. The effect on seizure duration and behavior was more variable. The drugs demonstrated efficacy with blood levels that were comparable to established human therapeutic ranges. Conclusions: This early examination of a system for continuous administration of antiepileptic drugs in an animal model of chronic limbic epilepsy demonstrates the feasibility of prolonged drug infusions while performing continuous video EEG monitoring. These findings suggest that this approach may be a useful addition to the process of therapy discovery. The demonstration of efficacy with drug levels relevant to established human levels raises the possibility that effective drug levels found for experimental therapies in this model may provide treatment targets for humans. (Supported by NINDS grant NS 049617.) 1 Filipe M. Bonone, 1 Margareth R. Priel, 1 Alexandre V. Silva, 1 Jo?o N. Stavale, and 1 Esper A. Cavalheiro ( 1 Neurologia e Neurocirurgia, Universidade Federal de S?o Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina, S?o Paulo, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: There is significant controversy regarding whether the brain damage associated with recurrent seizure activity in temporal lobe epilepsy is progressive or not. Moreover, until the present moment, no study has addressed whether seizure-related brain damage contributes for increased neurodegeneration in long term epilepsy. In this study we investigated the morphological alterations associated with long term recurrent seizure activity in old rats with epilepsy. Methods: The pilocarpine model of epilepsy was induced in Wistar rats (60 days old) by the administration of pilocarpine hydrochloride (350 mg/kg). After 5 hours of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), the animals received an injection of diazepam (5 mg/kg) in order to reduce mortality. Surviving rats were monitored 24h a day, until 15 months of life for quantification of seizure frequency. Animals were then sacrificed, and had their brains removed for histological examination using hematoxylin-eosin, congo red, cresil violet, periodic acid-schiff and Masson staning. Results: The mean frequency of seizures was of 4 to 5 per week. The time for first spontaneous seizure had not relationship with the frequency of seizures. The behavioral characteristics of seizures did not change with aging. The histological analysis showed no signal of additional brain degeneration in old rats with epilepsy, when compared with age-matched controls. Morphological alterations found in old rats with epilepsy do not differ from those reported in the literature for young rats. Conclusions: Our data suggest that recurrent seizure activity does not induce additional neurodegenerative processes in the old brain.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids can modify neuron firing, neurotransmitter release and neuronal ionic currents. Linolenic acid (LA) is a omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anticonvulsive effect of daily supplementation with LA as compared to the ketogenic diet Methods: 4 week-old male Wistar rats were fed one of the following diets for 30 days: ketogenic diet (KD, n = 9), regular diet (Sham, n = 14), regular diet with daily palm oil supplementation (PO, C16:0, n = 10) or regular diet with daily LA supplementation (LA, C18:3w3, n = 12). Pentylenetetrazol threshold (PTZth) was used to assess the anticonvulsive effects of the diets. PTZ was dissolved to obtain a concentration of 10mg/kg and was infused into the tail-vain at the rate of 2ml/h. The dose used to obtain the seizure threshold (mg/kg) was derived from the time required to obtain the first bilateral forelimb myoclonus. Nutritional status was monitored by body composition evaluation using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar PIXImus densitometer) at the beginning of the dietary modifications and after the PTZth testing Results: Following 30 days with their respective diets, the PTZth (mean ± sem) were 43.2 ± 1.9 mg/kg in Sham group, 51.2 ± 1.8 mg/kg in KD group, 47 ± 2.3 mg/kg in PO group and 52.1 ± 2.3 mg/kg in LA group (p = 0.003). LA was found to be significantly different from the Sham (p = 0.006), but not from the KD (p = 0.86). KD was found to be significantly different from the Sham (p = 0.005), and PO was not different to Sham (p = 0.17) and KD (p = 0.113) groups. With respect to the nutritional status, the fat mass did not differ among group at inclusion (p = 0.328) and after PTZth (p = 0.06). Fat masses (% of total body weight) were at inclusion (mean ± sem) 12.4 ± 0.3% in Sham group, 12.1 ± 0.2% in KD group, 11.7 ± 0.3 in PO group and 12.3 ± 0.2 in LA group and were: 16.1 ± 0.6, 19,3 ± 1.2, 17.6 ± 0.7 and 16.8 ± 0.7, respectively, after PTZth Conclusions: Daily oral supplementation in rats with LA is as effective as KD using PTZ threshold as a test for anticonvulsive activity. There is no evidence that PO oral supplementation (saturated fatty acid) supports anticonvulsive activity. It was described that LA had anticonvulsive and neuroprotective proprieties using intravenous pre-treatment conditioning. Lipids are an important constituent of the neuronal membrane and can modify membrane composition, fluidity and/or lipid-dependant cell metabolism. Due to the high amount of fatty acids in the ketogenic diet, we suggest that similar underlying mechanisms may support all or part of the anticonvulsive mechanisms in both KD and LA supplementation. Further exploration is required to explain the anticonvulsive activity of LA (Supported by AEAC association.) 1 Claudia Brandt, and 1 Wolfgang Löscher ( 1 Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmacy, School of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany ) Rationale: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common types of epilepsy in adult humans. TLE patients often show a characteristic pattern of neurodegeneration defined as hippocampus sclerosis. The most vulnerable region in the hippocampus seems to be the dentate hilus. The role of this neurodegeneration for the development of epilepsy is still discussed. It is described that the various types of neurons in the hilus differ in their susceptibility to neurodegeneration. The kindling model is a widely used model of TLE. If the kindling process is extended to more than 150 electrically induced generalized seizures, some of the rats develop spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) while in others SRS can not be detected. We recently showed that the total number of neurons in the hilus in these two subgroups of rats do not differ from each other nor from control rats. This seem to indicate that a loss of neurons in the hilus is not required for the development of SRS (Brandt et al., Epilepsy Res., 62; 135?56: 2004). However, there might be alterations in subpopulations of hilar neurons. In the present study we investigated whether there is a change of parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin- (SOM) expressing neurons in the hilus of rats with and without SRS. Methods: We therefore electrically stimulated female Wistar rats 235 times (range 174 to 283) over a period of about one year. Rats were video- and EEG-monitored every 8 to 10 weeks for 1 to 4 weeks to check if they developed SRS. At the end of the stimulation period we had a group of rats with SRS and one without SRS. We further had age-matched naive control rats, sham-kindled rats and conventionally-kindled rats. All rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, the brains were cut on a freezing microtome in 6 series of 40 ?m thick slices. The slices were immunhistochemically processed for PV and SOM. The total number of labeled neurons were counted in the hilus by an investigator unaware of the treatment groups. Results: The number of PV-labeled neurons was significantly higher in the hilus of rats with SRS compared to rats without SRS. The increased number of PV-labeled neurons in SRS rats can probably be linked to epileptogenesis and not to the high number of induced seizures since rats without SRS had an equal number of induced seizures. SOM-labeled neurons were significantly increased in the hilus in rats with and without SRS compared to control rats. In this case, the seizure activity itself is probably the cause of the increased number of SOM-labeled neurons. Conclusions: Thus, for both PV- and SOM-labeled GABAergic interneurons an increase and not a loss could be detected in epileptic rats. This increase of GABAergic neurons could be attributed either to the development of new neurons as an attempt to counteract the seizure activity or to an increase of the expression of PV and SOM in hilar neurons. 1 Russell J. Buono, 2 Gregory T. Golden, 3 John P. Dahl, 2 George G. Smith, 3 Candice L. Schwebel, 2 James F. Martin, 3 Ross MacDonald, 3 Falk W. Lohoff, 3 Wade H. Berrettini, and 3 Thomas N. Ferraro ( 1 Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; 2 Research Service, Veteran's Affairs Medical Center, Coatesville, PA ; and 3 Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies from our lab identified a 6.1 Mb segment of distal chromosome 1 that contains a gene (or genes) having a major influence on the difference in seizure susceptibility between C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice. A random insertion gene transfer strategy involving a BAC DNA construct that contained four tandem B6-derived candidate genes from the critical interval (Kcnj9, Kcnj10, Igsf8 and Atp1a2) was used to test the hypothesis that a strain-specific variation in Kcnj10 is responsible for the QTL effect. Methods: Fertilized oocytes from the seizure-sensitive congenic strain B6.D2-Mtv7a/Ty-27d were injected with RPCI-23 157J4 BAC DNA and three independent founder lines of BAC-transgenic (TG) mice were generated. TG and wildtype (WT) progeny were phenotyped by measuring maxiaml electroshock seizure threshold (MEST). Allele-specific RT-PCR analysis documented brain expression of BAC-containing candidate genes. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure brain mRNA levels and western blots were used to quantify brain protein levels of the BAC derived genes in TG and WT mice. Results: Quantification of seizure susceptibility documented significantly higher maximal electroshock seizure thresholds in TG mice compared to WT littermates. Relative levels of Kcnj10, Kcnj9 and Atp1a2 mRNA were 1.0?2.0 fold higher in TG mice compared to WT. Western analysis revealed close correspondence between regional brain levels of Kcnj9 and Kcnj10 encoded proteins and their respective mRNAs although there was regional variability. Conclusions: Taken together, results suggest that one or more of the BAC derived genes contain a polymorphism that is responsible for the previously documented chromosome 1 seizure QTL (Szs1). Given the lack of major expression differences noted for any of the BAC derived genes studied and the 100% identity of amino acid sequence between B6 and D2 mice for Kcnj9, Igsf8 and Atp1a2, the non-synonymous (Thr262Ser) SNP in Kcnj10 remains the variation that is most likely to define the seizure related QTL Szs1.

Here, we studied patterns of ictal local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) during mild partial seizures in amygdala partially kindled rats. Methods: LCBF rates were measured by means of the quantitative autoradiographic [14C]iodoantipyrine technique at two different times and the two first stages of the kindling (3 rats per groups and 7 controls). The [14C]IAP infusion was started either at 15 s before the stimulation (early ictal) or simultaneously with the application of the stimulation (ictal). Six animals reached stage 0 seizure and six rats reached stage 1 during the LCBF experiment. LCBF values were determined bilaterally in 30 structures and underwent an analysis of variance and the Dunnett's t-test. Results: In stage 0 seizures, no significant changes in LCBF rates were observed. In the early ictal stage 1 group, LCBF rates increased ipsilaterally in the cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens and bilaterally in the caudate nucleus. In the ictal stage 1 group, increases in LCBF rates occurred ipsilaterally in the piriform cortex, basolateral and central amygdala, dorsomedian thalamus, caudate nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, bilaterally in nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, medial amygdala, and all hypothalamic nuclei. Conclusions: LCBF mapping of limited motionless seizures (stage 0) can be falsely negative. In return, mild seizures with oroalimentary automatisms can induce significant hyperperfusion in the epileptogenic zone as well as in distant structures potentially involved in the spreading and/or remote control of ictal discharges. 1,2 Nick Chernyy, 1,2 Nathalia Peixoto, 1,2 Sridhar Sunderam, 1,2 Jonathan P. Mason, 4 Steven J. Weinstein, 1,3 Steven J. Schiff, and 1,2 Bruce J. Gluckman ( 1 Krasnow Institute, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA ; 2 Physics and Astronomy, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA ; 3 Psychology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA ; and 4 Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC ) Rationale: Low frequency (<100Hz), low amplitude (<100mV/mm) non-pulsatile electric fields have been shown to modulate epileptiform activity both in vitro and in vivo. The use of such subthreshold modulatory fields enables simultaneous stimulation and measurement, and allows continuous feedback control. Because of their inherent large low frequency common mode signal, off-the-shelf amplifiers for recording are not appropriate for this application. Therefore, we designed suitable hardware ? electronics for recording, stimulation, and electrodes ? for chronic applications. Methods: We have designed and implemented a complete stimulation and recording system, which includes headstages, isolated stimulators, and custom made software for continuous recording and simultaneous stimulation. The headstage preamplifiers are micro-powered (total consumption of 15mW), and can be connected to up to eight electrodes (four differential channels), and contain a MEMS-based biaxial DC accelerometer. Stimulation electronics are optically isolated from the recording system, and powered by two AA batteries for up to two weeks at a time. Both stimulation and recording are controlled by relatively low cost multifunction DAC cards in a standard PC. Results: In performance tests, preamplifiers presented 4uV input referred noise. The frequency response (amplitude and phase) are shown in Figure 1A (upper curves). Depth electrode amplifiers were designed with a built-in lowpass filter. The system was tested in 6 chronically implanted animals (one week per animal), with reproducible and reliable results. Figure 1B shows typical examples of traces from the accelerometer, and EEG signals from two types of electrodes. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the performance and reliability of a recording and stimulation system designed for use with chronically implanted animals. This system is currently being used to assess the safety and efficacy of low frequency electrical stimulation, and will aid in the development of an adaptive epileptiform seizure control system.

Stafstrom ( 1 Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: The ketogenic diet (KD) is effective in many cases of medically refractory epilepsy in children, but the KD is difficult to administer and maintain. Studies of the KD mechanism have focused on the role of ketosis, with relatively little attention to the possible role of the type and quantity of fat. To determine whether fat type affects seizure frequency and long-term effects of seizures on learning and memory, we studied the effects of 3 different diets in juvenile rats with kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy. We tested the hypothesis that a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is associated with an antiepileptic effect, since PUFAs are necessary for optimal brain development and exert a stabilizing effect of excitatory membranes (Prostagland Leukotr Essen Fatty Acids 67:131, 2002). Methods: We compared a control diet with a diet enriched in PUFA, a classic KD, and a KD diet with PUFA as the main fat component. On P29?35, male rats were subjected to status epilepticus induced by KA 10 mg/kg i.p. After recovery, rats were assigned to a control diet (n = 6) or one of 3 experimental diets: PUFA (n = 8), KD (n = 7), or KD-PUFA (n = 7). Diets were administered isocalorically with calories restricted to 80?90% of the recommended daily requirement for rats. For the next 3 months, rats were monitored visually for approximately 100 hours in total, by trained observers. The number, characteristics, and severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were recorded and compared among dietary treatments. Results: Spontaneous seizures were observed in 67% of animals on the control diet, 50% of the PUFA group, 29% of the KD, and 43% of the KD-PUFA group. Seizure frequency was significantly lower in the KD group (p = 0.038) compared to the other dietary groups. There were no significant differences between dietary groups in the percent of rats experiencing one class III-V spontaneous seizure (p = 0.503) or in seizure severity (p = 0.432). Conclusions: The classic KD afforded protection against spontaneous seizures in the KA model in juvenile rats. The PUFA diet alone or PUFAs added to the standard KD did not result in significant protection against seizures in this model. (Supported by The Charlie Foundation.) 1 Stefan Engström, 1 Michael M.J. McLean, 1 Robert R. Holcomb, and 1 Minhua Zhang ( 1 Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: The potential of using magnetic fields to control epilepctic episodes was evaluated in ICR mice. Methods: Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of NMDA (5 ?l, 200?400 ?g/kg) was used to trigger epileptic behavior in wild-type mice (ICR supplied by Charles River Laboratories, USA). The presence of the most severe of five types of behavior/outcomes was recorded for each mouse: wild running (WR), loss of righting (LOR), clonus (CLO), tonic hind-limb extension (THE), and death (DEA). Effects of exposure amplitude (0.44 mT, 2.6 mT, 6.6 mT nominal exposure), exposure duration (5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min) and NMDA concentration (200, 300, and 400 ?g/kg) were examined in this study. Results: Increasing field strenght tends to shift the distribution of observed behavior to less severe outcomes, significantly different from controls at 6.6 mT (mean over the head) with p < 0.01 by contingency table analysis, see Figure. Figure: Distribution of seizure scores for controls (left bar in a pair) compared to field-exposed mice (right bar) for three field strengths (averaged over the head of the mouse). The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of animals in each group. The highest exposure level provided a shift not attributable to chance by a chi-square test for homogeniety on the resulting 6x2 contingency table. Increasing duration of exposure also produced the same trends in shifting the observed behavior. The two higher doses of NMDA worsened the observed behavior slightly, but it also became gradually more difficult to control the seizure with the magnetic field at higher doses of NMDA, with no apparent difference between controls and field-exposed mice at 400 ?g/kg. Conclusions: Magnetic fields lessened the severity of NMDA-induced seizure manifestations in the ICR mouse. Higher fields (up to an average effective exposure of the head of 8 mT) provided stronger protection, as did longer exposures (studied up to 60 min).

Buono ( 1 Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Coatesville, PA ; and 3 Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: We are conducting a genetic mapping study in mice to identify loci that represent genes whose sequence variation mediates differences in responsiveness to the anticonvulsant effects of VPA. Ultimately, identification of such genes and their variation will lead to focused hypotheses regarding the pharmacogenetics of VPA in human epilepsy patients. Methods: A panel of eight common inbred strains of mice was screened for baseline seizure sensitivity by measuring maximal electroshock seizure thresholds (MEST). Strain-specific effects of VPA were characterized by dose response experiments (100?500 mg/kg, i.p.) in which the percentage increase of MEST over bsaeline was determined. BALB/cJ and 129X1/SvJ were chosen to generate an F2 intercross population (n = about 600) for genetic mapping because they have equivalent baseline MESTs but distinctive responses to VPA: BALB/cJ is relatively resistant and 129X1/SvJ is relatively sensitive to the ability of VPA to increase MEST. The ?broad sense? heritability of this effect is 0.7. F2 mice are injected with saline or VPA (200 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to MEST trials. Genome scans are underway in these two groups of mice utilizing standard microsatellite DNA markers at a resolution of approximately 15 cM Results: With a first pass genome scan approximately 75% complete, single point contingency analysis (Mapmaker QTX) has revealed a number of putative QTLs. Suggestive (less than 0.05) or significant (less than 0.0001) P-values were obtained for markers on chromosomes 1 (D1Mit64, D1Mit365), 4 (D4Mit251, D4Mit42), 6 (D6Mit123), 8 (D8Mit46), 9 (D9Mit311, D9Mit151), 15 (D15Mit13, D15Mit107), 18 (D18Mit186) and X (DXMit172) in the F2 cross pretreated with VPA. Putative QTLs on chromosomes 6 and 8 overlap with loci detected in the F2 cross pretreated with saline suggesting that they are seizure sensitivity QTLs and not specific for VPA response. Conclusions: VPA responsiveness in BALB/cJ and 129X1/SvJ mice is a complex trait that may be dissected using standard QTL mapping strategies. Preliminary data showing that these strains are also differentially sensitive to the anticonvulsant effects of phenytoin suggest the possibility that in mice, some genetic variation may influence responsiveness to multiple anticonvulsant drugs.

Fisher ( 1 Neurology, Stanford, Stanford, CA ; and 2 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute/St. Joseph's, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: We previously reported that Long Evans Hooded rats, treated early in life with AY9944, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor (CSI model rats), had increased occurrence of spike-waves in EEG recordings, and that neurons acutely dissociated from reticular nuclei (nRt) of CSI model rat thalamus demonstrated decreased GABAA-receptor sensitivity to benzodiazepines (Wu at al., 2004). The present experiments were designed to investigate changes in the gamma-2 and alpha-1 subunits of the GABAA receptor in CSI model rats, as possible mechanisms of these changes. Methods: EEG recordings were made to analyze the occurrences of spike-waves in control and CSI model rats; Western blot, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR techniques were performed to measure the levels of and signals for gamma-2 and alpha-1 subunits of the GABAA receptor in the reticular (nRt) and ventrobasal (VB) relay nuclei of thalamus, and in somatosensory cortex. Results: CSI model rats had significantly higher spike-wave scores, compared to control rats (control, n = 6: 0.54 ± 0.14 vs. CSI model rats, n = 5: 1.0 ± 0, p < 0.05), suggesting higher seizure susceptibility in the CSI model rats. Western blot results demonstrated GABAA receptor subunit specific alterations in thalamus and cortex. GABAA receptor gamma-2 subunit protein expression significantly decreased in CSI model thalamic nRt and VB nuclei (control, n = 6: 0.17 ± 0.02 vs. CSI model, n = 6: 0.11 ± 0.01, p < 0.05). This difference was not observed in somatosensory cortex (control, n = 6: 0.96 ± 0.15 vs. CSI model, n = 6: 0.92 ± 0.07, p = 0.8). Conversely, GABAA receptor subunit alpha-1 protein expression decreased in CSI model somatosensory cortex (control, n = 6: 1.32 ± 0.11 vs. CSI model cortex, n = 6: 0.83 ± 0.12, p < 0.05), but not in thalamic nRt and VB nuclei (control, n = 6: 0.5 ± 0.09 vs. CSI model, n = 6: 0.38 ± 0.06, p = 0.3). Immunohistochemistry results confirmed Western blot results and demonstrated that the decrease in GABAA subunits was not due to neuron loss in CSI model thalamus and cortex. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate that early life block of cholesterol synthesis produces region- and subunit-specific decreases in GABAA receptor gamma-2 and alpha-1 subunits in rat nRt and VB nuclei of thalamus and cortex, respectively. The physiological significance of the selective reductions in GABAA receptor subunits in thalamic nRt and VB nuclei and cortex remains to be determined.

O'Brien, and 2 Margaret J. Morris ( 1 The Department of Medicine, RMH, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia ; and 2 The Department of Pharmacology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: We have previously demonstrated that intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of NPY potently suppresses absence seizures in a model of genetic generalised epilepsy, Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats of Strasbourg (GAERS)1. Here we investigated the Y receptor subtype(s) on which NPY exerts this anti-absence effect. Methods: Cumulative duration of seizures was quantitated in adult male GAERS on 90-minute post-injection EEG recording in two experiments: (i) Post antagonists of Y1 - BIBP3226 (20 nmol, Boehringer Ingelheim), Y2 - BIIE0246 (20 nmol, Boehringer Ingelheim), Y5 - NPY5RA972 (20 nmol, Astra Zeneca) or vehicle followed by NPY (6 mmol) (n = 7). (ii) Post subtype selective agonists of Y1 (Leu31Pro34, 2.5 nmol,), Y2 (Gift of E Potter, Ac[Leu 28,31]NPY24?36 3 nmol,), Y5 receptors (Gift of A Beck-Sickinger, hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY 3 nmol,) NPY (3 nmol) or vehicle. Results were analysed using ANOVA for repeated measures with planned comparisons (n = 7 for both studies). Results: GAERS spent 14% of time in seizures. NPY injection was still able to suppress seizures (vs. vehicle alone) following the Y1- (45.3% suppression) and Y5-antagonists (80.1% suppression) compared to following vehicle (all p < 0.05), but not following the Y2-antagonist (5.1% suppression, p = 0.46). Conversely, injection of the Y1 and Y5 selective agonists resulted in significantly less mean seizure suppression than NPY (37.4% and 53.9% vs. 83.2% suppression, p < 0.05) while the Y2 agonist had similar effects to NPY (62.3% suppression, p = 0.57). Food intake was not increased following injection of the Y2 agonist, unlike following NPY or the other Y-subtype agonists. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that Y2 receptors are more important than Y1 and Y5 receptors in mediating the effect of NPY to suppress absence seizures in a genetic rat model. Drugs acting on Y2 receptors may represent targets for novel drugs effective against genetic generalised epilepsies without resulting in appetite stimulation.

Treiman ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is a dynamic state, with progressive changes in its underlying pathophysiology the longer it persists. A consequence of such changes is an increased refractoriness to treatment with antiepileptic drugs. The underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon are not well understood, but probably involve progressive impairment of GABA-mediated inhibition. Treiman et al (Epilepsy Res5:49?60, 1990) described a progressive sequence of EEG changes during experimental and clinical SE, and have suggested these EEG changes (Stages I-V) are a marker of the severity of SE. We tested the hypothesis that the later the EEG stage, the greater the impairment of GABA-mediated inhibition would be. Methods: SE was induced in P20-P28 male Sprague-Dawley rats with kainic acid (KA), 15 mg/kg IP. Continuous EEG recording from epidural screw electrodes was done from before injection to sacrifice at SE EEG Stage III (continuous ictal activity) or V Plus (continuous periodic epileptiform discharges overnight: approximately 20 hrs). Rats that were given KA but did not develop SE, were used as controls. Brains were rapidly removed at the time of sacrifice. Standard field recording methods in the CA1 region were then utilized to assess GABAergic function in 400 ?m transverse hippocampal slices prepared in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Results: A single stimulus to the Schaffer collateral pathway induced a single field potential spike in slices obtained from control and Stage III rats, but multiple field potential spikes in slices obtained from Stage V rats. Tetanic stimulation (100 Hz, 20 trains) induced a robust ?-oscillation in the slices from control animals, but the ?-oscillation was diminished in the slices from Stage III rats and absent in slices from Stage V rats. Perfusion of diazepam (1 ?M) to the slice completely restored ?-oscillations in Stage III rats. Paired pulse stimulation with a 50 ms pulse interval induced a reduction of the second response (paired pulse inhibition) in slices from control rats, but not in slices from Stage III or Stage V rats. However, paired pulse stimulation with a 150 ms pulse interval induced a potentiation of the second response (paired pulse facilitation) in slices from control rats, which was enhanced in slices from Stage III and Stage V rats. Conclusions: These data demonstrate progressive impairment of GABAergic function during prolonged KA-induced SE in juvenile rats, which may help explain the progressive refractoriness to treatment. The mechanism of this progressive impairment is not yet understood. None-the-less, this observation has important implications for the management of prolonged SE in human patients. Further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms may lead to more effective treatment interventions in clinical SE.

Rogawski ( 1 Epilepsy Research Section, NINDS/NIH, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: Resective surgery is a validated approach for the treatment of pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but it is an invasive approach accompanied by substantial risks. We have investigated local delivery of therapeutic agents as a less invasive and potentially safer approach to the treatment of intractable localization-related epilepsy. We use convection-enhanced delivery (CED), which provides for a controlled infusion to a restricted brain area and avoids the tissue damage produced by bolus infusion. In the present study we studied botulinum toxins A and B (BTX-A and BTX-B) with the CED approach. These toxins are highly potent, irreversible inhibitors of neurotransmitter release. We hypothesized that inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters involved in seizure generation, including glutamate, would confer an antiepileptic action against amygdala kindled seizures, a model of TLE. Methods: Rats were implanted with a combination guide cannula-stimulation electrode into the right basolateral amygdala. Daily stimulations continued until each rat was fully kindled (stage 5 seizures for at least five consecutive days). Then, the rats received CED infusions of BTX-A (1?10 ng) or BTX-B (3.2?10 ng) into the stimulation site over 20 min. Carbamazepine (0.1 mg) was studied for comparison. Each dose was delivered in a volume of 5 ?L at a rate of 0.25 ?L/min. Depth EEG (afterdischarge threshold and duration) and behavioral (seizure stage and duration) measures of amygdala-kindled seizures were recorded up to 64 d after the infusion. Results: Infusion of vehicle had no effect on the EEG or behavioral measures. In contrast, infusions of BTX-A resulted in a dose- and time-dependent protection against kindled seizures as reflected by significant increases in the afterdischarge threshold with accompanying decreases in the afterdischarge duration. These effects reached a maximum at 21 d post infusion and then gradually returned to baseline levels over the subsequent 40 days. Infusions of BTX-A had little effect on seizure stage and seizure duration. Similarly, infusions of BTX-B resulted in a significant protection against kindled seizures, with an elevation in the afterdischarge threshold lasting for 7 d; other measures of seizures (i.e. afterdischarge duration, seizure stage, and seizure duration) were affected for as long as 50 d post-infusion. Infusions of both toxins were well tolerated and were not associated with any immediate or long-term behavioral sequelae. In contrast to the long-lasting effects produced by the toxins, CED infusion of carbamazepine protected against seizures for only a few hours post-infusion. Conclusions: CED infusion of BTX-A and BTX-B produces long-lasting protection against seizures in the rat kindling model indicating that CED delivery of these toxins could be of utility in the treatment of TLE. (Supported by ERS/NINDS/NIH.) 1 Alexandra M. Gastens, 1 Claudia Brandt, and 1 Wolfgang Löscher ( 1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany ) Rationale: The underlying pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis, the process leading to manifestation of epilepsy, are still not understood. An intriguing aim is to control acquired epilepsy by preventing epileptogenesis. Furthermore, the effects of epilepsy on cognitive function and behavior are of great interest because of their impact on patients' quality of life. Rats with spontaneous seizures developing after status epilepticus (SE) are known to exhibit behavioral alterations and therefore are a good tool to study the influence of antiepileptic drugs on behavior. Methods: The aim of the present study was to investigate if valproate (VPA) prevents development of epilepsy with spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in a post-SE model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Furthermore we investigated whether VPA treatment reduces the behavioral alterations associated with epilepsy. For this purpose, female Sprague Dawley rats received a prolonged electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala which resulted in the development of a self-sustained SE. We limited SE duration to 4 h by diazepam and started VPA treatment immediately thereafter. VPA was administered as a bolus injection of 400 mg/kg and thereafter three times daily at 200 mg/kg for four weeks. A vehicle group was formed from rats treated with saline. Four weeks after drug treatment, the occurrence of SRS was monitored by continuous video/EEG-recording for one week. Five weeks after drug treatment the rats were tested in a battery of behavior tests including elevated plus maze, morris water maze, open field, rotarod, and a postseizure behavioral battery. Results: During prolonged treatment, VPA exerted anticonvulsant activity. However, four weeks after treatment, vehicle- and VPA-treated rats showed about the same number of SRS. These data indicate that VPA does not exert any anti-epileptogenic effect in the TLE model chosen for the present experiments. Furthermore VPA-treated rats showed the same cognitive deficits as the vehicle-treated group. The time spent on open arms at the elevated plus maze was significantly higher in the vehicle-group compared to VPA-treated rats and rats without epilepsy (control group). In the open field vehicle-treated rats spent significantly more time in the center and exhibited significantly higher locomotion and exploration behavior compared to the two other groups. In the postseizure behavioral battery, both, vehicle- and VPA-treated epileptic rats, exhibited a significantly higher score in the ?touch-response test? compared to the control group, whereas the VPA-treated rats were less reactive than vehicle-treated rats. Conclusions: These findings indicate that SE and SRS induce abnormal behavior as the rats are hyperexcitable, show higher locomotion and exploration, and show reduced anxiety-related behavior. VPA treatment counteracts these behavioral alterations. 1 Steve A. Gibbs, 1 Morris H. Scantlebury, 1 Pablo Lema, and 1 Lionel Carmant ( 1 Centre de Recherche de l?Hôpital Ste-Justine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Atypical febrile seizures have been associated with the mesial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome. However, its impact on brain development remains poorly understood. In adult patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and a history of atypical febrile seizures in early life, MRI volume and signal abnormalities have been reported. Recently, we have demonstrated that a localized cortical microgyrus predisposes immature rats to atypical hyperthermic seizures (HS) and chronic epilepsy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of this atypical HS on brain development. Methods: Freeze lesions (focal microgyri) were induced in the right fronto-parietal cortex of rats on postnatal day (P)1. HS were then induced at P10 by exposure to moderately-heated dry air. To evaluate the impact of the HS on the cerebral asymmetry; right and left hemispheric, cortical, subcortical and hippocampal volumes were estimated at P22 and P80 using the Cavalieri method after having sectioned the brains and determined the area of each section using the public domain NIH Image program. The degree of hemispheric asymmetry was estimated by calculating a ratio between the volumes of the right and left structures. Controls were sham-operated and naïve rats with and without HS (non-lesioned controls) and rats that only received the lesion (lesioned controls). Results: At both ages, there was no difference in the volumes between the non-lesion controls therefore these results were pooled. At P22, the ratio of hemispheric volumes in lesioned rats with HS (0.960 ± 0.037) was significantly smaller than that observed in non-lesioned controls (1.007 ± 0.008, p < 0.02). When the hemispheres were divided into cortical and subcortical volumes, asymmetry was only seen in the cortex (0.947 ± 0.049 vs. 1.018 ± 0.012, p < 0.01). At P80, similar results were obtained only this time all three ratios, hemispheric, cortical and subcortical, in lesioned rats with HS were significantly smaller than those obtained in non-lesioned controls. When the ratios of hippocampal volumes in lesioned rats with HS were compared at P22 (0.948 ± 0.070) and P80 (0.902 ± 0.075) they were both significantly smaller than non-lesioned controls ratios (P22: 1.027 ± 0.083, p < 0.02 and P80: 0.987 ± 0.070, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results show a progressive hemispheric asymmetry including the hippocampus in lesioned rats with HS. This is in line with studies of volume and signal abnormalities in humans. Ongoing studies will let us determine the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

Grabenstatter, and 1 F. Edward Dudek ( 1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO ) Rationale: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have traditionally been tested on acute seizures, but animal models of chronic epilepsy with spontaneous seizures may be more useful for developing new drugs to treat the pharmacoresistant population. Recent research suggests that these models can be used efficiently for studying the effects of AEDs on epileptic seizures. A study from our group (Grabenstatter et. al, 2005) used a repeated-measures cross-over protocol in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy, and showed that topiramate reduced seizure frequency in a dose-dependent manner. The purpose of the present experiment was to evaluate how the widely used AED carbamazepine depressed spontaneous seizures in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. Methods: Kainic acid was administered in repeated, low doses (5 mg/kg) every hour until each male Sprague-Dawley rat experienced convulsive status epilepticus for >3 h. Focal field-potential recordings in freely-behaving rats (n = 8) receiving 30 mg/kg carbamazepine or vehicle (20% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-?-cyclodextrin) were used to assess the effects of AED on spontaneous seizures using a repeated-measures, cross-over protocol. Results: Spontaneous seizure frequency was significantly suppressed by 78.44% (p < 0.0001) after administration of 30 mg/kg carbamazepine. The same dose did not affect seizure duration. Convulsive seizures were reduced by 70.27% (p < 0.0001). Nonconvulsive seizures were also reduced, but only by 47.31% (p = 0.0947). Conclusions: Carbamazepine (30 mg/kg) preferentially reduced convulsive seizures in spontaneously seizing rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. These data demonstrate that use of animal models with spontaneous seizures can provide valuable information about AEDs when implemented with EEG and video-monitoring. Carbamazepine elicited similar effects on convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy as is observed clinically in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (i.e., nonconvulsive seizures were ineffectively treated). (Supported by Epilepsy Foundation of America.) 1 James G. Heida, and 1 Quentin J. Pittman ( 1 Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Seizures in both humans and animals are often associated with significant alterations in body temperature. These alterations may influence degenerative processes within the brain. We tested the hypothesis that alterations in body temperature affect neurodegeneration in commonly used animal models of seizures and status epilepticus. Methods: Adult male rats (n = 38) weighing between 350?450 grams were used as subjects. The four seizure models used were pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 40mg/kg i.p.), pilocarpine (PILO, 350mg/kg i.p.), kainic acid (KA, 15mg/kg i.p.), and sustained amygdala stimulation (SAS, 30min electrical stimulation of the left basolateral amygdala). Animals were randomly assigned to the 4 different seizure groups (n = 8/group) and one control (n = 6). Five animals from each group were equipped with body temperature recording devices (SubCue(tm), Calgary Ab Canada). SAS animals had bipolar stimulating/recording electrodes placed bilaterally in the basolateral amygdalae. Body temperature, in all groups, was recorded at 5 min intervals. In addition the SAS group had EEG recorded before, during, and after seizure induction. Twenty-four hours later animals were sacrificed and processed for Fluoro-Jade histochemistry, as a means to identify degenerating neurons. Neurodegeneration was assessed by a trained observer, blinded to experimental conditions. Results: All models were associated with significant changes in body temperature after seizure induction. Robust hypothermic responses were observed in the PTZ (low = - 1.55 ± 0.11 °C, mean ± SEM compared to baseline p < 0.05) and PILO (low = - 3.39 ± 0.42 °C, p < 0.01). The KA group showed a predominately hyperthermic response (max =+ 1.17 ± 0.43 °C, p < 0.05), the SAS group also showed a significant hyperthermic component (max =+ 1.67 ± 0.36 °C, p < 0.05). After 24 hrs neurodegeneration was greatest in the KA group and SAS groups compared to PILO, PTZ, and saline treated animals. These changes were confined to limbic regions including the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei, piriform cortex, and mediodorsal thalamus (KA group p < 0.05, ANOVA, LSD post hoc compared to PILO, PTZ and Saline). In addition the SAS group had significantly more damage in the central amygdala compared to the PILO group (p < 0.05, ANOVA, LSD post hoc). Conclusions: We conclude that increases in body temperature are associated with differences in neurodegeneration between seizure models. Minimizing these changes could eliminate some of the variations observed between models.

Russek ( 1 Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA ; and 2 Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Regulated expression of type A GABA receptor (GABA-AR) subunit genes plays a critical role in neuronal maturation, synaptogenesis, and has been implicated in a variety of neurological diseases. Changes in expression of α subunit genes (GABRA) have been observed in models of TLE. The kind of α subunit influences sensitivity of GABA-AR to GABA and to allosteric modulators such as Zinc, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Understanding genetic regulation behind such changes will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling GABA-AR function and have the promise of providing potential new therapeutic tools for the prevention or cure of a variety of neurological disorders. We have focused on developing an understanding of GABRA1 regulation whose promoter activity decreases in animal models of disease, including pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and progesterone withdrawal. Methods: We have used transient transfection of primary hippocampal neurons to determine functional properties of DNA binding sites in GABRA1 and their specific interactions with the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to relate findings to the occupation of endogenous GABRA1 by activator and repressor proteins both in cultured neurons and in vivo in the pilocarpine model of TLE. Results: PMA stimulation of primary cultured neurons increases GABA-AR α1 subunit mRNA levels and GABRA1 promoter activity through a PKC dependent and MAPK independent pathway. Increased GABA-AR α1 subunit mRNA levels are accompanied by increased binding of phospho-CREB to endogenous GABRA1. Overexpression of wildtype CREB increases GABRA1 activity while overexpression of a mutant form (M-CREB) is without effect. A 2bp mutation in the CRE site blocks the response to PMA and to CREB-mediated increases in activity. A mutant form of CREB (K-CREB) that has lost its ability to bind fails to increase activity. Overexpression of CREB related isoforms ATF4 and ICER markedly inhibit GABRA1. These observations are the first to identify a transcriptional mechanism that could contribute to downregulation of GABRA1 gene expression in response to cell signals. Pilocarpine-induced SE increases CREB and p-CREB association with the endogenous GABRA1 promoter in dentate gyrus 24 hours after SE. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the CREB binding site in human GABRA1 is functional and that it can bind CREB family members. Repression of transcription through heterodimers of CREB/ICER and homodimers of ATF4 suggest a new mechanism of GABRA1 gene expression that may be operative in neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy.

Russek ( 1 Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA ; and 2 Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Functional changes in the properties of ?-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA-ARs) occurring in the dentate gyrus after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) are accompanied by changes in the mRNA levels of certain GABA-AR subunits, including those specific to α4. Because receptors containing α4 are believed to make up the majority of extrasynaptic GABA-ARs, it has been suggested that an increase in their expression could alter the relationship between tonic and phasic inhibition. Similar changes in GABA-AR function and gene expression are also seen in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients suggesting that altered GABA-AR subunit composition may at least in part contribute to the disease process. In order to understand the changes responsible for altered GABA-AR function, we have studied the binding property and transcriptional activity of the α4 gene (GABRA4) both in primary cultured neurons and in vivo. Methods: Bioinformatics was first used to identify potential DNA binding sites by comparing GABRs whose activity is upregulated in response to SE to those downregulated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was then used to determine occupancy of GABRA4 consensus DNA binding sites in vivo using slices of adult rat dentate granule tissue isolated from pilocarpine-treated rats and promoter function was examined using reporter assays. Results: Endogenous GABRA4 is bound by early growth response factor 3 (Egr3) 24 hours after induction of SE. Increased binding is accompanied by increases in Egr3 proteins and α4 and Egr3 mRNAs suggesting increased synthesis of Egr3 contributes at least in part to sustained response of GABRA4 to SE. To investigate a potential mechanism for Egr3 up-regulation in vivo, hippocampal neurons were exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in the presence and absence of specific antagonists (U0126 and calphostin C). Changes in GABRA4 mRNAs were monitored using real-time PCR. ChIP performed in parallel demonstrates that increases in α4 mRNA levels after MAPK/PKC activation are accompanied by increased binding of Egr3 to endogenous GABRA4. Functional studies in hippocampal neurons show that over-expression of Egr3 up-regulates promoter activity through the Egr3 binding site and that Egr3 dominant negatives prevent increased activity in response to PMA. Egr3 knock-out mice also display about 50% less GABRA4 mRNAs (with no change in α1). Conclusions: Our findings support a role for Egr3 as a major regulator of GABRA4 in neurons and provide the foundation for future studies aimed at determining the impact of the Egr3 signaling pathway to the etiology and treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy.

However, the exact pathway from PRC to sensorimotor cortex (SMC) remains elusive. An anatomic tracing study suggested that a pathway from PRC to SMC exists in the white matter adjacent to caudate nuclei (McIntyre, 1996). We named this site the ?anterior pericaudate white matter (APWM)?. In this study, we investigated the physiologic role of the APWM in secondary generalization of kanic acid (KA)-induced amygdalar seizures in rats. Methods: Twelve male Wistar rats were used in the experiment. All received stereotactic implantation of electrodes in the left amygdala (LA), left dorsal hippocampus (LH), and left sensorimotor cortex (LCx). A cannula was also inserted into the LA for the preparation of KA injection. The APWM was leisioned stereotactically in 6 rats (lesioned group) and the remaining 6 rats served as controls. All rats received KA injection (1.0 microg) into the LA to provocate KA-induced amygdalar seizures, and electroclinical observation was made for 6 h. The electroencephalographic data was statistically analyzed using Student t-test. Results: Stereotyped KA-induced amygdalar seizures appeared in all rats after 15 to 20 min. In the controls, secondary generalization was observed behaviorally and apparent propagation to the LCx was observed on the electroencephalogram after 1 h. Such changes was further aggravated after 2 h and 6 h. In contrast, statistical analysis revealed that seizure propagation to the LCx was lower electroencepholographically and seizure manifestation was less apparant in the lesioned group after 1 h, 2 h and 6 h. In LA and LH, there were no statistical electroencephalographic changes between controls and lesioned group. Conclusions: It is likely that the APWM is an important pathway associated with secondary generalization of KA-induced amygdalar seizures in rats. 1 John R. Ives, 2 Roberto Poma, and 2 Parent M. Joane ( 1 Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Western Ontario/London Health Sciences Centre, London, ON, Canada ; and 2 Clinical Studies, Ontario Veterinary College/Unversity of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Recording the EEG in dogs with epilepsy has always been difficult as the only suitable electrode available was the needle electrode (NE). The NE were easily dislodged, produced spontaneous artifact, had high impedances thus it was not possible to maintain viability of the NE for long periods of time. The NE were rigid electrodes and not conducive to long-term EEG monitoring (LTM). Epilepsy in dogs (4?5%) is more prevalent than in humans (1?2%). Epilepsy in dogs is also naturally occuring with similar clinical presentations and classifications. Therefore, being able to more easily and reliably record the EEG in dogs may provide better access to a naturally occuring epilepsy model for investigating new and established treatment methodologies. Methods: Using a new subdermal wire electrode (SWE) that was originally developed for use with patients in the neuro ICU (1), the difficulties and limitations of recording the EEG in dogs has been made easier with improved EEG quality and LTM potential. The SWE consist of multi-stranded, pure silver wire with a Teflon coat. It is placed using a 23 gauge hypodermic needle. The SWE is very similar to the original chronic sphenoidal electrode (2,3) developed for LTM in patients with epilepsy. By also including a very small, light-weight connector system, the recording electrodes and harness can be easily fixed on the scalp/collar of the dog to permit LTM by cable, RF or ambulatory methodology. Results: The SWE records with a <5KΩ impedance, is easily/quickly placed, and has high frequency as well as DC capability. The SWE records a high quality EEG and has significantly lower artifact during normal movements compared to the NE. The small size, low inertia and low profile of the SWE lends itself to LTM procedures. The SWE can also be used to record the animal's EKG. The SWE is MRI, CT, and rTMS compatible. Conclusions: A new subdermal wire electrode has been used to record the EEG in dogs with epilepsy. The SWE is superior in all aspects to the traditional needle electrode. The SWE has lower impedance, less spontaneous artifact and can record down to DC. In conjunction with a dedicated, light-weight connector, the potential to record the EEG from the dog in a similar manner as per LTM in humans is now possible. The SWE and its ability to record EEG in dogs opens up access to a natural occuring animal epilepsy model in the canine population. 1 Ives JR. New chronic EEG electrode for CCU/ICU monitoring. J.

O'Brien ( 1 Medicine, Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia ; 2 Centre for Molecular Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, East Melbourne, VIC, Australia ; and 3 Howard Florey Institute, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia ) Rationale: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) commonly show prominent imaging abnormalities in flurodeoxyglycose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The underlying mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities are largely unknown. The kainic acid rat model of TLE demonstrates many of the pathophysiological characteristics of TLE including severe cell loss and synaptic reorganization in the hippocampus resembling hippocampal sclerosis. The present study aimed to determine if the FDG-PET abnormalities seen in TLE patients also developed in this model. Methods: Eight male wistar rats were implanted with recording electrodes into the left amygdala one week prior to the induction of status epilepticus (SE n = 4, control n = 4). SE was induced by hourly injections of kainic acid (5mg/kg i.p.) until continuous seizures were observed by EEG. SE continued for 4 hours before termination by injection of diazepam (4mg/kg). Serial FDG-PET scans were acquired 24 hours, two, four and six weeks post SE. The development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in each animal was confirmed prior to the scans at four and six weeks. Results: FDG-PET demonstrated a distinct decrease in cerebral glucose metabolism 24 hours post SE (31% reduction). This hypometabolism persisted for the following five weeks (2 weeks 32%, 4 weeks 32%, 6 weeks 26%). The degree of hypometabolism did not appear to be affected by the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures. This persistent hypometabolism was not seen in control animals (p < 0.05, repeated measures ANOVA). Conclusions: Kainic acid induced SE results in the development of persistent cerebral hypometabolism. This hypometabolism develops before and remains constant after the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures. This indicates that the change in glucose utilization seen in this model is related to the process of epileptogenesis rather than being a secondary effect of recurrent seizures. These findings make it possible to conduct an investigation of the pathophysiological processes underlying changes in cerebral glucose metabolism in TLE utilizing this model. 1 Stanislav L. Karsten, 1,2 Anatol Bragin, 1 J.D.V. Ruidera, 1 Lauren T. Gehman, 1 Daniel H. Geschwind, 1,2 Charles L. Wilson, and 1,2,3 Jerome Engel ( 1 Neurology, UCLA ; 2 Brain Research Institute ; and 3 Neurobiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: To identify genes whose expression is altered due to recurrent spontaneous seizures, cDNA expression patterns were analyzed in the dentate gyri of the kainic acid (KA) rat model of chronic epilepsy using a combination of high density microarrays and screening in situ hybridizations. Methods: Experiments were carried out on 16 wistar male rats after intrahippocampal KA injection. To exclude the effect of KA injection and associated tissue changes, which would confound results, RNA profiles were assayed in two groups of animals: experimental group consisted of 8 rats that had spontaneous seizures for at least 11 months (SZ) and the control group of 8 rats that had similar treatment but did not develop seizure activity (non-SZ). The comparisons were performed between the area of dentate gyri adjacent to the KA lesion and control symmetrical contralateral side. The Rat Microarray (20,000 genes; Agilent Technologies) and the CodeLink Rat Whole Genome array (34,000 genes; GE Healthcare) were used to identify the expression changes. cRNA synthesis, hybridization and scanning were performed according to manufacturer's protocols. After the local background correction, lowess normalizations were carried out in all distinct pair wise comparisons and ratios were generated. The genes exceeding 1.4-fold change and with p < 0.05 were selected as regulated. Gene expression changes were confirmed in a subset of genes using in situ hybridizations with coronal brain sections from at least 3 animals of each phenotype. Results: We detected a number of genes differentially regulated in dentate gyri characterized by chronic seizure activity and confirmed our findings using in situ hybridization. 22% of identified genes were previously implicated in seizure- or epileptogenesis (http://pubmatrix.grc.nia.nih.gov/). To understand the biological significance of the overall changes in gene expression, identified SZ-specific genes were categorized using EASE (http://apps1.niaid.nih.gov/). Only the genes of immune response showed significant enrichment in SZ-rats based on their overall representation on the array (EASE score <0.001). There was no significant overrepresentation of genes related to NMDA, GABA receptors or genes related to different ion channels. To better understand the relevance of our current findings with respect to the human disease selected genes are being analyzed in human biopsy specimens from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Conclusions: Significant changes related to seizure genesis at the level of gene expression are not necessarily related to the electrophysiological changes at the neuronal level. This contradicts the existing data indicating the importance of neuron discharges in seizure initiation and requires further studies at the cellular and protein levels.

Limbic seizures in mice induced by KA microinjection, however, remain obscure. In the present study, we investigated seizures following microinjection of the KA into the amygdala in mice with different strains. Methods: Twelve mice with two strains (C57BL/6 (n = 6), FVB/N (n = 6)) underwent implantation of electrodes in the left amygdala (LA) and the left sensorimotor cortex (LCx). Stainless cannula was also inserted into the LA for KA injection,. All animals received KA injection into the LA (0.5? g) to induce seizures, Electroencephalographic and behavioral observation was made for 48 hours and voltages of the spike were statically analized. Mice then were decapitated and histologic studies including analysis of the neuronal density of the CA3 in the hippocampus were carried out. Results: On electoroencephalograms (EEGs), multiple spike discharges initially appeared in the LA within 10?20 min after KA injection and mouth and facial movement were behaviorally observed in both strains. At 20?60 min after KA injection, the seizure discharge propagated to the LCx. Within 60?90 min after KA injection the amplitude of the multiple spike discharges increased, seizure spread to the LCx, and head nodding, forelimb clonus, rearing and falling and generalized tonic clonic seizures were behaviorally observed. During ictal EEG change, all mice showed only immobilization, lasting 1?2 min and recurring every 10?20 min. In the C57BL/6, at 48 hours after KA injection multiple spike discharges were disappeared. Unlike C57BL/6, multiple spike discharges in the FVB/N were still apparent even at 48 hours after KA injection. Spike amplitude of the LCx in the FVB/N was statistically greater than that in the C57BL/6 at 48 hours after KA injection. Neuronal damage in the CA3 region was significantly more dense in the FVB/N than in the C57BL/6. Conclusions: In the KA-induced amygdalar seizures, it is likely that mice of the FVB/N strain show more seizure susceptibility than those of the C57BL/6.

Galecki, and 1 Jennifer A. Kearney ( 1 Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ; and 2 Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ) Rationale: Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channels SCN1A and SCN2A are responsible for several types of human epilepsy. Variable expressivity among family members is a common feature of these inherited epilepsies, suggesting that genetic modifiers may influence the clinical manifestation of epilepsy. The transgenic mouse model Scn2aQ54 has an epilepsy phenotype due to a mutation in Scn2a that slows channel inactivation. The mice display progressive epilepsy that begins with short duration partial seizures that appear to originate in the hippocampus. The partial seizures become more frequent and of longer duration with age, and often induce secondary generalized seizures. Clinical severity of the Scn2aQ54 phenotype is influenced by genetic background. Congenic C57BL/6J.Q54 mice exhibit decreased incidence of spontaneous seizures, delayed seizure onset, and longer survival in comparison with [C57BL/6J x SJL/J]F1.Q54 mice. This observation indicates that strain SJL/J carries dominant modifier alleles at one or more loci that determine the severity of the epilepsy phenotype. Methods: To localize loci responsible for the strain difference in seizure susceptibility between B6.Q54 and F1.Q54 mice, we carried out a backcross of F1.Q54 mice to strain B6. Backcross progeny carrying the Scn2aQ54 transgene were observed for 30 min at 3 and 6 weeks of age. Mice that exhibited one or more seizures during the 30 min observation were classified as susceptible and mice without seizures as resistant. A 20 cM resolution genome scan was carried out on 79 backcross DNAs, including 38 susceptible and 41 resistant. Association between genotypes and presence of epilepsy was analyzed by categorical trait interval mapping. An interval-specific congenic line carrying an SJL/J segment of chromosome 19 was used to confirm the mapping results and to generate interval-specific congenic lines for refining the map interval. Results: Genome-wide interval mapping in an N2 backcross revealed 2 modifier loci that influence the clinical severity of of this sodium channel-induced epilepsy on chromosomes 11 and 19, designated Moe1 (Modifier of Epilepsy 1) and Moe2, respectively. The modified phenotype is conferred by an interval-specific congenic mouse strain that carries an SJL/J-derived segment of chromosome 19 spanning the Moe2 region on a C57BL/6J background. We have further refined the map interval of Moe2 using interval-specific subcongenic lines. Conclusions: We have identified genetic modifiers that influence the age of onset and clinical severity of sodium channel-induced seizures in mice. Identification of epilepsy modifier loci that influence susceptibility and disease progression will provide insight into the molecular events of epileptogenesis, and may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of human patients.

Radiology, Yale Univ, New Haven, CT ; 2 Neurol., Yale Univ, New Haven, CT ; and 3 NeuroBiol., Yale Univ, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Generalized seizures are assumed to show a pattern of overall increased neuronal activity affecting the whole brain. Recent experiments have shown that the brain shows a rather heterogeneous pattern of increased and decreased activity during generalized seizures. While some consensus exists about increases, decreased neuronal activity during generalized seizures is still a matter of debate. Here we investigate increased and decreased activities during absence- and generalized tonic-clonic (T/C) seizures by combined EEG/fMRI measurements. Methods: We used WAG/Rij rats, because rats of this strain develop spontaneous absence epilepsy. T/C-seizures were induced by bicuculline injections. Rats were equipped with carbon filament electrodes for EEG recordings and placed inside a 9.4T horizontal bore spectrometer. During recordings rats were anesthetized with fentanyl/haloperidol and received D-tubocurarine for neuromuscular blockade. BOLD fMRI signals were analyzed by comparing images acquired during seizures to baseline images, and by comparing images acquired during different phases of seizure activity (T/C only). Results: Our recordings revealed widespread increases of the BOLD signal throughout the cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, septum and hypothalamus and also decreased BOLD responses throughout the cortex and septum for both seizure types, but in slightly different locations from the increases. However, increased and decreased activity was generally more intense and widespread in T/C compared to absence seizures that showed a more fronto-parietal dominance. Compared to absence, T/C-seizures also showed mixed increases/decreases in the basal ganglia and hypothalamus, and decreases in the ventral pallidum and ncl. accumbens. Interestingly, the hippocampus consistently displayed signal decreases for both seizure types. Conclusions: Our results suggest that during generalized seizures the brain is not homogenously affected, but rather shows increased/decreased BOLD activities in distinct networks. Furthermore, activation/inactivation patterns are different, dependent on seizure type. In particular the decreases in BOLD activity, especially in the hippocampus, are interesting and deserve further investigation. While decreases in hippocampus during absence seizure might correspond to the non-involvement of this structure in this seizure type, its cause in T/C-seizures (vascular steal, increased O2 consumption exceeding compensatory blood flow, or other mechanisms) remains to be elucidated. Our results encourage further studies of the mechanisms of increased/decreased activity during generalized seizures which may lead to new therapeutic interventions in epilepsy.

Recently, it is reported that spontaneous seizures were still developed even after MFS inhibition in some experimental temporal epilepsy models. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade a variety of extracellular matrix molecules and are considered to be involved in tissue remodeling. Expression of MMPs has been reported in several experimental seizure models. We assessed the roles of MMPs in MFS after pilocarpine-induced seizure, using MMP-9 inhibitor. Methods: Seizures were induced by intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine (300mg/kg) in adult male C57BL/6 mice after methylscopolamine injection (1mg/kg). Expression of MMPs after pilocarpine-induced seizure was observed by gelatin zymography and Western blotting. To examine the roles of MMP-9, MMP-9 inhibitor was administered intraventrically 1 day after pilocarpine-induced seizure. Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were evaluated using video-EEG monitoring system fourteen days after pilocarpine-induced seizure. MFS was assessed by using a modified method for Timm staining. Results: Elevated expression of MMP-9 was observed both in gelatin zymography and Western blotting after pilocarpine-induced seizure. Expression of MMP-9 reached its maximum three days after pilocarpine-induced seizure, and declined thereafter. The level of MMP-9 expression returned to the baseline level fourteen days after pilocarpine-induced seizure. Expression of MMP-2 did not change after pilocarpine-induced seizure. After intaventricular administration of MMP-9 inhibitor (10mg/2ml) one day after pilocarpine-induced seizure, the mean MMP-9 expression level decreased by 26% compared to sham-treated mice, three days after pilocarpine-induced seizure. The level of expression of MMP-2 did not change after MMP-9 inhibitor treatment. Fourteen days after pilocarpine-induced seizure, mossy fiber sprouting was observed in all mice (3/3). Mossy fiber sprouting was not observed in MMP-9 inhibitor-treated mice (0/3). SRS were observed in 75% (3/4) of mice 14 days after pilocarpine-induced seizures. MMP-9 inhibitor treatment did not alter induction rate (4/5) and mean numbers of SRS. Conclusions: Elevated expression of MMP-9 was observed after pilocarpine-induced seizure. Expression of MMP-9 was decreased after MMP-9 inhibitor treatment. MFS was ameliorated by MMP-9 inhibitor treatment, but induction rate and mean numbers of SRS were not changed by MMP-9 inhibitor treatment. 1 Mervyn Kyi, 2 Sash Lopaticki, 1 Terence J. O'Brien, and 2 Simon J. Foote ( 1 Department of Medicine (RMH/WH), University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; and 2 The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) are an inbred strain of Wistar rats that spontaneously display absence-like seizures and are widely utilized in epilepsy research. In a recent GAERS genome-wide scan, voltage gated calcium channel ?2-subunit (CACNG2) was identified as a possible candidate gene. This gene also underlies the defect in stargazer mouse model of ataxia and absence epilepsy. This study compares the genetic sequence and mRNA expression of CACNG2 in GAERS vs. non-epileptic control (NEC) rats. Methods: Brains were extracted from NEC and GAERS rats after their phenotype was confirmed via EEG recording. RNA was extracted from the thalamus and cortex. DNA was extracted from liver tissue. Both cDNA and genomic DNA were used to sequence CACNG2. Northern Blot analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from each subregion, and probed for CACNG2 and ?-actin PCR products Results: We found no differences in the coding sequence of CACNG2 between NEC, GAERS and Rattus norvegicus genome database. Northern blot analysis for CACNG2 revealed a 5.5 kilobase transcript in all animals with lower expression in the thalamus than in the cortex. No splice variants were detected between GAERS and NEC and messenger RNA expression levels were similar between the two strains. Conclusions: Results indicate that CACNG2 gene structure and its expression are not altered in GAERS. Absence epilepsy phenotype in GAERS is thought to be polygenic. By comparing CACNG2 between GAERS and their non-epileptic counterparts, this study eliminates this gene as a contributor to the epileptic phenotype in GAERS.

Neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels produce currents which, when abnormally expressed, can result in epileptiform firing patterns. In order to determine the role of altered sodium channel expression in kindling epileptogenesis, we studied the expression of sodium channels in hippocampal neurons, which become hyperexcitable after kindling. To further understand the contribution of altered sodium channel expression to epileptogenesis, we examined heterozygous mice of the med strain, phenotypically indistinguishable from wildtype mice but with only one functional copy of the gene encoding Nav1.6. Methods: 48 adult mice were grouped as follows: 12 wildtype sham, 12 wildtype kindled, 12 med sham, 12 med kindled. All mice were implanted with bipolar electrodes in the basolateral amygdala. Kindling was performed twice daily at a stimulus current equal to the afterdischarge threshold until three consecutive Racine class 5 seizures were recorded. Sham mice were implanted and treated identically except only negligible (1?A) stimulus was used. All mice were perfused two weeks after kindling, and brains were analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to identify changes in sodium channel mRNA and protein expression. Results: Kindled mice showed a significant upregulation of Nav1.6 mRNA and protein in CA3 hippocampal neurons compared to sham kindled mice. Med mice required a significantly greater number of stimulations to complete kindling compared to wildtype mice. Moreover, med mice showed a higher afterdischarge threshold than wildtype mice. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that Nav1.6 mRNA and protein is upregulated in CA3 neurons following amygdala kindling. This suggests that overexpression of Nav1.6 could serve as an underlying mechanism for enhanced excitability in kindling. The resistance to kindling exhibited by the heterozygous med mice further implicates Nav1.6 as a mechanistically important component of the kindling process. Further studies are needed to directly measure the possible role of altered sodium currents in enhanced excitability during kindling.

Photothrombotic brain infarction in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats leads to the development of focal epileptic seizures ipsilateral to the cortical infarct in 50% of the animals (Kharlamov et al, Epilepsy Research 2003; 56:185?203). In order to investigate the susceptibility to a proconvulsant agent, we tested the sensitivity of the animals to low doses of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in this model. Methods: Photothrombosis was performed on 8 male SD rats. Rose bengal (30 mg/kg) was injected intravenously. Photoactivation was performed with a 6 mm diameter cold white light focused over the left fronto-parietal cortex during 20 minutes. Six epidural screw electrodes were placed over the skull. EEG was recorded during 6 months. Eight male SD control rats were also recorded.Intraperitoneal (ip) PTZ, at 20 and 30 mg/kg, was injected 9 months and 11 months after surgery. The seizures were classified clinically: stage 1: staring; stage 2: diffuse myoclonus; stage 3: rearing on the hind legs; stage 4: full-blown generalized clonic convulsion and falling down. Results: Among the 8 rats in which photothrombosis was induced, one died during status epilepticus 19 days after surgery. Two control rats died during the chronic EEG recording period. No spontaneous focal seizures were seen. After ip PTZ 20 mg/kg, all control animals presented stage 1 seizures. Among rats with photothrombosis, one showed stage 3 and one showed stage 4 seizure.After ip PTZ 30 mg/kg, one control animal presented stage 1 seizures and 5 animal stage 4 seizures. Among rats with photothrombosis, one had stage 1 seizure, 2 had stage 2 seizures, one had stage 3 and 3 had stage 4 seizures. Conclusions: This study showed that after photothrombotic brain infarction, no animals had spontaneous focal seizures. After ip PTZ 20 mg/kg, there was a tendency for more severe seizures in animals with photothrombosis, compared to controls. This tendency is not confirmed after ip PTZ 30 mg/kg. Further experiments are ongoing to confirm the results of this pilot study, by increasing the number of animals and by testing other proconvulsant agents.

Carney ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida Health Science Center, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Human medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is characterized clinically by the progressive development of spontaneous recurrent seizures from temporal lobe foci. Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies in these patients often revealed interictal epileptiform discharges from the temporal lobes and EEG seizures of secondary generalization often starts with an electrodecremental event lasting a few seconds that is bilaterally followed by rhythmic fast activity. A rat model of chronic limbic epilepsy (CLE) was developed following a period of status epilepticus induced by continuous hippocampal stimulation. Spontaneous recurrent seizures occurred after a silent period of 4?6 weeks. The aim of this study was to examine whether the EEG changes in this model resemble those of human temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: 330 micron stainless steel monopolar electrodes were stereotaxically implanted in bilateral hippocampus and frontal cortex. Neuronal activity was recorded at 200Hz. Time-locked continuous video/EEG (VEEG) recordings were collected over the course of two months from a chronically seizing animal model of limbic epilepsy. EEG and behavior seizures were visually identified from time-locked continuous video/EEG recordings. Results: VEEG recordings from 24 animals with spontaneous recurrent seizures were reviewed. These EEGs were obtained from bilateral hippocampal depth electrodes and bilateral frontal cortical electrodes after the first spontaneous recurrent seizures and continued for 2?3 months. The interictal spikes and sharp waves were observed in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the stimulation site in majority of animals, and bilateral interictal spikes were observed in about 30% of animals. Prior to the onset of each spontaneous recurrent seizures, EEGs showed sudden onset of electrodecrements bilaterally for 1?2 seconds, followed by generalized bursts of sharp waves and buildup of rhythmic theta activity that accompanied the behavioral seizures. Postictal EEG showed a mixture of slow waves and attenuation of background activities. These EEG patterns were rather stereotypic and seen in the majority of animals. Conclusions: The pattern of interictal, ictal and post-ictal EEG changes in the rat CLE model resemble those observed in human MTLE. These results support the notion that the spontaneous limbic epilepsy rat model is a realistic model of human MLTE.

Myers ( 1 Department of Medicine, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; 2 Centre for Molecular Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; and 3 Department of Physiology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: Hippocampal alterations of GABAA/central benzodiazepine receptor (GABAA/cBZR) expression are noted in TLE patients and animal models, but their importance to epileptogenesis is uncertain. The binding of the GABAA/cBZR antagonist [3H]-Flumazenil was studied in the hippocampus of amygdala-kindled and kainate-treated rat models of ?early? and ?later? epileptogenesis Methods: Age-matched male Wistar rats were divided into amygdala-kindling (n = 5), kainate-treated (n = 4) and control (n = 6) groups. All kainate-treated rats were confirmed to have spontaneous seizures and all kindled rats attained 5 ClassV seizures. GABAA/cBZR density (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) were determined in all hippocampal strata from saturation-binding analysis using [3H]-Flumazenil. Mossy fiber sprouting into the dentate molecular layer and its relationship with Bmax was examined Results: Kainate-treated rats had bilateral decreased Bmax in the oriens (78%), pyramidal (75%) and radiatum (79%) lamina of CA1 (all p < 0.05). A smaller reduction was seen in the dentate hilus (83%, p = 0.06), and in the hilar insertion of CA3 (78% p = 0.03). Contrastingly, the kindled left hippocampus showed significantly increased Bmax in all subregions except CA2 (all p < 0.05), with marked elevation in the dentate molecular layer (139%), CA1 molecular layer (128%) and stratum oriens of CA3 (134%). Mossy fiber sprouting was increased in both kainate (197% p = 0.01) and kindled (137%, p = 0.01) groups, with a strong inverse correlation between density of sprouted mossy fibers and GABAA/cBZR expression in the dentate molecular layer (r = -0.84, p = 0.004). No Kd changes were detected. Conclusions: The contrasting findings in the kindling and kainate-treated rats suggest that GABAA/cBZR expression is upregulated early in epileptogenesis, but downregulated at the chronic epileptic phase in regions where cell loss occurs. Mossy fiber sprouting may modulate these changes which could represent an important compensatory or pathological mechanism in epileptogenesis 1 Ariana Lorenzano, and 1 Paula E. Schauwecker ( 1 Cell and Neurobiology, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Inheritance patterns between mouse strains suggest that a robust genetic influence determines individual susceptibility to kainic acid-induced hippocampal cell death. Previous quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies had located three significant loci on chromosomes 18, 15, and 4 in the mouse genome, responsible for seizure-induced cell death susceptibility. The QTL with the largest effect on susceptibility to seizure-induced cell death maps to the distal region of chromosome 18 (Schauwecker et al. 2004). In order to localize the loci more precisely, we generated a series of congenic and subcongenic strains by introgressing segments of seizure-induced cell death loci from the C57BL/6 resistant mouse into the background of the FVB/N susceptible mouse. Methods: Interval-specific congenic lines (ISCLs) were derived by identifying mice that carried recombination events in the C57BL/6 interval, during the backcrossing for congenics. Recombinant mice were backcrossed to FVB/N, and progeny that carried the reduced Chr 18, Chr 15, or Chr 4 region were tested for the effect on susceptibility to seizure-induced cell death. Mice were injected with kainate and observed for 3?4 hours for the onset and extent of seizures. Seven days following kainate, animals were perfused and hippocampi were assessed for susceptibility to kainate-induced cell death. A candidate gene approach was used to identify strong candidate genes within our introgressed regions by comparing the expression of candidate genes between C57BL/6 and FVB/N mice strains using quantitative RT-PCR. Genomic DNA from C57BL/6 and FVB/N mice was amplified and sequenced to identify potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) so as to detect genetic variants in both susceptible (FVB/N) and resistant (C57BL/6) murine populations. Results: Three congenic strains have been produced through introgression of various segments of chromosome 18, 15, or 4 from C57BL/6 mice into the recipient FVB/N mouse, and vice versa. In all cases, the extent of cell death was dramatically affected in that damage was significantly reduced in those congenic strains that contained a C57BL/6 resistant region in a FVB/N strain. We have developed multiple ISCLs which span our 3 QTL intervals, which have allowed us to begin to test each chromosomal segment statistically for linkage to kainate-induced cell death. Two of these share the C57BL/6 phenotype of reduced cell death. Differential expression of hippocampal mRNA for several candidate genes using quantitative RT-PCR and nucleotide variants have been identified between FVB/N and C57BL/6 strains as well. Conclusions: Overall, these data confirm the existence of the genetic loci that confer susceptibility to seizure-induced cell death. The resolution of individual recombinants obtained in this study should allow us to narrow our originally defined critical fragments down to a size amenable to facilitate the positional cloning of the loci.

Seyfried ( 1 Biology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA ) Rationale: Glucose uptake into the brain is greater during epileptic seizures than during most other brain activities suggesting a key role for glucose in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. Under conditions of fasting or caloric restriction (CR), however, brain cells can also derive energy from ketone bodies. Consequently, high fat, low protein, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KD) were developed to mimic the physiological effects of fasting for seizure control. While the mechanisms by which fasting and the KD inhibit seizures remain speculative, a transition from glucose to ketone bodies for brain energy is likely involved. This transition in brain energy metabolism likely produces multiple changes in gene and protein expression levels that ultimately lead to reduced neuronal membrane excitability and seizure protection. We previously showed that CR inhibits seizure susceptibility, and that the KD inhibits epileptogenesis in the epileptic EL mouse, a model of human multifactorial idiopathic epilepsy. In this study, we compared the antiepileptic and anticonvulsant efficacy of the KD with that of CR in adult EL mice, and studied the expression levels of various genes potentially involved in the metabolic control of seizures by these diets. Methods: Adult EL mice that experienced at least 15 recurrent complex partial seizures were fed either a standard (chow) diet unrestricted (SD-UR) or restricted (SD-R), and either a KD unrestricted (KD-UR) or restricted (KD-R). A new experimental design was used where each mouse in the diet-restricted groups served as its own control to achieve a 20% body weight reduction. Seizure susceptibility, body weights, and the levels of plasma glucose and ?-hydroxybutyrate were measured once a week over a nine-week treatment period in each diet group. Gene expression levels were analyzed by RT-PCR under the four dietary conditions. Results: Seizure susceptibility remained high in both UR-fed groups throughout the study, but was significantly reduced after three weeks in both R-fed groups. Body weights and plasma glucose levels remained high over the nine-week testing period in the SD-UR and the KD-UR groups, but were significantly reduced in the SD-R and KD-R groups. Plasma ?-hydroxybutyrate levels were significantly increased in the SD-R and KD-R groups compared to their respective UR groups. Preliminary RT-PCR data have been obtained for the expression profiles of various genes (MCT1, GLUT1, NPY, and GAD). Additional RT-PCR data are needed to test statistical variance. Conclusions: A reduction in plasma glucose levels coupled with an increase in plasma ketone levels is predicted to manage EL epileptic seizures through multiple integrated changes of inhibitory and excitatory neural systems.

Treiman ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is a dynamic state. There are progressive changes in clinical behavior, response to treatment, extent of neuronal damage, and EEG pattern during prolonged clinical and experimental status epilepticus. SE also causes deficits in learning and memory, but progressive impairment with increasing severity of SE has been little studied. We tested the hypothesis that the EEG stage during SE predicts the extent of subsequent cognitive impairment. Methods: Twelve 250?280 gm male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with 4 stainless steel epidural electrodes for EEG recording. Status epilepticus was induced by 3 mmol/kg IP LiCl followed 24 hrs later by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine. EEG was continuously recorded before and after injection, and SE was stopped at EEG stage III (continuous ictal activity), or V (periodic epileptiform discharges) (Treiman et al., Epilepsy Res5:49?60, 1990) with IP diazepam (10 mg/kg) plus phenobarbital (25 mg/kg). Control rats were given PB and DZM prior to SE induction and thus did not develop SE. Spatial learning and memory were assessed one week prior to SE induction (baseline) and one week after SE using a modification of the Morris Water Maze (J Neurosci Methods 1984; 11: 47?60). Learning impairment was tested in six trials on each of four sequential days. Effect of the SE EEG stage on the mean escape time to a submerged platform and mean swim length were determined by a multiple analysis of variance. Pair-wise multiple comparisons of groups were done by Fisher's least significant difference. The mean escape time and swim length for the six trials on test day 1 of week 2 (post-SE) was compared with the mean of the six trials on test day 4 of week 1 (pre-SE) to assess the effect of SE on spatial memory. Results: Mean time to stop SE from pilocarpine injection was, for Stage III 65 min, and for Stage V 210 min. There were no significant differences between these groups in baseline water maze performance. However, after SE, for both the first 6 trials on test day one (test of memory) and overall mean for all 24 trials (test of learning), mean escape time and swim length were significantly worse (P < 0.001) in Stage III and Stage V rats, compared with controls and Stage V rats were significantly worse than Stage III. Conclusions: SE results in a marked impairment of both visual-spatial memory and learning. The later the EEG stage, the greater the impairment. Thus progressive cognitive impairment, in addition to other dynamic changes cited above, is also an effect of prolonged SE. These data provide further evidence that the EEG stage during prolonged SE is a marker of its severity. (Supported by The Barrow Neurological Foundation.) 1 Yohan Chaix, 1 Eve Lapouble, and 1 Benoit Martin ( 1 Laboratoire de Neurobiologie - UPRES EA 2633, Université d'Orléans, Orléans Cedex 02, France ) Rationale: The beta-carbolines, such as the beta-CCM or methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, bind at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor. This family has various effects, such as anxiogenic, learning/memory enhancement and convulsant effects. Evidences suggest a genetic link between the mechanisms which control the seizuring response after a beta-carboline injection and those which control the absence-epilepsy: 1) it has been shown that the GAERS rats are more susceptible to seizures induced by a beta-carboline injection than the control NEpi rats; 2) two mouse lines derived from a bidirectionnal selection for their beta-CCM-induced-seizure susceptibility were characterized in our laboratory. These two strains differ logically for their beta-CCM response, but surprisingly they also differ for their electrophysiological activity: the susceptible one, BS/Orl, exhibits spontaneous, bilateral and synchronous spike and wave discharges (SWDs). The resistant one, BR/Orl, does not present any SWDs, even after injection of gamma-butyro-lactone, known to induce SWDs; 3) we created a pseudo-replicated selected line BS2/Orl for BS/Orl. These two lines share the same electrophysiological properties; 4) it has been shown that the Bis2 gene (beta-carboline-induced seizures 2), involved in beta-CCM responses, can modify the spontaneous SWD activity up to 600%. Methods: Our final goal is to identify genes involved in absence epilepsy. Since the genetic mechanisms for SWDs and beta-CCM response seem to overlap, we suggest in a first step to address the absence epilepsy genetic control in using the beta-CCM response trait. Here we present our mapping data and analysis for this beta-CCM induced seizure phenotype. The genome scan has been carried out on a segregating F2 population derived from BS/Orl and BR/Orl, with high density PCR markers using R-qtl (R package). Results: Two chromosomal regions have shown a highly significant linkage on chromosome 1 between D1mit14 and D1mit353 and chromosome 5 between D5mit13 and D5mit308 (LOD = 14 and 5, respectively; thresholds after permutations: p(0.05) = 3.19 and p(0.001) = 3.70). Conclusions: Mapping data and suggested candidate genes included in these regions are presented. (Supported by CNRS-France and the University of Orléans.) 1,4 Jonathan P. Mason, 1,4 Nathalia Piexoto, 1,4 Sridhar Sunderam, 2 Ruchi S. Parekh, 1,3 Steven L. Weinstein, 1,2 Steven J. Schiff, and 1,4 Bruce J. Gluckman ( 1 Krasnow Institute, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA ; 2 Department of Psychology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA ; 3 CNMC, Washington, DC ; and 4 Department of Physics and Astronomy, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA ) Rationale: It is becoming increasingly clear from human studies that the implantation of depth electrodes can be associated with functional effects independent of electrical stimulation. Although such findings have been attributed to microlesions associated with electrode implantation, there is to our knowledge no prior work examining the anatomy of such microlesions. We present a neuropathological study of cell bodies and processes injured following depth electrode insertion into the hippocampus of rats. Methods: Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (300g) were selected. The control group (n = 6) was not implanted while the experimental group (n = 7) was implanted bilaterally in the ventral hippocampus with electrodes constructed of stainless steel or steel coated with thin films of iridium oxide. These electrodes were placed so that they lay axially within the ventral hippocampus, within the curve of the CA3, by targeting a point near the tip of the enclosed blade of the dentate gyrus (Bregma referenced Paxinos and Watson 4th ed. atlas coordinates: AP = -5.15mm, ML =+/? 5.35mm, DV = -7.6mm). Implanted and non implanted animals were allowed free access to food and water for 10 days and then sacrificed and perfused with paraformaldehyde. All brains were sliced and stained with an Amino Cupric Silver stain to show neurodegeneration. Results: We find significant neurodegeneration due solely to electrode implantation, without stimulation, for all electrode materials used (n = 4 animals). Electrodes inserted into the white matter of stratum radiatum caused local retrograde Wallerian-type degeneration of CA3 pyramidal neurons associated with transection of their axon collaterals and apical dendritic processes. Considerable degeneration of shaffer collateral and commissural fibers was also noted in the stratum pyramidale and oriens of CA1. Moreover, we found fiber degeneration in the alveus, fimbria and notably distally in the fornices (Figure 1). Conclusions: We present to our knowledge the first anatomical description of microlesion neuronal degeneration associated with the deep brain implantation of electrodes for use in epilepsy control. It is critical to distinguish functional effects of such lesions from the effects (functional or degenerative) from long term chronic stimulation of deep brain structures.

Though prior studies suggested that such changes of epileptogenicity are likely associated with neurotransmitters, the biochemical mechanism including monoamine changes in this procedure remains veiled. This study was designed to assess the effect by evaluating intrahippocampal changes of monoamine. Methods: Experiments were carried out on 18 male Wistar rats having undergone microinjection of kainic acid into the amygdala in advance. More than three weeks later, 12 of them developed with spontaneous amygdalar seizures (Tanaka et al., 1988). They then were divided into three groups; controls (without spontaneous amygdalar seizures, n = 6), SP group (with spontaneous amygdalar seizures, without hippocampal transection, n = 6) and SPT group (with spontaneous amygdalar seizures, with hippocampal transection, n = 6). Hippocampal transection was done according to our previous methods (Imamura et al., 2001). Under deep anesthesia, animals were decapitated and the hippocampi were removed, then separated to dorsal and ventral portions. Intrahippocampal monoamine including noradrenaline (NA), homovanillic acid (HVA), dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) then were quantitatively measured using high performance liquid chromatography and statistical analysis was carried out. Results: Comparing with controls, NA in dorsal hippocampus and DA and DOPAC in ventral hippocampus were lower and 5-HT and 5-HIAA in dorsal and ventral hippocampi were higher in SP group. The rest were unaltered. In SPT group, after hippocampal transection was performed, DA and DOPAC in ventral hippocampus increased again, while NA in dorsal hippocampus and 5-HT and HIAA in dorsal and ventral hippocampi remained unchanged. Conclusions: The biochemical mechanism of hippocampal transection in spontaneous amygdalar seizures is likely to be associated with the changes of DA and DOPAC in ventral hippocampus.

Pierce, and 1,3 Helen E. Scharfman ( 1 CNRRR, Helen Hayes Hosp., W. Haverstraw, NY ; 2 Dept. of Neurology and Neuroscience, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, NY, NY ; and 3 Departments of Pharmacology and Neurology, Columbia University, NY, NY ) Rationale: Following status epilepticus, there is a large proliferation of dentate granule cells, many of which develop ectopically in the hilus. Despite evidence that these EGCs contribute to increased excitability after status, it is still unclear whether this population is substantial enough to affect hippocampal network physiology. To quantify this population and its persistence, the total number of EGCs was estimated, using unbiased stereology, at different times after PILO. Methods: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (200 ± 20g; n = 5) received 1 mg/kg atropine methylbromide, s.c., followed by 380mg/kg pilocarpine HCl i.p. (or 1 ml/kg saline in controls; n = 4). Diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered after 1 hr to attenuate status, and ?5 hrs later animals received 1 ml castor oil (orally), and 2 ml dextrose-lactate Ringer's Solution (s.c.). Diet was supplemented with apples for ?1 wk. Rats were perfused with PBS, 2?18 mon after PILO. One hippocampus was embedded in agarose, post-fixed (4% PFA), and chopped longitudinally (McIlwain) into 6 equal-length slabs. A randomly chosen slab was Vibratome resectioned (75 ?m) in its entirety. Free-floating immunocytochemistry used Prox-1 for EGC identification (1:60,000; Covance). The number of Prox-1 immunopositive neurons in the hilus was estimated for each animal using the optical fractionator method. Samples were taken at systematic points along a randomly placed grid using software (StereoInvestigator). The hilus was defined as the region between the apex of the granule cell layer and the tip of the individual blades, with a border 100?m away from the granule cell layer along each blade. When every section was counted, the total number of counted cells was multiplied by the reciprocal value of the sampling probabilities. Results: After PILO, mean EGC number per hippocampus was 17770 ± 5023 (sem), which was significantly higher than controls (1613 ± 248; t(4) = 3.2, p < 0.05). The total number of EGCs after PILO ranged from 6,300 to 32,250. The survival time did not appear to correlate with EGC number, but animals with few behavioral spontaneous seizures appeared to have fewer EGCs. Conclusions: These data are the first quantify hilar EGCs after PILO. The use of a granule cell specific antibody and unbiased stereology ensures maximal accuracy. EGCs were found to be at least 3 times higher in pilocarpine-treated rats than control rats at all time points tested (2, 14, and 18 months), showing that EGC formation represents a long-lasting change in the ?epileptic? rat hippocampus. Together with their physiological abnormalities, the high number of EGCs suggests that they may contribute to hippocampal hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis in the PILO model.

Several anticonvulsant drugs, including phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine have similar efficacy in animal models and are used to treat partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Blockade of sodium channels, and limitation of high-frequency action potential firing as a consequence, is believed to contribute to the efficacy of these drugs. Here, we describe effects of rufinamide on electrophysiological properties of neurons in vitro. Methods: Sodium currents were recorded from freshly dispersed rat cortical neurons with and without rufinamide in the extracellular buffer using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques. Sodium-dependent action potential firing of cultured mouse central neurons was recorded with intracellular microelectrode recording techniques. Cells were exposed to rufinamide in the superfusate for greater than 30 minutes and/or in the culture medium for up to 48 hours to ensure equilibration. The recording chamber was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline containing 7 mmol/L magnesium to suppress spontaneous firing at 35°C to 37°C. Results: Exposure to rufinamide produced rest- and use-dependent block of sodium currents, and slowed recovery from inactivation. Exposure to 1?500 ?mol/L of rufinamide reduced the rate and duration of action potential firing in response to depolarizing current pulses of up to 40 seconds in duration. Response to 1?100 ?moles/L rufinamide was variable; firing was severely inhibited in some cells, while others displayed only mild or moderate decreases in firing rate. Firing was severely limited in all cells exposed to rufinamide concentrations ≥200 ?mol/L. The concentration of rufinamide required to limit firing in 50% of neurons (IC50) was 3.8 ?mol/L (range 2?10 ?moles/L). Conclusions: Over a broad range of concentrations, rufinamide reduced sodium currents and limited high-frequency action potential firing of neurons in vitro. These findings suggest that rufinamide achieves its anticonvulsant effects, at least in part, by blocking sodium channels. (Supported by Eisai Inc.) 1 Terence J. O'Brien, 1,2 Lige Liu, 1 Charlott Wallengren, 1,3 Rink-Jan Lohman, and 3 Margaret J. Morris ( 1 The Department of Medicine, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia ; 2 Department of Neurology, Beijing Friendship Hspital, Beijing, China ; and 3 Department of Pharmacology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: Aggravation of seizures by anti-epileptic drugs is an important clinical problem. A well-documented example of this is the aggravation of absence seizures by carbamazepine (CBZ), but the mechanisms are very poorly understood. Generalized absence epilepsy rats of Strasbourg (GAERS) are a well-validated model of genetic absence epilepsy. Critical to the neurophysiology of absence seizures are the reticular nucleus (Rt) and the ventrobasal nucleus (VB) of the thalamus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of microinjection of CBZ into the Rt and the VB on seizure expression. Methods: Female ovarectomised GAERS were implanted with either intracerebroventricular (icv) cannulae or bilateral microcatheters into the Rt or VB, and extradural EEG electrodes. Rats were studied following injection of CBZ (icv: 10ug in 4uL or Rt/VB: 0.75ug in 0.2uL) or vehicle (in random order). The treatment effect was quantified over a 90-minute EEG recording. Results: Seizure aggravation was seen in all rats (n = 7) given CBZ icv (mean increase in seizure time = 49 ± 26% p < 0.05). Similar seizure aggravation was seen after microinjection of CBZ into the VB (56 ± 17%, P= 0.01, n = 7). No effects on seizures were observed following CBZ administration into the Rt (-8 ± 12%, n = 7). When a further groups of rats underwent injections into the VB of CBZ, CBZ with the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline (CBZ-BIC), bicuculline alone, or vehicle there was significantly less seizure aggravation following CBZ-BIC (21 ± 12%, n = 10) than following CBZ alone (151 ± 23%, n = 5) (p = 0.02). Conclusions: This data indicates that the VB is the neuroanatomical site at which CBZ acts to aggravate absence seizures, and that activation of GABA-A receptors are important in the mechanism of this effect. 1 Filiz Yilmaz Onat, 1 Ayten Azizova Gurbanova, 1 Rezzan Gülhan Aker, 1 Medine Gülçebi, and 2 Cigdem Ozkara ( 1 Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Cerrahapasa Medical School, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey ) Rationale: It has been reported that spike-and-wave discharges are consistenly recorded from the thalamus and the cortex whereas no spike-and-wave discharges are recorded from the limbic structures including the amygdala and the hippocampus in genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). Therefore, limbic structures are not generally considered to involve in the pathogenesis of absence epilepsy. In this study we aimed to evaluate electroencephalogram (EEG) from the cortex and amygdala of GAERS before and after repeated kindling electrical stimulations. Methods: Electrodes were stereotaxically implanted into the basolateral amygdala of GAERS (n = 12) for stimulation and recording and into the cortex for recording. After a recovery period, in order to determine the afterdischarge threshold, the basolateral amygdala of the rats was stimulated with an initial stimulation of 50 ?A (monophasic, square wave pulses of 80 Hz, each 1 msec in duration, for a total duration of 2 seconds) and continued with 50 ?A increments until an initial afterdischarge was obtained. Next, the animal was stimulated twice daily at the current afterdischarge threshold. The maximum number of electrical stimulations was 30. EEG was recorded to analyze spike-and-wave discharges and afterdischarge durations. Results: All GAERS showed cortical spike-and-wave discharges in the basal EEG before kindling stimulations. Nine out of 12 GAERS demonstrated no spike-and-wave discharges in the basolateral amydala with the maximum number of kindling stimulations. On the other hand, the basolateral amygdala recording of 3 GAERS with repeated electrical stimulations showed spike-and-wave discharges in EEG while their basal EEG before the kindling process demonstrated no spike-and-wave discharges in the basolateral amygdala. In addition, repeated amygdala kindling stimulations significantly enhanced the amplitude of spike-and-wave discharges in the EEG of 3 GAERS. Conclusions: Although limbic structures are not generally thought to contribute to the brain circuitry in which spike-and-wave discharges are generated, the observation of spike-and-wave discharges in the basolateral amygdala suggest that in a subpopulation of GAERS the amygdala seems to be involved in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges.

Schiff, and 1,2 Bruce J. Gluckman ( 1 Krasnow Inst, George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA ; 2 Physics and Astronomy, George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA ; 3 Psychology, George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA ; and 4 CNMC, Washington, DC ) Rationale: Neural activity can be modulated with low-frequency (<100Hz) electric fields. We are currently working to implement neural prosthetics for In Vivo applications, especially seizure control, based on this technology. In order to modulate activity in chronically implanted animals with electric fields, high charge density passing stimulation electrodes are required, where current is primarily limited by electrochemistry at the electrode surfaces. Here we evaluate performance and safety of electrodeposited iridium-oxide electrodes in chronically implanted and stimulated animals, and compare results to two In Vitro models. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally implanted with hippocampal stimulating (3mm long x 0.25mm diameter) and recording electrodes. Electrochemical deposition of iridium oxide film was used on all electrodes. Six days after surgery interhemispheric stimulation was applied for 100 h continuously, with 0.6V (voltage controlled) and frequency from 0.1 to 50Hz. Rats were then sacrificed, perfused and histology performed. Results: Electrode charge storage capacity was measured by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. In order to mimic the In Vivo situation, electrodes were immersed in 0.9%NaCl and submitted to the same stimulation protocol as described above. Charge passed per stimulation cycle as a function of frequency was calculated (Fig.1, M1) by integrating the electric current through the electrodes over each period of the stimulating waveform. Bipolar stimulation In Vivo yielded lower charge per cycle than In Vitro (Fig.1, R1 and R2). The In Vitro model was then adapted by adding an 8.2kΩ resistor in series with the electrodes to model higher net impedance between the electrodes. This model (Fig.1, M2) showed a better fit to the In Vivo data at higher frequencies. Conclusions: Electrochemical analysis of charge passed through implanted electrodes with the voltage control stimulation protocol showed that the net impedance through bilateral stimulation In Vivo was higher than expected. This limits the amount of current that can be safely passed in deep brain stimulation paradigms, and can be addressed with ipsilateral in contrast with bilateral electrode pairs. These results are relevant for safety assessment, optimal performance, and design of controls for high charge passing stimulation electrodes.

Crino ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: More than 30% of epilepsy patients do not respond completely to AEDs and are considered are medically intractable. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of antiepileptic drugs may begin to elucidate reasons for AED resistance. There is evidence that the effects of some of these drugs extend beyond ion channel blockade and second messengers to cause changes in gene transcription. Valproate causes changes in gene expression in mammalian cells that may relate to its mechanism of action. We first studied changes in gene expression in whole cultures following treatment with valproate to gain a broad view of altered transcription. Next we studied a subset of the candidate genes that are particularly relevant to epilepsy in single cells that were immunohistochemically identified as excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, or glial cells. Methods: After 14 days in vitro, dissociated rat embryonic hippocampal cultures were exposed for 24 hours to sodium valproate 1mM or sodium chloride 1mM. Whole cultures were lysed with Trizol and total RNA was extracted. mRNA was amplified from those samples, and the resulting radiolabeled mRNA was used to probe macroarrays containing epilepsy related candidate cDNAs. Expression of several mRNAs was altered in the VPA treated cultures thus warranting a cell specific examination of these genes. Similar cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for specific protein markers: vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2) to identify excitatory neurons; vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) to identify inhibitory neurons, and glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) to identify glial cells. Single cells were aspirated from cover slips using microscalpal. The mRNA was amplified from each of these cells and the resulting radiolabeled aRNA was used to probe cDNA macroarrays that contained the genes identified in the first stage. Results: The first set of experiments yielded a solid confirmation that mRNA expression of some epilepsy related genes are altered in vitro by VPA. Several ion channel subunit exhibited differential expression after exposure to VPA including: GABAAα5, GABAA?1, GABAA?2 all of which increased; and GluR5 which decreased. In addition, GAD 65 more than doubled in expression. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons, and glial cells on the cover slips. Single cell microscalpal aspiration reveals differential expression of epilepsy related genes in each cell type studied. Conclusions: Valproate caused alteration in the expression of several epilepsy related genes. The single cell gene expression studies confirmed differential changes in gene expression in inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons, and glial cells. The most profound changes occurred in levels of ion channel subunit expression. These studies suggest that pharmacogenomic changes caused by valproic acid may contribute to its mechanism of antiepileptic action.

FS may promote the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. It has been shown that an inflammatory response in mice contributes to the onset of FS. On other hand, it has been shown in rats that FS is followed by long-term modification of brain excitability. To further examine whether FS results in modification of brain excitability, we induced an inflammatory response in combination with FS Methods: Hyperthermia was induced in rat pups at either P11 or P16 using a heating lamp which increased body temperature at a rate of 1°C/min. Core temperature was continuously monitored using a rectal probe. Rat pups were maintain at the temperature seizure threshold during 5 min. In order to induce an inflammatory response, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli 055:B5) was injected i.p. at 5ug/kg or 50ug/kg, two hours prior the induction of the seizures. Six groups were studied: FS at P11 (P11FS), FS+LPS 5?g/kg at P11 (P11LPS5), FS+LPS 50?g/kg at P11 (P11LPS50), FS at P16 (P16FS), FS+LPS 5?g/kg at P16 (P16LPS5), and FS+LPS 50?g/kg at P16 (P16LPS50). After 1 month, pentylenetetrazol threshold (PTZth) was used to assess the modification of brain excitability (n = 8/group). PTZ was dissolved to obtain a concentration of 10mg/kg and was infused into the tail-vain at the rate of 5ml/h. Seizure threshold dose (mg/kg) was derived from the time of infusion required to achieve the first bilateral forelimb myoclonus Results: The temperature thresholds to induce the first seizure were not different among the groups. The temperature thresholds were: 41.2 ± 0.3°C in P11FS, 41.3 ± 0.3°C in P16FS, 42.1 ± 0.2°C in P11LPS5, 41.8 ± 0.3°C in P16LPS5, 41.8 ± 0.7°C in P11LPS50 and 42.2 ± 0.3°C in P16LPS50.The mortality rate were: 9% in P11FS, 12% in P16FS, 17% in P11LPS5, 18% in P16LPS5, 20% in P11LPS50 and 40% in P16LPS50. The PTZth (mg/kg mean ± sem) were not significantly different among the sham and FS only groups, or across ages with LPS treatment at either age. With in each age group, however, the PTZth was significantly lowered after either dose of LPS (38.8 ± 1.2 in P11FS, 34.8 ± 0.8 in P11LPS5 and 32.9 ± 1.1 P11LPS50 [p < 0.05]and 38.1 ± 0.7 in P16FS, 34.5 ± 0.7 in P16LPS5, 33.6 ± 0.9 in P16LPS50 [p < 0.05]) Conclusions: Lower PTZth obtained by using LPS in combination with FS in rat pups suggests modification of brain excitability. P11 appears to be the most useful age to study FS after inflammation due to the higher mortality at the older age group. Previous studies have shown that 30 min of FS is required for enhanced excitability. Our model with only 5 min of FS in combination with LPS suggests that an inflammatory response could, in part, explain brain excitability following FS (Supported by AEAC association.) 1 Liang Qiao, and 2 H. Steve White ( 1 Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, University of Utah ; and 2 Antiepileptic Drug Development Program, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Methamphetamine (METH), a schedule II drug, has long been known to be a potent releaser of dopamine and serotonin. In addition, seizures are often associated with acute METH overdose. The goal of this study was to assess whether multiple METH treatments affect rat amygdala kindling acquisition, which is a well-established model of epileptogenesis. Methods: Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 260?280 grams (n = 14 in METH-treated group, n = 10 in control group) were employed. In the METH-treated group, multiple METH injections (4?10 mg/kg, s.c.) were administered every 2 hrs. The control group received saline (4?1 ml/kg, s.c.) every 2 hrs. Three days after the last treatment, bipolar stimulating-recording electrodes were implanted into the basolateral amygdala using stereotaxic surgery. After a one-week recovery period, individual afterdischarge thresholds (ADTs) were determined by stimulating the amygdala with increasing stimulus intensity beginning at 40 ?Amp and increasing by 20 ?Amp increments until an afterdischarge of at least 3 seconds was observed. This current was recorded as the ADT and considered reflective of each animal's electrographic seizure threshold. On the day following ADT determination each rat was stimulated at its individual ADT once per day until all rats in the control group displayed three consecutive secondarily generalized seizures (i.e., stage IV/V according to the Racine scale, 1972). Both behavioral scores and afterdischarge durations (ADDs) displayed a progressive increase with each kindling stimulation. Results: There was no significant difference in ADT between the METH and saline groups. However, METH-treated rats displayed a faster rate of kindling as estimated by the number of stimulations required to reach stage 3 or stage 4/5 seizures. In METH-treated rats, 5.0 ± 0.3 and 8.3 ± 0.9 stimulations were required to reach 3 and stage 4/5 seizures, respectively; compared with 8.3 ± 0.9 and 11.6 ± 1.2 in control rats. The ADD was observed to be longer in the METH-treated group; nonetheless, the total ADD to reach either a stage 3 or stage 4/5 seizure was not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: Multiple METH treatment accelerates amygdala kindling acquisition. These results suggest that METH-induced neurotoxicity may contribute to epileptogenesis in susceptible individuals.

Apanites ( 1 MBS,CVM, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC ; and 2 Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC ) Rationale: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of intractable epilepsy. Despite the availability of over twenty-five antiepileptic drugs, nearly 30% of people with epilepsy have intractable seizures. TLE is characterized by a latent period between the initial injury and the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and a chronic epileptic state. These characteristics are expressed in pilocarpine-treated rats, an animal model of TLE. Neurosteroids are endogenous modulators of seizure susceptibility and hence could provide novel insights for the treatment of epilepsy. Allopregnanolone is a neurosteroid synthesized in the brain, but the therapeutic potential of this steroid remains unclear. In this study, we used the rat with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy as an animal model of TLE. We tested the hypothesis that endogenous GABAergic neurosteroids inhibits the frequency and severity of spontaneous seizures and electrographic discharges in pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats. Methods: We recently characterized the pilocarpine model of TLE, including the occurrence of SRS. We adapted the lithium-pilocarpine protocol described by Loescher for induction of chronic epilepsy. Female rats were subjected to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) by multiple injections (10 mg/kg, i.p., per 30 min). Rats were monitored for SRS during 6?10 weeks post pilocarpine. Behavioral and EEG seizures were recorded throughout this period. Occurrence of SRS was monitored for 8 h/day in all rats. Antiepileptic effects of allopregnanolone were investigated in chronic epileptic rats. Allopregnanolone (2?10 mg/kg) was injected thrice daily for 5 days for two weeks and animals were monitored for spontaneous seizures. Results: Repeated administration of pilocarpine resulted in persistent SE after 2?3 injections. Rats developed SRS after a latency of 35?50 days after pilocarpine treatment. The average seizure frequency was 4 seizures per 5 days. However, there was no tendency of increased frequency of SRS during the chronic period. To verify the occurrence of spontaneous seizures, we recorded EEG from two distinct areas (hippocampus and cortex) in pilocarpine-treated rats. Generally, the epileptiform discharges and paroxysms were well correlated with behavioral motor seizures. Rats showed variable intermittent spikes and burst of spikes. In allopregnanolone-treated rats, the frequency of SRS was dramatically reduced as well as the intensity of electrographic activity as compared with predrug and postdrug control period. Conclusions: In conclusion, the GABAergic neurosteroid allopregnanolone exhibited efficacy against spontaneous seizures in the rat pilocarpine model of chronic epilepsy. Pilocarpine model was selected because it replicates several clinical features of human TLE and allows testing new drugs on the frequency and severity of spontaneous seizures. 1 Maithili Sashindranath, 2 Karen J. McLean, 3 Ian A. Trounce, 1 Richard G.H. Cotton, and 2 Mark J. Cook ( 1 Genomic Disorders Research Centre, St Vincents Hospital, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia ; 2 Centre for Clinical Neurosciences and Neurological Research, St Vincents Hospital, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia ; and 3 Centre for Neurosciences, University of Melbourne, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia ) Rationale: Epilepsy is known to result from complex molecular and biochemical events, most of which have not yet been elucidated. Oxidative stress, mediated by an increase in free radical production, is believed to play a major role in seizure-induced cell death that may cause hippocampal sclerosis, which is particularly common in temporal lobe epilepsy (Patel, 2002, Jefferys, 1999). Oxidative stress can cause severe and irreversible mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to neuronal death, thus presenting a link between seizure-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. The hypothesis of this study is that seizures result in increased free radical production; the free-radical induced attack of mitochondrial DNA results in increased mitochondrial DNA mutation that causes hippocampal cell death and consequently cell loss. The cell death may also be related to the cognitive changes seen in some seizure disorders. Methods: An immunohistochemical analysis of markers of oxidative damage to DNA, lipids and proteins is being carried out in specimens of mouse tissue sourced initially from wildtype C57BL6 mice and later from superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) knockout mice, that have been induced to have seizures via amygdala kindling. Studies will also be performed on tissue from human subjects who have undergone hippocampal resection. Results: Immunohistochemistry has revealed that 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal (4HNE), a marker of lipid peroxidation is present in higher quantities in the brains of kindled mice. Conclusions: Oxidative stress may be an element in ongoing brain injury in people with epilepsy and may also contribute to the enduring seizure state. Modifying such oxidative damage may provide novel neuroprotective strategies in epilepsy. Our preliminary studies indicate that oxidative stress is definitely present in brains of mice that have been induced to have seizures. In the next few months, we aim to increase our sample size, conduct a similar analysis on human brain tissue and also establish the cellular localization of the markers, in order to determine the effect of the oxidative damage on the mitochondria.

After pilocarpina injection (350mg/kg, i.p.), only rats that displayed continuous, convulsive seizure activity were included in our study. Seizure activity was monitored behaviorally and terminated with an injection of diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) after 4 h of convulsive SE. The rats treated with lovastatin received two doses of 20mg/kg via an oesophagic probe 20 minutes and 24 hours after SE. Seven days after pilocarpine-induced SE, all the animals were perfused and their brains were processed for histological analysis through Nissl and Neo-Timm methods. Results: The cell counts in the Nissl-stained sections performed within the hippocampal formation showed a significant cell loss in rats that received pilocarpine and presented SE (CA1 = 27.08 ± 7.65; CA3 = 38.22 ± 3.98; hilus = 46.02 ± 1.79) when compared with control group animals (CA1 = 53.16 ± 5.17; CA3 = 65.06 ± 6.18; hilus = 57.8 ± 5.35). The average neuronal cell number of CA1 subfield of rats that present SE and received lovastatin (52.57 ± 6.91) was statically significant increased when compared with animals that just presented Conclusions: Lovastatin exert a neuroprotective role in the attenuation of brain damage after SE.

Seyfried ( 1 Biology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA ) Rationale: Most common human epilepsies have multifactorial etiologies and their development depends on a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. While significant progress has been made in gene identification for monogenic epilepsies, failure to identify and measure environmental risk factors has hindered progress in gene identification for multifactorial epilepsies. In this study, we analyzed the role of environmental factors on gene identification for multifactorial epilepsy in the EL mouse. The EL mouse is a model for age-dependent generalized idiopathic epilepsy and expresses complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. Methods: The inheritance of seizures was analyzed in the seizure susceptible EL (E) and seizure resistant ABP/LeJ (A) parental strains, and in their AEF1 and AEF2 hybrid offspring using a gentle handling-induced seizure susceptibility test paradigm. The seizure tests were administered in three environments that included: test initiation once/month beginning at 30 days and ending at 141 days (Environment I); a single test initiated at 150 days (Environment II); test initiation once/month beginning at 150 days and ending at 261 days (Environment III). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were analyzed using simple sequence length polymorphisms and Mapmaker/QTL software. A total of 691 mice were analyzed. Results: The inheritance of seizure susceptibility appeared dominant in Environments I and III, but appeared recessive in Environment II. Significant QTL, which were associated with repetitive seizure testing, were found on Chromosomes 2 and 9 and co-localized with the previously mapped El2 and El4 genes, respectively. Significant gender effects on gene mapping were detected only in Environment I. A novel QTL, El-N (Epilepsy-Naïve quantitative trait locus), for age-dependent predisposition to seizures was found only in Environments II and III on proximal Chromosome 9 and differed from the previously identified El1. Conclusions: Environmental risk factors including age, gender, and recurrent seizures influence the inheritance and genetic architecture of seizure susceptibility in EL mice. The findings suggest that QTL for multifactorial epilepsy and possibly other age-dependent complex traits should be defined in terms of the environment in which they are expressed.

Sepkuty ( 1 Neurology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: 1. To investigate the association between semaphorin 3F-neuropilin-2 (Sema3F-Npn-2) signaling and epilepsy, using knockout mice. 2. To determine hippocampal involvement in seizures of sema3F knockout mice, using depth wire recording. Sema3F-Npn-2 signaling is required for the proper targeting of the infrapyramidal tract in the hippocampus [sahay,Tessier-Lavigne]. In epilepsy models there is a dramatic decrease in semaphorin levels [Barnes,Holtmaat]. These observations along with the known histopathology of hippocampal sclerosis (mossy fiber sprouting), the observed phenotype of the sema3F knockout mouse (staring) and the localization of Sema3F ligand and Npn-2 receptor in synaptic-rich areas of the hippocampus, prompted us to hypothesize that: 1) Sema3F and npn-2 knockouts have epilepsy. 2) This may be temporal lobe epilepsy. 3) These mice may serve as new models for epileptogenesis. So far, we have shown that sema3F knockouts have epilepsy [Sahay2005]. Here, we heve further pursued objective 1 by examining the association of neuropilin-2 and epilepsy and objective 2 by performing depth wire recordings in sema3F knockouts to evaluate the role of the hippocampus in their seizures. Methods: Depth electrodes were implanted into the hippocampus of knockout mice and wild-type controls using a stereotaxic manipulator. Histology confirmed depth wire placement in the hippocampus. EEG and behavior were monitored daily. Seizure susceptibility was assessed by PTZ. Results: Npn-2 Knockout Mice. Scalp EEG recordings suggest that npn-2 knockout mice have epileptic seizures manifested by staring episodes. Additionally, behavioral monitoring indicate that npn-2 knockout mice have significantly fewer exploratory episodes (p = 0.012) and significantly more stationary episodes (p = 0.005) compared to wild-type controls. Depth EEG Recordings  2 Psychology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; 3 Government, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX ; and 4 Anesthesiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Evidence has shown that anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can distinctively alter EEG rhythms and neuronal bursting in thalamocortical networks. We will show that anterior thalamus (AN) to cortex coherence is changed by ethosuximide (ESM) treatment prior to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizures in rats. Coherence modulation is due to alpha wave generation in the cortex. Novel alpha wave production occurs locally without a concomitant presence thalamically. Prior work demonstrated the selective involvement of AN over the posterior thalamus (PT) in PTZ seizures with partial coherence spectral methods. Methods: Eight SD rats (4 exp  p < 0.04). The growth in network coupling is evident particularly inside the alpha band frequency band. In the mid to high alpha rhythm there is a significant rise in AN-to-cortex BISCOH for ESM-treated animals. This suggests the presence of new alpha wave signaling in cortex. Simple t-tests show growth in AN to cortical BISCOH after ESM at 10 Hz: (0.579 vs 1.209; p ≤ 0.02) and 12 Hz: (0.63 vs 1.37; p < 0.007). MANOVA coupled with Bonferroni-Scheffe measures show differences at each frequency at the p < 0.05 level in AN. PT levels remain unchanged with the addition of the AED. Conclusions: AEDs can affect thalamocortical communication. Increases in EEG synchronization occur after AED treatment. Conventional coherence based on spectral measurements may register these changes as dissociative since they reflect harmonic generation at the cortical destination after propagation. Newer coherence measuring tools expand the notion of thalamocortical communication to include enhanced nonlinear coupling. Bispectral EEG methods remain useful tools for discriminating seizure states after AED treatment within specific functional epileptic networks.

To address these issues, we rigorously examined the links between the extent of hippocampal neurodegeneration, the frequency of SRMS and the degree of aberrant MFS after kainic acid (KA)-induced SE in adult male F344 rats. Methods: Kainic acid (3 mg/Kg b.w./hr, i.p.) was administered every hr for 3?4 hrs to induce continuous stages III-V seizures for over 3 hrs. Control rats were treated similarly with saline for comparison. Groups of KA-treated and saline-treated rats were euthanized at 4-days post-treatment for neurodegeneration analyses. Additional groups of KA-treated rats were observed continuously for 3 months (6?8 hrs/week; starting from the 3rd month after KA) for the occurrence of SRMS and killed at 5-months post-KA for hippocampal neurodegeneration and aberrant MFS analyses. Results: KA-induced status epilepticus caused bilateral hippocampal injury (HI) in all rats when examined at 4 days post-KA. While a majority (77%) exhibited moderate neurodegeneration in the dentate hilus and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields, a smaller fraction (23%) exhibited massive neurodegeneration in all of these regions and died within 10 days. All surviving KA-treated rats displayed SRMS at 3-months post-KA and the severity and duration of the SRMS increased over time. Stereological analyses of the surviving neurons at 5-months post-KA revealed two subgroups of rats: one with moderate HI (56%) and another with severe HI (44%). Rats with severe HI exhibited greater level of the aberrant MFS than rats with moderate HI. However, the frequency and duration of SRMS was highly comparable between rats with moderate HI and rats with severe HI. Conclusions: The results suggest that the occurrence of SRMS at extended time-points after the KA-induced SE is consistently associated with significant bilateral hippocampal neurodegeneration and bilateral aberrant MFS. However, the results also underscore that neither the frequency nor the duration SRMS does not increase further with greater levels of hippocampal neurodegeneration and the aberrant MFS. Thus, minimal hippocampal injury after the status epilepticus is adequate for triggering epileptogenesis and SRMS in this rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

The hippocampus of the rat shows a developmental pattern of SE-induced injury that is age specific. Using pharmacological interventions to stop SE reduces the extent of the hippocampal injury. Here, we try to determine whether there exits a temporal window to stop SE before the onset of widespread injury. Methods: Under isoflurane anesthesia, 2 and 3-wk old Wistar rat pups were implanted with wireless recording modules (Data Sciences Inc.). The recording leads were placed onto the dura and secured with adhesive. Rats were pretreated 16?20hr with 3mEq LiCl (ip), followed by 60mg/kg PC (sc) to induce SE at postnatal day 14 or 21. Control rats were treated identically, but given saline in place of PC. 30, 90, 120, 150 or 180 min after the initiation of SE or saline injection, rats were given 5mg/kg diazepam + 25mg/kg phenobarbital (ip). EEGs were analyzed offline for initiation and cessation of SE using Harmonie seizure detection software (Stellate Sytems). Rats were killed 24hr after the start of SE, and their brains cut at 8microns for cell counts using H antigravity muscle tone permits seizure-related movement. 2) Neural generators of asynchronous neuronal discharge patterns can reduce EEG seizures during REM sleep; skeletal motor paralysis blocks seizure-related movement during REM. 3) Several similarities in seizure, autistic and sleep manifestations  Same seizure types; IIDs in 100% of cases; Same IID types  ? foci change over time ? seizures, esp.

BIA 2-093 is efficacious against maximal electroshock seizure induced seizures, protects against picrotoxin-induced seizures in mice and rats, and prevents development of kindling in rats. We have tested the effect of BIA 2-093 on latrunculin A-induced seizures, and its effect on the increase in extracellular glutamate levels induced by latrunculin A. Methods: Rat hippocampus was continuously perfused with a latrunculin A solution (4?M) through CMA/12 microdialysis probes at a flow rate of 2 ?l/min during 8 hours with continuous EEG and videotape recording for 3 consecutive days. The same protocol was repeated after oral administration of BIA 2-093 (10 and 30 mg/kg).Samples from the microdialysate were collected and analyzed by HPLC using pre-column derivatization with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) and fluorescence detection. Results: Continuous microperfusion of latrunculin A alone induced a variable number of seizures (4.3± 2.7) in the 90% of the animals studied and a significant increase in basal glutamate concentrations (from 27.6± 8.2 mM to 62.1± 14.9 mM four h after perfusion; p < 0.01). BIA 2-093, at both doses of 30 and 10 mg/kg, completely supressed seizures and significantly reduced extracellular glutamate concentrations (26.8±6.6 mM and 18.1±5.3 for doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg respectively; p < 0.01 when compared with latrunculin A treatment). Conclusions: BIA 2-093, at oral doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, shows an excellent antiepileptic effect against seizures induced by latrunculin A microperfusion in the rat hippocampus. The molecular mechaninsms of latrunculin A seizures are still unknown, however, the increase in extracellular glutamate concentrations observed during latrunculin A microperfusion are completely reversed by BIA 2-093.

Rothman ( 1 Neurosurgery, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ; 2 Neurosurgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ; and 3 Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: When epileptogenic regions encroach upon or involve eloquent brain, surgical options are limited and may incur unacceptable neurologic deficits. Reversible cooling of epileptogenic regions may control seizure activity while preserving neurologic function. We describe a novel animal model to investigate the effects of brain cooling on kindled seizures in awake, freely moving rats. Methods: Ten adult male rats underwent unilateral craniotomy, stereotaxic placement of a bipolar electrode into the dorsal hippocampus (ML +2.0 mm, AP -3.0 mm, DV -3.3 mm) and fixation of a copper cooling coil directly over the kindling site. Animals were kindled with 400?A 60-Hz 1-msec square wave pulses for 1 sec twice daily until 3 consecutive grade 5 seizures were recorded. The kindling electrode also served as a monopolar lead for digital EEG acquisition (Biopac, Goleta, CA). Fully kindled animals were cooled to one of two target temperatures (24° or 27°C) for three minutes preceding a kindling stimulation and two minutes after. Seizure score (0?5) and after-discharge duration (ADD) were recorded with and without cooling. Target temperatures were confirmed in another eight animals using a needle thermocouple advanced stereotaxically to the kindling target while circulating coolant (8° or 16°C). Results: Circulation of 16°C and 8°C coolant reliably achieved transcortical cooling of the hippocampal target to 26.5°C (± 0.16°C) and 23.5°C (± 0.61°C), respectively. Temperature stabilization occurred after 120 seconds. Three consecutive grade 5 seizures were achieved after a mean of 42.1 (± 4.6 SEM) kindling stimulations. Cooling to 26.5°C (n = 5) reduced seizure scores to 2.81 ±0.44, and ADD from123s ±14.6 to 49s ±8.2 (p < 0.001, Student's t test). Cooling to 23.5°C (n = 5) reduced seizure scores to 2.0 ±0.31, and ADD from 132s ±11.7 to 55s ±8.7 (p < 0.001). Grade 5 seizures recurred for subsequent kindling stimulations with cooling withheld. Conclusions: Fully kindled, tonic-clonic seizures can be suppressed or aborted with peri-ictal cooling of the kindling target. Anticonvulsant activity occurred at temperatures well above those known to result in tissue injury or inhibition of normal neurologic function. These findings have important implications for the potential use of implantable cooling devices in humans with refractory epilepsies in or near eloquent cortex or dominant hippocampal formations.

Chan ( 1 Pediatrics (Neurology)/Brain  and 2 Pediatrics  26:395), but the relation of the seizures to the mental retardation is unknown. We have used an animal model of atypical absence seizures, the AY 9944 (AY) model to investigate this question. This model bears clinical and electrographic resemblance to the human condition (Cortez et al, Neurology 2001; 56:341) including abnormal learning and memory. We have shown previously that while the seizures are blocked by anti-absence drugs such as ethosuximide, this drug does not reverse the learning deficits in this model (Chan et al. Pharmacol Biochem Behav 2004; 190:328). The object of the following experiments was to test the hypothesis that a seizure-independent, gamma amino butyric acid (B) [GABA(B)] receptor-mediated mechanism underlies the learning impairment in the AY-model of atypical absence seizures. Methods: The AY model of atypical absence seizures was created as described (Cortez et al, 2001). Chronic epidural electrodes were surgically implanted after weaning for ECoG recording to quantify the total slow spike wave discharge (SSWD) duration. For behavioral learning and memory testing the spatial working and reference memory of AY-treated and control animals were evaluated in an eight-arm radial arm maze (RAM) (Chan et al. 2004). Long term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slice preparations from AY-treated animals and controls was done as described (Chan et al. 2004). A graduated series of doses of the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, 3-aminopropyl(diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid [CGP 35348 (CGP)]) or 0.9% NaCl was administered to AY-treated animals prior to either RAM testing, ECoG recordings, or sacrifice for LTP recordings. Results: High doses of CGP blocked SSWD and reversed the learning deficits in the AY-treated animals. Low doses of CGP failed to alter the SSWD duration in AY-treated animals; however, the dose of CGP that had no effect on AY-induced atypical absence seizures resulted in a significant improvement in the spatial memory task which recovered in the low dose CGP/AY group to the level of the non-epileptic control group. Similarly, the impaired LTP observed in the AY controls, also was restored to control baseline in the presence of low dose CGP in rats with AY-induced atypical absence seizures. Conclusions: The data suggest that the cognitive impairment in the AY model of atypical absence seizures is independent of the SSWD and raise the possibility that GABA(B) receptor antagonists (Froestl et al. Biochem Pharmacol 2004; 68:1479) may have clinical utility in treatment of both atypical absence seizures (high dose) and deficits in cognition (low dose) in children with Lennox Gastaut syndrome.

Prior methods for states of vigilance discrimination used EEG spectral measures alone. Here, we show that head acceleration measured using biaxial microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers significantly enhances sleep-wake staging in rats implanted with bilateral hippocampal depth and cortical EEG electrodes. Methods: Rats were video and EEG monitored continuously for 7 days and digital recordings made of the EEG and acceleration signals acquired using custom made electronics which included DC sensitive accelerometers in the headstage. An EEG expert inspected video and EEG to classify sequential 15 s epochs of representative 1 hour recordings into different sleep-wake stages: Awake, Quiet Sleep and REM Sleep. Observed awake behavior was also labeled and divided into three categories: Exploration/Repositioning, Eating/Drinking/Grooming and Quiet/Twitching. Total power (dB) in four frequency bands (0.5?3.9, 4.0?7.9, 8?12.9, 13.1?50 Hz) was measured in 1 sec windows of the EEG (2 cortical, 2 depth) and head acceleration (x and y axes) and averaged over each 15 s epoch. The data was divided into two equal halves, a training set and a test set, and the 24 features were used to perform a linear discriminant analysis of the training set. Results: The leave-one-out classification error for sleep-wake stages was 9% (p < 0.01) using only EEG features, and improved to 6.8% (p < 0.01) when acceleration features were included (Figure 1). Similar performance was obtained for the behavioral state classification. Applying the linear classifier to the test data set gave significant agreement (p < 0.01) of over 90% for sleep-wake and behavior classification. Conclusions: Head acceleration measurements with EEG not only significantly improved the ability to discriminate broad transitions between REM sleep, quiet sleep and waking, but also distinguish patterns highly distinctive of behavior such as grooming, twitching or feeding. This capability will be especially useful in automatically detecting and selectively treating seizures using feedback control.

This study classified clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) phenotypes in these subspecies based upon interictal and ictal findings, as well as photosensitivity, by scalp EEG. Methods: One hundred baboons underwent one-hour EEG studies with photic stimulation (PS), 49 with previously witnessed seizures and 51 without. The animals were classified according to these electroclinical phenotypes: presence or absence of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs), seizures and photoparoxysmal or photoconvulsive responses. Effects of age, gender, and species on EEG phenotypes were also examined. Results: Six discrete electroclinical phenotypes were identified. Generalized IEDs of 2?3 Hz, 4?6 Hz, and or 6?7 Hz were identified in 67 baboons. Epileptic seizures were recorded in 40 animals, including myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Thirty-three animals were photosensitive. Although the prevalence of IEDs and seizures were similar in seizure and asymptomatic animals, photosensitivity was more prevalent in the seizure animals (p = 0.001). P.h. anubis/cynocephalus hybrids were more likely to be photosensitive than P.h. anubis (p = 0.004). Conclusions: The P. hamadryas subspecies have a generalized, photosensitive epilepsy. The association of photosensitivity with clinically evident seizures suggests a lower seizure threshold or greater propensity for ictal propagation in seizure animals. The reliable characterization of distinct epileptic phenotypes in this pedigreed colony is critical to the success of future genetic analyses to identify genetic factors underlying their epilepsy.

Treiman, 1,2 Levi B. Good, and 1 Steven T. Marsh ( 1 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as recurrent epileptic seizures (szs) without full recovery between the szs, or as continuous sz activity for a fixed period of time (5, 10, or 30 minutes). Operationally, sz activity is identified clinically, or on the basis of EEG changes thought to be ictal. However, there is no independent measure of ?ictalness? with which to validate a clinical or EEG diagnosis of SE. We used nonlinear dynamical analysis of the EEG to attempt to identify an objective marker of SE. Methods: SE was induced in 15 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats 5 days after implantation of Teflon coated tungsten wire electrodes (175 ?m diameter); 4 in the cortex (A-P +2.0 ± 3.0 mm, and A-P -4.0 mm ± 3.0 mm lateral to midline to depth 1.0 mm) and 2 ventral hippocampal electrodes (A-P -5.6 mm ± 4.5 mm lateral to midline to depth of 5.0 mm). EEG was recorded continuously during the entire experiment with a 2 hr baseline EEG prior to SC injection of 10 mg/kg kainic acid (KA) to induce SE, and continued until cessation of epileptiform discharges. EEG SE Stages I (discrete seizures), III (continuous ictal activity), and V (periodic epileptiform discharges) (Treiman et al., Epilepsy Res. 5:49?60, 1990) were identified by visual inspection. The EEG data were analyzed using nonlinear dynamical techniques that use the convergence of the largest short-term Lyapunov exponent over time at each electrode site to statistically quantify the brain's dynamical entrainment (Iasemidis et al., IEEE TBME, 50:616?627, 2003). Results: Mean time from KA injection to onset of Stage I was 7.3 (± 2.1) min, Stage III 177.3 (± 32.1) min, and Stage V 670.3 (± 235.9) min. At onset of Stage I entrainment was observed (drop in T-index). However, this was not statistically significant with α= 0.01 and did not reset (return to baseline after each discrete seizure, as occurs with isolated seizures). Entrainment was observed to progress towards the statistical threshold and by the onset of Stage II was statistically significant. Entrainment fluctuated around the threshold throughout the remaining SE stages until the PED frequency began to slow as the rat showed spontaneous recovery (up to 36 hrs after injection; PED frequency 1 per 4?5 sec) and gradually returned to baseline. Conclusions: These results suggest that nonlinear dynamical analysis of the EEG can provide an independent marker of SE and that electrophysiologically, SE may consist of two phases. During EEG Stage I, SE is characterized by a moderate drop in the T-index with failure to reset, in contrast to what occurs with single seizures. During Stages II-V there is a greater drop in the T index which is statistically significant for entrainment and a continuing failure to reset. This observation needs to be studied in other experimental models and in human SE, but may provide another parameter for the diagnosis of SE.

Schwartzkroin ( 1 Neurological Surgery, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA ) Rationale: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetically-based disorder that is often associated with early-onset epilepsy. The mechanisms that link the structural pathology of TSC to seizure activity are poorly understood. We have investigated morphological and physiological features the brain of a TSC animal model - the Eker rat ? in which there is a mutation in the TSC2 gene, and characterized the consequences of a ?second hit? insult, varying the dose of ?-irradiation delivered at different developmental time-points. Methods: Eker (TSC2+/?) and wildtype rats were exposed to ionizing irradiation (Cs-based ?- ray) at ages E18, P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5. Irradiation dose ranged from 400 to 750 cGy. Flurothyl seizure threshold testing was performed at 1 and 3 months post-irradiation. Histological procedures were carried out at either one or three months post-irradiation to quantify pathological cell features. At 2?3 months post-irradiation, a sub-group of animals was studied with slice electrophysiological procedures; population responses to paired-pulse stimulation were recorded from the deep layers of neocortex to evaluate cortical excitability. Results: Seizure threshold: In irradiated animals (750 cGy), seizure threshold was reduced (compared to non-irradiated rats) at 3 months post-irradiation but not at 1 month. There was no significant difference between irradiated wildtype and irradiated Eker rats. Histology: Irradiation (400?750cGy) of Eker (but not wildtype) rat pups, at ages E18 to P6, induced an increase in the number of dysmorphic neurons in the neocortex. This increase was modest at one month post-irradiation, but was substantial at three months (a 4-5-fold increase compared to one month). To induce cell pathology, optimal time of irradiation was 3?4 days postnatal. The higher irradiation doses (700?750cGy) induced a 2-3-fold greater increase in the number of dysmorphic neurons and giant astrocytes compared to the lower doses (400?650cGy) (irrespective of time of irradiation); this difference was found at both one and three months post-irradiation. Physiology. Non-irradiated wildtype animals showed fEPSP amplitude facilitation at shorter interpulse intervals (20?50ms) and depression at longer intervals (100?140 ms). Irradiated Eker rat cortex showed relatively little change in the fEPSP ratio over the paired-pulse intervals tested. Conclusions: Early postnatal ionizing irradiation of Eker rats exacerbated cortical pathology in a dose-dependent manner. The degree of histopathology increased between one and three months post-irradiation ? a change that was mirrored in the time-dependent decrease of seizure threshold. Preliminary electrophysiological data from irradiated Eker rat cortex suggest that the evolving structural abnormalities are reflected in aberrant cortical (Supported by NIH/NINDS grant # NS 18895 (PAS) and an EF postdoctoral fellowship (NT).) 1 Gilles Van Luijtelaar, 2 Ayten Azizova, and 2 Filiz Onat ( 1 Biological Psychology, NICI, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands ; and 2 Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Marmara University, Hayderpasa, Istanbul, Turkey ) Rationale: Evidence is accumulating that absence seizures have a cortical origin. Based on neurophysiological studies, immunocytochemistry, morphometric in vitro and pharmacological studies in vivo it has been demonstrated that various disturbances in the somatosensory cortex in WAG/Rij, but also in GAERS, might underly the origin of the spike-wave discharges (SWD), the electroencephalographic hallmark of absence seizures. Here we investigated whether local (at the somatosensory cortex) application of phenytoine, a drug that promotes SWD after systemic administration, is effective in reducing the number of SWD. Methods: Adult male WAG/Rij rats were equipped cortical EEG electrodes and bilateral canulla's for cortical administraion of the drug. Canulla's were located at the peri-oral part of the somatosensory cortex. Rats were either systemically injected with a dose of 40 mg/kg phenytoin or saline, or with 360 pmol/500 nl per side and Ringer as control. EEG's were recorded one hour before and after two hours after administration, number and mean duration of SWD were quantified. Results: Systemic injection of phenytoin doubled the number (p < .05) the number of SWD, the effect ocured immediately and persisted for 2 hours. In contrast, local injection of phenytoin reduced (p < .01) the number of SWD, also for at least 2 hours. In fact all SWDs were nearly abolished. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that phenytoin has opposite effects on absence seizures: the are aggravated after systemic administration, but reduced after administration to the somatosensory cortex. The results are also in favour of the cortical focus theory of absence epilepsy which suggests that absence epilepsy is secondary generalized. 1 H. Jurgen Wenzel, 1 Robert F. Berman, 1 Kimberley Katleba, 1 Yeung Lo, 1 Peggy Jaubert, 1 Mareike Wenzel, 1 Ari Altangerel, and 1 Philip A. Schwartzkroin ( 1 Neurological Surgery, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA ) Rationale: A significant proportion of children diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders presents with seizure abnormalities. Recent clinical data suggest that serotonin (5-HT) function is disrupted in autistic patients. Serotonin plays a significant role in brain development, in sleep-wake cycles, and in the modulation of cortical excitability. We hypothesized that disruption of the serotonin system in immature rats would lead to autism-relevant behaviors and aberrant patterns of brain excitability. To test this hypothesis, we have begun to characterize a model of ?hyperserotonemia? developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues (Physiol. Behav. 2002: 75:403?410). Methods: Time-mated pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with a non-specific 5-HT receptor agonist, 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT) (1mg/kg, s.c.), once a day from gestational day 12 through postnatal day 21 (P21); time-mated control animals were injected with saline. Immature animals (between P7 and P19) were tested on a battery of ?autism-relevant? behavioral tasks (e.g., ultrasonic vocalization (USV) when separated from dam, open field exploration, negative geotaxis, response to tactile stimulation). They were then monitored with video/EEG telemetry, with subsets of animals sacrificed (at P27) for assessment of alterations in brain serotonergic innervation, using quantitative immunocytochemistry. Results: 5-MT treatment led to inconsistent behavioral differences compared to saline-injected controls. At P19 (but not earlier), 5-MT pups exhibited decreased USV. There were no significant differences between 5-MT and saline pups on a negative geotaxis task, on open field exploration (with and without auditory stimulation), on response to tactile stimulation, and on spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze. Video/EEG recording showed a significant number of spike-like epileptiform events in 5-MT animals, but not in control rats. Immunocytochemistry for serotonin- including quantitative measurements of fiber immunoreactivity (IR) in selected brain regions - revealed significant increases (compared to age-matched controls) in hippocampal CA3 subfield and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala; 5-HT IR in central amygdala, neocortex (lamina V in parietal cortex) and lateral nucleus of the dorsal raphe showed no significant differences. Conclusions: Early 5-MT treatment failed to yield the expected range of behavioral changes in rat pups, although decreased USV in 5-MT-treated animals is arguably consistent with an autism-like deficit. The ?hyperserotonemic? 5-MT model is associated with significant region-specific increases in serotonin fiber IR, a finding opposite to the initially hypothesized change. 5-MT treated pups did show EEG abnormalities that may be consistent with increased seizure propensity in some individuals with autism.

Staley ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ; 2 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO ; and 3 Department of Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: To improve treatment of human epilepsy, animal models are developed to determine the effectiveness of anticonvulsants. The kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy has been investigated extensively and produces rats which are chronically epileptic. To fully understand the results and statistical significance of drug studies, it is necessary to understand the expected variation in seizure number and duration over a fixed period. Methods: For this study we consider 11 two month old Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with EEG radio-telemetry units. The rats were treated with varying doses of kainate and monitored using a video-EEG system for up to 5 months. EEG seizures were identified using routines written in Visual Basic 6.0 (DClamp software) and expert confirmation. Results: We have determined that there are three distinct phases after kainate-treatment: (1) a latent phase which extends up to 5 months in which there are sporadic, clustered seizures, (2) a transitional phase, in which the number of seizures increases dramatically, and (3) a stable epileptic phase in which the rats have frequent seizures. We determined the daily and 5 day average variability in each of these phases of both the number of seizures and the time spent seizing. We expressed this as the mean fractional change in these parameters, defined as the average change in the seizure parameter (either number of seizures or total length of time seizing) from one period to the next, divided by the mean value of the parameter during the phase. The average daily and 5 day changes during phase 1 were 0.96 and 0.64 for the number of seizures and 1.10 and 0.67 for the time spent seizing. Much of the reason for the large variability in daily seizure occurrence was due to seizure clustering. During both the transition phase and the stable phase, the variability decreased dramatically. For the transition phase the average daily mean fractional change in number of seizures was 0.32 for the stable epileptic phase, the average daily mean fractional change was 0.23. Conclusions: Consideration of differences in variance of seizure frequency are important in the design of experiments using the kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy. From these results it is evident that studies performed while the rats are in the ?latent phase.? For example, investigations of epileptogenesis will require either larger numbers of animals or longer observation times to achieve statistical significance in the face of higher variance in seizure frequency. Studies performed during the two later phases will more easily yield significant results. (Supported by the NIH.) 1 H.

This investigation compares the preclinical anticonvulsant profile and tolerability of rufinamide to those of established AEDs, including phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), ethosuximide (ESM), and sodium valproate (VPA). Methods: Doses of each AED were administered via both oral (CF1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats) and intraperitoneal (IP) (CF1 mice) routes; a minimum of 8 animals received each dose and at least 5 doses were administered per test. For both species and administration routes, the maximal electroshock (MES) test evaluated the efficacy of rufinamide against seizure spread and predicted its effectiveness against tonic-clonic (and also partial) seizures in man; subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) tested for raised seizure threshold and protection against clonic seizures. Mice receiving the IP dose were also administered subcutaneous strychnine (STR) to evaluate protection against tonic seizures, and subcutaneous bicuculline (BIC) and picrotoxin (PIC) to further characterize elevations in seizure threshold and clonic-seizure protection. Tolerance was assessed over 5 days with the MES test in orally administered rats. The effective dose (ED50) for each AED was defined as the amount of drug necessary to achieve a 50% decrease of induced seizure frequency. Minimal neurotoxic dose (TD50) was determined with the chimney test (rats) or the rotorod test (6 rpm) at time of peak neurotoxic effect (mice). Results: Oral rufinamide was protective against MES-induced tonic-clonic seizures in both mice and rats (ED50, 23.9 and 6.1 mg/kg, respectively) and suppressed PTZ-induced seizures in mice (ED50, 45.8 mg/kg); tolerance was not observed. Intraperitoneal rufinamide suppressed PTZ-, BIC-, and PIC-induced clonus (ED50, 54.5, 50.5, and 76.3 mg/kg, respectively) in IP-administered mice and was partially effective in the mouse STR test. For both species and delivery routes, rufinamide tolerability exceeded or was similar to that of any established AED except PHT administered orally to rats. For all tests, the protective index (ratio of TD50 to anticonvulsant ED50) of rufinamide was greater than that of any established AED. Conclusions: Rufinamide displayed a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant profile in mice and rats at doses where no side effects were observed. Rufinamide was well-tolerated by animals of both species, and the protective indices determined for rufinamide were superior to those of established AEDs. (Supported by Eisai Inc.) 1,4 Jeff T. Williams, 3,4 M. Michelle Leland, 2 Koyle D. Knape, and 2 C. ?kos Szabó ( 1 Genetics, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX ; 2 Medicine/Neurology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX ; 3 Comparative Medicine, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX ; and 4 Southwest National Primate Research Center, San Antonio, TX ) Rationale: Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR) in San Antonio, TX, manages the world's largest baboon colony, currently comprising about 3800 baboons. More than 1500 baboons?primarily P.h.anubis (64%), P.h.cynocephalus (4%), and their hybrids (29%)?are members of a single pedigree that is used for genetic analysis. The baboon is ideal for development as a genetic model of human disorders because baboon and human share many genetic, anatomical, biochemical, and physiological features, and we are using the colony at SFBR to develop the baboon as a nonhuman primate animal model for the genetics of idiopathic generalized epilepsy in humans. Methods: It has long been known that baboons at SFBR suffer spontaneous seizures. The prevalence of seizures in the baboon colony is 20?30%, and about 10?20 new cases per year are reported, corresponding to an incidence of about 2%. We are undertaking a retrospective case-detection survey of veterinary records to evaluate living and dead members of the colony for a history of seizures, and to better characterize the epidemiology of seizures in the colony. Results: We have reviewed records for 761 baboons (235 living, 526 dead, 802 F, 871 M) and identified as seizures 1353 events in 444 baboons. Of these, 579 (43%) seizures were witnessed, and 774 (57%) were suspected on the basis of periorbital or other facial trauma, which has been found to be a reliable proxy indicator of seizures. Among witnessed seizures, 467 (81%) were spontaneous, and 112 (19%) were provoked by handling and/or ketamine administration. Seizures are usually brief: the median duration is 40s (range 5?300s, n = 134). Seizures are most common during the morning hours (68%, n = 314). Seizures are equally distributed between the sexes (212 F, 232 M) and sex-specific age distributions are similar. Seizures are observed at all ages, but are most prevalent in younger animals?about 40% of cases are younger than 4yr, and about 60% of cases have their first seizure prior to reaching adulthood (6?7 yr). There is no significant difference in the subspecies prevalence of seizure. Conclusions: These data help establish the baboon as a valid nonhuman primate animal model for idiopathic generalized epilepsy in humans. The prevalence of seizures in the baboon population is much greater than can be expected in a comparable human sample, and the epidemiological features of the seizures in the colony are similar to those seen in human populations. The availability of accurate pedigree information for the baboon colony enables quantitative genetic analysis to identify genetic contributions to seizures and related traits.

Rothman ( 1 Department of Neurology and Hope Center for Neurological Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Over the past decade there has been great interest in the potential use of brain cooling as a treatment for neurological diseases. Our previous work has shown that focal cooling to 20°C with a thermoelectric (Peltier) device can rapidly terminate neocortical seizures and produces no cortical injury. Because there have been relatively few studies examining the possibility of brain injury caused by cooling, we decided to determine whether cooling to temperatures close to freezing would lead to any detectable structural alterations in either intact cortex or hippocampal slices. Methods: In vivo experiments were performed on halothane-anesthetized rats. A craniotomy was created over the left hemisphere. Cortical cooling was accomplished with a Peltier device, which made direct contact with the pial surface and maintained a temperature of 5°C on the brain surface. The cooling system was activated by a computer program every 2 minutes for 30 seconds, over 2 hours. The rats were sacrificed 3 day post operation. Paraffin sections of the brain were prepared and examined using Nissl and TUNEL staining for necrotic injury, neuronal loss, and apoptotic death. For in vitro studies, 500 ?m hippocampal slices were prepared from 2?3 month old green-fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing transgenic mice (line M). Slices were studied in a submerged chamber maintained at 33°C and cooled by perfusion with chilled ACSF. The temperature declined by 5°C/min. In each slice, one or two GFP-positive, distal CA1 dendrites were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 multiphoton microscope. We acquired Z-stacks of the same dendrites and associated spines every 15?30 minutes for 2 hours. The images were analyzed off-line by a blinded observer to assess changes in spine number (gain or loss) at different temperatures. Results: In the in vivo experiments there were no evidence of necrosis and apoptosis from Nissl and TUNEL staining on the cooling regions. Quantitative cell counts showed 1075±103 neurons/mm2 in control cortex and 1098±171 neurons/mm2 in cooled cortex (p > 0.05). When hippocampal slices were cooled to 10°C, there was no loss of dendritic spines over the 120 minutes. However, in slices that were cooled to 5°C, we saw a loss of spines and obvious beading of the dendritic shaft. With rewarming, the beading resolved and the spines reappeared. We did not identify new spine formation with either prolonged cooling or rewarming. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cooling to as low as 5°C is well tolerated by the in vivo and in vitro mammalian central nervous system. The results also showed that there is a large margin of safety between the range of temperatures required for proposed therapeutic uses of hypothermia and the temperatures capable of inducing even transient neuronal alterations.

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200?300grams were used as subjects. SE was induced 7 days after placement of epidural electrodes, by lithium pretreatment followed by low dose of pilocarpine i.p.(30mg/kg). The intracranial EEG was continuously recorded from pilocarpine injection until the end of SE. The pattern of EEG were divided into 5 stages; discrete ictal discharge (d), merging stage, continuous ictal discharge stage (c), continuous ictal discharge with flat period (f), periodic epileptiform discharge stage. Phenytoin (30mg/Kg, PHT), valproate (100mg/Kg, VPA) and phenytoin with valproate (PNT+VPA) were injected during discrete (d), continuous ictal discharge (c), continuous ictal discharge with flat period stages (f), respectively. Results: SE was induced in 78/96 (81.3%). The mortality was 20%(2/10) in control group, 14.3% (3/21) in PHT treated group, 18.2% (4/22) in VPA group and 8% (2/25) in PHT+VPA group. In control group, duration of total EEG seizure was 1008.0±89.47 minutes. Continuous stage significantly was shortened in VPA-d group and PHT+VPA-d group compared to control group (p < 0.05). Also, the durations of the periodic epileptiform discharge stage and total seizure were reduced in VPA-d, PHT+VPA-d and PNT+VPA-c groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This results suggest that analysis of progressive EEG pattern in SE may predict the prognosis of SE and response to treatment. And early treatment according to EEG monitoring and polytherapy are effective treatment in SE. 1 Minhua Zhang, 1 Michael J. McLean, 1 Stefan Engstrom, and 1 Robert R. Holcomb ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Seizures due to overdose with the bronchodilator, theophylline (THEO), can be life-threatening in humans. Mildly toxic doses of THEO did not produce seizures, but predisposed outbred mice to seizures induced by sound (THEO-induced audiogenic seizures; THEO-AGS). Here, we describe effects of several anticonvulsant drugs and static magnetic fields on THEO-AGS. Methods: ICR/CD1 male mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. Animal handling conformed to NIH guidelines and was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. THEO and anticonvulsant drugs were injected intraperitoneally (IP) before sound stimulation (recording of rattling keys; 90?110 dB). The device and methods for magnetic field stimulation have been published (McLean et al., Epi Res 55:105?116, 2003). Concomitant controls received THEO IP, but no other treatment. Audiogenic seizures (AGS) evolved from wild running (WR) to loss of righting (LOR), clonic jerks (CLO), tonic hindlimb extension (THE) and death (DEA) in < 1 min. Results: Sound stimulation did not result in seizures in ICR mice. Mice (>90%) given 75 mg/kg THEO IP 10 minutes before sound stimulation (blood level ?71 mg/ml) had AGS. Pretreatment with anticonvulsant drugs (AED) prevented AGS manifestations to different degrees with the following order of potency: Non-toxic doses of gabapentin (ED50 vs CLO 60 mg/kg, 30 min before sound; ?36 mg/ml) and pregabalin (?60 mg/kg, 30 min before sound) provided nearly complete control. Phenytoin provided nearly complete control at an intoxicating dose that produce abnormal movements (80 mg/kg, 2 hr before sound; ?170 mg/ml). Levetiracetam provided partial protection at high non-toxic doses (up to 500 mg/kg, 1 hour before sound; 361 mg/ml). Static magnetic fields effective against AGS in inbred DBA/2 mice (?5 millitesla and 0.3-1 tesla/meter averaged over volume of mouse head) provided no protection against THEO-AGS. Conclusions: Intoxicating doses of THEO did not produce seizures, but had proconvulsant effects that resulted in seizures in response to sound. THEO-AGS in outbred mice were more severe than AGS in inbred DBA/2 mice. THEO-AGS were lethal if untreated. Seizure control required higher doses of certain AED than AGS in DBA/2 mice. Magnetic fields effective in DBA/2 mice were ineffective against THEO-AGS, perhaps due to greater seizure severity and widespread distribution of THEO.

Ghaddar, 1 Yehezkel Ben-Ari, and 1 Rustem Khazipov ( 1 INMED, INSERM U29, Marseilles, France ) Rationale: Developmental studies using brain preparations in vitro have suggested that neurotransmitter GABA exerts excitatory action on immature neurons. For example, in the neonatal rat hippocampal slices, drugs that enhance the postsynaptic action of GABA, such as diazepam, increase the amplitude and frequency of network driven Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDPs)from birth till the postnatal day (P)10, when GABA switches from excitatory to inhibitory. However, it remains unknown when similar excitatory action of GABA takes place also in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the action of GABA on the neonatal rat hippocampal and neocortical neurons in vivo. Methods: Extracellular field and multiple unit activity (MUA) recordings Results: Using extracellular field and multiple unit activity (MUA) recordings we found that diazepam and phenobarbital injected intraperiotaneally increase the frequency of the sharp waves in the hippocampus from P4?8 - but not adult - rats. In several cases we also observed interictal-like activity composed of single or multiple population spikes in P4?8 animals. Conclusions: Thus, positive allosteric GABA(A) modulators benzodiazepines and barbiturates enhance the excitability of the hippocampal network in vivo before P8, suggesting that GABA exerts excitatory action at the early developmental stages in vivo. This study raises concern on possible proconvulsive effects of GABAergic drugs in preterm infants. (Supported by INSERM.)

AB  - As society ages, aging medical problems such as organ damage or failure among senior citizens increases, raising the demand for organ repair technologies. Synthetic materials have been developed and applied in various parts of human body to meet the biomedical needs. Hydrogels, in particular, have found extensive applications as wound healing, drug delivery and controlled release, and scaffold materials in the human body. The development of the next generation of soft hydrogel biomaterials focuses on facile synthetic methods, efficacy of treatment, and tunable multi-functionalities for applications. Supramolecular 3D entities are highly attractive materials for biomedical application. They are assembled by modules via various non-covalent bonds (hydrogen bonds, p?p stacking and/or van der Waals interactions). Biodegradable thermogels are a class of such supramolecular assembled materials. Their use as soft biomaterials and their related applications are described in this Review.

AB  - 1 Joshua R. Anderson, 1 Nazih Moufarrij, 1 John Gorecki, and 1 Kore Liow ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Via Christi Regional Medical Center, Wichita, KS ) Rationale: Anterior Medial Temoral Lobe Resection (AMTR) is a procedure widely performed for refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome at tertiary care university-based medical centers. However, increasingly, more tertiary non-university-based community hospitals or university affiliated community hospitals are performing these procedures. There is little available outcome data for AMTR performed at community hospitals. Methods: Retrospective chart review performed on 33 patients who underwent AMTR at the 945 bed tertiary care Via Christi Regional Medical Center in Wichita, Kansas from 2002?2003. All patients were worked up at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center including Video Epilepsy Monitoring, Specialized Epilepsy Magnetic Resonance Imaging Protocol, FD Glucose Positron Emission Tomography Scans, Intracarotid Amobarbitol Testings, Intracranial Recording by fellowship-trained epileptologist. Neurosurgeon was performing AMTR at academic institution prior to praticing at community hospital. Results: The patient population of 33 people included 16 males and 17 females averaging 32 years of age. All had complex or simple partial seizures. Patients had waited for an average of 20 years before being referred to epilepsy center for surgical evaluation. Patients had failed a average of 3.7 seizure medications, and they were on 2 seizure medications at the time of surgery, and had avarage of 17.9 seizures/month prior to surgery. 21 patients had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) abnormalities with 11 mesial temporal sclerosis noted. 17 patients had right sided resection while 16 right sided resections. Post-operatively, 31 of 33 (93%) patients had Engel Class I surgical outcome at average follow up duration of 6 months. 30 of 33 (90%) patients are gainfully employed or attending school/college as of last clinic follow up. 27 of the 31 (87%) adult patients who were not able to drive before surgery are now driving. Surgical complications included 1 chronic aphasia, 1 venous infarct in the posterior cerebral artery distribution and 1 scalp infection. Conclusions: AMTR epilepsy surgery performed at tertiary care community hospital in Kansas by fellowship-trained epileptologist and neurosurgeon shows comparable favorable outcome.

Mariani, 1 Lauro Seda, 1 Rodio Brandao, 1,2 Meire Argentoni-Baldochi, 1,2 Carla Baise-Zung, 1,2 Cassio R. Forster, and 1,2 Valeria A. Mello ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Hospital Brigadeiro, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Clinica de Epilepsia de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: The use of valproic acid has been associated to bleeding in some centers and reports. On the other hand, there is no consensus on if valproate should be withdrawn before major surgical procedures, such as neurosurgical operations or not. This paper reviews our experience with refractory epileptic patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures and who were under high dosage of valproate which has not been withdrawn before surgery. Methods: One hundred consecutive refractory epileptic patients (children and adults) who have been receiving at least 1500mg of valproate daily (mean = 2250mg/day) and who have been submitted to epilepsy surgery have been retrospectively reviewed. All patients have been submitted to standard preoperative coagulation tests including platelet function and have no formal abnormal findings (patients with clear preoperative coagulopathies have been excluded from this analysis). Results: Six patients presented with extensive, clearly abnormal, bleeding during surgery; the mean transfusion volume was 3,0 liters. Only 1 patient presented with clinically significant postoperative hemathoma (epidural) that had to be evacuated. These 6 patients had more transfusions and longer hospital permanence, but no difference regarding long-term outcome. All these patients have been receiving at least 2500mg of valproate daily (mean 3000mg/day) and had platelet counts at the lower normal range. The other patients did not differ from patients not receiving valproate regarding intraoperative bleeding, hospital stay, transfusion or outcome. Conclusions: Although not statistically significant, patients receiving 2500mg/day or more of valproic acid and low (although within normal range) platelet counts might be in risk for intraoperative bleeding during major surgical procedures. Considering the potential risk for major neurological complications, we recommend that valproate should be withdrawn in this selected patient population. 1 Jorge A. Gonzalez-Martinez, 2 Teeradej Srikijvilaikul, 3 Imad M. Najm, 4 Christopher Kellinghaus, and 1 William E. Bingaman ( 1 Neurosurgery, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; 2 Neurosurgery, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand ; 3 Neurology, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 4 Neurology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany ) Rationale: Outcome after epilepsy surgery with histopathology correlations indicated that different pathological findings of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) had different outcome. FCD and balloon cells demonstrated best outcome with 75% seizure-free at least 1-year follow-up. Our objective is to correlate seizure outcome after surgery for FCD with pathological findings and variables associated with seizures outcome. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent surgery for drug-resistant partial epilepsy due to FCD and confirmed by histopathologic analysis between 1990?2002 with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Histological findings were classified as: type Ia, architectural abnormalities, type Ib, architectural abnormalities plus giant or immature neurons, type IIa, architectural abnormalities plus dysmorphic neurons, and type IIb, architectural abnormalities plus dysmorphic neurons plus balloon cells. Seizure outcome was classified according to Engel's classification. Results: Sixty-two patients were identified, 53% of patients were seizure-free (Engel Ia) and 79% had favorable outcome (Engel I  and 2 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Clinica de Epilepsia de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Extratemporal resection is often larger then temporal lobe resection in patients with refractory epilepsy, especially in patients with normal MRI findings. Cortical resection margins could be restricted by the presence of eloquent areas within the planned resection or due to individual vascular, especially venous, anatomy. This paper discusses our experience while performing extratemporal resections in patients with normal MRI regarding the intraoperative factors limiting cortical resection. Methods: Sixty-one patients with extratemporal refractory epilepsy and normal MRI were studied (both children and adults). All patients have been submitted to invasive neurophysiological investigation by means of chronically implanted subdural electrodes. Planned cortical resection necessarily included the ictal-onset region and the region from which habitual seizures were elicited by stimulation and, whenever possible, the interictal zone. Results: In 11 patients cortical resection has been limited by the presence of eloquent areas within the planned procedure; in 28 patients the cortical resection has been limited by the patient's venous drainage pattern and in 6, it has been limited by both. There was no mortality and no unexpected neurological morbidity. Conclusions: Despite the fact the both the presence of eloquent areas and vascular anatomy could limit the actual cortical resection in extratemporal epileptic patients, the venous' drainage pattern appears to be the most important single factor. In 64% of these patients, the cortical resection suggested by invasive neurophysiological findings would be limited by one of these factors, or both. 1 Mar Carreño, 1 Antonio Donaire, 2 Inés Barceló, 1 Nuria Bargalló, and 1 Jordi Rumiá ( 1 Neurology, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain ; and 2 Neurology, Hospital de Son Dureta, Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca, Spain ) Rationale: Linear scleroderma in coup de sabre (LSCS) presents as band-like sclerotic skin lesions, usually involving the frontoparietal area of the head. Progression of the disease may result in hemifacial syndrome (identical to idiopathic Parry Romberg syndrome -PRS-). LSCS and PRS may be accompanied focal epilepsy, which is often refractory to medical treatment. Methods: We report two patients, one with LSCs and other with idiopathic PRS who presented with a clinical and pathological picture identical to Rasmussen encephalitis (RE). Results: Patient #1 started to have seizures at the age of 3, consisting of clonic twitching of the right arm and bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures. Seizures were pharmacorresistant. Progressive hemiparesis and cognitive decline were noticed by the age of 5, in addition to slight atrophy of the left side of the face, which progressed over the next years. MRIs showed marked and progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere. Presurgical evaluation at the age of 10 showed seizures arising from the left frontocentral region. She underwent a left functional hemispherectomy. Pathology showed massive neuronal cortical loss, reactive astrocitosis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and microglial nodules, compatible with RE. She has had a 75% seizure reduction. Patient #2 started to have seizures at the age of 23. Seizures consisted of paresthesias in the left thigh extending to the left arm and left hemiface, sometimes progressing into clonic movements of the left arm. At the age of 18 he had been diagnosed with LSCS (focal lesion over the right frontoparietal area), and left hemidystonia, succesfully treated with botulinum toxin. Seizures were initially controlled with carbamazepine. Seizure frequency suddenly increased at the age of 30 and he developed epilepsia partialis continua involving the left arm. Fluctuating hemiparesis was noticed, first after clusters of seizures and later in between seizures. MRIs showed progressive atrophy of the right hemisphere involving also the right basal ganglia. He underwent presurgical evaluation at the age of 33. Seizures were seen to arise from the right parietal region. He underwent invasive video-EEG monitoring with subdural electrodes over the right parietal region. He had a focal resection of the right parietal area. He has been seizure free for three months. Pathology showed focal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, microglial nodules, focal neuronal loss, and reactive astrocytosis, all suggestive of RE. Conclusions: LSCs and PRS seem to be part of the same spectrum of diseases characterized by progressive facial atrophy and neurological symptoms. Refractory focal epilepsy is common and surgical treament may be indicated. Pathological findings may be identical to chronic encephalitis (RE), suggesting a common autoimmune pathogenesis. 1 Dongwoo John Chang, and 1 Christi DeLemos ( 1 Neurological Surgery, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA ) Rationale: Decades of successful empirical experience with epilepsy surgery have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of surgical intervention on selected seizure syndromes. Recently, the beneficial effect of anterior temporal lobe resection has been reaffirmed by a prospective randomized clinical trial for patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (New England Journal of Medicine 2001). Despite these findings, only a small minority of potential surgical candidates undergo epilepsy surgery in the United States. This study attempts to determine the attitudes and practice patterns of general neurologists vis-a-vis epileptologists regarding epilepsy treatment in the State of California and in the State of New York. Methods: Confidential e-mail questionnaires were sent to all neurologists in the State of California and in the State of New York. Two groups were queried as comparison cohorts: epileptologists and all other neurologists, including those who have other declared subspecialty interests in neurology. The survey covers all facets of epilepsy management, including questions regarding the definition of medical intractability, attitudes and practice patterns regarding surgical treatment of seizure disorders, the necessity and feasibility of further randomized clinical trials for other surgical procedures for epilepsy, and the perceived relative value of specialized epilepsy treatment centers. Results: A complete analysis of the findings of this study will be presented at the December 2005 meeting of the American Epilepsy Society. The final results of this survey are unavailable at the time of the writing of this abstract. Conclusions: Published data demonstrate the benefit of epilepsy surgery in selected patient subgroups. However, because surgery is perceived to be invasive, it is important to determine the burden of proof that needs to be satisfied in order to allow selected surgical procedures to become primary therapy in epilepsy management as opposed to remaining as options of last resort. 1 Peter Chin, 2 Anne Berg, 3 Susan Spencer, 4 Michael Sperling, 5 Shlomo Shinnar, 6 John Langfitt, 7 Carl Bazil, 8 Thaddeus Walczak, 9 Steven Pacia, 1 Martin Lee, and 1 Barbara Vickrey ( 1 Neuro, UCLA ; 2 BIOS, NIU ; 3 Neuro, Yale ; 4 Neuro, Thomas Jefferson ; 5 Neuro, Montefiore Med. Ctr. ; 6 Neuro, U. of Rochester ; 7 Neuro, Columbia ; 8 MINCEP ; and 9 Neuro, NYU ) Rationale: Patients often suffer detrimental effects of longstanding epilepsy with respect to social adjustment, education and employment before undergoing resective surgery as a last resort. Post-operative employment gains have been shown to enhance the impact of epilepsy surgery, so studying employment patterns may inform interventions aimed at reintegrating patients into society. Methods: At 7 US centers, 396 patients with focal epilepsy enrolled in a cohort study and underwent resective surgery. Eligible patients had refractory epilepsy for at least 2 years, failed 2 or more AED's, and had at least 20 seizures in the 24 months prior to enrollment. Data were collected from interviews and medical records at baseline and at 3, 12, and 24 months following surgery. Descriptive data on employment pre- and post-surgery were examined. Associations between employment patterns and disability status, race (white vs. non-white) and age < 35 were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: The cohort was 48% male; average age was 37 years. Mean duration of intractable epilepsy was 13 years. Prior to surgery 45% of the cohort was regularly employed, including 148 (38%) employed full-time and 27 (7%) part-time. Other categories at baseline included 102 (26%) disabled and unemployed; 45 (11%) unemployed; 27 (7%) in school; 22 (6%) homemakers; 12 (3%) irregular or seasonal work; 7 (2%) retired; 3 (1%) volunteer work only; and 1 other. Two years after surgery 52% of the cohort was employed, representing a net employment gain of 7%. Twenty-two percent of those who were disabled and unemployed before surgery obtained regular work, compared with 23% of those who were unemployed but not disabled (p = .93). Whites were more likely than non-whites to be employed before surgery (49% vs 25%, p = .002) and 24 months after surgery (56% vs. 37%, p = .007) but were not significantly more likely to change employment status at 24 months (p = .35). Age under 35 did not influence work status before surgery (p = .55) and 24 months after surgery (p = .77) or change in employment at 24 months (p = .07). Conclusions: Improved employment status is seen in all categories following epilepsy surgery except the retired (0 of 7). However, overall employment gains remain low after 2 years because 12% of the cohort found work but 5% concurrently lost their jobs. Vocational rehabilitation efforts should be enhanced and should include those who were working prior to surgery but unemployed at follow up. The potential for post-operative employment among those who were formerly disabled from epilepsy does not appear to differ from that of the non-disabled unemployed. Race and age below 35 did not affect post-operative change in employment. (Supported by NIH NINDS RO1 32375?06 and the RWJ Foundation.) 1 Walter J. Hader, 1 Neelan Pillay, 1 S. Terence Myles, 1 Lisa Partlo, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Clinical Neuropsychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; and Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Universtiy of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Selective resection of mesial temporal structures in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy has been advocated in an attempt to minimize temporal neocortical removal associated with standard temporal resections. The benefits of such a strategy have not been not well documented. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent either selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy (SAH) or a standard cortico-amygdalo-hippocampectomy (CAH) for their intractable temporal lobe epilepsy at the University of Calgary was completed. Patients had either a transcortical SAH or CAH, extending to 4.5 cm on the dominant middle temporal gyrus and 6 cm on the non-dominant temporal lobe Results: A total of 72 patients were identified. Forty-eight (67%)had SAH and 24(33%)CAH. No difference in age at onset of epilepsy, side of surgery, seizure types, duration of epilepsy or age at surgery was identified between the two groups Patients undergoing SAH had preoperative evidence of MTS on MRI (81 vs 33%) while 67% of MRIs were normal in patients undergoing CAH. Forty-five (63%) of 72 patients were free of disabling seizures at last follow up. Clinical and formal visual field deficits were more common in CAH than SAH. The duration of stay in hospital was shorter in patients with SAH. Detailed pre and post operative neuropsychological testing was available in 36 patients and revealed no significant differences in those undergoing SAH or CAH Conclusions: Patients treated with SAH for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrate greater evidence of mesial temporal lobe pathology, suffer fewer visual complications and require shorter duration of stay in hospital than patients undergoing more standard CAH. Neuropsychological consequences of temporal lobe surgery in this study were similar in those patients treated with both SAH and CAH. 1,2 Leigh R. Hochberg, 1 Selim Suner, 1 Matthew R. Fellows, 3 Gerhard M. Friehs, and 1,4 John P. Donoghue ( 1 Neuroscience, Brown Univ., Providence, RI ; 2 Neurology, Mass. Gen. Hosp./Brigham  3 Clinical Neurosciences, Brown Univ., Providence, RI ; and 4 Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems, Inc., Foxboro, MA ) Rationale: Cortical physiology has been studied in animals for more than 40 years using single electrodes to record action potentials under different stimulus or behavioral conditions. Microwires or microelectrode arrays have now made it possible to record the activity of dozens to hundreds of individual neurons and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously. An array of 96 silicon/platinum microelectrodes has been used to record chronically (months to years) from macaque primary motor cortex (M1). This technology, BrainGate, forms the basis for a human neuromotor prosthesis for persons with tetraparesis, now in pilot clinical trial. If the array also provides useful neural signals acutely ? minutes to hours after placement in human cortex ? it could prove valuable for applications in seizure detection, intraoperative monitoring, and neurocritical care. Methods: 4x4 mm arrays of 96 microelectrodes (Cyberkinetics, Inc.) were implanted into macaque M1 or visual cortex (V1, data courtesy of D.L. Ringach). In the M1 experiments, recordings were first attempted in the awake animal the following day. In V1, recordings were obtained beginning 10?20 minutes after array insertion while the animal was sedated with propofol/sufentanil. Single units, multi-unit waveforms, and LFPs were collected while the animal was sitting in a primate chair (M1) or while retinotopic mapping was performed (V1). Neural signals were transferred to a connector; amplified signals from each electrode were manually separated into data streams and stored digitally. Results: In both animals receiving a M1 array, action potentials, multi-unit waveforms, and LFPs were recorded simultaneously on post-operative day 1. 62 and 29 discriminated units with ?fair? (signal:noise ratio approx. 2 to 4) or better waveforms were recorded in each animal, respectively. LFPs were also observed from an additional 32 and 31 electrodes, respectively. In the 10 V1 animals, LFPs were seen consistently on all electrodes as soon as recording was initiated. Multi-unit waveforms were seen on most electrodes, and a range of 15?70 single units was isolated in each experiment. Conclusions: Microelectrode arrays can record from cortical neuronal ensembles as soon as 10?20 minutes after insertion. It thus may be possible to record human cortical neuronal activity in a variety of acute and subacute settings. Potential studies include high spatial resolution recording of epileptigenic tissue in patients undergoing subdural grid placement (including further investigation of interictal spike physiology and seizure prediction paradigms) and neuronal/LFP activity patterns in tissue at risk for ischemia secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm.

This study is aimed at investigation of the surgical outcome and the prognostic factors of epilepsy patients with a brain tumor. Methods: We acquired the data from the epilepsy surgery cohort since May 1995. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients who had 1) a hemispheric intra-axial neuroepithelial tumor, 2) seizure as an only presenting feature, 3) no neurological deficit at presentation, 4) at least 1 year of follow-up after surgery. We excluded highly malignant tumors (world health organization grade IV). We evaluated the seizure outcome according to Engel's classification. The degree of resection was assessed on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: 75 patients fulfilled the criteria. Median follow-up was 3.3 years (range 1.0?9.3 years). Ganglioglioma (25 cases) was the most common histopathological entity and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (18 cases), oligodendroglioma (13 cases) and diffuse astrocytoma (6 cases) followed. Eight cases of world health organization (WHO) grade III tumors were included. One year after surgery, 77.3% of the patients were seizure-free (class I). Overall seizure-free rate at last follow-up rose up to 85.7% and 72% of those patients were free of anticonvulsants. Favorable seizure outcome was associated with the degree of resection, pathological grade, tumor location that required awake anesthesia, intractability and EEG concordance in univariate analysis. Among theses factors, only degree of resection and pathological grade gained statistical significance in multivariate analysis (p = 0.023, 0.020 respectively). Concomitant hippocampal sclerosis (dual pathology) was found in 9 patients (12%). Resection of both the tumor and mesial structures yielded better outcome than resection of the tumor alone (p = 0.048). Conclusions: Degree of surgical resection and pathological grade of the tumor are the most important factors for seizure outcome in epileptic patients with a brain tumor. In the case of dual pathology, both the tumor and mesial structures should be resected for better seizure outcome. 1 George L. Morris, 1 Christopher M. Inglese, 2 Wade M. Mueller, and 3 Sara J. Swanson ( 1 Regional Epilepsy Center, St Luke's Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI ; 2 Department Neurosurgery, MCW, Milwaukee, WI ; and 3 Department of Neuropsychology, MCW, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: To determine the effect of normal MRI findings on seizure free outcomes following epilepsy surgery Methods: We reviewed the results of epilepsy surgeries performed in Milwaukee from 1991 to 2001. In 362 evaluations of epilepsy, we found 214 surgical resections. We found 176 cases with valid MRI results, surgery locations, and 6 month seizure-free outcomes. We divided patients into seizure-free versus non-seizure-free at their 6 month assessment. Surgery locations were defined as lobar or multi-lobar. MRIs were collapsed into normal or abnormal resuilts. We performed an analsis using Pearson's Chi-squared technique on the relationship between normal versus abnormal MRI results and the patient's seizure outcome, including analysis by surgery location. Results: Of the 176 surgeries performed, 136 were temporal and 22 were frontal. Seizure freedon coccurred in 103 of temporal resections (76%) and 8 of frontal resections (37%). Abnormal MRIs were found in 92 temporal resections (67%) and 15 frontal resections (68%). Seizure freedom was no different in patients with normal versus abnormal MRIs (p = 0.991). Seizure freedom rates for temporal resections were 70% in normal MRI versus 77% in abnormal MRI (p = 0.43). Seizure freedom rates for frontal resections in normal MRI were 42% versus 33% in abnormal MRIs. Conclusions: Normal MRI in the evaluation of localization-related epilepsies did not influence seizure-free rates in our surgical experience. Previous studies suggest the presence of MRI abnormalities improves surgical outcomes and we have previously reported abnormalities of prognostic significance. Patients presenting for epilepsy surgery should not be discouraged that normal MRI findings may influence their outcome. 1,2 Johan Pallud, 1 Ute Haussler, 1 Sophie Hamelin, 2 Bertrand Devaux, and 1 Antoine Depaulis ( 1 U704, Inserm-UJF, Grenoble, France ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Sainte-Anne Hospital, Paris, France ) Rationale: Surgical resection of mesial temporal structures is an effective treatment of medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). However, dominant hippocampus resection may ensue with postoperative verbal memory deficit that warrants surgical alternatives to resection attempts. Based on the principle of multiple subpial transections, we developed in the kainate (KA) model of MTLE in mice, a technique of intrahippocampal transection, to disrupt longitudinally projecting axonal circuits that may play a role in generation and propagation of seizures. Methods: C57BL/6 adult mice were stereotactically injected with KA (1 nmol in 50 nl) in the right dorsal hippocampus and equiped for hippocampal and cortical EEG recording. Two hippocampal electrodes were placed along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, 1.4 mm apart, with the anterior one located at the site of KA injection. Three weeks later, when spontaneous recurrent focal discharges occurred, an intrahippocampal transection was stereotactically performed in the transversal plan between the 2 hippocampal electrodes. Seizures were quantified on EEG recordings before transection and during the following 3 weeks. Animals with such transections were compared to sham operated animals and animals with electrolytic lesion of the hippocampus. Upon completion of experiments, histological controls were performed to ascertain the hippocampal sclerosis (neuronal loss, gliosis, mossy fiber sprouting and granule cell dispersion), the position of the electrodes and the extent of the transection. Results: After a complete hippocampal transection (n = 6), no seizures were recorded at the hippocampal electrode located posterior to the transection, whereas discharges persisted at the KA focus, with a reduction of their occurrence and an increase of their duration. After partial hippocampal transection (n = 6) discharges, without modification of their occurrence and duration, were recorded at both hippocampal electrodes, as well as in the sham group (n = 6). After hippocampal electrolytic lesion (n = 6), no discharges were recorded at both hippocampal electrodes. Conclusions: Complete intrahippocampal transversal transection stops diffusion of discharges within the hippocampus. Moreover, such transections also modify the generation of focal discharges, which are less frequent and of a longer duration as compared to controls. These results suggest a role of longitudinally projecting axonal circuits of the hippocampus in the generation and the diffusion of seizures in this model of MTLE.

Baumgartner ( 1 Department of Neurology/Texas Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX ; 2 Department of Surgery ; and 3 Department of Neurosurgery ) Rationale: The corpus callosum is the principle pathway linking the cerebral corticies, anatomically and neurophysiologically. Corpus callosotomy (CC) is a palliative surgical procedure used in patients with generalized seizure types. It interrupts bilateral synchrony and is most effective in the treatment of both tonic and atonic seizures. With the introduction of the vagus nerve stimulator, CC has seemingly declined in many epilepsy surgical centers. At our center, though the number of CCs declined in the years 2000 and 2001, in recent years it has regained prominence. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the number of CCs performed between 1995 and March 2005 by a single surgeon (JB). The number of surgeries done on a yearly basis, extent of the procedure (partial versus complete), repeat operations (completion of CC and focal resection after CC) and acute/subacute surgical complications were assessed. Results: The patient's ages ranged from 18 months to 23 years. Eighty-nine patients had a total of ninety-seven surgeries (8 in 1995; 10 in 1996; 14 in 1997; 12 in 1998; 14 in 1999; 1 in 2000; 0 in 2001; 8 in 2002; 15 in 2003; 12 in 2004; and 4 thus far in 2005). Fifty-five patients had partial CCs, thirty patients had complete CCs, and information was unavailable in four. Seven patients with partial CCs returned for completion after their seizures were not adequately controlled; one of whom had to have two further surgeries. Four cases returned for focal resection after a primary focus was identified post CC. Rare complications included a bone flap infection in 2 children; transient diabetes insipidus in 7 patients; and small frontal lobe infarcts in 3 patients. The operating time from incision to complete closure decreased over time (mean duration of approximately 60 minutes). The duration of the hemi-body neglect/disconnection syndrome seen post CC, has also declined over time. Information on time to discharge was available in patients from 1999. The time to discharge decreased over time from a mean of 8.3 days in 1999 to 5.4 in 2004, suggesting a decrease in complication rate. Conclusions: Our institution has seen a resurgence in the number of CCs performed in recent years. It has been effective in rapidly decreasing or eliminating both tonic and atonic seizures. The overall morbidity has been remarkably low. With good patient selection, using an experienced surgeon, the CC should still be entertained as a palliative procedure in patients with tonic and atonic seizures, primarily in patients with frequent seizure inflicted injuries. 1 Vicenta Salanova, 1 Omkar Markand, 1 Robert Worth, and 1 Hema Patel ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Objectives: To determine whether, there are significant differences in the clinical history, evaluation, complication rate and outcome, between younger and older patients undergoing surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy Methods: Sixty-four patients 40 years of age or older (group 1) with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) underwent surgery following a comprehensive presurgical evaluation. We compared the history, clinical manifestations, surgical outcome, pathologic diagnosis, surgical outcome and the complication rate with 28 patients with TLE treated surgically at < 18 years of age (group 2, and noted any significant differences) Results: Group 1; 64 patients (40 yrs or >): The age of seizure onset ranged from 1 yr to 46 yrs, the age at surgery from 40 yrs to 59 yrs. 23% had a history of febrile seizures (FS), 81% had abnormal head MRIs, and 73% had abnormal FDG-PET scans, 18% required invasive recordings. Thirty seven patients underwent right and 27 had left sided resections. There was no surgical mortality, one patient (1.5%) had a mild hemiparesis. 63% became seizure free and 23% had rare seizures (follow-up 1yr to 18 yrs). Group 2; 28 patients (<18 yrs): The age of seizure onset ranged from 1 yr to 13 yrs, and the age at surgery from 8 yrs to 17 yrs. 54% had a history of FS, 62% had abnormal head MRIs, and 94% abnormal FDG-PET scans, 10% required invasive recordings. 54% had mesial temporal sclerosis.There was no surgical mortality, or complications. 79% became seizure free, and 7% had rare seizures (follow-up 1 yr to 18 yrs) Conclusions: While the older patients had a favorable outcome, the younger patients who had a higher incidence of febrile convulsions, and less demand for invasive studies, fared even better, and had no complications, emphasizing the need for earlier surgical treatment 1 Janel Schneider, and 1 Daniela Minecan ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI ) Rationale: Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a relentlessly progressive disease with onset most commonly in childhood. Clinically, RE is characterized by the development of refractory partial seizures and progressive hemiparesis. The exact etiology of RE is not known, although recent scientific studies have implicated an underlying immune mechanism. These studies have led to trials of various immunomodulatory therapies, some of which have shown potential benefit, with improved seizure frequency and delayed progression of neurologic deficit. Yet, this benefit is variable and often short-lived. The only proven curative therapy for RE is functional hemispherectomy. This radical surgery is typically performed after significant neurologic deficit has occurred. Affected children may have the potential for recovery of the motor and language functions of the involved hemisphere. However, a dilemma is faced in deciding on the appropriate treatment course for adolescent or adult onset cases of RE which often have a more variable course and slower progression. In these individuals, a temporizing treatment is desirable as the clinical consequences of functional hemispherectomy may hasten the development of permanent neurologic deficit. There are few reports on the outcome in older RE patients after other, less radical, surgical interventions. Methods: We report a case of late-onset RE, in which the patient had become progressively disabled by her seizures, specifically the development of epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) and the adverse effects of high doses of multiple anti-epileptic medications. Despite the severity of her seizures, neurologically, she had no evidence of permanent motor deficit. Results: Intracranial EEG monitoring identified the area involved in her focal motor seizures and focal resection of this area resulted in dramatic improvement of seizure frequency and allowed for the initiation of a medication taper. This resection resulted in minimal motor deficits of the corresponding side and overall the patient experienced a significant improvement in her quality of life. Conclusions: Based on this experience, it may be proposed that focal surgical resection should be considered in older RE patient's who are disabled primarily by their seizures and have relative preservation of neurologic function, thus avoiding the certain deficits from functional hemispherectomy. The duration of this benefit is unclear, although in our patient improvments have been sustained for a period of months. Long-term follow-up will be necesary to compare the benefits of focal surgical resection to other less radical therapies. 1 Teeradej Srikijvilaikul, 2 Tayard Deesudchit, 3 Jarturon Tantivatana, and 4 Chaichon Locharernkul ( 1 Neurosurgery, Chulalongkorn Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Patumwan, Bangkok, Thailand ; 2 Pediatrics, Chulalongkorn Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Patumwan, Bangkok, Thailand ; 3 Radiology, Chulalongkorn Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Patumwan, Bangkok, Thailand ; and 4 Neurology, Chulalongkorn Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Patumwan, Bangkok, Thailand ) Rationale: Intracarotid amobarbital procedure (WADA test) has been widely used to determine the hemisphere for speech dominance and memory function. Recently, there has been a worldwide shortage of the amobarbital despite a need for the test in some epilepsy surgery candidates. There were reports of effective use of propofol for speech and memory testing with safety. We report our experiences in intracarotid propofol test during epilepsy preoperative evaluation. Methods: Between October 2004-March 2005, 4 patients, 1 male and 3 females, underwent intracarotid propofol test for epilepsy preoperative evaluation. The patients' ages were 13?23 years. Two patients had left hemispheric epilepsy with congenital right hemiparesis who were considered candidates for functional hemispherectomy. One patient who was ambidexterous had failed left temporal lobectomy and was planning for reoperation. The fourth patient had daily atonic seizures and bisynchronous EEG discharges from a right frontal lobe tumor. The intracarotid propofol test was performed to determine speech dominant hemisphere in the first three patients and to suppress epileptiform discharges in the fourth. The propofol preparation was 10 mg in 10 ml of normal saline solution. Results: The dose of propofol was between 15?18 mg for each injection. We were able to identify speech dominant hemisphere in all 3 patients. Two patients who underwent left functional hemispherectomy had no postoperative language deficit. Another patient showed left sided speech dominance after left sided injection. He then underwent subdural electrode recording. After cortical stimulation mapping, the speech areas were found on the same hemisphere shown by propofol test. In the patient with right frontal lobe tumor, bisynchronous spike-and-waves were completely suppressed after right sided injection, but unchanged after injection to the left. After tumor resection, she had fewer seizures then became seizure free on the fifth month. There were no complications during and after the tests in all subjects. Conclusions: Intracarotid propofol test can be used for epilepsy preoperative evaluation. The results of the test were confirmed by surgical outcome in our cases. 1 Kenou Van Rijckevorsel, 1 Cécile Grandin, 1 Marianne De Tourtchaninoff, 1 Geraldo Vaz, and 1 Christian Raftopoulos ( 1 Neurology, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium; Neuroradiology, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium; and Neurosurgery, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium ) Rationale: Mesiotemporal epilepsy refractory to antiepileptic drugs can be treated by surgery. Temporal lobectomy and selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy are the two main procedures. Both techniques give same seizure outcome. However, there are no studies that compare the seizure outcome with the amount of the resection and the etiology of the epilepsy. This is the aim of this report. Methods: Among 37 temporal epilepsy surgery cases, 26 patients benefit from a selective trans-sylvian amygdalo-hippocampectomy. Each patient has a pre- and postsurgical evaluation with neurological examination, cognitive testing, RMI and visual field exploration. The amount of resection was calculated on RMI T2 coronal slides (3 mm thickness, 0.3 mm gap) acquired perpendicularly to the hippocampus. For the hippocampus, the% of resected length was calculated and for the amygdala, the% of resected volume was visually evaluated. Seizure outcome was evaluated according to the Engel's classification. Results: 1 patient, with per-surgery hemorrhage, had temporary arm paresis and speech difficulties, left temporal hemianopsia and right quadranopsia, 8 additional patients have a partial visual field defect (superior quadranopsia) at the short term exam. Among the 26 patients, 22 patients have one year of follow-up or more. 14 were in Engel class I, 6 in class II and 2 in class III. There was no correlation between the seizure outcome and the extent of removal which varied from less than 1/3 to more than 2/3 of the hippocampus length and from less than half to complete removal for the amygdala. The two patients with class III outcome have a complete resection of the lesion, the amygdala and the hippocampus. For both patients, the etiology was tumoral: for one patient it was the third surgery and for the other patient, there was a 20-year evolution of refractory seizures. Conclusions: There is no correlation between the amount of hippocampal resection and the seizure outcome. This could be partially explained by the fact that for some patients, the epileptic focus is located into the amygdala or has an extent outside the limbic structures and/or the macroscopic lesion. 1 Mary Ann Werz, 2 Mark L. Cohen, 3 Robert Maciunas, 4 Barbara E. Swartz, 1 Pamela Lang, 1 Michael Schoenberg, 1 Gaotami Rao, and 5 Mark S. Scher ( 1 Neurology, Case Western Reserve Univ; University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH ; 2 Pathology, Case Western Reserve Univ; University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH ; 3 Neurosurgery, Case Western Reserve Univ; University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH ; 4 Neurology, Hoag Hospital Epilepsy Center, Newport Beach, CA ; and 5 Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve Univ; University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: The pathogenesis of partial epilepsy is poorly understood. We have reviewed our adult epilepsy surgical cases for potential perinatal and childhood contributors to the development of epilepsy. Methods: Retrospective review of surgical cases since 2000 included age of seizure onset, age at surgery, seizure type and frequency, lobe(s) resected, pathology, MRI/PET, neuropsychology, and surgical outcome. Patients, and when possible their mothers, were called for childhood history. Birth records were requested from outside hospitals. Queries included survey of risk factors in the mother, fetus, neonate, infant, and child. Results: Forty-six epilepsy surgery cases, excluding malignant tumors, were reviewed. The median age in years at surgery was 45 (range 16?74). The median duration of intractable epilepsy was 15 years with a range of several months to 60 years. Average full scale IQ was 95 (SD = 15.2). Resections were of the temporal lobe in 33 (29 standard, 4 neocortical), frontal lobe in 5, parietal lobe in 3, and multilobar in 5. Pathology revealed dysplastic etiologies in 20 patients: focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in 12 (Palmini classification Ia n = 4, Ib n = 3, IIa n = 5), DNET in 6 and ganglioglioma in 2. Other lesions identified were: vascular malformations (7), pilocytic astrocytoma (1), meningioangiomatosis (1), osteoma (1), and pathogen-free granuloma (1). Mesial temporal sclerosis was co-identified in 7 cases of FCD (Type I, IIa) and 9 cases in isolation. MTS was associated with febrile seizures, status epilepticus and/or meningitis in 9 of 17 cases (as infants in 6). Infantile spasms was associated with one case of Type IIa FCD. Significant maternal risk factors were not identified though a maternal history of neurofibramatosis (NF1) was identified in one case of MTS. Isolated MTS was associated with low birth weight (1800 g) in one and with high birth weight (above 4000 g) in 4 patients. Conclusions: Presumed congenital structural abnormalities of the brain were identified in 60% of our adult surgical series: 26% FCD (15% Type I and 11% Type IIa), 17%?extreme FCD? (DNET/ganglioglioma), 15% vascular malformations, and 2% meningioangiomatosis. Isolated MTS or non-specific gliosis occurred in 34%. These data suggest that developmental dysgenesis of cerebral cortex may be a major cause of adult epilepsy. The timing of microdysgenesis in development as well as genetic and environmental factors in FCD need to be identified. 1 Alan J. Wilensky, 1 Carl B. Dodrill, and 2 George A. Ojemann ( 1 Department of Neurology/Epilepsy Center, University of Washington, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA ; and 2 Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: A patient's outcome after epilepsy surgery is usually apparent by one year. Those who have been seizure-free since surgery usually remain so unless they attempt to stop all of their antiepileptic medication. About half of those who stop their medications do so successfully and remain seizure free. However, there is a very small group of patients who are seizure free, off or on medication, who have recurrent seizures many years after their surgery. This study was undertaken to see if there were any common characteristics to this small group of patients. Methods: Various data bases at the University of Washington were queried to identify patients who had been seizure free for at least five years after surgery. We then identified any patients in that group for whom there were data indicating they had had a recurrence of their seizures. Actual clinical records were then reviewed to confirm long-term seizure freedom and recurrence and data were abstracted from those records. Results: Nine patients were seizure free for at least 9 years after surgery and then relapsed. One additional patient relapsed in the 6th year year after surgery. An 11th patient developed simple partial seizures after stopping medications after year 4 and had complex partial seizures starting in year 10. Age at onset ranged from 2 months to 19 years and surgery occurred 5 to 29 years later. Seizures recurred as late as 38 years after surgery in one patient and and 22, and 23 years later in two others. Although 58% of all of our resections are left-sided, only 37% of this group had left sided operations. Two of those had right -sided language so that 82% of this group were operated on in the non-language dominant hemisphere. In a comparable group of 12 patients who remained seizure free only 42% had non-dominasntr resections. All of these patients had temporal resections as part or all of their surgery. However, atypical for our temporal resection patients as a whole, 9 of the 11 did not have hippocampal resections. Long term 9 of 11 of these patients have continued to have seizures at last follow-up. Two have had a second surgery and one of those still has frequent seizures. Conclusions: In this small group of patients with late recurrence of seizures after apparent successful surgery two findings stand out. First, this group has an excess proportion, compared to our population as a whole, of non-dominant hemisphere resections. Second, this group had only 2 patients in whom hippocampal resections were undertaken whereas the majority of our temporal operations include hippoxcampal resection. This finding is consistent with other evidence that extent of hippocampal resection correlates with outcome. These patients may have remained seizure free if their original surgeries had been more complete. 1 Chong H. Wong, 1 Julie Birkett, 1,2 Mark Dexter, 1 Ernest Somerville, 1,2 Raymond Chaseling, 1 Michael Fearnside, and 1,2 Andrew Bleasel ( 1 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, NSW, Australia ; and 2 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia ) Rationale: Intracranial EEG recording is necessary in a subset of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. This study evaluates the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality during video-EEG monitoring with subdural electrodes in patients with intractable partial epilepsy. Methods: Retrospective audit of all patients undergoing monitoring with intracranial electrodes at Westmead Hospital and The Children's Hospital at Westmead between 1988?2004. The following variables were recorded: epilepsy syndrome, anticonvulsant medication, duration of implantation surgery and intracranial monitoring, side and site of grid implantation, number of grids and electrodes, size of grids, frequency of clinical seizures, previous craniotomy, other medical conditions and length of hospital stay. Results: 296 patients with refractory epilepsy underwent epilepsy surgery during this period. 79 intracranial monitoring sessions were performed in 71 patients (49 males; median age: 24 years; IQR 17; 35, range 6?54 years) to further localize the ictal onset. 69% had extratemporal epilepsy and 44% were non-lesional. Median monitoring duration 11 days (IQR 7; 14). 82% of the monitored patients underwent epilepsy resection. 75% had seizure outcome of Engel 1 or 2 with a median follow up period of 31 months. Overall complication rate was 31.6%. 26.6% were directly related to subdural electrode implantation; 13.9% transient complications requiring no treatment, 8.9% transient complications requiring treatment, 1.3% permanent and there were 2 deaths (2.5%). Specific complications included osteomyelitis (2.5%), haemorrhage (7.6%), cerebral infarction (3.8%), transient neurological deficit (5.1%) and pulmonary emboli or deep venous thrombosis (3.8%). The 2 deaths were both related to raised intracranial pressure (1 venous infarction, 1 unexplained) and occurred within 48 hrs of implantation. Complications were associated with greater number of electrodes (p < 0.001), greater number of strip/grid arrays (0.039), 8x8 grids (0.001) and longer duration of monitoring (0.029). Only the total number of electrodes was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001) when fitted into a multiple logistic regression. No significant correlation existed between complications and seizure frequency, interhemispheric site, repositioning of electrodes or age. Conclusions: The transient complication rate in this series is comparable to previously reported series1. We found increased morbidity and mortality were associated with a greater number of electrodes. The results of this audit are being used to modify our implantation and monitoring protocols.

Zaatreh, 1 Albert Hinn, 1 Bradley Vaughn, 1 Melanie Adams, 1 Spencer Weig, 1 Michael Tennison, 1 Robert Greenwood, and 2 Eldad Hadar ( 1 Department of Neurology, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC ) Rationale: Epilepsy Surgery offers a cure for selective patients with refractory seizures. After successful epilepsy surgery some patients can be successfully tapered off anticonvulsants potentially improving their quality of life further. Although Epileptologists tend to withdraw anticonvulsants many months or even years after successful surgery, systemic studies about the best timing for anticonvulsant withdrawal are lacking. We present our experience with rapid withdrawal of anticonvulsants in a group of patients after epilepsy surgery Methods: Patients with epilepsy surgery followed in our Epilepsy Surgery Program were offered a trail of anticonvulsants withdrawal 6 weeks after epilepsy surgery with complete withdrawal at 12 weeks. Recurrence of seizures was monitored. Patients with early postoperative seizures, more than 4 anticonvulsants, history of generalized status epilepticus and patients on phenobarbital were excluded. Results: Among 27 patients with epilepsy surgery rapid withdrawal of anticonvulsants was attempted in 15 (9 Females). Age ranged between 6?57 years (mean 28.3 years). Eight patients had temporal lobectomy, 6 extartemporal resections and 1 with hemishperectomy. Pathology was consistent with mesiotemporal sclerosis in 4, focal cortical dysplasia in 4, low grade tumor in 2, atrophy and gliosis is 2 and normal in 3. Seizures recurred in 8 of the 15 patients, 4 during and 4 after complete drug withdrawal. Among the 8 patients with seizure recurrence 4 continued to have seizures after reinstating anticonvulsants while seizures stopped in the other 4 after restarting or increasing anticonvulsants. Seven patients remained seizure free with a mean follow-up of 9 months postsurgery (6?19 months). Pathological examination of the patients who remained seizure free was cortical dysplasia in 4, low grade tumor in 2 and one patient with mesiotemporal sclerosis. Drug withdrawal was not successful in any patient with normal postoperative histopathology. Conclusions: In selective patients with epilepsy surgery pathological findings may be a factor in successful early withdrawal of anticonvulsants. Further studies are needed to define patients who could benefit from early anticonvulsant withdrawal after epilepsy surgery and the effects of that on quality of life. 1 Tammy N. Tsuchida, 1 Heidi E. Kirsch, 2 Charles E. McCulloch, 1 Gilbert A.W. Woo, and 1 Paul A. Garcia ( 1 Neurology, UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ; and 2 Biostatistics, UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ) Rationale: Many epileptologists advocate early surgical treatment of refractory epilepsy in children and young adults. This study was performed to determine if there is a relationship between epilepsy duration prior to epilepsy surgery and successful surgical outcomes in patients with childhood-onset epilepsy. Methods: We performed secondary data analysis of a tertiary care epilepsy surgery database selecting for patients with onset of epilepsy < 18 years old and with their first resective epilepsy surgery. Outcomes at one or more years after surgery were classified as good if the patient was rated Engel Class (EC) 1and poor if rated EC 2?4. Predictors included race, sex, age at onset of epilepsy, age at time of surgery, duration of epilepsy prior to surgery, IQ prior to surgery, MRI findings, bilateral or unilateral MRI findings, Pathology, and Diagnosis. Diagnosis was determined by review of the mri and pathology reports by raters who were blinded to the surgical outcome. Results: 188 patients met criteria for inclusion and had sufficient information for analysis. Mean age at onset 7.46 +/? 5.73 y. Mean age at surgery 30 +/? 11 y. Diagnoses were MTS (60%), cortical malformation (8.5%), tumor (4.2%), and gliosis (7.4%). Patients with cortical malformation, tumor or vascular malformation had a median duration of 13 years. Patients with MTS or gliosis had a median duration of 25 years. If data for patients with one year post surgical followup was analyzed utilizing chi-square analysis, unilateral mri abnormalities were predictive of good outcome (p = 0.035). Duration, age at onset, and age at surgery were divided into quartiles for analysis. If only the diagnosis MTS was analyzed, the oldest quartile of age at surgery (40?61y) was associated with poorer outcomes (p = 0.034). Cox survival analysis of time to EC3 for patients with longer follow-up showed that patients with intermediate disease durations had lower hazards than the shortest durations (0.5y to 13y compared to 14y to 22y, HR = .52, p = 0.047; 0.5y to 13y compared to 23y to 32y, HR = 0.60, p = 0.094). The longest disease durations (32.85y to 51y) had hazards comparable to the shortest (HR = 1.02, p = 0.95). When restricted to MTS diagnosis, this relationship persisted (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Our study suggests that children with MTS are less likely to become seizure free than young adults with the same diagnosis. We suspect that the relationship is not causative; rather, young children may have MTS on a different pathophysiological basis. In contrast, it is possible that patients with very long epilepsy duration may have worse outcomes due to the long-term effect of seizures. Along with prior studies of clinical and radiological findings and surgical outcome, this study should be taken into consideration in counseling patients on the likelihood of surgical success.

Carter Snead III ( 1 Department of Child Neurology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Okayama, Japan ; and 2 Division of Neurology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Multiple band frequency analysis (MBFA), a new frequency analysis method, provides better frequency and temporal resolutions than fast Fourier or wavelet transform. We evaluated dynamic changes of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) on brain surface maps using MBFA to localize epileptogenic zones in neocortical epilepsy. Methods: We studied 2 children with intractable neocortical epilepsy by subdural EEG (SDEEG) at 1 KHz sampling rate. We performed MBFA for 1?5 second ictal EEG using the software Short Spectrum Eye (Gram, Saitama, Japan). We identified HFOs, determined the frequency range, and calculated averaged powers at every 10 ms for all electrodes. We imported the averaged powers into a topographic mapping program Prism and Insight (Persyst, Prescott, AZ) to visualize HFO powers on the brain surface picture. To analyze temporal interrelationships of regions with HFOs, we arranged HFO power maps at every 20 ms to project movies of ictal HFOs on the brain surface. Case 1: A 17 year old right handed girl presented with simple partial seizures consisting of numbness and tingling sensations in the right arm followed by clonic movements and secondary generalization. Case 2: A 14 year old left handed boy with asymmetric epileptic spasms in clusters. Results: Case 1; During partial seizures, MBFA of 25-channel SDEEG showed 80?130 Hz HFOs over the middle portion of the left postcentral gyrus and upper portion of the left post- and pre-central gyri. Sequential power maps of 80?130 Hz HFOs revealed high powers over these 2 regions, and reverberating power changes between them with a maximum at the middle portion of postcentral gyrus. We resected the upper and middle portions of left postcentral gyrus. She has rare and brief partial motor seizures without sensory aura and secondary generalization 9 months after surgery. Case 2; During spasms, MBFA of 106-channel SDEEG showed extensive but noncontiguous 60?150 Hz HFOs over the right superior and inferior frontal, and middle temporal gyri. Sequential power maps of 80?120 Hz HFOs revealed initial high power over the right superior frontal gyrus and subsequent activations over other 2 regions. We performed partial right frontal lobectomy, cortical excisions of the superior and inferior frontal gyri, and middle temporal gyrus where predominant HFOs existed. He is seizure free 6 months after surgery. Conclusions: The combination of MBFA and sequential brain surface HFO power mapping enabled us to recognize the localization and dynamic changes of ictal HFOs. This spatial and temporal analysis of HFO cortical mapping may disclose the behavior of ictal networks in the cortical epileptogenic zones. 1 Eishi Asano, 1 Csaba Juhasz, 1 Aashit Shah, 1 Otto Muzik, 1 Diane C. Chugani, 1 Sandeep Sood, and 1 Harry T. Chugani ( 1 Pediatrics, Neurology, Radiology, Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Cortical tubers are the hallmark of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and are usually associated with overlying and surrounding gray matter on MRI. In the present study, we have quantitatively analyzed ictal electrocorticography (ECoG) data using subdural and depth electrodes to determine whether epileptic seizures originate more frequently from glucose hypometabolic cortex surrounding a tuber than normometabolic cortex. Secondly, we asked whether epileptic seizures are generated by a cortical tuber itself or the cortex surrounding a tuber in children with TSC. Methods: We studied a series of 16 children with TSC and uncontrolled seizures (age: 5 months to 16 years; 11 boys), who underwent MRI, glucose metabolism PET and prolonged intracranial ECoG recording for subsequent cortical resection. The location of electrodes was derived from planar X-rays and displayed on the 3D brain surface reconstructed from MRIs showing the location of tubers and also hypometabolic areas from co-registered PET scans (Muzik et al, Neurology 2000). For each seizure event, the center of ictal discharges was objectively defined as the electrode showing the maximal increase of ECoG magnitude specific to an ictal onset in a seizure consisting of continuous rhythmic activity or the electrode showing the maximal spike magnitude in a seizure consisting of periodic spike activity or a single spike followed by fast wave bursts (Asano et al, Epilepsia 2005 [in press]). We performed a one-sample t-test to determine whether the center of ictal discharges was located more frequently in glucose hypometabolic regions than normometabolic regions, and whether the center of ictal discharges was located more frequently in the cortex surrounding a tuber than the cortical tuber itself. Results: A total of 70 seizures were objectively analyzed in the subjects where subdural electrodes but not depth electrodes were placed on the presumed epileptic hemisphere. In 57 out of the 70 seizures, the center of ictal discharges was located in the glucose hypometabolic cortices. Ictal discharges arose more frequently from the glucose hypometabolic cortex than from normometabolic cortex (p < 0.001). In a single subject where a depth electrode was inserted into a tuber, no spontaneous seizures were captured and we were not able to determine the location of ictal onset zones. Conclusions: These results suggest that most of the epileptic seizures in children with TSC may be generated by glucose hypometabolic regions associated with either the dysplastic cortex surrounding a tuber or the tuber itself. Further studies of patients with depth electrodes are required to determine whether epileptic seizures are generated by a cortical tuber itself or the cortex surrounding a tuber in children with TSC.

In many patients, particularly those with multifocal or neocortical epilepsy, seizures are difficult to localize due to rapid spread of ictal activity and high frequency rhythms that may elude detection, potentially affecting the surgical outcome. Time-frequency analysis is a conceptually simple technique that, when applied to intracranial EEG recordings, may reveal information that is not apparent to visual inspection alone. To facilitate its use, an easily interpreted visual presentation was created that provides an overview of the activity of the complete EEG montage. This case series examines the role of spectral time-frequency analysis in five patients with medically refractory epilepsy who underwent invasive subdural electrode video-EEG studies. Methods: Interictal and ictal recordings were studied from five patients who underwent intracranial subdural electrode studies for seizure localization as part of a presurgical evaluation. Time-frequency spectral analysis was performed on all channels over sequential one-second time windows. The spectrogram over the 1?200 Hz frequency range was displayed using a colormap with intensity corresponding to the logarithm of the FFT of the input signal over a one-second time window; the colormap is fixed for a given sequence to allow comparisons over time and between channels. EEG was recorded on a Nicolet Bravo system with a sampling rate of 400 Hz/channel and bandpass filtered (4th order Butterworth) at 0.5?125 Hz. All computations were implemented in Matlab. Results: Spectral analysis of seizure onsets are shown for the five patients and compared to the clinical interpretation. In four cases, the additional information provided confirmatory support for the clinical localization, while in the fourth case the analysis supported an alternative candidate seizure focus, an observation consistent with the surgical outcome. Conclusions: This case series illustrates the complementary role of spectral time-frequency analysis in the setting of intracranial EEG recordings, as well as the importance of a unified presentation that permits direct comparisons between channels. The role of this technique in providing information not apparent on visual EEG interpretation and its contribution to the evaluation of complex neocortical epilepsies, as well as its potential effect on surgical outcome, warrants further assessment.

Sackellares ( 1 Industrial and Systems Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ ; 2 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, St. Peter's University Hospital, New Brunswick, NJ ; 3 Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 4 Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ; and 5 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: At least 2 million people in the U.S. (1% of population) currently suffer from epilepsy. The most disabling aspect of epilepsy is recurrent seizures, in which the majority of epileptic patients (at least 1 million) feel that they get inadequate treatments or seizures cannot be controlled by available treatments. It is very clear that improved treatments are desperately needed. In this study, we herein propose novel quantitative approaches that can detect abnormalities in the brain's electrical activity. The results of this study will pave our way to the development of an Automated Brain Activity Classifier, which is a prerequisite of seizure prediction process. Methods: Continuous 26-channel long-term intracranial EEG recordings previously obtained in 3 patients with medically intractable partial seizures were used to test the automated brain activity classifier. Patient 1 had 15 seizures in a 10-day recording; patient 2 had 8 seizures in 6 days; patient 3 had 7 seizures in 12 days. The automated brain activity classifier involved the following steps: (1) quantify the chaoticity properties (i.e., Lyapunov exponents, angular frequency, entropy) of the brain dynamics, (2a) use the statistical cross validation technique to estimate statistical distances between an EEG epoch and the brain activity from different physiological states (normal, pre-seizure, post-seizure), (2b) use optimization techniques to find support vector machines to separate different brain physiological states, (3) classify the EEG epoch to the physiological state of the most brain activity (smallest statistical distance). Results: The sensitivities of the statistical cross validation approach in classifying pre-seizure EEG's in patients 1, 2, and 3 were 89.39%, 85.71%, and 84.44%, respectively and the sensitivities in classifying normal EEG's in patients 1, 2, and 3 were 93.50%, 78.00%, and 75.00%, respectively. The sensitivities of the support vector machines approach in classifying pre-seizure EEG's in patients 1, 2, and 3 were 81.21%, 71.18%, and 74.13%, respectively and the sensitivities in classifying normal EEG's in patients 1, 2, and 3 were 87.46%, 76.85%, and 70.60%, respectively. Conclusions: Based on the proposed statistical classification approaches, this automated brain activity classifier can classify EEG epochs into the accurate brain physiological state with performance characteristics that could have practical clinical utility. The classifier could be incorporated into clinical EEG monitoring system or, incorporated into a seizure warning system used to activate timed physiological or pharmacological interventions. 1 Lei Ding, 2 Gregory A. Worrell, 2 Terrence D. Lagerlund, and 1 Bin He ( 1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic ) Rationale: Substantial interest exists in the development of noninvasive localization of epileptogenic foci, since the current standard utilization of subdural electrocorticography and depth electrodes requires surgical implantation with some additional risks to the patient. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a novel noninvasive source localization approach for localizing epileptogenic foci from scalp EEG. Methods: The traditional dipole source localization approach faces problems for multiple dipole source localization as the number of sources increases. We recently developed a new subspace source localization approach, i.e. three-dimensional first principle vectors (3D-FINE), for EEG-based epileptic focus localization (Xu et al, Phys Med  2 Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ; and 3 Neurology and Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Ten to twenty percent of children with facial port-wine stain (PWS) develop neurologic features characteristic of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), which may include seizures, visual field defects, hemiparesis, and cognitive impairment. Screening often involves serial neuroimaging, which carries a sedation risk and is often falsely negative in infants. We have reported that decreased power on the affected side correlated with neurologic impairments in subjects with SWS, and efforts are ongoing to develop quantitative EEG (qEEG) as a tool for early diagnosis in SWS. Methods: Three infants with unilateral facial port-wine stains had standard 16-channel EEG recordings at approximately 4 month intervals. Thirty artifact-free, two-second epochs were selected from each record. Bipolar data from each epoch was submitted to a fast Fourier transform with a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz. Power spectra from each side of the head were compared using a laterality score (LS = (Left - Right)/(Left + Right). The LS were calculated for delta (2.0?3.5 Hz), theta (4.0?7.5 Hz), alpha (8.0?12.5 Hz), beta (13.0?32.0 Hz), and total power (2?32 Hz). All EEGs were independently read by an experienced electroencephalographer. Results: Subject #1 had a left-sided PWS and initially left-sided brain involvement with his first focal seizure at 8 months of age. EEGs at 11 and 15 months were read as symmetric, but quantitative EEG showed significantly lower power in the left hemisphere. MRI at this time showed left-sided leptomeningeal angiomatosis. MRI at 18 months showed bilateral occipital lesions. Further EEGs at 19 and 23 months yielded no statistically significant asymmetries in total power, possibly reflecting either his bilateral involvement or normal development and fully controlled seizures. Subject #2 had EEGs at 2, 6, and 10 months of age that were read as normal; however, qEEG showed significantly lower ipsilateral power at 2 and 10 months. MRI at 6 months showed unilateral leptomeningeal enhancement. This child has never seized and is developmentally normal. Subject #3 had a single EEG at 4 months that was read as normal; qEEG showed no significant asymmetry. MRI at six months showed no stigmata of SWS. This infant has had neither seizures nor any neurodevelopmental delay. Subjects #2 and #3 will continue to have EEGs every 3 months for a total of two years. Conclusions: In infants with a unilateral port-wine stain, serial qEEG shows decreases in power over the hemisphere that is affected or at-risk for neurological impairment. Further studies are needed to determine if qEEG is a reliable and sensitive method for identifying children with unilateral PWS who need neuroimaging and determining the optimal timing of imaging. 1 Michael D. Furman, 1 Jennifer D. Simonotto, 2 Paul R. Carney, and 1 William L. Ditto ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 2 Department of Pediatric Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Currently, neural activity and focus localization in epileptic patients is essential for pre-surgical evaluation. Several methods have been devised to locate activity by applying combinations of EEG, MEG, PET, SPECT, and fMRI. Phase-Dynamic Quantification combines Recurrence Quantification Analysis, phase correlation, and three-dimensional temporal and spatial alignment to track seizure activity along with pre- and postictal responses. Utilizing high-frequency (12?25kHz) multi-channel brain activity, we introduce a method for correlating dynamic temporal phase which permits tracking of the seizure focus. Methods: Multichannel neuronal potentials were collected synchronously over the course of 2 mos from a chronically seizing animal model of limbic epilepsy (n = 1). Arrays of tungsten microwire electrodes were stereotaxically implanted in the dentate and CA1-2 of the hippocampus. Neuronal activity was recorded at 24414.1Hz. Electrode placement and CA1-2/Dentate targeting were verified post-mortem using a high-field (17.6 Tesla) MRI brain imaging instrument. Hippocampus depth and grid recording were also obtained in humans undergoing presurgical epilepsy evaluations (n = 2). Cortical activity was recorded continuously at 400Hz. All data sets were analyzed for phase correlation. Results: In all time series analyzed, the results demonstrated a well-defined seizure path within the epileptogenic focus. In each human data set, phase correlation coincided with the seizure focus that was determined by visual analysis of temporal lobe depth and grid recordings. Figure shows dynamic moving focus phase correlation using three 400 Hz signals. Conclusions: Phase-Dynamic Quantification reveals epilepsy as a highly organized contiguous neural pathway that can be localized and tracked. This method may of clinical utility assist with seizure localization.

Ghacibeh, 2 Deng-Shan Shiau, 2 Linda Dance, 1 Stephan Eisenschenk, and 1,2,3 J. Chris Sackellares ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 3 Department of Biomedical Engeneering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Short-Term Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (STLmax) is a measure of the order of a dynamical system. Smaller STLmax values indicate that the signal is more ordered. In temporal lobe epilepsy, the dynamical properties of the preictal, ictal and postictal states are distinctly different and can be defined quantitatively. STLmax has been observed to be the lowest during a seizure, intermediate in the preictal period and highest in the postictal state. Antiepileptic medications are known to reduce seizure frequency in most epilepsy patients. We postulate that high levels of antiepileptic medications are associated with higher STLmax. The objectives of this study are to compare STLmax values from intracranial EEG recordings when patients have high, medium and low levels of antiepileptic medications. Methods: Two patients with intracranial subdural grids were recruited: patient 1 had right fronto-temporal and patient 2 had left fronto-central grids. Patients were tapered off their antiepileptic medications to record seizures. Patient 1 was on phenytoin, levetiracetam, carbamazepine and zonisamide and Patient 2 was levetiracetam and topiramate. Medication dosages were collected daily for all antiepileptic drugs during the entire monitoring period and medication levels were obtained for the older drugs. For each patient, three distinct time segments were determined based on their medication dosages and levels. Day 1: high medication levels, Day 2: medium levels and Day 3: low levels. All three segments were chosen to be at least 6 hours prior or after a seizure. For each patient, a total of 8 channels were selected for analysis. Four channels were within the epileptic focus and four outside the epileptic focus. For each analyzed electrode, STLmax was calculated for each non-overlapping 10.24 second segment (4096 EEG points in 400 Hz recording). A total of 100 mean STLmax values were randomly sampled from time intervals in each of the three medication levels. One-way ANOVA test was applied to test the significance of the effect among medication levels. If the effect was found significant, multiple comparison tests were utilized to test the significance of pairwise differences. Results: In both patients, within both epileptic and non-epileptic areas, EEG signals recorded during high medication level (day 1) exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.01) STLmax values (less ordered) than during medium (day 2) and low (day 3) medication levels. Conclusions: Antiepileptic medications have an influence on STLmax. High levels are associated with increased STLmax value. This effect may be related to the anticonvulsant properties of these medications. 1 Julie D. Golomb, 2 Michel Shamy, 2 April R. Levin, 2 Kathryn Davis, 2 Kelly A. McNally, 3 Kenneth Vives, 3 Dennis D. Spencer, 2,3 Susan S. Spencer, 2 Hitten Zaveri, and 1,2,3,4 Hal Blumenfeld ( 1 Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT ; 2 Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; 3 Department of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; and 4 Department of Neurobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Prior studies suggest that temporal lobe seizures cause impaired function in widespread neocortical areas in addition to mesial temporal lobe regions. A recent study by Blumenfeld et al. (NEUROLOGY, 2004) found increased low voltage fast and polyspike ictal activity in ipsilateral mesial and lateral temporal regions, with simultaneous large amplitude ictal slowing in frontoparietal regions. However, these observations were based on subjective ratings of the intracranial EEG recordings and were not correlated with behavior. In the present study we employ quantitative analyses to more accurately describe ictal and post-ictal changes associated with various brain regions during complex and simple partial seizures. Methods: 12 Patients with surgically confirmed mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent intracranial EEG monitoring and had no seizures during a follow-up period of at least 1 year after temporal lobe resection were selected for analysis. Seizures that secondarily generalized were excluded. Electrode contacts were assigned to one of nine cortical regions based on MRI surface reconstructions. Power measurements for classically defined spectral bands were calculated with the Fourier transform for the ictal and peri-ictal time periods for each EEG signal. Results: A small, brief increase in beta (13?25 Hz) and gamma (25?50 Hz) frequency power was seen in ipsilateral mesial temporal regions immediately following seizure onset. This was followed by a much larger increase in alpha (8?13 Hz), beta, gamma, and particularly theta (4?8 Hz) power in ipsilateral mesial and lateral temporal regions. Simultaneously, a large increase in delta (0?4 Hz) power was seen in lateral, medial, and orbital frontal regions, which sometimes persisted throughout the post-ictal period. Subclinical seizures involved transient changes confined to the ipsilateral mesial temporal contacts. Although considerable between-patient variability was found, individual patients showed remarkable consistency in EEG patterns across their seizures. Conclusions: Quantitative power analysis showed increased high frequency activity in temporal regions and low frequency activity in frontal regions during partial seizures of temporal lobe origin. These results support and expand upon previous studies of EEG activity positing that neocortical slowing represents a form of ?surround inhibition? during such seizures. Further analyses may reveal specific differences between EEG signals in complex and simple partial seizures, and contribute to an understanding of behavioral manifestations of temporal lobe seizures. 1 Elena Urrestarazu, 1 Pierre LeVan, and 1 Jean Gotman ( 1 EEG, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: The aim of this study was to investigate whether Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can be applied in intracranial recordings to analyze interactions between the temporal lobes during temporal lobe seizures. ICA has already been used in scalp EEGs to isolate spikes from background and to help lateralize temporal lobe seizures Methods: Intracranial recordings of temporal lobe seizures from 8 patients with bitemporal implantation were analyzed. Scalp EEG recordings showed that the patients had seizures originating from both temporal lobes. The seizures of each patient were classified in four categories: unilateral right or left (UR or UL), and bilateral with right or left onset (BR or BL). ICA decomposes the EEG into as many statistically independent components as there are channels. ICA was applied to the seizures, and only components with ictal activity in the first 10 seconds of the seizure were studied. Correlation coefficients were calculated between these components and every channel of the original EEG, in the time interval preceding the appearance of bilateral activity. Components were classified as unilateral if their correlation was greater than 0.2 exclusively with channels in one hemisphere; if the correlation was greater than 0.2 with channels in both hemispheres, the component was labeled as bilateral. Nonparametric statistics were applied. Results: 46 seizures were analyzed (11 UR, 13 UL, 12 BR and 10 BL). There were five patients with seizures beginning independently in both temporal lobes, two patients with right temporal seizures only, and one patient with left temporal seizures only. Even though the correlation was calculated when seizure activity was unilateral, the proportion of components that were bilateral was significantly lower (p = 0.001) in seizures that stayed unilateral (22% for UR and 26% for UL) than in seizures that became bilateral (46% for BR and 48% for BL). There were no significant differences between right and left seizures. Bilateral seizures were significantly longer than unilateral seizures (p = 0.000), but the duration of the seizure was not significantly correlated (p > 0.05) with the proportion of bilateral components. Conclusions: In patients with bitemporal epilepsy, more than 20% of the components extracted using ICA have a bitemporal distribution even at the time when the seizures are apparently unilateral. The proportion of bilateral components during the unilateral phase is significantly higher in seizures with subsequent contralateral spread. It therefore appears that minimal contralteral seizure activity is present even when the discharge appears unilateral, and that the more such contralateral activity is present, the more the seizure is likely to spread.

Lina, 1 F. Dubeau, and 1 J. Gotman ( 1 Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill U., Montreal, QC, Canada ; and 2 Centre de Recherche en Mathématiques, Montreal, Canada ) Rationale: The first objective is to compare two imaging modalities to better identify brain areas where spikes are generated: ? EEG source localization, which allows estimating a current density along the cortical surface at each time sample of the spike ? Simultaneous EEG/fMRI, which allows measuring the hemodynamic correlates of EEG activity Those modalities highlight several aspects of spike generation, because signals have different physiological origins and complementary spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, EEG source localization has no unique solution and adding prior information is necessary. The second objective is to evaluate whether it is relevant to include fMRI information in EEG source localization. Methods: 9 patients with focal epilepsy underwent EEG/fMRI examination and EEG recording outside the scanner. The EEG/fMRI protocol consists of recording 19 EEG channels inside the MR scanner. After manual detection of interictal spikes, data were analysed using a linear model combining several hemodynamic responses after each spike. T maps showing brain areas with significant fMRI responses were interpolated on the cortical surface, to compare with EEG source localization. Source localization was applied to averaged spikes recorded outside the scanner (43 channels). We applied the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) approach 1 to estimate the current density on the cortical surface at each time sample of the spike. fMRI results were compared with MEM results obtained at the peaks of the spike. The level of concordance was assessed by measuring the minimal geodesic distance D between local extrema of the fMRI and MEM maps. We also measured an index A to assess whether fMRI could be included as a prior for EEG source localization, using a hierarchical Bayesian model 2. Large positive values of A mean that fMRI data were highly relevant information regarding EEG data. Results: 3 patients did not show any fMRI response. Among the 6 other patients, MEM and fMRI results showed good concordance in 4 (D < 2.5 cm). However, qualitative analysis revealed that most exhibited concordant areas and areas unique to each modality. Our index A was in good agreement with the qualitative comparison of MEM and fMRI results. Conclusions: Our study highlights that EEG source localization and EEG/fMRI clearly explored different phenomena linked to spike generation. Brain areas involved could be concordant or complementary regarding both modalities. The index of relevance A seems promising to decide whether fMRI or a part of the fMRI map should be used as prior for source localization. By analysing more data, those approaches may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved during spike generation and propagation.

Hecox, 1 Fengmei Lui, 1 Seaon Marler, 1 Jennifer Dwyer, 1 Michael Kohrman, 1 Arnetta McGhee, and 1 Joel Fontanarosa ( 1 Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Dynamic Systems analysis has been applied to the study of interictal and ictal EEG data for more than a decade. Abnormalities in these measures have been reported in the detection, prediction and localization of seizures. The purpose of this study is to extend these observations to the pediatric population, to compare ictal data to three forms of baseline data and to describe some of the features of the spatial distribution of the systems changes, for multiple metrics. Methods: Intracranial and extracranial recordings were obtained from a series of pediatric aged patients undergoing evaluation for surgical treatment. Ages varied from 5 to 19 years of age. Three examples of seizures, interictal sleep, interictal awake and preictal (within one minute of seizure onset) were selected and analyzed for each patient. Metrics were calculated for correlation dimension (least squares), correlation dimension (maximum likelihood), Kolmogorov entropy, eigenvalues and Z (a global measure of nonlinearity) in each case. These metrics were calculated for at least eight surface electrodes (four over each hemisphere) and for at least 16 intracranial electrodes. The intracranial electrodes were further subdivided into ?involved? versus ?uninvolved? in the ictal event according to visual analysis. These data were subjected to analysis of variance and chi square analyses. Results: Eighty percent of the ictal events were detectable. Differences were seen between sleep and wakefulness baselines for 70% of the the group. Preictal changes were seen for 40% of the group, compared to baseline. Seemingly uninvolved electrodes show changes in these metrics both ictally and interictally. The magnitude of the change and the metris showing the changes varied across patients but eigenvalue was most commonly changed amongst the measures. Eigenvalue and correlation dimension (least squares) were the least specific spatially, while Kolmogorov entropy and Z were the most spatially specific. Conclusions: We continue to observe ictal changes in dynamic systems measures in pediatric aged patients with seizures. The measures are also abnormal in a number of patients interictally. No single metric is complete enough to stand alone, from a detection or anticipation perspective. Anticipation was possible in nearly half of the cases. The most surprising findings of this study were that electrodes felt to be ?control? or uninvolved in the seizures can show significant changes in these metrics and that the metrics vary considerably in their spatial specificity. Localizing a focus using these metrics must be performed with considerable caution. Further, the differences in spatial distribution across metrics suggest that these metrics do not all reflect the operation of a single process.

Bergey ( 1 Department of Neurology - Epilepsy Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Partial seizures originate from focal regions of epileptogenesis. The dynamic of seizure onset and pattern of ictal discharges may reflect the cerebral region of seizure onset. To date, however, these observations have been largely derived from visual analysis or simple frequency characterization. We here report detailed comparative analysis of seizure dynamics at seizure onset. Methods: We analyzed data from multiple partial seizures from patients with mesial temporal onset epilepsy (MTLE; n = 3) or with neocortical lesional epilepsy (NLE; n = 6) monitored in the epilepsy monitoring unit for presurgical evaluation with intracranial subdural grid arrays. The time-frequency decomposition was obtained with the matching pursuit (MP) method. The Gabor atom density (GAD) (Jouny et al. 2003), derived from MP, provides a measure of signal complexity. Different features of the intracranial EEG (ICEEG) or of GAD can be used to synchronize seizures. Onset of complexity increase was used to synchronize the events. Time-frequency maps reconstructed from the MP decomposition were then re-aligned and averaged. Results: GAD plots reveal that all mesial temporal onset seizures and neocortical onset seizures have an increase in complexity at seizure onset and have a reproducible pattern of onset. These consistent features can be used to synchronize the events. Because of the slight variability in timing between different phases of the seizure, one can enhance the visibility of any of these phases by choosing their feature as the synchronizing event for the re-alignment. Onset features which are not time-locked will not be enhanced by averaging. In this study, averaged seizure onsets exhibit distinguishable predominant frequency components in 5 out of 9 patients (either ?7Hz, ?15Hz, ?20Hz or ?40Hz) or activities with a broader spectral signature in 3 out of 9 patients. Conclusions: The assumption that multiple seizure onsets in a given patient have stereotypical features is based predominantly on clinical experience and visual analysis. We studied here the detailed time-frequency components of partial seizures and, by averaging their reconstructed maps, isolated the components that are common to all seizures. One of the advantage of the method was to reveal an onset pattern including high-frequency components (>40Hz) with a decreasing main frequency which was not evident on ICEEG. High-frequency components during onset might go unnoticed - especially when embedded in electrodecrement pattern of onset. High-frequency recordings and detailed time-frequency analysis can reveal the dynamic evolution of onsets and provide important information regarding timing of onset pattern and localization.

Crone ( 1 Department of Neurology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ; 2 Laboratory of Medical Physics, Warsaw University, Warsaw, Poland ; and 3 Department of Biostatistics, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: The cortical regions responsible for word production have been mapped with a variety of techniques, but the dynamic interactions between these cortical regions in real time have yet to be explored in depth. To investigate these interactions we recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals while subjects spoke words in response to either visual or auditory stimuli, and we studied event-related gamma activity flows among different cortical regions. Methods: The short-time direct directed transfer function (SdDTF) is a new method for estimating causal interactions between different brain regions. SdDTF evaluates the direction and intensity of EEG activity flows during consecutive short-time epochs, for selected frequency bands. This multichannel approach enables comparisons of the strengths of relations between sites. ECoG signals recorded during two tasks, word repetition (auditory stimulus) and picture naming (visual stimulus), were analyzed. Event-related changes in cortical network interactions were studied with emphasis on 60?140 Hz (high gamma). Results: Auditory word stimuli were associated with activity flows mainly between sites within superior temporal gyrus (STG) and from STG to inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and to ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC); interactions between STG and basal temporal language area (BTLA) were also observed. In the interval between offset of the auditory word stimulus and onset of the verbal response, flows were observed predominantly from STG to IFG and BTLA. Flows between IFG, STG, and vSMC were also present. During picture naming the interval between onset of the stimulus and the verbal response was associated with many bidirectional interactions between IFG and STG, and between IFG, BTLA and vSMC. Spoken responses to both visual and auditory stimuli were associated with relatively fewer interactions, albeit involving all aforementioned sites. Conclusions: Cortical network interactions during word production predictably depend on stimulus modality. These interactions are reflected by changes in high-gamma activity flows between and within cortical regions commonly involved in language processing.

Kuzniecky ( 1 Software Division, ESCO, Garden Grove, CA ; and 2 Neurology, Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY ) Rationale: The objective was to develop a program (?SeizureGuard?) that is ideal for recognizing/predicting EEG seizures, real-time, within the limited power resources of future, fully implanted therapeutic devices, like the hybrid neuroprosthesis. Methods: Instead of handling the EEG signals as a succession of waves, the SeizureGuard program decomposed these signals into vectors, describing each vector with its angle and magnitude. From the derived vector-stream, the program computed various neurobiologically relevant parameters, including inter-vector interval and vector-periodicity. These parameters were indexed according to their relevance to the characteristics of electrographic seizure-onsets. No complex numbers were used in the calculations. To validate the algorithm, a data miner utility program was utilized to extract continuous EEG signals from files generated with a Nicolet BMSI 6000 recording system. All recordings were obtained from temporal lobe epilepsy patients presurgically implanted with subdural strip- and grid-electrodes. Results: The program accurately recognized subclinical EEG seizures within 1?2 sec from their onset. Artifacts and non-epileptic rhythmic discharges and large-amplitude waves were not falsely indicated. Interestingly, the occasional false-positive seizure detections by the program in the interictal phase actually indicated bursts of sharp waves/spikes that occurred in the recording channel(s) of seizure activity. Conclusions: The SeizureGuard program, utilizing a computationally inexpensive algorithm that decomposes the EEG waves into vectors, is suitable for recognizing the onsets of focal subclinical seizures and has the potential to indicate epileptiform events prior to these seizures. As such, it seems to be ideal for use in implanted seizure-controlling devices. (Supported by NYU/FACES.) 1 Yuan Lai, 2 Wim Van Drongelen, 2 David M. Frim, 2 Kurt E. Hecox, and 1 Bin He ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota ; and 2 Pediatrics, University of Chicago ) Rationale: In past decades, epilepsy surgery has been recognized increasingly as a viable treatment for patients with medically refractory seizures. However, the large gap between number of potential surgical candidates and number of patients being treated with surgery still exists due to the lengthy, complex, and expensive procedure of current practice of using invasive procedures to identify epileptic foci responsible for the seizures. If epileptic foci can be identified noninvasively, numerous epilepsy patients undergoing surgical treatment will benefit significantly from the noninvasive surgical planning. The aim of present study is to evaluate a novel noninvasive electrophysiological cortical imaging technique (He et al., IEEE-TBME, 46:1264?1268, 1999) to image and localize ictal activities from scalp EEG. Methods: All patients are pediatric patients with intractable partial epilepsy in the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at the University of Chicago. For each patient, multiple habitual seizures were visually identified according to the IFSECN criteria. Seizure activities with sudden propagation to whole brain were excluded from further analysis. For ictal EEG recordings with sustained rhythmic focal morphology, time-frequency analysis has been applied as preprocessing. Spatial-temporal evolution of ictal discharges were examined using wavelet analysis to obtain a time-varying energy distribution in each frequency band. The dominant frequency is determined with highest energy concentration, at which the phase encoding is used for multi-channel EEG around seizure onset to generate a scalp potential map representing the major ictal activity. The cortical imaging algorithm (He et al., 1999) was then applied to reconstruct the cortical potential distribution from the phase encoded scalp potential map. Since pediatric patients usually have seizure originating from neocortex, the estimated cortical potential generated by different underlying sources are less likely to overlap so that it can be used to observe the source activity with much less deviation as compared to that from a deeper source. Results: Five pediatric epilepsy patients by various causes were studied, who are either seizure free or having substantial seizure reduction after neurosurgical resections. For all patients, the cortical imaging analysis has been able to successfully reveal underlying epileptogenic cortical zones at different lobes (temporal or extra-temporal, one or two epileptogenic foci for each patient), which are consistent with clinical findings and confirmed by neurosurgical resections and outcomes. Conclusions: Cortical imaging can reliably localize cortical activity in regions displaying epileptiform activity; these regions were confirmed by successful surgical resection. Cortical imaging may become a useful alternative for noninvasive pre-surgical and surgical planning in pediatric epilepsy patients. (Supported by NIH EB 00178 and NSF BES-0411898.) 1 Pierre LeVan, 1 Elena Urrestarazu, and 1 Jean Gotman ( 1 EEG, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: The objective of this study was to devise an automated system to remove artefacts from ictal scalp EEG, using independent component analysis (ICA). Current ICA methods rely on a tedious visual identification of artefactual sources among extracted components, hence the desire for a fully automated method. Methods: 69 ictal scalp recordings from 16 epileptic patients were analyzed. The seizures were contaminated by various artefacts such as eye movements, EMG, and patient movement. For each seizure, ICA was applied to a 30s interval beginning approximately 10s before the suspected seizure onset. The extracted independent components were divided into 2s epochs and each epoch was labelled as either EEG or non-EEG. Data from half of the patients was used as a training set to induce a Bayesian network classifier, while the remaining data was reserved for use as a validation set. The classifier used the following features: component negentropy, epoch variance, spectral entropy between 5 and 30Hz, and relative power in several frequency bands. The spatial distribution of each component was then fitted with a dipole, the position of which was also used as a feature whenever the residual variance of the fit was less than 20%. For each 2s epoch, the output of the classifier was the probability that the epoch represented EEG activity. A component was considered to be artefactual if the sum of the probabilities for its 15 epochs was less than 4. To evaluate the performance of the system, an expert neurologist reviewed the original seizure recordings in the validation set and compared them with the records reconstructed after rejection of the artefactual components. A qualitative score was given with respect to the reduction of artefactual activity and the preservation of EEG activity. Results: The validation set contained 33 seizures from 8 patients. The system correctly classified 5047/5920 (85%) EEG epochs and 5628/6950 (81%) non-EEG epochs. The reviewer noted that 23 seizures were contaminated by a significant amount of artefacts. After the automated rejection of artefactual components, the reviewer determined that the majority of artefacts were removed in 17 seizures, while 5 of them had minor improvements, and only 1 record had no reduction of artefactual activity. The system preserved all the EEG activity in 17 seizures, attenuated some minor EEG activity in 4 cases, and removed some significant ictal activity in the remaining 2 cases. The automated method was also applied to the 10 seizures that did not contain significant artefacts; in 9 cases, all the EEG activity was preserved, while the remaining case had only minor EEG attenuation. Conclusions: Temporal and spatial features of ICA components were used in a Bayesian framework to classify component epochs as either EEG or non-EEG. This allowed the proposed system to automatically eliminate a large proportion of artefactual components in ictal scalp recordings, while minimally affecting the EEG activity.

Miller, 1 Wonsuk Kim, 1 Mark Holmes, and 2 Sampsa Vanhatalo ( 1 Neurology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; and 2 Clinical Neurophysiology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland ) Rationale: We recently described techniques to perform longterm DC-coupled EEG recordings at the bedside, and have used these methods to demonstrate that inspection of infraslow (<0.5 Hz) activity can correctly lateralize temporal lobe seizures (Vanhatalo et al, Neurology.60:1098, 2003). However, even high amplitude infraslow activity can sometimes be difficult to localize by simple visual inspection if there is considerable overlying faster EEG activity or obscuring slow artifact. Also, this earlier study did not investigate extratemporal seizures, which are often more difficult to localize. We address these issues with improvements in the DC-coupled EEG recording and analysis technique, and by extending our observation to seizures arising from a variety of cerebral regions. Methods: Recordings were performed on patients receiving presurgical monitoring for medically intractable localization related epilepsy with 20 seizures in 11 patients included in analysis. Recordings used a commercial system for DC-coupled recording, with sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes in a standard array defined by the 10:10 system, with additional anterior temporal electrodes, as well as subtemporal chains. Afterwards, ictal events were exported to an EEG analysis software package (BESA 5.0) to review the seizures with source montages. Recognition and localization of the infraslow signal was made easier (i) by compressing the time scale (30 to 90 seconds per screen), ii) by filtering the signal in time domain (i.e. regular high pass/low pass or band pass filtering), iii) by filtering the signal in space (e.g. with a source montage), and iv) by using a moving average to smooth the recording. The spatial filtering properties of the source montage also makes it easier to differentiate the ictal change from physiological artifacts, such as eye movements, that arise from other head regions. In addition, the time frequency characteristics of some seizures were analysed by FFT and by use of Morlet wavelets. Results: Infraslow signals were present with all focal seizures, sometimes with amplitude orders of magnitude higher than the ictal signals in the convention EEG frequency band (0.5 to 70 Hz). Analysis of these infraslow signals was a reliable localization tool. Five patients in this study received epilepsy surgery and had follow-up documenting significant seizure reduction, and analysis of infraslow signals correctly localized epileptic foci in all five, while conventional noninvasive EEG recording with visual analysis of seizures correctly localized only two. Conclusions: DC-coupled EEG recordings can give additional information that is clinically useful to noninvasively localize the epileptogenic focus. The value of this method is increased by source analysis tools that can reveal highly localized changes more clearly than direct visual inspection.

Morgan, 2 Eliane Kobayashi, 2 Andrew Bagshaw, 2 Colin Hawco, 3 Bassel Abou-Khalil, 2 Francois Dubeau, and 2 Jean Gotman ( 1 Radiology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ; 2 Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada ; and 3 Neurology, Vanderbilt Unversity, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Simultaneous fMRI and EEG may localize the generators of interictal spikes recorded on scalp EEG. Temporal clustering analysis (TCA) is a method to analyze fMRI images independently of EEG information. TCA seeks to identify resting state activations related to the epileptogenic zone. The objective of this study was to compare the results of these two analyses in a series of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods: BOLD fMRI images were acquired in 22 TLE patients on a 1.5T MRI scanner with simultaneous continuous EEG in two-hour sessions at the MNI (64 ?64 ?25, 5mm ? 5mm ? 5mm, TR = 3sec, 120 volumes per series, 8?10 series per patient). For EEG-BOLD analysis, EEGs were processed offline and spikes were identified in the filtered EEG for event-related analysis. For the TCA-BOLD analysis, only the first three series were used. Data were analyzed by previously published TCA methods in which a histogram is created indicating the number of voxels that reach at least 80% of their maximum at each time point. Activated regions were determined by using a fixed-effects analysis of the three series. The concordance of the temporal lobe activation identified by the two methods and the temporal lobe spikes were assessed. Patients were divided into those with unilateral and those with bilateral independent temporal lobe spikes on EEG. One patient's fMRI was not analyzed due to excess motion. Results: Fourteen patients had unilateral spikes on EEG: 12/14 had TCA-BOLD temporal activation (6 were ipsilateral to the EEG spikes, and 2 had bilateral activation with predominance ipsilateral to the spikes) and 9/14 showed EEG-BOLD activation (2 were ipsilateral to the EEG spikes, 5 had bilateral activation with predominance ipsilateral to the spikes, one had bilateral activation with no side predominance). Seven patients had bilateral independent temporal spikes on EEG: all patients showed TCA-BOLD activation in the temporal lobes, but it was bilateral (concordant with the EEG) in 3; 4/7 patients showed EEG-BOLD temporal lobe activation, bilateral in 3. Overall, we observed an agreement between both methods in 7/11 patients. Conclusions: Activations in the temporal lobes were detected in 90% of patients using TCA-BOLD and in 68% using EEG-BOLD. TCA, which has the advantage of not using the information from the EEG, was concordant with EEG-BOLD analysis in 64% of those who showed activations, and disclosed responses not present in the former one in 5. TCA-BOLD could lateralize the underlying structural MRI lesion in 52% of the patients, similar to that observed with EEG-BOLD analysis (48%). More development is required for both methods. (Supported by Epilepsy Foundation and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Preston Robb MNI fellowship, and Savoy Foundation for Epilepsy.) 1 Amit Mukherjee, 2 Pradeep Modur, and 1 Nicolaos Karayiannis ( 1 Electrical  and 2 Neurology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY ) Rationale: We describe a novel method for detection of seizure onset using a quantum neural network (QNN) that was progressively trained by quantitative features (in both the time and frequency domains) extracted from intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals. QNNs are particularly helpful in the classification of uncertain data without any restricting assumptions. [Purushothaman and Karayiannis, IEEE Trans Neural Networks 1997; 8:679?693]. Methods: Raw iEEG data (subdural and depth recordings) from 4 subjects, sampled at 1000 Hz, were analyzed. Bandpass was set from 1.6 to 300 Hz. Seizure onset was marked at the time of earliest change in EEG. The EEG segment, 10 sec before and after seizure onset, was divided into onset epochs (OE), each of 2 sec length, with 50% overlap between consecutive epochs. Background epoch (BE) was defined as the average of 30-sec EEG during the interictal period, preceding the OE by at least 2 min. The signal was decomposed using a Daub-2 wavelet and scales 2 to 6 (corresponding to frequency bins 250?125, 125?63, 63?32, 32?16, 16?8 and 8?4 Hz respectively) were used for feature analysis. Two parameters were computed for each scale: relative energy (ratio of the energy in a given scale in the OE to the energy of the same scale in the BE); average of the distribution tail (ratio of the average of the top 80th percentile squared coefficient to the average of the squared coefficient for a given scale). In addition to this average peak-to-peak amplitude and curve length (measure relating to the fractal dimension) of the OE are also computed and used as features. QNN was initially trained using seizure onset patterns from multiple subjects. With each subsequent seizure, the QNN was progressively re-trained by populating the training with 50% of the epochs belonging to the last seizure, 25% belonging to the previous to last seizure and 25% from a bank containing a variety of patterns from multiple subjects. Decision-making was based on the inherent ability of the QNN to identify and quantify uncertainty, represented by its output values between 0 (non-seizure) and 1 (seizure), in conjuction with a spatio-temporal rule. Thus, seizure onset was reported when the activity was observed in at least 2 adjacent channels and the activity was sustained for at least 6 sec (with QNN output value >0.65). If a channel had reported seizure in the past, its membership threshold was reduced to 0.4 and the spatio-temporal rule was applied. The QNN classifier was tested on 8 seizures from 2 subjects (each with 4 seizures). Results: All the seizure onsets (100%) were detected using the above method. There were only a few false detections. Conclusions: Progressively trained QNNs appear to be promising in detection of intracranial seizure onset. Further investigation will focus on detection of a wider variety of seizure onset patterns in multiple subjects and different decision-making strategies. 1 Ayako Ochi, 1 Hiroshi Otsubo, 1 Ryoichi Iwata, 1 Takanori Funaki, 1 Tomoyuki Akiyama, 1 Rohit Sharma, 1 Shelly K.

Carter Snead III ( 1 Neurology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ; and 2 Neurosurgery, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the frequency range of 80 Hz and higher has been investigated from ictal subdural EEG data in patients with intractable localization-related epilepsy. Multiple band frequency analysis (MBFA) provides high resolution of frequency changes and time courses in HFOs. We studied ictal HFOs from extraoperative video subdural EEG monitoring (SDEEG) using MBFA to characterize patterns of HFOs in children with intractable neocortical epilepsy. Methods: We retrospectively studied 8 children (3 girls and 5 boys; mean age, 14 years; range, 8 to 17 years) who presented with intractable neocortical epilepsy and underwent SDEEG consisting of 48 to 116 contacts (AD-TECH Medical instrument corporation, Racine, WI, USA). We recorded SDEEG for 48 to 144 hours with 1,000 Hz sampling rate (HARMONY 5.4, Stellate, Montreal, PQ, Canada). We analyzed 4 to 11 seizures by selecting SDEEG data epochs of 10 to 50 seconds including 5 seconds before the ictal EEG onset. We used MBFA using the software program Short Spectrum Eye (Gram, Saitama, Japan) for frequency and distribution analyses of HFOs. The power spectrograms of frequency bands between 5 Hz to 300 Hz were calculated with a frequency resolution of 2 Hz and a temporal resolution of 25 ms. We arranged all power spectrograms in the same order as subdural grid electrodes and evaluated the distribution of HFOs. Results: Seven of 8 patients presented with regionally predominant ictal HFO changes (mean, 23 electrodes). We found two patterns of HFOs consisting of existence or absence of sustained narrow band of HFOs. Four of 7 patients had initial wide range of HFOs (up to 115 Hz) lasting 2 to 5 seconds before the clinical seizure onset, followed by a sustained narrow band of HFOs (mean, 101 Hz) during ictal symptom of partial seizures. The seizures in these 4 patients evolved into secondary generalization. The other three patients had wide range of HFOs (up to 214 Hz) before and after the clinical onset without following sustained narrow band of HFOs. They presented with brief partial seizures in cluster in one patient, epileptic spasms in 2, but they did not evolved into secondarily generalized seizures. The cortical resection areas in 7 patients included the region of predominant HFOs (mean maximum frequency, 138 Hz). They achieved good postsurgical outcomes. The remaining one patient had no regionally predominant ictal HFO changes. This patient has residual partial seizures after frontal cortical excision. Conclusions: MBFA characterized 2 patterns of ictal HFO changes between seizures with and without secondarily generalized in pediatric neocortical epilepsy. The regionally predominant ictal HFOs represented the ictal onset and ictal symptomatogenic zones. 1,2 Hannes Osterhage, 1 Florian Mormann, 1 Ralph G. Andrzejak, 1 Christian E. Elger, and 1,2 Klaus Lehnertz ( 1 Dept. of Epileptology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany ; and 2 Helmholtz-Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany ) Rationale: Patients suffering from intractable focal epilepsy may benefit from neurosurgical resection of the epileptic focus provided it can be identified via electroencephalographic recording of the seizure onset. A question of interest is whether the focus can be reliably identified from interictal recordings, i.e. without the necessity of observing seizures. Measurements of the synchronization between different EEG channels have been found to be promising for this purpose. Up to now, a number of measures for synchronization have been proposed based on different approaches. In this study a comparison between different linear and nonlinear synchronization measures was performed with respect to two aspects: 1. general performance of the measures in terms of their ability to discriminate the ipsi- from the contralateral hemisphere, 2. comparison of different measures to investigate whether the different approaches render complementary or redundant information. Methods: We analyzed intracranial EEG recordings from the seizure-free intervals of 30 patients with medically intractable medial temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing invasive presurgical diagnostics. EEG signals were recorded via bilateral intrahippocampal depth electrodes, each equipped with 10 recording contacts and implanted stereotactically along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampal formation. The total recording time comprised more than 83 hours. Several measures of synchronization were calculated for all combinations of depth electrodes within each hemisphere using a moving window technique, and then averaged over time. For each of the measures the average spatial synchronization in each hemisphere was calculated. A detection of the focal hemisphere was carried out for all measures and patients based on the assumption of a higher average synchronization in the focal hemisphere. True and false lateralizations were compared for different measures. Results: Correct lateralization based on higher synchronization of the focal hemisphere was found to be statistically significant for all measures investigated, although actual performance differed among the investigated measures. False lateralizations for different measures ranged between 6 and 8 out of 30. A comparison of correct and false lateralizations showed a strong similarities between measures. Conclusions: The focal hemisphere in an epileptic brain is characterized by a pathological increase in synchronization. The different measures investigated in this study appear to be sensitive to this increased synchronization. Lateralization analysis using synchronization measures could render additional diagnostic information, although the false lateralizations found in this study could limit its clinical applicability.

This approach is limited given its fixed-length analysis window and the non-stationary nature of EEG signals. The S Transform is a Fourier-based multi-resolution transform that has a variable length analysis window, thus circumventing the shortcomings of the STFT. In the present study, we introduce a novel application of the S Transform for visualization of normal and epileptiform EEG phenomena in humans. Methods: Selected recordings from five normal subjects and five patients with either focal or generalized epileptiform discharges were used. We identified a single channel that had a clear example of an electrographic feature of interest (e.g. alpha, mu, sleep spindles, eye blink, spike and wave, sharp wave) and applied the S Transform to it. Results: The S Transform provided clear visualization of the frequency components, in time, of the electrographic events. Some of the spectral attributes of these events were not immediately apparent on conventional review of the EEG. Conclusions: The application of the S Transform to EEG is novel and can potentially be a useful tool for visualizing clinically relevant features in EEG.

An intriguing hypothesis about the development of epilepsy is that a cortical region, when potentiated by repeated seizures, becomes chronically biased, leading to hypersynchrony. Thus, brain regions most involved in epileptogenesis are marked by chronic local hypersynchrony (LH). In this study, we discuss and illustrate the use of the mean phase synchrony measure to detect and map patterns of locally hypersynchronous neuronal activity in long term ICEEG recordings obtained during the epilepsy presurgical evaluation. Methods: Seven patients with different epilepsy syndromes were studied. Three 5 minute interictal samples from different monitoring days were tested in each case. Two seizures from each patient were studied, with 30 second samples taken from the preictal, ictal, and postictal periods. Interelectrode synchrony was measured using the mean phase coherence algorithm, which calculates the degree of phase locking independent of amplitude. Pairwise synchrony over one-second epochs was calculated for all adjacent channels of a subdural grid located over or near the clinically determined seizure onset zone. LH regions were defined as a set of contiguous channel pairs with average synchrony greater than one standard deviation above the mean for the entire grid. Results: Chronic LH regions were found in all seven patients, with these characteristics: (1) LH persisted over long recording periods and was state-independent. (2) Each patient had a unique pattern of LH regions with different anatomical distributions. (3) In each case, an LH area was associated with the clinically identified the seizure onset zone. (4) In peri-ictal recordings, there was a relative focal desynchronization preictally, a prominent finding in two patients but present to some degree in all seven, and enhanced hypersynchrony postictally. Conclusions: These findings suggest that local hypersynchrony in the EEG is related to abnormalities that underly partial epilepsy. This identification may prove useful in several areas. First, clinical EEG interpretation may be enhanced by using synchrony measurements to help define epileptogenic networks. Second, the described properties may be investigated to shed light on epileptogenic mechanisms. Third, knowledge of network structure and function may lead to improved techniques for disrupting the network to prevent seizures through resection, on-site neurostimulation, or local drug delivery. Fourth, these observations may lead to improved techniques for automated seizure prediction and detection. FACES 1,7 Deng-Shan Shiau, 2,7 Chang-Chia Liu, 2,7 Wichai Suharitdamrong, 2 Panos M.

Chris Sackellares ( 1 Neuroscience, University of Florida ; 2 Industrial and Systems Engineering ; 3 Pediatrics ; 4 Biomedical Engineering ; 5 Neurology ; 6 Psychiatry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 7 Malcolm Randall VA Medical Center, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Rapid identification of patients with independent bitemporal seizure onset zones could greatly reduce presurgical evaluation costs. We describe a novel method to identify patients with independent bilateral seizure foci based on a nonlinear characteristic of EEG signals. Signal nonlinear characteristic is quantified by the statistical difference of Short-Term Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (STLmax) values estimated from the original EEG signals and its surrogate dataset. Methods: Eight adults with temporal lobe epilepsy (5 with unilateral temporal onsets and 3 with independent bilateral onsets) were included in this study. Long-term EEG recordings from bilaterally placed depth and subdural electrodes (left and right temporal depth, subtemporal and orbitofrontal) were analyzed. Initial analyses involved the following steps: (1) each EEG signal was divided into 10.24 sec epochs and 10 surrogate EEG time series were generated, (2) STLmax values were estimated for each epoch of the original EEG signal and each of the 10 surrogate EEG signals, (3) T-index, derived from pair-T statistics, was calculated to measure the statistical difference in STLmax values between the original signal and mean values estimated from the 10 surrogate EEGs. Nested two-way ANOVA was applied to test the significance of the brain region effect (patients were random blocks; seizures were nested within patient). Significance level = 0.05 was applied for rejection of the null hypothesis. Results: For each of the five patients with unilateral seizure onset, statistical test revealed that the nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals derived from mesial temporal electrodes within the seizure onset zone are significantly different from those from other areas (p < 0.01). In contrast, the nonlinear characteristics of EEG are not different (p > 0.05) among recording areas in all three patients who experienced bilateral seizure onsets. These differences were present throughout the recording, even before the first seizure was recorded. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that it may be possible to efficiently and quantitatively determine whether a patient is likely to have unilateral temporal or independent bitemporal seizure onsets, based on analysis of the nonlinear characteristics of the EEG signal. In these patients, the findings were robust and persistent. Further studies in a large sample of patients will be required to determine whether or not this approach will have utility in selecting candidates for resective surgery.

Methods: We implemented a patient-specific seizure detection algorithm (Shoeb A, et al. Epilepsy Behav 2004; 5:483?498) on a small digital signal processor (DSP; TM320C6711, Texas Instruments), and streamed previously recorded ambulatory EEGs from two patients to the DSP at a rate of 200 samples/sec per channel. For each EEG, we noted the sensitivity and specificity of seizure detections, and the latency with which the algorithm declared seizure onset following the initial electroencephalographic changes. Results: The algorithm trained on seizure-free EEG epochs and 7 electrographic seizures uniformly sampled over the duration of the two EEG studies. The figure shows the average latency for detection of seizure onsets once the electroencephalographic changes began. The algorithm detected 70/72 seizure onsets (30/31 for patient #1, and 41/42 for patient #2), and declared 2 false detections (0 for patient #1, and 2 for patient #2) in 5.5 hours (2 hours for patient #1, 3.5 hours for patient #2) of ambulatory EEG epochs uniformly sampled over a 36-hour period (20 hours for patient #1, and 16 hours for patient #2). The figure also compares how soon following electrographic seizure onset patient #1 became symptomatic (indicated by pressing the event button). Patient #2 was unaware of his seizures and therefore did not press the event button. Conclusions: These preliminary results demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of seizure onset detections using our algorithm and the feasibility of detecting seizures in the ambulatory setting within seconds of electrographic seizure onset and before symptoms occur. Further evaluation of our detection methodology on pre-recorded as well as on-line ambulatory EEG studies is underway.

Jirsch, 1 Pierre LeVan, 1 François Dubeau, and 1 Jean Gotman ( 1 EEG, Montreal Neurological Institute,McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: High frequency activity in the intracerebral EEG of epileptic patients has been described in recent studies using microelectrodes. We report changes in high frequency activity immediately following epileptic spikes in intracerebral recordings obtained from macroelectrodes. Methods: Eight patients with intractable epilepsy were evaluated; 4 had mesial temporal epilepsy (MT) and 4 neocortical epilepsy (N). EEGs from stereotaxically placed depth electrodes were filtered at 500Hz and sampled at 2000Hz. Spikes were classified according to their localization and morphology, with 60 spikes in each type. Segments of 256ms were selected immediately following each spike (post-spike), and 2s before each spike (baseline). Log-spectral power was estimated in 4 frequency bands: slow (0?40Hz), gamma (40?100Hz), high frequency (HF, 100?200Hz), and very high frequency (VHF, 250?500Hz). Changes between post-spike periods and baselines were assessed for each channel (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.01). Results: 25 types of spike were identified (16 MT, 9 N). Changes were seen in 14 types of spike in HF (10 MT, 4 N) and in 11 types in VHF (8 MT, 3 N). Changes in VHF were always associated with changes in HF. In 9 types of spike (7 MT, 2 N), there was an increase in slow activity corresponding to a visible slow wave, but also a decrease in fast activity. These changes occurred in the hippocampus and neocortex. In 6 types of spike (5 MT, 1 N), there was an increase in slow activity despite the absence of a visible slow wave and an increase in fast activity. These changes occurred mostly in the amygdala, even though the spike was minimal in that area. The same pattern was observed in the hippocampus in two types of spikes in one patient. Finally, there was one type of spike with a decrease in fast activity without changes in slow activity. Overall, changes in VHF activity were spatially more restricted than changes in HF and gamma bands. Conclusions: A significant proportion of spikes were followed by changes in high frequency activity, more often in mesial temporal than neocortical spikes. Slow waves following spikes were generally associated with a decrease in HF and VHF compared to baseline. Changes in high frequency were clearest in channels where the spikes were most prominent, while changes at lower frequencies were more widespread. In many instances, there was an increase in high frequencies in the amygdala, even though the spike was not prominent in this region. This study demonstrates that high frequency activity can be recorded with macroelectrodes and has significant changes in epileptic discharges. The reduction in HF and VHF following spikes may reflect a profound inhibition that is more marked in the region of spike generation. The amygdala behaves differently from the hippocampus and neocortex, not showing this reduction in fast activity.

Methods: CCA separated a 10s EEG epoch in a set of components (or sources) with a decreasing autocorrelation index (AI). It has been noticed that muscle artifact components have a lower AI than genuine EEG components. A neurologist removed muscle artifact from 317 epochs of ictal EEG of 40 patients by gradually removing the components starting from the one with the lowest AI. The neurologist determined subjectively the separation point where as much muscle activity was removed as possible, without affecting the brain activity significantly. This yielded a gold standard binary classification of the CCA components into muscle artifact components and EEG components. Next a fully automated classification of each CCA component was performed based on the ratio of spectral energy of the frequency band 25?50Hz to the band 10?15Hz. It is anticipated a large value of this feature will be observed when muscle activity is present in a component. The optimal feature threshold was selected by maximally remaining EEG components and maximally suppressing muscle artifact components. Results: The developed automated method was able to remain on average 99±0.3% of the EEG component energy, while removing on average 71±33% of the muscle artifact component energy. Conclusions: An automated muscle artifact removal technique was presented, that could be used as pre-processing step in the early detection of ictal activity or as a filter in the visual evaluation of ictal EEG.Currently the same EEG's are being processed by other neurologists, to investigate the user dependency of the optimal separation point to obtain a more generalized gold standard which can improve the robustness of the automated muscle artifact elimination.

One of its capabilities is to study the epileptiform discharges to demonstrate similar or different origin of its components. The goal of this study was to discover how ICA analyse the discharges in the benign centrospikes, to understand better this kind of idiopathic epilepsy. Methods: We analysed 15 discharges of 3 patients with benign centrotemporal epilepsy. Their morphology was sharp wave, spike or spike-and-wave. The samples were recorded digitally with a 32-channels Lamont amplifiers and Harmonie 5.2b program. ICA was applied using the JADE algorithm implemented in a Matlab platform. The components were identified visually. The suspected components were selected and the EEG of these components by itself and together were reconstructed. The topography in each component of the discharge was compared with the original using the BESA program in the same period. Results: The spikes and waves were located in different components. Spikes were separated in one (n = 10), two (n = 4) or three (n = 1) components, with delay between their maximums of 5?10 ms. The waves were isolated in other one or two components. Their topography was centrotemporal, very similar but not identical. The lateralization of each component was variable between components of the same spike, and it could be right, left or bilateral. Each component of the spike fit very well with the EEG in the correspondent time. The topography of the components from different spikes of the same patient varied slightly in the localisation. Conclusions: ICA differentiates several components with temporal evolution in the epileptiform discharges in centrotemporal epilepsy. In most of the discharges, the spike and the wave had different components suggesting different origin. Their topography was centrotemporal, similar but variable in the lateralization and localisation. In each patient the way of analysis of the discharge was very similar but not identical. 1 Chunmao Wang, 2 Istvan Ulbert, 1 Werner K.

Methods: Laminar multiple microelectrodes and clinical macroelectrodes were chronically implanted in epilepsy patients undergoing subdural grid and depth implantation for seizure localization. The patients participated in several cognitive tasks during their normal alert status. Three of them were visual word recognition tasks, in which the patients were requested to decide if a word: (1) presented an animal or object longer than one foot; (2) rhymed in ?AY; ? or 3) ended in ?ED? for its past tense. Another task was auditory version of the size judgment task, in which a computer speaker instead of a monitor presented the stimuli. In all four tasks, half of the words were presented during practice stages prior to test, so repetition effect was expected. Results: Extensive overlapping responses were recorded in frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices. In visual cortex, the earliest response was peaking at ?140 ms. For auditory stimuli, the earliest auditory response was in superior temporal cortex, peaking at ?100 ms, and the largest response was in adjacent area [still in superior temporal cortex], starting from ?120 ms and peaking at ?300 ms. These responses were equivalent to new and repeated words. However, there were significant differential responses from ?500?1000 ms to new versus repeated words, for both auditory and visual stimuli, mainly in medial and ventral temporal areas. Laminar electrodes in adjacent areas measured a sink and source complex, with a greater response to new words during the same time range. Conclusions: For both micro and macro recording, word repetition does not affect the initial processing stage but decreases later activity. These differential responses appeared to represent the N4-P3b.

As seizures are characterized by an abnormal synchronization of neurons, multivariate time series analysis techniques detecting synchronized dynamics in invasive EEG recordings of epilepsy patients are a promising approach. Here, we have investigated two synchronization measures originating from the theory of Nonlinear Dynamics with respect to their potential role for epileptic seizure prediction. Methods: Two quantities measuring phase and lag synchronization have been applied to an invasive EEG data pool of 21 patients each with 24 hours of seizure-free recordings and 2?5 pre-seizure periods. Synchronization changes have been examined in different brain structures analyzing focal electrode contacts, i.e. early involved in ictal activity, as well as extra-focal electrode contacts, i.e. not involved in ictal activity or only involved lately during seizure spread. The seizure prediction performance has been assessed by the methodology of the seizure prediction characteristic. The seizure prediction characteristic evaluates sensitivity of a prediction method with respect to its specificity and temporal aspects of a prediction. Comparing with the probability to predict seizures by chance, a test is utilized to decide about the statistical significance. Results: Compared to a random prediction, a significantly better seizure prediction performance has been shown for half of the patients. Both decreasing and increasing synchronization in the EEG dynamics could precede seizures. Regarding the topography of brain structures investigated, a statistical significant superiority of combinations between one focal and one extra-focal electrode contact could be demonstrated for the lag synchronization measure (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Preictal changes in the synchronization of the EEG dynamics may offer a chance for epileptic seizure prediction. Our study shows that the seizure prediction performance differs between patients and strongly depends on the analysis technique applied and the brain structure investigated.

Larson-Prior, and 2 Abraham Z. Snyder ( 1 Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ; and 2 Radiology and NeuroImaging Laboratory, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: The ballistocardiogram (BKG) is a significant source of artifact in scalp EEG recorded in the static magnetic field characteristic of human MRI scanners. Multiple methods (averaging, ICA, adaptive filtering) have been successfully employed by others to reduce the BKG. A new method of identifying BKG is used to biologically characterize the BKG across multiple electrodes and subjects. Methods: Simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings were made from twelve subjects. Greater than than ten hours of EEG containing BKG. EEG-fMRI was recorded in a 3 Tesla Siemens Allegra MR scanner using a Neuroscan (El Paso, TX) Synamps/2 amplifier and Maglink cap and cabling system with Scan 4.5 software. Standard 10/20 electrode positions were collected at a 20 kHz sampling rate and the gradient artifact greatly reduced with Scan 4.5 with decimation of the EEG signal to 500 Hz. 10?20 electrodes were referenced to a common electrode halfway between CZ and CPZ). Two additional processing steps were developed to reduce the BKG (Vincent, et al, Soc Neuroscience Abstracts 2005). First, a custom template based beat detector program, which identifies EKG patterns that represent single heart beats, was used to provide accurate triggering. Second, a moving general linear model was used to generate models of the BKG. The extracted BKG signal was characterized by standard averaging and forward FFT techniques. Results: The BKG waveforms recovered by the GLM technique consistently included components outlasting the mean inter-beat interval in all (12/12) subjects and all 10?20 electrodes. Thus, as the waveforms due to successive beats inconsistently overlap, simple averaging cannot adequately characterize and reduce the BKG artifact. The BKG is large at 3 T. The positive to negative peak variation in the BKG is always more than 100 microvolts, and the largest components are most frequently several hundred microvolts in size in the O1-Ref electrode. The frequency content of the BKG is complicated. In addition to the frequency of the heart rate itself, bimodal peaks at 3?5 Hz and 8?10 Hz are present in the BKG, which contaminate frequency ranges needed to recover standard EEG. When the power spectral density of each electrode is averaged across subjects, the frequency bin with peak power varies over the scalp. Conclusions: BKG recorded at 3 Tesla represents a significant electrical signal that must be successfully removed to obtain EEG that represents brain activity. In addition to removing the BKG, biological characterization of the BKG across multiple subjects allows determination of the nature and variability of this signal. BKG itself is spatially variable in size and frequency content across the scalp. These observations constrain theoretical accounts of BKG origin, which presently remain incomplete.

AB  - Introduction: The amount of oxygen in blood is an important measure of lung function. There are three ways to quantify the amount of oxygen in blood: 1) the oxygen tension (PO2); 2) the percent of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (HbO2); and 3) the absolute content of oxygen in the blood (ContO2). PO2 is commonly measured. HbO2 and ContO2 are usually calculated from the normal human oxyhemoglobin relationship, but can be measured directly. The canine curve is similar to, but not the same as, that of humans. The purpose of this study was to compare, in dogs, direct measurements of HbO2 and ContO2 with analyzer-calculated values derived using the human oxyhemoglobin curve, and with hand-calculated values derived using a canine oxyhemoglobin curve. Materials And Methods: Arterial and jugular venous samples from 17 healthy dogs were analyzed by an ABL 705 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer, an OSM3 co-oximeter, and a LexO2con oxygen content analyzer. HbO2 was calculated from the measured PO2 using a published formula based on normal canine data (Reeves, 1982), and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. ContO2 values were calculated, and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. Means and standard deviations were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Results: Arterial HbO2 determined by the ABL 705 factory-programmed algorithm, reported by the OSM3 co-oximeter, and calculated from Reeves' canine formula were significantly different (97.1±0.57, 98.2±0.58, and 96.6±0.74, respectively). The calculated canine HbO2 was significantly lower than that measured by the OSM3 or calculated by the ABL for both arterial and jugular venous samples. Calculated and measured arterial and venous ContO2 were similar, as were arterial-venous ContO2 differences. However, values derived from the calculated canine HbO2 (canine-calculated) resulted in the greatest arterial-venous ContO2 difference. Conclusion: ABL-calculated and canine-calculated HbO2 were similar to measured values. Likewise, ABL-calculated, canine-calculated, and OSM3-calculated ContO2 were very similar to measured values. Although some of the values generated by the different methods are statistically significantly different, these differences are unlikely to be clinically important in the healthy dog.

AB  - Our laboratory developed a customized solution containing various free-radical scavengers, energy sources, and vasodilators in an attempt to attenuate intestinal injury following an ischemic insult. This solution has been evaluated with beneficial effects following low flow ischemia and reperfusion using in vitro and in vivo models using intra-arterial and intraluminal administration. In both investigations, the solution minimized morphologic injury and decreased transmucosal leakage of albumin. Objective: To determine if the systemic administration of the solution (GI Boost) had any clinical effect on normal horses, and to summarize the outcome of horses undergoing colic surgery that received the solution intravenously and intraluminally. Animals: 5 healthy adult horses and at the time of submission the outcomes of 10 horses undergoing abdominal surgery for colic. Methods: 2 L of GI Boost was administered at concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 75% intravenously (IV) to 5 normal horses. Parameters evaluated included CBC, chemistry panel, blood pressure, and physical examination. In 10 clinical cases, GI Boost was administered IV (intra-op and post-op) and intraluminally via the enterotomy. Results: The administration of GI Boost did not produce any clinical or hematologic abnormalities in normal cases. None of the clinical cases developed any complications associated with the use of the solution. The majority of horses were discharged from the hospital and 1 died following large colon rupture. Clinical Relevance: The administration of GI Boost may have a beneficial effect in horses presented for colic. Additional cases continue to be acquired to determine if this solution has a beneficial effect relative to traditional methods of treatment.

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - A new closure technique developed for lateral thoracotomy approaches in emergency surgeries was used to close 20 thoracotomies in 5 cats and 15 dogs, and the results were compared retrospectively to a previously recommended and published technique. The continuous shoe-lace technique involved the use of monofilament 2?0 (cats) to 2 sized (large dogs) polypropylene on a swaged on taper needle. The closure pattern began at the dorsal aspect of the intercostal opening just caudal to the caudal rib and then moved to just cranial to the cranial rib. The pattern continued in a continuous fashion, placing a suture bite every 1?2?cm (cats) to every 3?4?cm (large dogs). At the ventral aspect of the incision, the closure continued back dorsally with a continuous lacing-like pattern. At the conclusion of the pattern dorsally the sutures on each side of the incision were pulled tight. The opening between the ribs was brought together with this tightening. The single knot was then tied. Results revealed a more rapid closure than the conventional closure (averaging 10?minutes versus 20?minutes, respectively). No dehiscence was observed with either technique. The single knot was able to be tied without any difficulty. No other complications were observed. This study proved that the new closure technique was very effective. It is recommended over the routine previously accepted and published method because of increased speed and less suture material buried. This is especially helpful in emergency surgery where surgery time needs to be as short as possible.

AB  - Because of the cost and complexity of treating immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) cases, it is important to find accurate prognostic factors. Most information to date has come from retrospective university studies with varying treatment protocols. To better identify prognostic indicators in cases diagnosed with IMHA, a prospective study with a standardized treatment protocol was undertaken. Diagnosis of IMHA was based on standard published criteria and effective rule out of other diseases. For each IMHA case admitted, historical, treatment and clinical data were documented during hospitalization. All discharged cases were followed for at least 3 months. Of 31 cases originally enrolled in the study, 26 cases were available for analysis in determining chance for discharge and 21 cases were available in determining longer term prognosis. All cases were autoagglutinating. Eighteen cases were discharged (69%), 1 case died, and 7 cases were euthanized in the hospital due to a grave prognosis. Cases that died or were euthanized in the hospital had a significantly higher maximum total bilirubin (Tbili) level than those that were discharged (33.5 versus 4.8, p=0.0004). Between cases that were discharged and those that died or were euthanized, there was no difference in age, packed cell volume, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count or Tbili on admission, or the presence of hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia. The number of transfusions received and hospitalization time were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Only 3 animals had been vaccinated within 2 months; of those, 1 was euthanized and 2 were discharged. Three-month follow-up information was available for 13 of the 18 cases discharged. Of the 13, 7 cases were still alive at 3 months (7/21, 33%). There was no difference in age, PCV, WBC, platelet count, total bilirubin at admission, number of transfusions received, or hospitalization time between survivors and non-survivors. None of the animals that lived over 3 months had hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria during their hospitalization. Maximum Tbili was significantly higher in non-survivors versus survivors (23.7 versus 1.9, p=0.0005). A total bilirubin of greater than 5.16 during hospitalization was associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

AB  - Acepromazine (ACE) is a phenothiazine derivative used for its sedative properties. The primary mechanism of action of ACE is through inhibition of dopaminergic-2 receptors in the brain. It is a common belief that ACE lowers the seizure threshold. The purpose of this clinical study is to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of seizures in dogs presenting with a history of seizures that were treated with ACE during hospitalization. A retrospective review of records from dogs that had a chronic or acute seizure history and received ACE was done. Factors evaluated included the presenting complaint, historical seizure information, ACE dosage and route of administration, reason for giving and length of hospitalization following ACE, occurrence of seizure activity post-ACE administration, time interval between ACE and seizure activity, and use of other medications. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study, 20 males and 11 females. Age range was 3 months - 14.9 years. Presenting complaint was seizure in 28 patients, bite wound in 1 patient, ruptured cranial cruciate ligament in 1 patient, and hind limb paresis in 1 patient. Twenty-seven dogs did not seize after ACE administration within an average of 16.4 hours of observation (range: 0.25?66 hours). There was a known history of seizures in 22/31 prior to the day of presentation, and 15/22 were currently on maintenance anti-epileptic medication. Of the 16 not on anti-seizure medication at the time of presentation, 13 were started on phenobarbital. One was also started on potassium bromide, and 3 received no anti-seizure medication during hospitalization. All received at least one dose of ACE while in the hospital (range 1?5). Mean ACE dose was 0.029?mg/kg IV (range: 0.008?0.057?mg/kg; n=46), 0.036?mg/kg IM (range: 0.017?0.059?mg/kg; n=14), 0.53?mg/kg PO (n=2). Twenty-three received some form of anti-seizure medication in the hospital prior to being given ACE. Eight seizure episodes occurred 0.3?10 hours after ACE administration in 4. All 4 presented for seizures. The time interval between ACE administration and seizure activity was greater than that expected for measurable effects to be seen in one dog (10 hours). In conclusion, there is no clinical evidence that ACE administration at the listed dosages is associated with increased seizure activity in dogs with seizure disorders. A larger study group is needed to more thoroughly evaluate the safety of short-term ACE use in dogs with a seizure history.

AB  - Introduction: Gastric acid suppression is a recommended therapy for gastric ulceration. Human studies suggest that optimal healing of duodenal ulcers occurs at gastric pH >3 for 75% of the day. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4 gastric acid suppressants at recommended veterinary doses. Drug effect was based on the 24-hour median pH and the percentage of time that the intragastric pH ≥3 in a 24 hour period. Methods: The study was conducted in 12 healthy Beagle dogs and was a double-blind, randomized, multiple cross-over comparison of a placebo (saline IV q12?h), ranitidine 2?mg/kg IV q12?h, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q12?h, pantoprazole 1?mg/kg IV q24?h, and omeprazole (unblinded) ?1?mg/kg PO q24?h. Continuous 24-hour intragastric pH measurements were obtained via PEG tube. Prior to drug testing, 24-hour pH measurements were recorded in fasted and fed dogs. Thereafter, dogs were fed standardized meals throughout the remainder of the study period. Drugs were administered for 1 week with a one-week washout period between tests. Data were obtained on Day 0 (baseline), Day 2 and Day 6 of treatment. Following the randomized study, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q8?h and omeprazole ?1?mg/kg + bicarbonate q12?h via PEG tube were evaluated in 6 dogs, respectively. Appropriate statistical analyses were applied to calculate the 24-hour median pH and percentage of time that the test drug maintained intragastric pH≥3 over 24 hours. Results: The 24-hour median pH of fasted dogs was 4.44 vs. fed dogs 1.30 (p<0.0001). The % time pH≥3: fasted dogs 66.0% vs. fed dogs 13.3% (p<0.0001). The 24-hour median pH was (bold denotes significance when compared to saline) - saline pH 1.81, ranitidine Day 2?pH 2.53, Day 6?pH 2.05, famotidine Day 2?pH 2.83, Day 6?pH 3.68, pantoprazole Day 2?pH 3.11, Day 6?pH 3.49, omeprazole Day 2?pH 3.86, Day 6?pH 4.09. The % time pH≥3: saline 32.9%; ranitidine day 2 ? 44.6%, Day 6 ? 37.2%; famotidine: Day 2 ? 48.9%, Day 6 ? 60.1%; pantoprazole: Day 2 ? 54.2%, Day 6 ? 59.1%; omeprazole: Day 2 ? 66.9%, Day 6 ? 70.2%. The 24-hour median pH of omeprazole + bicarbonate q12?h was 4.7 on Day 2 and 4.9 on Day 6; the % time pH ≥3 was 90.9% on Day 2 and 78.4% on Day 6, respectively. No significant difference was noted in any parameter comparing famotidine q8?h and q12?h. Conclusions: Fasted dogs had a significantly higher pH than fed dogs. Omeprazole was the only drug tested that approached the potential therapeutic efficacy for healing of duodenal ulcers when assessed by criteria for human patients. Variation existed amongst dogs in all drugs tested.

AB  - A technique for placement of a long-term arterial catheter that the author developed was used in 20 canine patients. The catheter was used for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. The technique involved the following steps post-sedation and placement of a local anesthetic: 1 Clipping and prepping of the medial aspect of the distal tibia and proximal metatarsal region; 2 Incision over the medial tibial malleolus just caudal to the cranial tibial muscle-tendon; 3 Blunt dissection of the space just caudal to the cranial tibialis tendon; 4 Isolation of the cranial tibial artery and loop placement proximally and distally; 5 Placement of a 3 Fr. polyurethane 4?8?cm catheter using a Seldinger wire technique; 6 Placement of a suture in the periosteium of the distal tibia and anchoring of the catheter with this suture; 7 Closure of the skin incision with sutures or staples; 8 Bandage application to hold the catheter in place. The entire surgical procedure was done using sterile technique. The catheter was able to be kept in place and working for up to 9 days (averaged 4 days). This compared favorably retrospectively over dorsalis pedis catheters that lasted only a maximum of 4 days. (average 1.5 days). Because of the size of the catheter (3 Fr.) it provided improved waveforms over that observed with the dorsalis pedis catheter (22?g) and its occlusion rate was very low (2 in 20). The cranial tibial artery catheter was found to be particularly effective because the catheter was able to be inserted several cm up the artery and the catheter was able to be anchored well. No major complications were observed with this technique. Because of its effectiveness it is recommended to be used routinely over femoral artery and dorsal pedis artery catheters.
