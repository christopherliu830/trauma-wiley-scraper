AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication in the cat, carrying a mortality rate as high as 26% during initial hospitalization. In humans, the presenting laboratory values can be correlated with the length of hospitalization and survival. To our knowledge, no studies of this kind can be found in the veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of therapy and clinical outcome of cats with DKA based on laboratory values, and whether or not administration of sodium HCO3 had an impact on survival. Only completed medical records of cats treated at the Animal Emergency Center for DKA from January 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. All patients received a standardized protocol for treatment of DKA. Data collected included presenting blood glucose level, presenting venous blood gas values, whether or not bicarbonate therapy was administered, length of hospitalization, and survival. Median duration of hospitalization of survivors was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and comparisons between groups performed using the log-rank test. Differences in laboratory values between survivors and non-survivors were compared using a one-sided unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test. Twenty medical records fit the study criteria. There were 12 male and 8 female cats, of which 14 were released to owner care and 6 died in the hospital (5 euthanized). Median duration of hospitalization among survivors was 4.5 days. There was a trend toward increased hospital stay in cats presenting with a blood glucose >269?mg/dL (3 days versus 5 days; p=0.0685). There was a trend for nonsurvivors to have pCO2 <21.5?mmHg (p=0.063), and K+<3.65?mmol/L (p=0.063). Eight cats presented with HCO3 <10?mmol/L. Of these, 2 were administered sodium HCO3. In conclusion, there was no statistically significant correlation between presenting laboratory values and outcome of cats with DKA. Those presenting with a pCO2<21.5?mmol/L or K+<3.65 mEq/L may have a greater chance for morbidity. There does not appear to be an association between sodium HCO3 administration and outcome in these cats. Additional case evaluations would provide greater power in confirming the validity of these preliminary results.

AB  - While potent analgesic agents, opioids reduce intestinal transport in the intestine, thereby increasing transit times and the potential for impaction colic. Methylnaltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, does not reverse the analgesic effects of morphine, and directly stimulates isolated smooth muscle strips in humans. Objective: To determine if N-methynaltrexone has an effect on contractile activity of the equine jejunum and pelvic flexure. Study Design: In vitro investigation using isolated circular smooth muscle strips. Animals: 8 adult horses (n=200 muscle strips). Methods: Increasing concentrations of N-methylnaltrexone were added to tissue baths in the range of 1?10?9?M to 1?10?5?M, and contractile responses were recorded for 3 minutes. Data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA with statistical significance as P<0.05. Results: The administration of N-methylnaltrexone significantly increased the contractile frequency and amplitude at all concentrations relative to baseline (P <0.0001) for the jejunum. The response was greatest at 1?10?7?M (P=0.0005) with a mean difference from baseline of 0.341?mg/cm2. The highest concentration evaluated (1?10?5?M) had a mean contractile strength of 0.206?mg/cm2 which was significantly greater than baseline activity (P=0.04). A significant increase in contractile activity for the colon was detected at 3?10?6?M (P=0.027) and 1?10?5?M (P=0.002). Clinical Relevance: Potentially, this agent could be used in conjunction with morphine to provide more potent and effective analgesia without compromising intestinal function.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Clostridium tetani infection is uncommon in dogs and cats. Up to this point in time just single case reports have been published in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of 13 dogs and one cat affected with Clostridium tetani. The medical records of the last ten year were reviewed. Dogs and cats that were identified as being infected with Clostridium tetani on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and/or bacterial culture from infected wounds were eligible for study inclusion. Thirteen dogs and one cat met the criteria for study inclusion. Six different breeds and mix-breed dogs were affected, German Shepherd dogs (n=4, 29%) and Labrador retriever (n=3, 21%) were the most frequently affected breeds. Observed clinical complications were ventricular aspiration pneumonia (n=7), laryngeal spasm (n=6), hypersalivation (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=3), and third degree AV block (n=1). Median days from onset of clinical signs until first signs of improvement were 10 days (range: 9?12 days). Median hospitalisation time was 18 days (range: 14?22 days). Six animals showed full recovery and 8 animals died or were euthanized. Death was associated with acute onset of ventricular tachycardia in 2 dogs, 1 dog died with non-responsive third degree AV-block, 3 dogs died after developing aspiration pneumonia, and 1 dog died of unknown causes.

AB  - The Rescue Glide Sked provides a practical means of moving a recumbent, non-ambulatory or injured horse from the site of an accident. Horses with serious injuries, displaying severe malnutrition or neurological symptoms, can be easily moved out of a stall or even down a trail to a horse ambulance for transport to a veterinary facility. It is a specialty cut piece of 8?? 4? recycled polypropylene with tie-down straps and steel attachment points for winch loading into an equine ambulance. A horse must be fully sedated during transport on the rescue glide to prevent further injury to itself or rescuers. Moving a recumbent horse is very difficult due to the weight of the animal, often causing damage to the head and eyes, and with many safety concerns for the rescuers (struggling, kicking). It may take 8 to 10 people to move a horse just a few feet, especially uphill or on high friction surfaces. Benefits of the Rescue Glide include that the plastic reduces the friction of the weight of the animal on the ground surface, so fewer people are needed to move the animal. The tough resilient plastic is flexible so it goes easily over obstacles such as logs, roots, or through ditches. It folds up around the animal's body to get through a standard stall door or tight spaces as might be encountered on a trail. The Glide may be attached to a winch, ropes pulled by human rescuers, or even vehicle (ATV, car, etc.) The practical use of the Rescue Glide has been demonstrated in numerous situations including severe limb injuries, neurological compromise, geriatric, recumbent/unable to rise, severe neglect/malnutrition, and recovery/removal of dead large animals. The equipment has been used at race tracks and riding competition events for transport of animals into ambulances, as well as by veterinary rescue response teams in trail riding accidents, pasture accidents, and severe trailer injuries. The Rescue Glide, in conjunction with an equine ambulance trailer, provides a safe and suitable means of transport of large animals to veterinary facilities and should be a part of the equine practitioner's emergency equipment.

AB  - The primary classes of drugs used for pain control in horses include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), the alpha-2 agonists, and the opiates, but each of these drug classes has significant adverse effects. Ketamine hydrochloride is a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the spinal cord and has been used in both dogs and humans to provide analgesia. The purpose of this study was to identify a safe administration rate for a continuous infusion of ketamine to awake horses and describe the clinical effects of this infusion. Six horses were administered a continuous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a low dose (0.4?mg/kg/hr) and high dose (0.8?mg/kg/hr). Each infusion took place over 6 hours and the horses were monitored during infusion as well as for the 6 hours post-infusion. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, activity level, and analgesic thresholds. Both the low dose and high dose rates were tolerated well by all horses with no signs of excitation or discomfort. Post-infusion heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased as compared to pre-infusion values (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) A significant increase in analgesic threshold was not identified. Subanesthetic infusions of ketamine to awake horses appear to be well tolerated and cause only mild changes in clinical parameters. Further research is needed to evaluate the analgesic potential of these infusions.

AB  - A prospective case-control study was undertaken at DLEAH from May, 2001 to February, 2003 to examine risk factors for development of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). A questionnaire was filled out by the attending doctor for each IMHA case diagnosed. The diagnosis of IMHA was made based on a PCV <25%, effective rule out of other diseases, and the presence of at least 2 of the following: spherocytosis; regenerative response with elevated reticulocytes or polychromasia; hemolysis characterized by bilirubinuria, hyperbilirubinemia, hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia; positive slide agglutination or positive Coombs' test. To provide case controls, the same questionnaire was filled out for the next canine patient admitted after diagnosis. Age, breed, vaccine history, previous illness, and medication history were examined. Date of admission was compared to total hospital case numbers to look for seasonality. The study contained 31 cases and 29 controls. Cases were significantly older than controls (7.45 years versus 5.1 years, p=0.01). Cocker spaniels and Cocker mixes were significantly more likely to be cases than controls (7/31 IMHA versus 1/29 controls, p=0.05). Medication and illness history for the 2 months prior to presentation was not significantly different between cases and controls. None of the IMHA cases had received antibiotics previously reported to be associated with IMHA. In contrast to previous studies, vaccination history was not significantly different between cases and controls. Five out of 31 cases had received vaccines in the previous 2 months; 4 of 9 controls had received vaccines in that same period. At least one case presented each month of the year. Although cases presented more frequently in the summer months, overall hospital case load was also elevated during these times. The monthly distributions of IMHA cases and total hospital case load were not significantly different.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the management and outcome of 10 cases of severe fulminant mitral regurgitation (MR) treated with SNP at the Animal Emergency Center between June of 1997 and August of 2000. The presence of acute respiratory distress with echocardiograph findings consistent with mitral regurgitation; no response to oxygen, lasix, and nitroglycerine ointment after 2?4 hours; and radiographic evidence that over 75% of the lung fields were involved defined dogs with severe fulminant MR. SNP was started at a dose of 1 ?g/kg/min. The dogs were monitored every 15?min by Doppler blood pressure, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, respiratory rate, and auscultation of the lungs for respiratory crackles were recorded. If the blood pressure remained above 90?mmHg systolic and increased lung sounds were present, the dose of SNP was increased by 1??g/kg/min every 15?min until respiratory crackles were reduced. These dogs were then maintained on that dose of SNP during what was called the ?maintenance period?. During this maintenance period, they were evaluated for signs of respiratory distress and blood pressure monitoring was recorded every 2 hours. The dogs were started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor during the maintenance period, and slowly tapered off the SNP. If the blood pressure decreased below 90?mmHg systolic, the dose of SNP was reduced to the previous dose. Eight dogs survived to discharge, one dog died 1 hour after starting SNP, and one dog was euthanized after 2 hours of SNP treatment. In the 8 dogs that survived, respiratory distress improved within 2 hours in 7 dogs (mean: 1.69, median: 2, range: 1.15?2) at a SNP dose of 1?3 ?g/kg/hr (mean: 1.75, median: 1.5 and range: 1?3). Respiratory distress improved in one dog within 6 hours on SNP at a dose of 5 ?g/kg/hr. In the survival group, SNP was maintained for 9?20 hours (mean: 14, median: 13 and range: 9?22). The taper of SNP occurred over 2?3 hours (mean: 4.2, median: 3 and range: 0?14) in 7 of the dogs that survived. One dog was tapered over 14 hours due to periodic episodes of hypotension and respiratory distress. The results suggest that use of SNP for treatment of dogs with CHF secondary to MR resulted in improvement in respiratory distress in 8 of the 10 dogs evaluated, and may be an effective alternative therapy for dogs with severe refractory CHF due to MR.

AB  - Objective: To retrospectively evaluate the indications, management and outcome of 152 cases of long-term positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Methods: Medical records of patients maintained on PPV for 24 hours or longer, from 1991 to 2001 were reviewed. All cases were categorized into 3 groups according to the reason they required PPV: animals with pulmonary parenchymal disease that were not adequately oxygenating (1), animals with neuromuscular or large airway disease that were not adequately ventilating (2), or animals with both inadequate oxygenation and ventilation (3). Results: A total of 152 ventilator episodes were identified represented by 124 dogs and 24 cats. The median duration of ventilation was 49 hours (range 24?356 hours). Overall, 41.4% of cases were weaned, and 27% of cases survived to discharge. There were 78 cases with inadequate oxygenation (Group 1), of which 37.2% were weaned and 20.5% survived to discharge. There were 62 cases with inadequate ventilation (Group 2), of which 50% were weaned and 38.7% survived to discharge. In Group 3, 10 cases were identified; 25% were weaned and 8.3% survived to discharge. Arterial blood gases were collected in 61.2% of cases prior to PPV. Venous blood gases were collected in 10.5% of cases and an SpO2 was recorded on 2% of cases. In 26.3% of cases, no blood gas or SpO2 measurements were performed prior to PPV. The mean PaCO2 prior to PPV was 46.9±15.5?mmHg in Group 1, 72.6±26.9?mmHg in Group 2, and 64.3±14.1?mmHg in Group 3. In Groups 1, 2 and 3, the mean PaO2/FIO2 ratio was 101.7±67.6, 262.6±210.9 and 115.7±75.9, respectively. Pentobarbital, with or without diazepam, was the most common induction (28.9%) and maintenance (61.8%) agent utilized. Most cases (91.4%) were initially stabilized with volume or pressure control. Of the animals weaned from PPV, synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation was used in 46% of cases and continuous positive airway pressure was used in 22.2%. Complications included pneumothorax (6.6%), oral ulceration (5.9%), and corneal ulceration (3.9%). Conclusion: Long-term PPV can be both practical and successful in veterinary medicine. Patients that require PPV due to pulmonary parenchymal disease had lower weaning and survival rates than those without.

AB  - Introduction: The study objective was to describe the underlying diseases, predisposing factors, clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with thromboembolic disease of non-cardiogenic origin in cats. Study Design: Necropsy-based retrospective study (1991?2002) Results: Forty-eight cats with thromboemboli that were not associated with significant structural heart disease were identified in a retrospective study using case records from the small animal necropsy service of the University of Pennsylvania, from 1991 to 2002. Thirty-five cats presented for non-specific signs such as lethargy and anorexia while others presented for signs such as paresis (10) or dyspnea (10) that were referable to the location of the thromboemboli. Thromboembolic disease was suspected clinically in 12 of 48 cats. In cases where a single predisposing factor could be identified, thromboemboli were associated with neoplastic (9), infectious (7) and inflammatory (3) disease. Thirteen cats had multiple predisposing factors and no obvious predisposing factor could be identified in 16 cats. The thromboemboli were found in the systemic arteries (12), systemic veins (9), both systemic arteries and veins (7), pulmonary vasculature (7) and in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation (13). Eleven cats either died at home, presented in respiratory or cardiac arrest, or arrested shortly after presentation to the emergency service. Two cats arrested later during hospitalization and the remainder were euthanized (35). No sex or breed disposition was found. There were no significant differences in serum biochemistries, coagulation profiles, lactate, Doppler blood pressure or rectal temperature when groups were compared by primary disorder. Cats with neoplasia as the underlying disorder were significantly older (median 13.5 years, p=0.04). Cats with infectious disease had statistically significant higher white blood cell counts (median 35,000/?l, p=0.03) and cats with inflammatory disease had significantly longer hospital stays (median 3 days, p=0.006). Conclusion: These results suggest that most cats with non-cardiac related thromboemboli often have multiple predisposing factors, non-specific signs and non-specific changes on laboratory parameters. More sensitive tests for hypercoagulability may aid in diagnosing thromboemboli in cats.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate whether ECG changes induced by hyperkalemia correspond with previously described changes. Design: Prospective Animals: Eighteen dogs and 22 cats with serum potassium levels >5.5?mEq/L as the result of various disease processes. Procedure: Once hyperkalemia was documented, the following data were collected: ECG (n=40), total magnesium (mg/dl) (n=18), total calcium (mg/dl) (n=31), and venous blood gas (n=20). Animals were divided into 5 groups based on expected ECG's changes associated with hyperkalemia (mEq/L): Group 1- 5.5?6.5; Group 2- 6.6?7.0; Group 3- 7.1?8.5; Group 4- 8.6?10.0; Group 5- >10.0. ECG's were interpreted to determine if the rate, rhythm and changes in the P-QRS-T complex were similar to those previously reported. Results: Twelve ECGs demonstrated changes previously described, while 28 did not: Group 1 (n=7)- 1/7; Group 2 (n=2)- 0/2; Group 3 (n=14)- 4/14; Group 4 (n=6)- 3/6; Group 5 (n=11)- 4/11. Many ECG abnormalities not previously described were also identified such as atrioventricular dissociation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Blood gas analysis revealed acidemia (19/20) with severe acidemia (pH<7.2) in the majority (16/19). Hypocalcemia was documented (5/13) and most of these patents (4/5) were in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia was documented in the majority of patients (10/18), though not in one particular group. Clinical Implications: It is difficult to establish typical ECG changes in patients with hyperkalemia, which represents a departure from the historical description. Hypocalcemia may be involved with ECG changes and arrhythmias in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia causes electrocardiographic abnormalities similar to those described with hyperkalemia and therefore does not explain the results of this study. There likely are complex interactions with electrolytes and acid base abnormalities that affect ECG formation.

AB  - Objective: To determine the amount of time required to reach the highest concentrations of oxygen at the patient's face and to determine what these highest concentrations of oxygen were with various non-invasive methods of providing supplemental oxygen using a commercial oxygen content analyzer. Procedure: Three healthy cats and 3 healthy dogs were each individually given supplemental oxygen by 6 different means, each done at 2 rates (5?L and 15?L per minute). The methods tested were: 1) Plastic sheet over conventional cage door (PSCD); 2) Blow-by where the tubing delivering the oxygen was held 8?cm from the face (BB); 3) Large plastic bag covering the patient (BAG); 4) Anesthesia induction chamber (AIC); 5) Synder oxygen cage (SOC); and 6) Crowe Oxygen E-Collar (COC). Prior to the testing, the commercial oxygen content analyzer (Mini-Ox) was calibrated. Results: Significant repeatable differences were consistently observed between the 6 methods of oxygen delivery. Results of both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rates consistently indicated that the highest oxygen concentrations were achieved with the anesthesia induction chamber and large plastic bag with oxygen concentrations reaching approximately 95% and 90%, respectively between 5 to 15?min. The BAG method had the advantage of allowing additional room for patient manipulation and the ability to place intravenous catheters while continuing to give supplemental oxygen. The plastic sheet covering a conventional cage door provided oxygen concentrations of 50% and 60% at 15 and 45?min, respectively. The Crowe Oxygen E-Collar achieved oxygen concentrations of 70% in 1.5?min. Blow-by was found to be the simplest method. It increased FiO2 to 40% within 2?min. The Synder oxygen cage was able to achieve 45% oxygen concentration within 30?min with an oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min. It was able to achieve 60% at 45?min (similar to the plastic bag on the cage). Conclusion: The order of effectiveness of providing non-invasive oxygen supplementation, from the highest to the lowest concentrations, was AIC, BAG, COC, PSCD, SOC, and BB. The fastest to the slowest increases in oxygen concentrations followed the same order at both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rate and they were BB, COC, AIC, BAG, PSCD, and SOC. SOC was the most inefficient means of providing oxygen while AIC, BAG and COC were the most efficient.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish reference values of respiratory mechanics and diffusion capacity in awake llamas for the interpretation and diagnosis of respiratory disease in critically ill camelids. The following procedures were performed in 10 healthy adult llamas (2?9 years; 100?204?kg): Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography and Pneumotachography (RIP) for the assessment of thoraco-abdominal synchrony and airflow obstruction (Hoffman, J Appl Physiol 2001;91: 2767?75), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and functional residual capacity (FRC) via helium dilution, esophageal balloon-pneumotachography to determine pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn), as well as Monofrequency Forced Oscillatory Mechanics (FOM) (Young, J Appl Physiol 1994;76:2467?72) to establish respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at the oscillatory frequencies of 1,2,3,5 and 7?Hz. RIP was further performed in 3 camelid patients to determine the cause of respiratory failure. The results of conventional lung mechanics, FOM (1?Hz), DLCO and FRC in healthy llamas are listed in the table below. Rrs at 1?Hz (closest to breathing frequency) was positively correlated with RL (P=.05). The calculated mean resonant frequency was 3.37 (+/?0.68) Hz. RIP results showed a peak difference between plethysmographic flow (V'sum) and nasal flow (V'n) of 2.61 (+/?1.02) during expiration (PEsf), and 2.48 (+/?1.04) during inspiration (PIsf). The area difference between V'sum and V'n was 0.05 (+/?0.14) and 0.05 (+/?.04) during the first 25% of expiration (SFEx) and inspiration (SFIx), respectively. Noninvasive evaluation of respiratory mechanics in clinical patients was essential to establish severity, type and progression of respiratory disease, especially in camelids presenting for upper airway obstruction, pulmonary disease or thoraco-abdominal asynchrony.

AB  - It has been recognized that a percentage of clone calves suffer from persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN). It has been proposed by some investigators that an imbalance between vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin (ET-1) and vasodilators (such as NO) are involved in the genesis of the problem. Additionally, some clone calves and human infants are refractory to more traditional therapy or require prolonged treatment for PPHN and these patients appear to have increased smooth muscle in their pulmonary small resistance vessels suggesting chronicity. ET-1 is a known mitogen of vascular smooth muscle. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate ET-1 concentrations in the blood of clone, the blood of their surrogate dams and in fetal fluids to investigate the utility of using these fluids for prepartum evaluation of the clone. Blood was collected from calves and their surrogates at the time of delivery into heparin tubes; the plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen until assayed. Fetal fluid samples were also obtained and frozen. Endothelin-1 concentration was determined using a commercially available RIA. Oxygen-dependent calves were those calves requiring, at a minimum, intranasal oxygen insufflation at rates of 5 or more L/min to maintain SPO2 values of >90%. Samples were obtained from a total of 40 calves; 13 calves were considered to be oxygen dependent and 27 calves were deemed non-oxygen dependent. Plasma ET-1 concentrations tended to be larger in oxygen-dependent calves (2-sample T test; p=0.16). Fetal fluid ET-1 concentration was significantly larger in the oxygen-dependent group (2-sample T test; p=0.0003). No difference between groups was detected in ET-1 measured in the blood of the surrogates; however, maternal blood ET-1 concentration was weakly but significantly correlated with fetal fluid ET-1 concentration overall (Correlation=0.456; p=0.007) and the correlation was stronger within the oxygen dependent group (Correlation 0.780; p=0.002). These data suggest that ET-1 may play a role in pulmonary function abnormalities in clone calves in the immediate post-partum period.

AB  - The ischemia-reperfusion seen in dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) could cause oxidative stress, decrease antioxidant capacity, and predispose patients to higher morbidity and mortality. Elevated lactate levels in dogs with GDV have been previously found to be a negative prognostic indicator. The purpose of this study was to serially evaluate oxidant and antioxidant concentrations in dogs with GDV and to determine if there is a correlation between the degree of antioxidant depletion and lactate levels. Dogs presenting to the Tufts Emergency Service that had not been treated with corticosteroids or fluids prior to admission and were not receiving antioxidant supplementation were eligible for the study. Blood samples were collected at the time of initial catheter placement pre-operatively (Time 0), and then 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The samples were analyzed for concentrations of oxidants [malondialdehyde (MDA), oxygen radical trapping capacity (ORAC) and F2 isoprostanes] and antioxidants (α-tocopherol, ? -tocopherol, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase). ANOVA with repeated measures was used to evaluate differences in the variables over the 48-hour period and Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between 2 continuous variables. To date, 8 dogs have been enrolled in the study (1 female and 7 males, with a mean age of 8.0±2.2 years). All dogs have survived to discharge. The chart below indicates differences in parameters measured during hospitalization. Variable Time 0?median (range) 24 hours?median (range) 48 hours?median (range) P?Value MDA (nmol/L) 0.725 (0.532?1.250) 0.500 (0.423?0.870) 0.512 (0.388?0.890) 0.008 α-tocopherol (ug/ml) 16.350 (3.800?29.400) 11.300 (6.760?30.800) 12.950 (7.850?40.400) 0.000 ?-tocopherol (ug/ml) 0.402 (0.138?0.776) 0.293 (0.000?0.500) 0.300 (0.000?0.503) 0.501 Mean plasma lactate upon admission was 4.3?mmol/L (range 2.1?7.2?mmol/L). There was a positive correlation between ?-tocopherol and lactate (r=0.784, P=0.012) but there were no correlations between lactate and MDA or α-tocopherol. Additional dogs are currently being enrolled in the study and analyses of the other variables (ORAC, F2 isoprostanes, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase) are pending. These preliminary results support the hypothesis of alterations in oxidant and antioxidant parameters in dogs with GDV.

AB  - Objective: To determine if 1) administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) would result in alteration of heart rate and fractional shortening parameters and 2) if administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) prior to administration of a dissociative sedative combination (ketamine-diazepam) would blunt increases in heart rate and fractional shortening parameters previously reported with the use of dissociative-based sedation. Design: Single blinded, randomized, crossover design. Animals: Eleven privately owned healthy cats with normal echocardiograms. Procedure: All cats received each of the following injections with at least one week separating each treatment: Treatment A (TA) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) and hydromorphone (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment B (TB) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by ketamine (6?mg/kg IM) and diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment C (TC) ? diazepam and hydromorphone combined in the same syringe followed in 15?minutes by ketamine and diazepam combined in the same syringe. Echocardiograms were performed using the right parasternal position 15?minutes after the second injection. Heart rate (HR) and parameters to determine fractional shortening (FS) in the short axis view were recorded in triplicate for each treatment group. An analysis of variance for repeated measures with a Fisher's LSD protected t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Fractional shortening was significantly increased in each treatment group compared to baseline (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in FS between TA and TB (p<0.05), TA and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p=0.9). Heart rate was not significantly increased between baseline and TA. There was a significant increase in HR between baseline and both TB and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p<0.05) Conclusion: The increase in fractional shortening induced by dissociative-based chemical restraint in normal cats is not blunted by the prior administration of a neuroleptanalgesia combination. The increase in fractional shortening following administration of the neuroleptanalgesia combination may have been due to an indirect increase in sympathetic tone (stress response).

AB  - Improved options for the successful transport of horses trapped in inaccessible areas (floodwater, steep ravines, etc.) during a disaster or emergency are available to practitioners using helicopter assets and the Anderson Sling?. Horses present a particularly difficult problem to remove from the rescue environment of a wide flooded area, or difficult steep terrain far from access by vehicles or heavy equipment. Due to their fractious and fearful nature, they may fight any effort to walk, climb or swim them to safety, and those attempts are inherently very dangerous for the rescuer(s). Unfortunately, many disaster or emergency scenarios may occur in areas not conducive to the use of other options (barge, rescue glide, simple vertical lift sling). Veterinary practitioners on scene should have familiarity with helicopter sling-load operations. The use of cargo nets, inappropriate home-made slings, and inadequate equipment has contributed to disastrous efforts by well-intentioned rescuers. There have even been desperate attempts at sling loading of cattle by roping the horns or one leg and transporting them into a waiting truck for removal from public lands. The Anderson Sling? has been successfully used for helicopter operations in multiple emergencies and training demonstration flights, and is the only Equine Sling recommended for this purpose. Although it was originally intended for clinical use in long-term recovery cases, it has become the industry standard for helicopter operations with equines because of its demonstrated safety margin, design and strength. In clinical use, leg straps further distribute the animal's weight to the legs, but are not necessary in rescue lifts. In some states, there are Large Animal Rescue Teams associated with the Veterinary School, the State Emergency Management Association, or local private Equine Ambulance Services that may have equipment and personnel trained in helicopter sling-loading. This is a specialty interest that requires prior coordination, significant planning, and training of all personnel involved.

AB  - An 8-year-old Pêga breed donkey that presented with a history of persistent enlargement of the right leg was diagnosed with a rhabdomyosarcoma by surgical exploration and biopsy. The tumoral mass involved the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh. At presentation, the donkey was extremely painful and reluctant to walk. Initial physical examination showed a heart rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and a rectal temperature of 100.2°F. Venous blood was collected for a CBC and biochemistry. Postoperative care included antibiotic (potassium penicillin and gentamicin) and anti-inflammatory (phenylbutazone and dexamethasone). The donkey was very painful in the immediate postoperative period and developed dehiscence of the incision. It was unable to bear weight on the affected limb, very reluctant to walk, and lying down in sternal recumbency most of the time. Heart and respiratory rates ranged from 60 to 90 and 20 to 32, respectively. Because of the poor prognosis, euthanasia was indicated but the owner decided to keep the donkey alive to try semen collection. In order to improve life quality and making the semen collection possible, the anti-inflammatory therapy was stopped and an analgesic therapy with epidural opioids was selected. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was inserted in the first intercoccygeal space through an epidural Huber point needle. With the purpose of reaching the lumbosacral area, 20?cm of the catheter was advanced cranially from the needle tip. During 3 days, a combination of morphine (0.1?mg/kg) and tramadol (0.5?mg/kg) was administered daily with a total volume of 20?ml. During the first 24 hours after the first administration, heart rate ranged from 62 to 64 and respiratory rate from 20 to 24. It was not observed to have any adverse effect. The donkey improved during treatment standing most of the time and eating better. It was easier to hand walk, although it was not completely able to bear weight in the affected limb. Even during treatment, the donkey reacted intensely when the surgical area in the caudal aspect of the thigh was manipulated. On the forth day, it tried to copulate and semen was successfully collected by manipulation of the penis. As the semen was not classified as good enough to be frozen, the donkey was euthanatized. On post-mortem examination, the position of the catheter in the epidural canal was observed and 20?ml of methylene blue solution injected through the catheter before euthanasia. It was enough to totally stain the segment of epidural canal from the first intercoccygeal space to the lumbosacral joint. The opioid epidural analgesic therapy reported here was considered to be efficient to treat the painful condition of the donkey, but it was not able to completely abolish the pain.

AB  - Objective: To establish normal parameters of thromboelastography (TEG) in healthy adult cats. Background: Thromboelastography (TEG) is an in vitro test of coagulation that has been shown to be useful in humans, dogs and select species to identify and quantify alterations of hemostasis (e.g., hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states). It has also been demonstrated to be useful in monitoring effects of anticoagulant therapies. This test has not been evaluated in cats. Methods: Blood was collected from 25 clinically normal cats by venipuncture using a 21 gauge?3 1/2 inch butterfly catheter and syringe for medial saphenous or jugular venipuncture. A single 1.8?mL sample in 3.8% Sodium Citrate (9:1) was collected from each cat. Recalcified whole blood was analyzed 30?minutes following collection with the TEG? 5000 analyzer (Haemoscope, Niles, IL). Analysis temperature was 37.6°C. TEG parameters recorded included: R-value (represents initial fibrin formation), K (time from R to standard fixed measure of clot firmness which represents contributions of platelets and fibrinogen), maximum amplitude (MA; represents absolute clot strength), and alpha angle (α; the slope of TEG tracing which represents rate of clot formation). The coagulation index (CI) was derived from the formula generated for humans to provide an overall assessment of whether the sample was hyper- or hypocoagulable. Results: Values for the 25 normal cat samples are reported as mean ±2 standard deviations. R=2.97; 1.23?4.72; K=1.54, 0.38?2.71; α=70.70, 57.76?83.65; MA=58.50, 45.26?71.74 and CI=2.27, 0.07?4.46. Compared to historical information obtained on normal dogs, cats have significantly shorter R and K and larger α, MA and CI. Conclusions: TEG does have reproducible performance when used to evaluate coagulation status in normal cats. Compared to dogs, normal cats favor a hypercoagulable state. Species-specific normal values are necessary for interpretation of TEG results. This test bears potential value for use in future experimental and clinical work to investigate hemostasis in cats receiving anticoagulant therapies or in cats suffering from diseases such as cardiomyopathy which are thought to be associated with altered coagulation status.

AB  - Pulse contour analysis is a relatively new method of continuously monitoring cardiac output. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the human algorithm for calculation of continuous cardiac output from the pulse waveform, for use in anaesthetised horses. Cardiac output was measured in 27 anaesthetised clinical cases comparing lithium dilution (LiDCO) with a preceding, calibrated cardiac output measured from the pulse waveform (PulseCO) using a commercial system (LiDCOplus, LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge, UK). These comparisons were repeated every 20?30?min. Positive inotropes or vasopressors were administered when clinically indicated. Cardiac output values obtained ranged from 15.2?52.2?L/min, with cardiac indices from 30.7?114.9?ml/kg/min. Eighty-nine comparisons were obtained. The mean bias was 0.24?ml/kg/min +/?6.48?ml/kg/min. The limits of agreement were ?12.72?13.2?ml/kg/min. The 95% confidence interval for the upper limit of agreement was 12.07?14.33?ml/kg/min and for the lower limit of agreement was ?11.59?13.85?ml/kg/min. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.89 and produced an equation of PulseCO (mls kg?1 minute?1)=0.9226LiDCO (mls kg?1minute?1) +5.354. This method of pulse contour analysis is a relatively non-invasive and reliable way of monitoring continuous cardiac output in the horse under anaesthesia. The ability to easily continuously monitor cardiac output may improve morbidity and mortality in the anaesthetised horse.
