AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scar is a devastating sequel to burns and other tangential skin injuries. It follows deep dermal injuries and does not occur after superficial injuries. Nitric oxide (NO) plays many important roles in wound healing from inflammation to scar remodeling. Studies have shown that expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production are decreased in human hypertrophic scar. However little is known about NO involvement in the early stages of hypertrophic scarring, because of the lack of an animal model. It was recently reported that the female red Duroc pig (FRDP) makes thick scar, which is similar to human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized that NO production in wounds on the female, red Duroc pig is similar to that of human hypertrophic scar and that NO involvement in deep wounds is different from that in superficial wounds. Methods: Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of four FRDPs. Biopsies were collected at weeks 1.5, 4, 8 and 21 post wounding including samples of uninjured skin. Nitric oxide levels were measured with the Griess reaction assay and normalized with tissue protein level. Results: Superficial wounds healed with an invisible scar whereas the deep wounds healed with scar resembling mild hypertrophic scar. The thickness of the scars from the deep wounds was significantly greater than uninjured skin and healed superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). NO levels were increased at 1.5 weeks in deep wounds compared to superficial wounds and uninjured skin (p?<?0.05). At 8 weeks, NO levels in deep wounds had returned to the level of uninjured tissue and superficial wounds. By 21 weeks, NO levels had decreased significantly when compared to superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). There were no differences in NO levels between uninjured skin and superficial wounds at any time point (p?>?0.05). Conclusions: NO production is similar in late, deep wounds on the female, red Duroc pig to that reported in the literature for human hypertrophic scar further validating this animal model. NO production is quite different after deep wounds as compared to superficial wounds in the FRDP. Early elevation in nitric oxide production might account for excessive inflammation in deep wounds that become thick scars in the FRDP. Nitric oxide regulators and effects at early stages of scar formation should be elucidated further and the FRDP appears to be a useful model.

AB  - Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection that often leaves patients with a large integumentary deficit to their penis and scrotum. Treatment of the skin defect has been described in a multitude of ways including split thickness skin grafting, burying the testes in the thighs, thigh flaps, and a variety of myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Many of the previously described techniques have worked well for smaller defects and for closure of wounds but fell short of aesthetic reconstruction of sexual organs. We describe a technique using split-thickness skin grafts with suction dressings or bolster. This was employed using the VAC?(Vacuum Assisted Closure Device, KCI?). This technique creates a natural appearing scrotum that holds the testes away from the body in a physiologic manner and surfaces the penis with a seemingly natural appearance in a functional manner. The technique provides a nearly 100% graft take and greatly decreases hospital length of stay. A case report demonstrates a patient?s full recovery to his professional, social, and sexual life within six weeks of initial reconstructive treatment. Our technique provides a reliable treatment with good functional and aesthetic outcomes to a difficult problem.

AB  - Celosia argentea is used in traditional medicine for sores, ulcers, and skin eruptions. Therefore, we investigated the healing efficiency of an ointment formulated on a alcohol extract of Celosia argentea leaves (CA) in a rat burn wound model. Wound closure occurred earlier in the treated rats (15 days versus 30 in the untreated group; P?<?0.05). Collagen and hexsoamine content of the granulation tissue increased at a faster rate in the treated wounds. To probe the cell biologic basis of this effect, we found that this extract promoted cell motility and proliferation of primary dermal fibroblasts but did not alter these responses in primary keratinocytes. In short, we demonstrate a salutary action of the Celosia argentea extract on wound healing and suggest that this may be due to mitogenic and motogenic promotion of dermal fibroblasts.

AB  - Introduction: Low-energy laser photostimuation has been reported to affect the proliferative phase of wound healing and stimulate macrophages. Light-emitting diodes (LED) are an efficient, inexpensive source of low energy photons. We propose that LED therapy will stimulate macrophage production of VEGF and NO. Methods: Serum-starved RAW 264.7 cells (5???105cells/ml) were treated with or without LPS (10?ng/ml) and IFN-gamma (100?Units/ml) for 24 hours. Cells were divided into groups: 1) control ? no LED, 2) 670?nm, 3) 730?nm, 4) 880?nm, and 5) combination (880?nm/730?nm/670?nm) at 4?J/cm2 per wavelength. Twenty-four hours post-LED, conditioned media was analyzed for VEGF (ELISA) and nitrites (Greiss assay). Proliferation was assessed using BrDU incorporation. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test. Results: In serum-starved cells, proliferation was unchanged by LED. VEGF and nitrite levels were increased in groups 4 (VEGF?=?1057.1?+/??100.3?pg/ml; nitrites?=?11.13?+/? 0.79?uM) and 5 (VEGF?=?1148.9?+/??88.5?pg/ml; nitrites?=?10.72?+/??1.03?uM) compared to control (VEGF?=?812.2?+/??94.8?pg/ml; nitrites?=?7.32?+/??1.92?uM). LPS/IFN decreased proliferation 25 percent at all wavelengths compared to control?+?LPS/IFN (p?<?0.01). Nitrite and VEGF levels were markedly elevated in all five LPS/IFN-treated groups with no appreciable intergroup differences. Conclusions: LPS/IFN stimulation resulted in maximally elevated levels of nitrites and VEGF, possibly masking the effects of LED. Serum-starved RAW 264.7 cells responded to LED treatment at 880?nm and combined wavelengths with increased VEGF and NO production. These results suggest that LED treatment at 880?nm and 880?nm/730?nm/670?nm may upregulate the production of pro-angiogenic factors by macrophages in the wound bed.

AB  - Transforming growth factor ?(TGF?) has both positive and negative effects on cutaneous wound healing. Smad7 acts as a major downstream antagonist of TGF? signaling in keratinocytes and its role in wound healing has not been defined. We have established a Smad7 transgenic mouse line using a keratin 5 (K5) promoter (K5.Smad7) which expresses Smad7 transgene at a mild level (?2 fold of the endogenous Smad7 in the skin). These mice did not have overt skin defects as shown from our previous Smad7 transgenic mice expressing much higher levels of the Smad7 transgene (EMBO J 2002, 21:2580?90). K5.Smad7 mice from the above low expressor line and non-transgenic littermates were subject to 6-mm full-thickness excisional wounding. K5.Smad7 mice exhibited early scab rejection, reduced inflammation, and accelerated re-epithelialization as compared to non-transgenic mice. To further determine the stage-specific effects of Smad7 on wound healing, we generated a transgenic model in which Smad7 transgene expression can be induced in the epidermis and hair follicles (gene-switch-Smad7) by topically RU486 application. Smad7 induction from day 3 to day 7 after excisional wounding reduced inflammatory responses through suppressing expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in gene-switch-Smad7 mice as compared to control mice. Meanwhile, overexpression of Smad7 exhibited accelerated re-epithelialization, which correlated with increased expression of metalloproteinases and elevated Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signaling in the leading epidermal edges in gene-switch-Smad7 wounds compared to control wounds. Smad7 induction from day 7 to day 20 after excisional wounding reduced dermal fibrotic response and angiogenesis in the dermis, resulting in a better tissue repair. We conclude that the effectsof Smad7 on wound healing are likely due to blocking the negative effects of TGF? on cutaneous wound healing.

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem, resulting in both adverse tissue form and function and the goal of therapeutic interventions is to reduce and prevent excessive scarring. We have demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus containing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (rAd-p21), inhibited scar formation by blocking cell cycle progression and attenuated cell proliferation at the wound site (Perkins et?al 2002). Recently, we have shown rAd-p21 specific antiproliferative effects on granulation tissue in vivo(Gu, et?al, manuscript submitted). Safety parameters using rAd-p21 for anti-scarring may include effects on wound strength and dehiscence of the wound. We tested effects of rAd-p21 on wound strength in vivo using tensile strength as an endpoint and included comparisons with other clinically relevant antiproliferative agents. Specifically, rAd-p21 at doses from 1???107 to 3.8???1010 particle (PN) per incision was administered intradermally to linear rat incisions and assayed 14?28 days post treatment. rAd-p21 mildly reduced tensile strength at high doses (≥3???1010PN), whereas low to moderate doses (1???107 to 1???1010PN) had no effect. Interestingly, all rAd-p21 treated wounds regained tensile strength indistinguishable from vehicle control, 4 weeks after treatment, suggesting that rAd-p21 wounds recover with time. An adenovirus control vector, not containing a gene (rAd-Empty), showed subtle reduction of tensile strength that was only statistically significant at day 21. This suggests that delivery of rAd-Empty alone in the wound has little effect on wound strength. Triamcinolone at 5?mg/mL/wound, 5-FU at 10?mg/mL/wound, and low doses of MMC did not significantly reduce tensile strength, although high doses of MMC (0.2?mg/mL/wound) severely reduced tensile strength which failed to recover after 28 days. Morphological analysis of all groups revealed necrosis only in the MMC treatment. This data suggests that rAd-p21 may reduce the hyperproliferative status in excessive scar formation with minimal effects on wound strength.

AB  - Introduction: Angiogenesis is thought to be important for granulation tissue formation and for the delivery oxygen and other nutrients to the healing wound bed. We examined whether angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) such as endostatin decrease neovascularization in full-thickness wounds leading to impaired granulation tissue formation and delayed wound closure. Methods: Endostatin at tumor-inhibiting doses (20?mg/kg/BID) was injected daily starting three days prior to surgery. Two full-thickness wounds were created on the mouse dorsum using a novel wound healing model developed in our lab. A second experimental group had topical VEGF (10??g/QD) applied to these wounds. Both groups were compared to PBS-treated controls. Wounds were analyzed for closure time, granulation tissue formation, and wound vascularity using CD31. Results: Endostatin-treatment delayed wound closure compared to control mice (17.4d?±?1.51 vs. 12.8?±?0.89, P?<?0.05), resulted in decreased granulation tissue formation at all time points (P?<?0.05), and significantly reduced wound vascularity as measured by CD31+ vessel counts (P?<?0.05). VEGF application to the wound bed of endostatin-treated mice normalized wound closure despite endostatin treatment (13.8d?±?1.1 vs. 17.44d?±?1.51, P?<?0.05). Conclusion: Endostatin impairs wound angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation and delays full-thickness wound closure. Topical VEGF was able to reverse this effect and may represent a novel approach to improve wound healing in patients receiving AI. These findings may have serious implications for patients undergoing AI treatment that require surgery or who have wound healing complications.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - Background: Physiological healing in acute wounds generally occurs by granulation from the wound base and by migration of epithelium from the wound edges toward the center of the wound in a uniform, concentric fashion. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) compared this phenomenon in acute wounds treated with standard care versus acute wounds pharmacologically stimulated with growth factor therapy. Methods: With informed consent, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. The biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel Q.D., ii) rhPDGF-BB Q.O.D., iii) daily rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). Wound morphology was carefully examined and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Results: There were distinct differences in the morphological pattern of healing seen between control wounds and growth factor-stimulated wounds. Acute wounds treated with bacitracin tended to heal in circumferential fashion, as predicted. Growth factor-stimulated wounds, by contrast, exhibited accentuated angiogenesis (granulation), with non-uniform epithelial islands streaming into the wound. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that rhPDGF-BB influences acute wound healing by promoting accelerated granulation and epithelialization. Accelerated healing is manifest by different healing morphologies. The biological basis for these differences requires further histological and molecular analyses.

AB  - The importance of controlling the bioburden in wounds can not be over emphasized. Glycerine based gel sheets have been used extensively to show their bacteriostatic/fungistatic properties. Hoekstra studied animal wounds and compared glycerine dressings with water based dressings and the glycerine showed superior bioburden reduction. Vandeputte showed similar results when comparing hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings and looked at the histology of the wounds to find differences in the quantities of the types of cells present. The reduced scar formation of wounds are thought to be attributed to the influence of the glycerine on the healing process. Hoestra has reported the dramatic reduction in the inflammation reaction soon after application of the glycerine gel dressing. Studies by Oliveria-Gandia, Davis, and Mertz showed the glycerine dressings to be more effective than hydrogel or hydrocolloid dressings in reducing bioburden in animal wounds that were inoculated with microbes and also reducing biocounts in appropriate growth medium. Vandeputte conducted a diabetic study(no exclusions) that compared the glycerine dressing (n?=?15) with standard protocol(n?=?14) for diabetic foot wounds, that showed the test dressing to be far superior. He along with thousands of other nurses around the world have reported the use of glycerine dressings on superficial burns to reduce pain, reduce the chance for infection, reduce scar formation, and to protect the wound from friction and pressure. J. Baksa extensively used the glycerine gel sheets in his burn unit not only for the superficial wounds but also for 3rd and 4th degree burns on children as well as after surgical removal of hypertrophic and keloid scars to prevent reoccurrence. T.M. Baum and M.J. Busuito also reported the use of the glycerine dressing for scar prevention and treatment. The glycerine dressing has been used extensively for te treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers in hospitals, nursing homes, athletic fields, as well as, under casts, splints and braces. R. Horchner reported a >95% reduction in pressure ulcers in a direct comparison to the control and to hydrocolloids.

AB  - Delayed wound healing is a common complication of diabetes resulting in significant clinical morbidity. The diabetic wound exhibits impaired cellular infiltration and consequently inadequate granulation tissue formation. Additionally, altered patterns of apoptosis. In this study, we have evaluated the differential gene expression pattern in transgenic diabetic female mice, 5?6 weeks old, in a full thickness cutaneous punch wound model. We assessed the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and differential gene expression pattern at 4th, 7th and 11th day post wounding. Supernatants obtained from diabetic wound tissue homogenates were subjected to zymogram analysis. The data showed that MMPs were expressed at higher level by 4th day post wounding, whereas expression of MMPs were down regulated towards the 11th day post wounding suggesting their role during early phase of wound healing. The pathway specific gene array data demonstrated differential regulation of several growth factors, transcription factors and other related genes such as fibroblast growth factors and their receptors, ID3 and restin respectively. The cytokine/extracellular matrix protein osteopontin (OPN), an important component of cellular immunity and inflammation also showed higher expression after 4 days post wounding. The expression of OPN remained at higher level after 11 days post wounding in diabetic mice, whereas the expression were down regulated to basal level in normal wounded animal suggesting that the expression of OPN was concomitant with the extent of healing. Other adhesion molecules such as integrin αV and PECAM-1 were also differentially regulated. Though a single gene may not be solely responsible for any defect or impairment in healing as it is a very tightly controlled and regulated process, however, a detailed study of these gene(s) may shed some light to the delayed healing in diabetic mice.

AB  - Peptides of the innate immune system play a vital role in the protection and repair of almost all biological systems. Such peptides have been implicated in a range of activities associated with prevention of disease and modulation of innate immunity. HB107 is a derivative of one such peptide, Cecropin B, that has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing wound healing in both burn and incision animal models. HB107 has been evaluated for efficacy in a mouse incision model and for safety and efficacy in a pig burn wound model. Topical application of the peptide gives RE50(time needed for 50% re-epithelialization) values of 10.28 days for 500?ug/mL and 12.72 days for 100?ug/mL compared to control 16.45 days. Additionally the peptide was well tolerated in terms of safety both topically and in an IV acute toxicity mouse model with no adverse effects observed. HB107 not only demonstrated efficacy and safety, but due to being a relatively short synthetic peptide, costs significantly less to manufacture than the current approved therapies.

AB  - Macrophages serve as the coordinators of the wound healing process. Since 1998 following the Israeli Ministry of health authorization, macrophage suspensions have been used for the treatment of ulcers, in more than 800 elderly and paraplegic patients suffering from decubital chronic ulcers. As previously published, a significant number of genes showed increased levels of expression in hypo-osmotic shock activated cells, using DNA microarrays technique. The majority of these genes are considered to be directly involved in the macrophage function and in the wound healing process. Macrophge suspensions are prepared from a whole blood unit of healthy, young volunteer blood donors in a closed, sterile system, as previously described. The activated cells are applied to the wounds either by local injection or by direct deposition to the wound. Between January 2000 and October 2003, 112 patients with postoperative sternal wound infection were treated with macrophage suspension. Full closure of the wounds was achieved in 104 (93%) of the patients. Original wound surface area 8?175?cm2 (mean 93) Days until treatment 6?180 (mean 47) Days until 50% closure 6?60 (mean 21) Days until full closure 10?138 (mean 49) No side effects were noted. The use of macrophage suspension is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that reduces risk of complications and morbidity and improves the quality of life for long -suffering patients. Length and cost of hospital stay may be reduced, as the treatment requires no hospitalization.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) transiently expresses in acute wound. In non-healed wounds, MMP-9 together with other proteinases persistently elevate, which may lead excessive ECM degradation and failure of wound closure. To understand the molecular regulation of MMP-9 we investigated the signal transduction for TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9 by dermal fibroblasts. TNF-alpha initiates three major signal pathways including NF-11B, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. On the other hand, Rho-GTPase plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, angiogenesis, and mitosis. It remains unknown if the ?cross talk? of these signals having a role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we found that over expression of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) specifically attenuates TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9. However, TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-3 and proMMP-2 activation was intact. NF-?B signal is regarded as a common pathway for many MMPs. Indeed, PAK did not affect TNF-alpha mediated degradation of Ikappa B, suggesting additional signal is targeted by PAK. In contrast, MMP-3 but not MMP-9 expression is specifically blocked by p38 MAK. Thus TNF-alpha induced expression of multiple MMPs in wound healing may utilize different intracellular signal pathways.

AB  - In order to closely mimic the actual mechanism of wound debridement by an enzymatic debriding agent, a synthetic wound eschar substrate (SWES) has been developed. The SWES is prepared by the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of fibrous bovine collagen and elastin, to form an insoluble planar matrix composed of the three major proteins present in wound eschar. Each of the proteinaceous components is uniquely labeled prior to formation of SWES with different dye, and the debridement test is conducted using a Franz Diffusion System. The debriding agent is applied to the SWES mounted on the donor compartment of the cell, and the digested hydrolysate containing dye-labeled peptide fragments is sampled from the receptor compartment. Accordingly, the progress of digestion is obtained in real time. Since the three proteins are labeled with spectrally distinct dyes, data on the hydrolysis of the substrates can be collected simultaneously. This method facilitates the testing of formulated debriding products in a manner that closely mimics application to a wound and provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of formulated enzymatic debriding agents.

AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used adjunctively to treat chronic, non-healing wounds. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production during HBO is suggested as an important mechanism that promotes enhanced wound healing. The purpose of this study is the documentation of NO production during and following HBO treatments (txs). Diabetic and non-diabetic patients receiving HBO therapy (20?txs; 2.0ATA???90?min) provided wound fluid and fasting plasma and urine specimens for nitrate (NOx) determinations. Nitrate measurements were obtained prior to HBO (baseline), after 10 and 20?txs, and at one and four weeks following HBO completion. In patients healing after HBO baseline plasma NOx ranged between 17.7 and 33.20??M. At 10?txs plasma NOx increased >50% to between 35.8?43.5??M. At 20?txs plasma NOx decreased to between 22.3?35.5??M. Healing diabetic patient plasma NOx increased after HBO reaching 170% of baseline at one month (57.8?±?0.15??M). Plasma NOx of healing non-diabetic patients decreased to baseline levels at one month after HBO. Urine NOx values mirrored those of plasma NOx; wound fluid NOx elevations were delayed compared to plasma and urine. Conversely, non-healing HBO patients did not demonstrate the early, significant elevations of plasma NOx after 10?txs. This study documents, for the first time, an early (10?txs), significant elevation of plasma and urine NOx after HBO that is associated with successful healing in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. A similar early increase in plasma and urine NOx was not observed in patients not responding to HBO therapy. These findings suggest that HBO-mediated increased NO production plays a critical role in the correction of impaired wound healing in selected patients. Furthermore, early plasma and urine NOx determinations after HBO therapy may prove valuable in the prediction of the clinical outcome of treatment.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium cultured from infected wounds. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral arterial disease would be patient predictors of severe outcomes, defined as amputation, sepsis, or death, and infections caused by resistant strains would be bacterial predictors of severe outcomes. Methods: With IRB approval, 50 S. aureus strains (45 wound, 5 central line) were isolated during routine clinical care. Investigations included antibiotic resistance (>5?mcg/ml), and PCR for STAR elements. Chart review included wound type, location, relevant comorbidities, antibiotic resistance, and outcome. Results: Outcome n(%of outcome total) Severe All others Total Diabetic 7 (70) 6 (17) 13 (29) Non-diabetic 3 (30) 29 (83) 32 (71) MRSA STAR groups 2 (20) 8 (23) 10 (22) All other STAR 8 (80) 27 (77) 35 (78) MRSA 4 (40) 8 (23) 12 (27) MSSA 6 (60) 27 (77) 33 (73) Total patients 10 (22) 35 (78) 45 No non-DM patient with arterial disease (n?=?6) had a poor outcome. Conclusions: The strongest predictor of outcome was the presence of DM. Patients with severe outcomes were slightly more likely to have MRSA infection, although only 33% of patients with MRSA had severe outcomes. Although STAR/arsRBC groups have been shown previously to predict antibiotic resistance, in this collection there was no correlation between these molecular markers and outcome. This study shows that the strongest predictor of clinical outcome in wound infection is patient-dependent, while bacterial factors appear to play a lesser role.

AB  - Caspases are a family of at least 14 highly conserved aspartate proteases that are the major effector arm of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Previous immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have implicated two of the family members, caspase 3 and caspase 14, as having a role in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation. Reepithelialization of epidermal defects after wounding requires coordination between signals that initiate growth and migration as well as signals that initiate differentiation. We therefore examined the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 14 in the epidermis of early (up to 48 hour) human wounds. Two excisional wounds were created on the inner arm using a 3?mm biopsy punch and allowed to heal via secondary intention. Wounds were excised at 24 and 48 hours using a 6?mm biopsy punch, placed in OCT, frozen, cryosectioned and immunohistochemically labeled using affinity purified antisera for caspases 3, 9 and 14. At 24 hours, the distribution of caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression was unchanged from non-wounded skin. Caspase 3 was found in the upper differentiating cells of the granular layer, while caspase 9 was expressed in scattered dendritic cells in the epidermis. At 48 hours, caspase 3 expression was lost in the epithelial tongue, while caspase 9 expression was found in keratinocytes at the tip of the migrating tongue. Caspase 14 expression at 24 hours was noted at the tip of the migrating epithelial tongue, while at 48 hours, the normal expression of caspase 14 in the granular layer was lost. These results suggest that in 48 hour wounds, loss of caspase 3 and 14 expression in the migrating epithelium reflects the activated state of this tissue. The onset of caspase 9 expression at 48 hours in the leading edge of the wound suggests a role for caspase 9 in wound remodeling, as caspase 9 is known to participate in tissue remodeling during development. Characterization of the caspases involved during wound healing may lead to future therapies utilizng caspases or caspase inhibitors in situations of poor or aberrant wound healing.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.
