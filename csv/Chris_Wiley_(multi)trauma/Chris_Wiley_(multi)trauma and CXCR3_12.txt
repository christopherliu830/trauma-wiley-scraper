AB  - Leptin is a pleiotropic cytokine constitutively expressed in adipose tissue and upregulated by hypoxia in sites of tissue injury and in the placenta. Leptin has been demonstrated to play a role in normal and pathological wound healing and it is gene is acutely expressed in experimental wounds. Angiogenesis is among the most salient and well-documented biological actions of leptin. Therefore it was hypothesized that leptin may play in the modulation of wound neovascularization. Using a murine model of experimental wounds the modulation of wound angiogenesis was investigated by treatment of the wounds to either recombinant leptin or a neutralizing anti-leptin antibody. The parameters measured were: a)woundblood flow using laser Doppler imaging; b)vesseldensity by counting the number of CD-31 positive vessels in wound sections; c)angiogenic transcriptionalprofiling using quantitative real-time RT-PCR; and d)validation of transcriptionalprofiling by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The treatment of wounds with leptin had a marked effect in wound blood flow that was most significant at 24hours post-wounding with average increase of 55% with respect to the controls. The effect diminished significantly by 72 hours (24%) and became negligible thereafter. Leptin also accelerate wound neovascularization by 24 hours where the number of small caliber vessels averaged 30/mm2 in leptin treated vessels and 13/mm2 in the controls (n?=?10; P?<?0.005). However, the number of vessels measured by 72 hours not significantly different between controls and leptin-treated wounds. In addition transcriptional profiling reveled changes in gene expression of molecules related to angiogenesis such as VEGF, PlGF, Tie-1, Tie-2, Flt-1, Flk-1, FGF-2 and endothelial markers like CD-31, endoglin and eNOS. Overall, time course analysis throughout the healing process showed that leptin treatment induced an early shift in the expression of many of the analyzed transcripts. The most salient changes could be observed as early as 6 hours post-wounding and included: TSP-1 (+8.7); FLK-1(+9); Ang-2 (+18); CD31(+5.3); endoglin (+7.6); eNOS (+4.2); FGF-2 (+4.3); etc. Leptin mRNA was also significantly increased (+10) as well as the long-form of its receptor ObR-b (+9). Conversely, when wounds were exposed to anti-leptin antibodies, healing progression was impaired and changes in the transcriptional profile showed diminished expression of several genes related to wound neovascularization. Some examples by 24 hours: Endoglin(?2.5); Flk-1(?2.8); eNOS (?5.1); Ang-2 (?5.1); CD31(?3); VEGF-A (?3.6). In conclusion, leptin had and early and significant effect in modulating wound neovascularization. The effect of treatment of wounds with exogenous leptin did not elicit hypervascularization of the wound and appeared to only accelerate what appeared to be a self-limited process of wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Introduction: One of the earliest events in wound healing and scar formation is the inflammatory phase. Deficient or excessive inflammatory responses result in aberrant healing. NFK-b is a transcription factor that regulates key genes responsible for multiple intra-nuclear inflammatory cytokines. When bound to IK-B, an inhibitory protein, this factor is in an inactive state. We studied the wound healing effects of irreversibly inhibiting the activation of NFK-b by continuously infusing adenoviral activated IK-B. Methods: Seventy-five male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponge-osmotic pump constructs. The pumps were filled with a solution containing a genetically altered adenovirus containing the DNA for continuously activated IK-B protein. 50??l of viral transport media containing 5???109 PFU of virus were delivered to each individual sponges daily. Controls included pumps filled with normal saline in one group or filled with sham virus in another group. Sponges were harvested on days 1,3,5, and 7 post-implantation. The sponges were analyzed for TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) levels, as index of inflammation, as well as for hydroxyproline (OHP) content at seven days, an index of collagen deposition. Results: Treatment with the IK-B virus resulted in significantly higher levels of OHP after seven days when compared to normal saline and sham virus treated sponges (654?±?81 vs 546?±?109 vs 498?±?123??g OHP/100?mg sponge, P?<?0.05 by ANOVA). Wound fluid NO concentration was significantly lower in the IkB group after 5 days (38?±?15 vs 55?±?12 vs 71?±?27??M, P?<?0.05 by chi-square). There were no differences in sponge TNF-α concentrations on days 1,3, and 5. Conclusions: Treatment of wound sponge granulomas with IK-B increases the amount of collagen deposition after seven days. Reduction of inflammation by inhibiting NF-KB may be a possible mechanism of action, as reflected in decreased NO wound content.

AB  - Introduction. We have demonstrated that wounds treated with adenoviral overexpression of Il-10 (AdIl-10) heal scarlessly, resembling fetal wound healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is elevated in fetal wounds. We hypothesized that IL-10 creates a permissive environment for scarless healing through the differential mediation of hyaluronic acid synthases (Has1?3).?Methods. Adult C57 mice (n?=?24) were pretreated with 5???108 PFU AdIL-10, AdLacz, or PBS. 48?hrs post-injection, 2-cm incisional wounds were created at the site of injection. Wounds harvested at 1, 3, and 5 days were analyzed for mRNA transcript levels of Has 1?3 and GAPDH via RT-PCR and band densitometry. Data expressed as signal intensity ratio relative to GAPDH?±?SEM. ?Results. The three Has transcripts were expressed after pre-treatment and wounding at day 1, 3, and 5. At day 1, there is no significant difference in Has mRNA levels. At Day 3, Has1 transcript levels are significantly decreased in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. (Il-10 0.28?±?0.04; LacZ 0.53?±?0.06; PBS 0.43?±?0.43, p?<?0.005) At Day 5, there was a significant increase in Has1 transcript levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds compared to controls. (Il-10 0.82?±?0.08; LacZ 0.41?±?0.06; PBS 0.57?±?0.03, p?<?0.005) At Day 3 and 5, there was no significant difference in Has2 and Has3 levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. ?Conclusions. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of Il-10 results in the differential expression of Has1 at day 3 and 5. Has1 encodes for high molecular weight HA, which is associated with inhibition of angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltrates as observed in the HA-rich environment of fetal wounds. The effects of AdIl-10 may in part be due to the differential expression of Has1 creating a permissive environment for fetal-like scarless wound repair.

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that psychological stress impairs wound healing. Catecholamines released in response to stress could cause vascular changes that would restrict oxygen delivery to the healing wound. Hence, we hypothesized that stress impairs healing by disrupting oxygen balance in the wounds. 6?8 week, female SKH-1 mice were subjected to stress by confinement in well-ventilated 50-ml conical tubes. Stressing was done three days prior to wounding and five days post wounding, during the active cycle of the mice. Wounds were placed using a standard, 3.5?mm-diameter biopsy punch. Each mouse received two wounds on their dorsum, behind their shoulder blades. Wound oxygenation was measured by EPR oximetry. Gene expression was measured by real time PCR. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist was used in conjunction with EPR oximetry to determine catecholamine-mediated modulation of wound oxygenation during healing. Our results on the effects of stress on wound healing were consistent with previous results in the model, and showed 19%? 30% larger wounds in the stressed animals when compared to controls. Oxygen levels in the wounds showed a 17.49 to 34.38%(p?<?0.001) decrease in the stressed animals on days 1 through 5 post wounding. Furthermore, gene expression studies of a hypoxia driven gene, iNOS, showed an increase in expression on days 1 (205%; p?<?0.0003), 3(96%; p?<?0.04) and 5 (249%; p?<?0.0003). eNOS expression increased by 66%(p?<?0.02) on day 1 post-wounding, with no significant difference in nNOS expression. Phentolamine ameliorated the effect of stress on wound oxygenation on day 1 post wounding. These findings show that stress-impaired healing is associated with reduced tissue oxygen and altered expression of a hypoxia-induced gene. Furthermoe, the data suggests a role for catecholamines in stress-induced impairment of wound oxygenation during early healing.

AB  - Background: The study of wound biology and effects of advanced modalities would benefit from a reliable human model for normal healing. Eaglstein et?al. previously suggested that the forearm biopsy may be useful in acute wound healing studies (J Am Acad Dermatol 45:857, 2001). The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) here validates this model in healthy individuals treated with topical growth factor therapy. Methods: In our randomized, double-blinded study design, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel (Q.D.), ii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.O.D.), iii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). The wounds were examined, measured and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events were monitored. Rates of healing and time-to-complete closure were measured. Repeat biopsies of a subset of healing wounds were performed for gene microarray analysis. Results: The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of acute wound healing outcomes achieved by rhPDGF-BB regimens versus standard care alone. There were no infectious complications. Subject compliance was excellent with?<?3% of visits missed. Conclusion: The forearm biopsy model has several advantages in the study of acute wounds: it allows for comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion; studies can be conducted easily with good patient compliance; and the forearm allows for repeat imaging and tissue harvesting for gene profiling during healing.

AB  - The importance of stromal-epithelial interactions in wound healing is well established. These interactions likely involve autocrine and paracrine action of multiple growth factors, including members of the TGF-ß family. TGF-ß1, ß2 and ß3 isoforms signal by sequentially binding to the TGF-ß type II and type I receptors, respectively. We address the role of TGF-ß signaling in dermal fibroblasts using a conditional fibroblastic TGF-ß type II receptor knockout mouse model (termed FßKO). We found that the loss of TGF-ß signaling in the dermal fibroblasts results in accelerated excision-wound closure compared with similar wounds in wild type mice. The mechanism of the altered rate of re-epitheliaization in the FßKO mice was examined with regard to keratiocyte motility and proliferation. The migration of keratinocytes through collagen I coated 8??m pore filters in the presence or absence of fibroblast-conditioned media was tested. These experiments showed increased keratinocyte migration when incubated with FßKO dermal fibroblast conditioned media compared to media conditioned in wild type fibroblasts. Immuno-histochemical staining of paraffin embedded intact skin indicated both wild type and FßKO mice had similar low levels of keratinocyte proliferation, based on Ki67 staining. In healing wounds, only the distal wound edges of wild type mice were proliferative. In contrast, the FßKO mice exhibited elevated proliferation across the length of the wound, including the leading edge of epithelial closure. Together our results suggest TGF-ß signaling by the dermal fibroblasts suppresses re-epithelialization of excision wounds by regulating keratinocyte motility and proliferation through paracrine mechanisms. ?

AB  - Aim : An antimicrobial dressing that combines high absorbency and potent antimicrobial properties. The unique composition of the dressing manages exudates in moderate to heavily exuding, infected or critically colonised wounds, which creates a favourable environment for effective wound management. Methods : Two test methods were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the dressing: 1) A zone of inhibition sensitivity test that challenges the dressing to a seeded agar plate and 2) A log reduction test that exposes a small sample of dressing against a high bacterial loaded broth, measuring the log reduction of the bacteria over a specified time period. The absorbency of the dressing was evaluated using British Pharmacopoeia test methods. Results : The antimicrobial dressing has been shown to be highly effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans and also against resistant organisms MRSE, MRSA and VRE. The product is highly absorbent with absorbency?>?16?g/g and 16?g/m2.

AB  - Elderly hospital patients have ample exposure to situations and procedures that may increase their pressure ulcer risk. The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in elderly medical patients and to determine whether the risk of pressure ulcers is associated with longer emergency department (ED) stays, lengthy procedures in the ED, or use of immobilizing restraints, medications, or devices in the ED. The study cohort was made up of 3,233 patients aged 65 or over admitted through the EDs of two Philadelphia hospitals. Sixty-five percent of subjects were aged 80 or more, 61% were female, and 69% were Black. The incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers on Day 3 of the hospital stay, as ascertained by direct skin examination, was 6.2%. There were 266 hospital-acquired pressure ulcers among 201 patients (mean per patient 1.3 pressure ulcers) 27% of the pressure ulcers were stage 1, 54% were stage 2, and the remainder were stages 3 or 4 or could not be staged. The median length of stay in the ED was 6.6 hours. The association between hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and extrinsic risk factors will be presented. The identification of potentially modifiable risk factors may lead to the development of effective interventions to prevent hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.

AB  - Introduction: Thermal injury to the female breast is one of the most challenging aspects of aesthetic burn surgery today. As the ability to provide coverage for large body surface injuries has progressed greatly in recent years; attention can now be directed towards achieving aesthetically pleasing results. Breast reconstruction in the burn patient can be accomplished in several ways. In planning the reconstruction, one must account for gender, age, and stage of breast development at the time of injury. The following is the treatment protocol utilized at our institution. After determining the level of injury the injured area is cleansed and treated with topical anti-microbial agents such as Silvadene. If the decision is made to excise and graft the injured area one of two algorithms is followed. The first choice involves excising the burn and placing a split thickness skin graft to the area involved. This is done by placing a sheet graft and using aerosolized fibrin sealant to affix it to the wound bed. If the burn involves deeper elements of tissue then a second approach is taken which includes excision of the burn down to the level of fascia with preservation of the breast mounds and the nipple areola complex (NAR). The (NAR) is spared excision and allowed to heal. Reconstruction of the (NAR) can be deferred for a secondary procedure depending upon the response to primary healing. A split thickness skin graft is then applied to the area of injury. Again a sheet graft is preferred and fibrin sealant is utilized to improve graft fixation and contour. We attribute our excellent results to the sheet grafts and fibrin sealant used. It should be noted that the increased vascularity of the breast fat when compared to fat located elsewhere in the body allows the grafts to adhere and survive on this generally difficult to graft surface. Methods: We identified five female patients at our institution over the last 18 months with thermal injuries to the breasts. Each patient was placed into one of the two treatment algorithms. Results: The five patients had excellent outcomes. Breast mounds and symmetry were preserved. Further development of the breast was allowed in each patient. One patient even underwent a breast augmentation after surviving a 50% TBSA injury. Proper use of fibrin sealant and sheet grafts account for the excellent results seen at this institution. Conclusion: Following careful evaluation of the burned female breast cosmetically and functionally acceptable results can be attained when following our institution?s protocol for breast reconstruction in the female burn victim.

Biopsy failed to reveal malignancy and confirmed stasis changes. Treatment was ongoing including compression therapy, local debridements, and moist wound healing, off-loading, and nutritional support. The wound remained free of infection. Due to the continued recalcitrant nature of the lesion multiple applications of Dermagraft were utilized to augment healing. Results: The researcher observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue. Conclusions: Dermagraft appears to augment healing in patients with venous ulcers and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgements: Smith & Nephew Wound Management, Largo, Fl.

AB  - The use of adjunctive peri-wound, ultrasound with either a 1?MgHz or 3?MgHz frequency has been reported on in the literature with variable results. MIST ultrasound therapy is a novel application of direct wound bed application of kilohertz ultrasound waves utilizing a normal saline mist as the coupling mechanism, allowing for no direct patient contact. The mist generated by the system is of relative uniform particle size and acts as a conduit of ultrasound energy. Unlike ultrasonic baths, which dissipate the vibrational energy over a large area, the transducer horn focuses the energy into a smaller area of application. The MIST? system consists of an ultrasonic power supply (generator), a transducer (or alternately referred to as the converter), and an applicator coupled to the transducer. The generator converts voltage to high frequency electrical energy. This electrical energy is transmitted to the piezoelectric transducer within the converter, where it is changed to mechanical vibrations. The generator is designed to operate the converter at 40?kHz with a distal displacement of 60 microns. Published reports have described various biological effects of low frequency ultrasound including VEGF and PDGF production, increased protein synthesis, improved bone and wound healing. Other authors have published abstracts demonstrating clinical efficacy of this device on a broad range of patients with recalcitrant wounds. This report describes the clinical results of a prospective, non-randomized, efficacy trial, adding MIST ultrasound therapy to current treatment protocols in recalcitrant wounds. Wound healing trajectories before and after treatment will be evaluated and wound healing will be assessed with laser Doppler image analysis and trans-cutaneous oximetry.

AB  - Background: More than three quarters of patients with a connective tissue disorder will develop secondary Raynauld?s disease. This more severe form of the Raynauld?s can lead to digital ischemia, tissue loss and may even result in the need for amputation of one or more digits. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor currently approved for use in vascular disease of the lower extremities. Case History: In August of 2002 a 62 year old female pianist with scleroderma presented to the wound clinic with a two year history of intractable digital pain secondary to ischemic ulcerations of the index, long and ring fingers of the right hand. She suffered from secondary Raynauld?s disease. Prior unsuccessful treatments included warming the hands, calcium channel blockade, anticoagulation, topical xylocaine and narcotic analgesics. In August of 2002 cilostazol was started at 100mg BID. Wound care consisted of serial debridement, moist wound healing and topical rhPDGF. Results: Four weeks into treatment the patient?s narcotic requirement decreased substantially and the fingers had a pink appearance. The ring finger healed after eight weeks. At three months the patient discontinued narcotic pain medication. Nine months into treatment the index finger had healed and she resumed playing the piano. The long finger finally healed one year after she initially presented to the wound clinic. Conclusion: Cilostazol may be an important adjunct in the treatment of secondary Raynauld?s disease particularly when digital ischemia has developed.

AB  - Hydration of keratinocytes modifies the levels of cytokines they secrete, which in turn impacts the secretory behaviour of dermal fibroblasts. In an in vitro coculture model, conditioned media (CM) collagen content was decreased 44% when keratinocytes were hydrated. We hypothesized that this is partly due to increased MMP-activity. We used the same coculture model to study changes in MMP-activity and TIMP secreted by keratinocytes as well as by fibroblasts in monoculture and in coculture in relation to air-treatment or hydration of keratinocytes. Stratified human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and confluent human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were cocultured for 72?h under serum-free conditions. HEK were either kept at the air-interface or hydrated. CM was assayed for MMP-1, ?2, ?9, TIMP-1 and ?2 were assayed using zymograms, western blotting, and ELISA. MMP-1, secreted by both cell types, increased significantly in cocultures compared to monocultures (4-fold in the air-treated group, 26-fold in the hydrated group). MMP-2, secreted mainly by HDFs, was significantly increased by coculture (hydration: 2.4-fold, air: 2.8-fold). MMP-9, predominantly secreted by air-treated HEKs and was significantly decreased in hydrated monoculture (76%) and coculture. HEK-monoculture hydration also significant decreased MMP-1 (86%) and MMP-2 (81%) activity. HDF-secreted TIMP-1 expression was significantly increased by coculture and was unaffected by hydration. Our findings demonstrate that paracrine interactions between HEK and HDF modify MMP activity and that HEK hydration significantly effects on MMP activity. The findings provide insight into the role of hydration on HEK and HDF ctivity during the wound healing process.

AB  - In order to closely mimic the actual mechanism of wound debridement by an enzymatic debriding agent, a synthetic wound eschar substrate (SWES) has been developed. The SWES is prepared by the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of fibrous bovine collagen and elastin, to form an insoluble planar matrix composed of the three major proteins present in wound eschar. Each of the proteinaceous components is uniquely labeled prior to formation of SWES with different dye, and the debridement test is conducted using a Franz Diffusion System. The debriding agent is applied to the SWES mounted on the donor compartment of the cell, and the digested hydrolysate containing dye-labeled peptide fragments is sampled from the receptor compartment. Accordingly, the progress of digestion is obtained in real time. Since the three proteins are labeled with spectrally distinct dyes, data on the hydrolysis of the substrates can be collected simultaneously. This method facilitates the testing of formulated debriding products in a manner that closely mimics application to a wound and provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of formulated enzymatic debriding agents.

AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used adjunctively to treat chronic, non-healing wounds. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production during HBO is suggested as an important mechanism that promotes enhanced wound healing. The purpose of this study is the documentation of NO production during and following HBO treatments (txs). Diabetic and non-diabetic patients receiving HBO therapy (20?txs; 2.0ATA???90?min) provided wound fluid and fasting plasma and urine specimens for nitrate (NOx) determinations. Nitrate measurements were obtained prior to HBO (baseline), after 10 and 20?txs, and at one and four weeks following HBO completion. In patients healing after HBO baseline plasma NOx ranged between 17.7 and 33.20??M. At 10?txs plasma NOx increased >50% to between 35.8?43.5??M. At 20?txs plasma NOx decreased to between 22.3?35.5??M. Healing diabetic patient plasma NOx increased after HBO reaching 170% of baseline at one month (57.8?±?0.15??M). Plasma NOx of healing non-diabetic patients decreased to baseline levels at one month after HBO. Urine NOx values mirrored those of plasma NOx; wound fluid NOx elevations were delayed compared to plasma and urine. Conversely, non-healing HBO patients did not demonstrate the early, significant elevations of plasma NOx after 10?txs. This study documents, for the first time, an early (10?txs), significant elevation of plasma and urine NOx after HBO that is associated with successful healing in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. A similar early increase in plasma and urine NOx was not observed in patients not responding to HBO therapy. These findings suggest that HBO-mediated increased NO production plays a critical role in the correction of impaired wound healing in selected patients. Furthermore, early plasma and urine NOx determinations after HBO therapy may prove valuable in the prediction of the clinical outcome of treatment.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium cultured from infected wounds. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral arterial disease would be patient predictors of severe outcomes, defined as amputation, sepsis, or death, and infections caused by resistant strains would be bacterial predictors of severe outcomes. Methods: With IRB approval, 50 S. aureus strains (45 wound, 5 central line) were isolated during routine clinical care. Investigations included antibiotic resistance (>5?mcg/ml), and PCR for STAR elements. Chart review included wound type, location, relevant comorbidities, antibiotic resistance, and outcome. Results: Outcome n(%of outcome total) Severe All others Total Diabetic 7 (70) 6 (17) 13 (29) Non-diabetic 3 (30) 29 (83) 32 (71) MRSA STAR groups 2 (20) 8 (23) 10 (22) All other STAR 8 (80) 27 (77) 35 (78) MRSA 4 (40) 8 (23) 12 (27) MSSA 6 (60) 27 (77) 33 (73) Total patients 10 (22) 35 (78) 45 No non-DM patient with arterial disease (n?=?6) had a poor outcome. Conclusions: The strongest predictor of outcome was the presence of DM. Patients with severe outcomes were slightly more likely to have MRSA infection, although only 33% of patients with MRSA had severe outcomes. Although STAR/arsRBC groups have been shown previously to predict antibiotic resistance, in this collection there was no correlation between these molecular markers and outcome. This study shows that the strongest predictor of clinical outcome in wound infection is patient-dependent, while bacterial factors appear to play a lesser role.

AB  - Caspases are a family of at least 14 highly conserved aspartate proteases that are the major effector arm of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Previous immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have implicated two of the family members, caspase 3 and caspase 14, as having a role in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation. Reepithelialization of epidermal defects after wounding requires coordination between signals that initiate growth and migration as well as signals that initiate differentiation. We therefore examined the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 14 in the epidermis of early (up to 48 hour) human wounds. Two excisional wounds were created on the inner arm using a 3?mm biopsy punch and allowed to heal via secondary intention. Wounds were excised at 24 and 48 hours using a 6?mm biopsy punch, placed in OCT, frozen, cryosectioned and immunohistochemically labeled using affinity purified antisera for caspases 3, 9 and 14. At 24 hours, the distribution of caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression was unchanged from non-wounded skin. Caspase 3 was found in the upper differentiating cells of the granular layer, while caspase 9 was expressed in scattered dendritic cells in the epidermis. At 48 hours, caspase 3 expression was lost in the epithelial tongue, while caspase 9 expression was found in keratinocytes at the tip of the migrating tongue. Caspase 14 expression at 24 hours was noted at the tip of the migrating epithelial tongue, while at 48 hours, the normal expression of caspase 14 in the granular layer was lost. These results suggest that in 48 hour wounds, loss of caspase 3 and 14 expression in the migrating epithelium reflects the activated state of this tissue. The onset of caspase 9 expression at 48 hours in the leading edge of the wound suggests a role for caspase 9 in wound remodeling, as caspase 9 is known to participate in tissue remodeling during development. Characterization of the caspases involved during wound healing may lead to future therapies utilizng caspases or caspase inhibitors in situations of poor or aberrant wound healing.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Burns have been associated with high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines which promote systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), immunosuppression and sepsis for which no effective treatment is currently available. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system and enhance adaptive immunity. We have examined the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1?-(IL-1?), gamma-interferon (IFN?) and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNFα) on human ?-defensin-2 (HBD-2) levels in cultured keratinocytes. We have also examined the effects of heat shock at 42?°C. Our results demonstrate that only TNFα shows significant induction of HBD-2 but this induction was not sustained in the long term. In addition, endogenous levels of defensin were significantly reduced by exposure to heat shock. The keratinocytes also responded to IL-1? by becoming hypertrophic. These results indicate that stress-related, pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce keratinocytes to synthesize HBD-2, while heat shock appears to reduce its production. Understanding the roles cytokines play in the continued problems associated with severe wounding, and in particular, major burn injury, is important. This study provides further insight into the role of natural anti-microbial peptides under conditions of stress.

AB  - Methods to reliably measure tissue oxygenation in situ are currently lacking. We have developed a vertically oriented, dorsal, bipedicle flap model that is easy to perform, reliably reproduces tissue ischemia, eliminates craniocaudal variation, and is amenable to studying therapeutic modalities. The effect of narrowing this flap on tissue oxygenation measured with Licox electrodes has previously been presented. In this study we utilize in situ EPR spectroscopy to demonstrate the oxygen gradient in the flap as a function of flap width and placement of a silicone sheet directly under the flap. The effect of wound healing over a 2 week period is demonstrated. Twenty four, 300?gm male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the bipedicle flap according to the following groups: 2.5?cm flap with silicone, 2.0?cm flap without silicone, 2.0?cm flap with silicone. Each group of 6 animals was injected with EMS char at 2?cm intervals along the flap and one injection in the control, non-ischemic tissue. A 4th group underwent 2.0?cm flaps with silicone and use of lithium phthalocyanin as the paramagnetic material. Wound measurements and EPR spectroscopy were performed on days 3, 7, 10 and 14. On day 14, after EPR measurements, the animals were sacrificed and their wounds excised. One flap and one control wound were preserved for histologic analysis, the other flap and control wounds were prepared for lactate measurements. EPR spectroscopy demonstrated a gradient of oxygen that was lowest in the center of the flap and greatest at either end. Changes in the oxygen gradient correlated with narrowing and placement of the intervening silicone sheet. This new technology has never been utilized in an animal model of impaired wound healing. Comparison of recently developed paramagnetic materials for optimal tissue oxygen and free radical measurements will be presented.
