AB  - Gap junctions and their connexin components are indispensable in mediating the cellular coordination required for tissue and organ homeostasis. The critical nature of their existence mandates a connection to disease while at the same time offering therapeutic potential. Therapeutic intervention may be offered through the pharmacological and molecular disruption of the pathways involved in connexin biosynthesis, gap junction assembly, stabilization, or degradation. Chemical inhibitors aimed at closing connexin channels, peptide mimetics corresponding to short connexin sequences, and gene therapy approaches have been incredibly useful molecular tools in deciphering the complexities associated with connexin biology. Recently, therapeutic potential in targeting connexins has evolved from basic research in cell-based models to clinical opportunity in the form of human trials. Clinical promise is particularly evident with regards to targeting connexin43 in the context of wound healing. The following review is aimed at highlighting novel advances where the pharmacological manipulation of connexin biology has proven beneficial in animals or humans.

AB  - Objective:? Prevalence of textile dye contact dermatitis (TD-CD) are lacking in many countries. Our aim is to know the frequency of TD-CD in three different areas of Spain. Methods:? 100 patients were tested with Spanish standard series and the five most frequent TD in each city. D. Orange 1, D. Orange 3, D. Blue 35, D. Blue 106, D. Blue 124 were included in Murcia and Seville, and the three last and D. Red 1, D. Red 17 in Santiago. Results:? 23/300 (15 women and 8 men) were positives to one or more TD. D. Blue 124 was the most frequent allergen (18/300), followed by D. Blue 106 (17/300). D. Red 1, D. Red 17 and D. Orange 1 were positives in 2/200. D. Orange 3 and D. Blue 35 were positives in 1/200. Eczema was located on hands in 13 cases. Clinical picture was variable. Origin of sensitization was clothing and occupational. Relevance was obtained in 20/23 cases. Conclusions:? The study confirm an high frequency of disperse dye allergy in Spain with a very different prevalence in the three areas: Seville 14%, Murcia 5% and Santiago 4%, that are probably due to social and cultural factors. We recommend the inclusion of D. Blue 106, D. Blue 124, D. Blue 35, D. Red 1, D. Red 17, D. Orange 1 and D. Orange 3 in standard series in order to detect sensitivity to textile colours that is most frequent than previously suspected.

AB  - There is a need for a diversity of approaches to predictive irritancy testing. In this study we examined the potential for changes in the expression of the nitric oxide generating enzyme, nitric oxide synthase, to act as a marker of skin irritation. Human volunteers were patch tested with sodium lauryl sulphate and dithranol so as to induce acute irritant contact dermatitis. Test and control biopsies were removed at various time points and skin sections immunocytochemically labelled with a range of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the three nitric oxide synthase isoforms, NOS1, NOS2 and NOS3. Quantitative image analysis of keratinocytes and endothelial cells revealed major inconsistencies in the labelling of both normal and inflamed skin between antibodies, including those purported to recognise the same epitope. Of the ten antibodies tested, two, AHP303 and N2643, gave statistically significant changes in NOS2 and NOS3 expression, respectively, in well-established 48?h and 96?h reactions. Importantly, the changes were consistent for both irritants, despite their differing mechanisms of action. Further investigations are needed to assess their suitability as markers of irritation in animal and in-vivo models.

AB  - Easily applicable, cheap, noninvasive and quantitative techniques to measure edema in skin and subcutaneous tissues have not been available. Recently, a new device MoistureMeter-D based on the local measurement of the dielectric properties of the biological tissues was validated in the quantitation of systemic edema in humans. In the present study the MoistureMeter-D was applied to quantitate local skin edema related to skin irritation. The irritation was induced in the volar forearms of 12 healthy volunteers with the topical application of 1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) for 6 hours. After induction the volunteers were divided into two groups: the irritation site of group I (six volunteers) had no treatment for the irritation site while for group II (six volunteers) the corticosteroid cream was topically administered on the irritation site. A good correlation was measured between the temporal changes of edema during the three days? follow-up by the ultrasound-measured skin thickness and the edema-specific MoistureMeter-D in group I (p?<?0.001). The reduction of edema in group II by the corticosteroid treatment was consistently measured by both instruments. The coefficient of variation for a single measurement varied between 2 and 3%. The results demonstrate that the MoistuMeter-D is an accurate instrument for the quick quantitative evaluation of local oedema and fluid retention in irritated skin.

AB  - For the pas few years, mainly because of mad cow disease, hydrolysed wheat proteins (HWP) have been used in cosmetics and food as emulsifiers and stabilizers in replacement of bovine collagen. We report here contact urticaria to cosmetics induced by these HWP in 7 patients of which 6 had food allergy to modified gluten and the results of their immunological testing. These cases were regrouped through the french network REVIDAL-GERDA. All 7 women developped contact urticaria immediatly after applying cosmetics (mainly facial cream), from different brands, containing HWP. Six of them had also anaphylactic reactions or urticaria after eating preserved foods or delicatessen which contained modified gluten. Neither had allergic reaction after eating broad or bread. Skin tests were positive with the cosmetics, HWP contained in them and, in case of food allergy, modified gluten. They were negative with natural wheat flour. Despite that, specific IgE to wheat flour were positive in 2 cases. Specific IgE to gluten were positive in 3 patients. Sera were also investigated for their specificity toward wheat proteins and various preparations of gluten. Individual variations of specificity were observed. All sera contained IgE reacting with both hydrolysed peptides and some native flour proteins. It appears that, from the medical history, allergy to cosmetics preceeded food allergy. In view of these elements, may be the use of HWP in cosmetics should be questionned.

AB  - Objective:? The aim was to detect a possible allergen in a patient with eyelid dermatitis. Patient and methods: a non atopic 27-year-old female presented with eyelid dermatitis since 3 months. This dermatitis persisted despite the fact she had stopped the use of make up; she had acrylic artificial nails since 2 months and sometimes used hair dyes;patch tests were performed with Finn Chamber? tests with readings at D2 and D3, according ICDRG criteria, with European standard series, additional series (including toluenesulfonamide formaldehyde resin), cosmetic, acrylates, hairdressing series, in 3 patch test sessions, using Chemotechnique Diagnostics? allergens. Results:? The only positive patch test was coconut diethanolamide (0.5% pet.)++ at D2 and D3. After removal of the shampoo containing this allergen, the dermatitis cleared. Coconut diethanolamide (cocamide DEA), tensioactive synthesized with coconut oil is widely used in shampoos, soaps, shower gels, barrier creams, washing up liquids, metalworking fluids, hydraulic oils. Involvement of eyelids is not frequently described in the literature with this allergen. Conclusion:? Coconut diethanolamide should be added in cosmetic series, and it should be useful to test this allergen in patients with eyelid dermatitis.
