AB  - Terpenes are among the most widely used fragrances, found not only in fine fragrances but most often incorporated in domestic and occupational products. Terpenes oxidize easily at air-exposure. Our previous studies have proved that limonene, linalool and caryophyllene are not allergenic in themselves but easily form allergenic products due to autoxidation. The aim of this study was to study the frequency and characteristics of allergic reactions in Europe to some oxidized fragrance terpenes. Method:? Consecutive dermatitis patients in six European dermatological centers were patch tested with oxidized terpenes. Questionnaires, standard and additional fragrance patch test materials were used in the diagnosis of fragrance allergy. Results:? Oxidized limonene was tested in 2411, while oxidized linalool, linalool hydroperoxide, oxidized caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and oxidized myrcene in additional 1511 patients. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidized limonene, 1.3% to oxidized linalool, 0.5% to oxidized caryophyllene and 1 patient to oxidized myrcene. 1.1% of the patients reacted to linalool hydroperoxide, while testing with caryophyllene oxide resulted in few positive Results: 60% of the patients reacting to oxidized terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for fragrance related dermatitis. Conclusion:? Oxidized limonene and linalool are common allergens in dermatitis patients tested consecutively in Europe. Our results indicate that autoxidation of fragrance terpenes contributes to fragrance allergy to a great extent. This observation emphasises the need of testing with chemicals that patients actually come in contact with and not only ingredients that were originally applied in the commercial formulations.

AB  - Sensitive skin is a neolgism used by consumers for a self-perceived intolerance to environmental factors including skin care products and cosmetics. Consumer complaints focused industry on this concept and dermatology has gradually recognized it also. Identified associations range from endogenous skin disorders to irritant (including sensory) and allergic reactions. Impaired barrier function has been implicated in some instances. The consumer with sensitive skin frequently experiences adverse reactions to cosmetics, but what information is available to help them choose products they can tolerate? To answer this question, a survey is being conducted among cosmetic manufacturers inquiring if they market products for consumers with sensitive skin. They are asked what steps they take in the design of these products to insure tolerance, and what testing is done on these products that may be unique. Does the post-marketing data show these products fulfilled their goal and these cosmetics are well tolerated by this group? The manufacturers are surveyed as to what precautions they regard as important for ?sensitive skin? individuals in choosing and using cosmetics. The results of the survey are incorporated into patient recommendations.

AB  - Aim:? To investigate the risk of adult hand eczema and possible influence on later working life in persons with childhood atopic dermatitis. Method:? After reviewing medical records from the school healthcare in Stockholm regarding individuals born 1960?69, 600 individuals where signs of atopic dermatitis were noted (?cases?) and 600 matched controls without eczema or allergic disease (?controls?) were identified. 405 cases and 378 controls answered a questionnaire regarding past and present skin disease, choice of job, exposure at work and possible change of job due to eczema. Results: Hand eczema was more than 3 times more common among cases, 42%, compared to controls, 13%(p?<?0.001). Hand eczema during the past 12 months was reported by 24% of the cases and 9% of the controls (p?<?0.001). The proportion of individuals working in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema was equal between the groups, as well as exposure to water, detergents, chemicals and hand washing. Among the cases 9% reported change of job due to eczema compared to 2% of controls (p?<?0.001) and sick leave 10% compared to 2%(p?<?0.001). Conclusions: Childhood atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for hand eczema. As the proportion of individuals in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema and the exposure was the same in cases and controls measures preventive measures are important to reduce consequences like sick leave and change of job.

AB  - Objectives:? The strip patch test (SPT), proposed by Spier and Sixt (Hautarzt 1955;6:152?9), is a modification of the patch test (PT). This technique is used to enhance penetration through the stratum corneum for poorly penetrating substances such as medicaments. So far, a standardised procedure is lacking. This multicentre study aims at standardising the SPT procedure. Methods:? A total of 83 healthy volunteers participated. In each subject, we determined the number of strips (A) until the surface became glistening and then calculated the median number of strips in the sample (??=?26). We ascertained the median number of strips in the sample (??=?11) that was necessary to achieve a first statistically significant and medically relevant increase of the TEWL revealing a critical stratum corneum strip depth. For the finally calculated number of strips for each subject (a/A?=?(?/?)?a?=?A???(?/?)), the actual increase in test sensitivity was substantiated employing SLS 0.125% aqueous. Standardisation results:? Perform stripping at one upper part of the back until the surface becomes glistening: gently press a 25?mm diameter adhesive tape downward vertically for about 2 seconds and then remove it in one quick movement at the angle in direction of adherence; continue stripping with a new tape cut on exactly the same skin area. Multiply number of strips by the correction factor (cf?=??/??=?11/26?=?0.4). Perform calculated number of strips likewise on the contralateral site and then apply there the test preparation for 24 hours. Conclusions:? If clinically an allergic contact dermatitis is expected but PT is negative, the SPT might reveal the potential allergen.

AB  - Objective and methods:? To evaluate the importance of occupational colophony exposure among occupational dermatitis patients we analyzed data of occupational dermatitis caused by colophony on the basis of the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases (FROD) and among the colophony allergic patients studied in the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH)in 1993?2002. Finnish physicians are obligated to report cases of occupational diseases to the FROD. Insurance companies remit patients to FIOH, mainly recommended by company doctors or dermatologists. Results:? Altogether 128 cases (68 females and 60 males) of occupational dermatitis caused by colophony were reported to the FROD since 1993 to 2002 accounting for 3.4% of all occupational allergic contact dermatitis cases and another 67 had it as a second diagnosis. Mean age of the patients was 42 years, being lowest among engineering workers (34 years) Among colophony allergic patients studied in FIOH 46/89 had an occupational dermatitis caused by colophony; 14 of them as a second diagnosis. Engineering, metal working, wood working, agricultural or medical work were most common occupations. Among colophony allergic patients without an occupational dermatitis (22) or an occupational dermatitis caused by other causes (21)working with food materials and agricultural work were most common. Principal causative agents of occupational allergic contact dermatitis from colophony were cutting fluids, soldering fluxes, tall soft soap, adhesives and varnishes. Variable individual sources were occasionally detected. Mean exposure time was 12 years. Conclusion:? Occupational dermatitis caused by colophony is difficult to diagnose, since non-occupational colophony exposure is common.

AB  - The performances of three different questions from The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) were compared with respect to their ability to identify subjects with atopic dermatitis. NOSQ-2002 was used in an intervention study on the prevention of work related skin diseases among gut cleaners. The questions were: ?Have you ever had an itchy rash that has been coming and going for at least 6 months, and at sometime has affected skin creases??(A1), ?Have you ever had eczema on the fronts of the elbow or behind the knees??(S5a), and ?Have you ever had ?childhood? eczema??(S5b). Question A1 is the single UK-working party question on atopic dermatitis; questions S5a & S5b are national atopic dermatitis questions previously used in different Nordic studies. A total of 255 of 622 (41%) gut cleaners answered ?yes? to question A1. Questions S5a and S5b gave rise to 14% and 5% positive answers, respectively. The high frequency of positive answers to question A1 could be due to the occupational exposure of gut cleaners. Their working environment is wet and often involves both forearms and hands, hence often leading to eczema of elbow creases. In conclusion, compared to other Danish studies the UK question seems to lead to over-reporting. Question S5a seems to give a reliable frequency of atopic dermatitis in adult populations at risk for work-related skin diseases.

AB  - Hospital employees and especially nurses have a high frequency of work-related skin diseases. The purpose of the present study was to collect baseline data in order to plan an intervention project with focus on skin problems among different hospital job groups reporting high frequencies of work related skin problems or eczema. Self-administered questionnaires based on a standardized questionnaire for work-related skin diseases and exposure (NOSQ-2002) were used. A total of about 1.900 employees from all job groups at the hospital where invited to participate. Due to anonymous distribution of the questionnaires it was not possible to administer reminders. The overall response rate was 65%. Among the 1.246 respondents the frequency of self-reported eczema within the last year varied between different departments from 7% to 44%. Assessed by job group the eczema frequency varied from 8% to 31%, with the highest frequency found among nurses and assistant nurses.

AB  - Propolis is an ancient remedy well known for its beneficial properties. The aim of our study was to estimate the frequency of sensitization to propolis in our pediatric patch test population. 1255 children, 583 boys and 672 girls, aged from 7 months to 12 years, were patch tested for suspected allergic contact dermatitis with our pediatric series of 30 allergens including propolis. Out of these, 37% were affected by atopic dermatitis. Among the 1255 children tested, 113 (9%), 60 boys and 53 girls reacted to propolis. In subjects reacting to propolis the dermatitis involved the face in 4% of cases, the trunk in 3%, the hands in 2,2%, and the flexural skin folds of the limbs in 1,7%. The wider and wider use of propolis in ?natural products? and biocosmetics, even in the pediatric age, could explain the high frequency of positive patch test responses to propolis we observed.

AB  - It has been demonstrated for a wide range of contact allergens that the degree to which sensitisation is induced is highly dependent on the dose per unit area of material applied to the skin. For a given skin area, the concentration of the contact allergen applied may be conveniently expressed as a percentage. However, although a number of other variables affecting induction have been examined, little attention has been paid to the impact of the duration of skin contact. For example, in the human repeated insult patch test the 9 inductions exposures may be applied for either 24h or for a combination of 48h and 72h, the latter ensuring continuous exposure during the 3 week induction period. Under these latter conditions, it is known that the contact allergen p-phenylenediamine (PPD) sensitises quite efficiently; historical data with 1% PPD in petrolatum resulted in a sensitisation rate of 47/88 (54%). Applying the same dose per unit area, we examined the impact of reducing the exposure time to 9???5 minutes spaced over the same 3 week period. Under these conditions, PPD sensitised only 2/102 (2%) of subjects. The data suggest that one route to the limitation of the extent of contact allergy would be to limit the duration of skin exposure.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) proteins by keratinocytes following in vitro exposure to a contact allergen can be used to detect contact allergy. Methods:? Suction blisters were made on skin of allergic and anergic subjects to urushiol, the contact allergen of poison ivy. Keratinocyte cultures were prepared and exposed to the allergen in vitro. Controls were the allergen solvent. Variable allergen concentrations, allergen exposure times and cell culture times were used. At the end of each culture time, IL-8 RNA and protein of the culture supernatants were analyzed by PCR and ELISA. Results:? The concentration of IL-8 in the supernatants proved to be a successful way to distinguish between subjects who patch tested positive with a non-toxic concentration of urushiol and subjects who tested negative. In the allergic subjects, a correlation was established between the dose of the allergen and the IL-8 protein concentration in the supernatants. Conclusions:? In vitro testing of contact allergies in patients makes possible an objective assessment of their allergic status without causing a booster effect or risking active sensitizations. The results indicate that the method may be used as an alternative method to animal models for testing consumer products before their marketing, thus avoiding ethical problems and problems related to interpretation of tests because of biological differences between animals and humans.

AB  - We describe a case of a 42-year-old non atopic man with a history of ano-perianal eczema in consequence of the use of anti-haemorroidal ointments and allergic contact dermatitis to Myroxylon pereirae, benzocaine, paraben mix and paraphenylenediamine. He was referred to our Unit for a strong eczematous reaction in the genital area with a marked oedema of the balanoprepuzial region that had appeared some hours after the use of a condom (Settebello-Hatù? Durex) made of natural latex and containing a retarding cream composed with benzocaine 5%, polyethylene glycol plus glycerin 94,7% and paraben 0,3% as preservative. The suspension of the use of the condom and treatment with a corticosteroid cream healed the eruption in few days. Patch testing with the SIDAPA (Società Italiana di Dermatologia Allergologica, Professionale e Ambientale) standard series, an additional rubber series, a piece of the rubber?s condom washed clean of cream and the condom?s cream gave positive reactions to Myroxylon pereirae, benzocaine, paraben mix, paraphenylenediamine and condom?s cream. Further patch test with the other ingredients of condom?s cream was negative as well as latex prick test. We discuss about the ethiologic agents and the most useful diagnostic test in allergic contact dermatitis condom-related and the preventive measures that should be adopted.

AB  - In order to know the actual risk of contact dermatitis in hairdressers, we studied, from 1994 to 2003, 300 hairdressers of a total of 7510 patients seen in our Department of occupational skin diseases. Most of them were women (93%) with a mean age of 23.7 years. A positive patch test response to one or more of the allergens tested was presented by 215 patients (71.7%). Occupational allergic contact dermatitis was diagnosed in 174 cases (58%). The most frequent sensitizations showed by positive patch test response were to: PPD (54.3%), 4-aminobenzene (40.7%), nickel (36.7%), disperse orange (17%), p-toluene-diamine (15.3%), ammonium persulfate (14.3%), aminophenoles (14.0%), acid thioglycolic (12.7%) and kathon (10.3%). Irritant contact dermatitis (20%), no occupational allergic contact dermatitis (5.3%), atopic dermatitis (6.7%) were some of the other diagnoses between the hairdressers. We compare these results with those of a previous study of 379 hairdressers who attended our department from 1980 to 1993, in order to evaluate the effects of the changes in the substances and techniques used in hairdressing and the occupational education in the risk of sensitization in this trade.

AB  - Background:? Introduction of informatics has facilitated the apparition of lesions affecting the hand responsible of mouse movement. Different cases of contact dermatitis related to the use of personal computers have been published in the last years and two new morphologic patterns within cutaneous pathology affecting hands have been described in direct relationship with professional occupation, named generally ?computer fingers? and ?computer palms?. Case report:? We present a 7-patient series presenting lesions suggesting contact dermatitis after continued use (min 8 hours/day) of personal computer from a total of 700 patients revised. Patch tests including standard series of the GEIDC, series for plastics and glues and others related to specific details of each patient were performed in all cases. Six of our patients presented lesions in the 2, 3 and 4 fingers of the right hand while the other one was affected in the right hand palm. In our patients, all the epicutaneous tests were negative or without relevance, suggesting a mechanical cause to the occupational dermatitis presented. Comments:? Products used in the fabrication of ABS plastics, employed to make personal computers mouse, such as ftalates, cobalt salts and resorcinol monobenzoate have been described as possible allergens. However, concentration of these allergens is too small to ensure a causal relationship. Pressure or an excessive sweating could facilitate these reactions. Wide use of informatics nowadays obliges us to consider those factors in patients presenting chronic dermatoses in their hands. Furthermore, better ergonomics in work places could prevent this kind of occupational dermatitis.

AB  - Objective and methods:? We review patch test results from two special patch test series for plant allergens, ?plant extracts? and ?allergenic plant chemicals?, provided by Prof. Hausen (Germany) and tested in 1992?2003. The standard series contained Sesquiterpene-lactone mix (SL mix) since 1993 (3/1998?10/1999 excluded) and Compositae mix since 3/1998. We present the cases where either SL mix or Compositae mix gave an allergic reaction and where, in addition, the series of plant extracts was tested. Results:? SL mix and Compositae mix were tested to 900 patients. Among them, plant extracts were tested in 122 and plant chemicals in 104 cases. 30 patients had an allergic reaction to Compositae mix and 17 to SL mix as well. In the plant extract series, there were more than 5 allergic reactions to feverfew(21), true chamomile(21), arnica(18), chrysanthemum(18), laurel bay leaf(13), tansy(12), gaillardia(9), yarrow(8) and pot marigold(7). In the plant chemical series, there were 9 allergic reactions to parthenolide and single reactions to primin, chlorophorin and Mansonone A. Conclusions:? Compositae mix gave a positive test reaction always together with SL mix, which gave a positive reaction in only part of these cases. The concentration of Compositae mix was lowered from 6% to 3% in 1/1999 because of cases of active sensitisation. The lower concentration seems to be reliable for detecting allergy, although it still causes active sensitisation.

AB  - We reviewed our experience patch testing to plastics at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, England. The department?s electronic database was searched from June 2002 to December 2003. In total 434 patients where patch tested to the British Standard Series. All positive reactions to epoxy resin and p-tert-Butylphenol-Formaldehyde resin (PTBF)where recorded. 28 of the patients tested to the Standard Series where also tested to an extended Plastics Series and again positive reactions where recorded. Type-4 mediated hypersensitivity reactions where seen in, 3 men secondary to epoxy resin, 2 men secondary to PTBF and in 1 women secondary to triethylene glycol acrylate. No irritant reactions where recorded. Epoxy resin was thought to be the cause of an occupational allergic hand dermatitis in 2 of the men. The positive reactions in the other patients where felt not to be of current relevance to their dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to plastic appears to be rare in patients attending for patch testing in Sheffield. In particular the frequency of reactions to epoxy resin, a potent sensitizer, is less than 1%. This is perhaps surprising as Sheffield is a large industrial city where exposure to epoxy resins is likely to be common. Hopefully this reflects safe workin practices in Sheffield.

AB  - Background:? Throughout medical literature, there are conflicting data on the relationship between atopy and contact sensitisation. Some authors believe that atopy is a protective factor against contact allergy, whereas others say it is a risk factor. Facing this contradiction, this study was undertaken to reassess the possible relationship. Study design:? In 5 vocational schools, 1 randomly selected class in each was invited to participate. Altogether 135 students were tested, 73 females and 62 males aged 18?19 years. As markers of atopy, positive skin prick tests, Phadiatop and elevated total IgE (>120?kU/l) were selected. Patch tests were used for the detection of contact sensitivity. Skin tests included 10 contact allergens and 16 aeroallergens relevant for this population. The tests were carried out and scored according to the ICDRG and EAACI guidelines. Statistical analysis of the relationships included Fisher?s chi-square test and odds ratios. Results:? Positive patch tests (at least 1+ reaction) were found in 28.1% of the study subjects, positive prick test (wheal diameter at least 3?mm) in 23.7%, positive Phadiatop in 20.0%, and elevated total IgE in 23.7%. No statistically significant relationship between atopy markers and patch test results could be found. For each analysed feature, odds ratios remained close to the value of 1. As a ?positive control? for the study design, the known relationship between female gender and positive patch test could be reconfirmed (for nickel: p?=?0.003, OR?=?12.0, 95%CI: 2.7?54.1). Conclusion:? In general population, there is no (or little) correlation between atopy and contact sensitisation.

AB  - Although the primary point of intervention for the prevention of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) should be appropriate assessment and management of potential skin sensitization hazards, there is nevertheless a place for secondary prevention in individuals who are already sensitized. Thus it is necessary to ensure a full appreciation of the variables impacting the elicitation of ACD exist. To this end, we have been engaged in a series of investigations of the elicitation of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) sensitization. In particular, we have studied the impact of duration and frequency of exposure on elicitation. Using groups of PPD sensitized volunteers, in patch tests and repeated open application tests, we have shown that exposures of only a few minutes are often without consequence in such individuals, except where the exposure is often repeated and/or the individual is highly allergic. With volunteers who were 1+ or 2+ positive to the diagnostic patch test, and where exposure to PPD was at 0.5%?1.0% in a short contact rinse-off hair colouring product, no scalp reactions were experienced. It is our view that the establishment of safe exposure limits to contact allergens should be based wherever possible on a detailed assessment of the risk to sensitized humans.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction mediated by allergen specific T-lymphocytes. Allergen exposure leads to the activation of specific T-lymphocytes, which subsequently start to produce and release a vast array of cytokines and chemokines. However, the list of relevant genes taking part in the elicitation phase of contact dermatitis is not complete. In this study, we evaluate the use of the high-density microarray technology, which enable us to assess the global gene expression in allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We included 3 chromium-allergic patients and 3 non-allergic controls in the study. Cultures of PBMC were established from each participant and stimulated with 100?ug/ul CrCl3 or media alone. The cell cultures were grown for 24 hours and the gene expression was analysed using an Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Array. Of the genes that exhibited differences of expression (p?<?0.01) in allergen-activated PBMC from patients compared to controls, 54%(159/294) displayed increased activity and 46%(136/294) displayed decreased activity. Of the 159 up-regulated genes, 41 genes had a fold change above 1.50 and 30 genes among the 136 down-regulated genes had a fold change below -1.5. A significant number of the genes that showed differential expression in the cell cultures established from the allergic patients are known to be involved in immune responses and inflammation. The data indicates that the method of microarrays is a valuable tool for investigating the gene expression profile in our model system for allergic contact dermatitis.

AB  - Objectives:? Study patch test reactivity to nickel sulphate and fragrance mix in a population of unselected infants with focus on reproducibility, clinical relevance, and nickel patch test concentration. Method:? The data presented is part of a clinical epidemiological study of allergic diseases in newborns followed prospectively with questionnaire, clinical examination and testing at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of age. TRUE Test patches were used with nickel sulphate in 3 concentrations: 200, 66, 22?ìg/cm2 and fragrance mix 430?ìg/cm2. A positive reaction suggesting sensitisation was defined as at least palpable erythema present at both the 12 and 18 months follow-up visits. Results:? A total of 543 children (268 girls, 275 boys) were patch tested at least once, 304 children were tested at both 12 and 18 months. The prevalence of a reproducible positive reaction to nickel sulphate 200?ìg/cm2 was 8.6%(20 girls, 6 boys). A transient reactivity was observed in 111 children (53 girls, 58 boys). A clinical relevance to nickel was found in only one child. There was no association between number of patch test procedures performed and reactions to nickel sulphate. Reproducible reactivity to fragrance mix was not found. Conclusion:? A high proportion of transient patch test reactivity to nickel sulphate 200?ìg/cm2 was found. Patch testing with nickel in concentrations used for adults cannot be recommended in infants. The interpretation of a singular positive nickel patch test in small children must be assessed with caution. Allergic reactions to fragrance mix were not found in this age group.
