AB  - Occupational exposure to monoterpenes occurs in saw mills, particle-board plants, carpentry shops and other types of wood-treating industries. The bicyclic monoterpene delta-3-Carene, one of the components of turpentine, may irritate the skin and muceous membranes and prolonged exposure may result in allergic contact dermatitis or chronic lung function impairment. The effects of low concentrations of delta-3-Carene on alveolar macrophages in vitro were examined and a dose-dependent relationship between the cell viability and the delta-3-Carene concentration was found. Little is known about the metabolism of delta-3-Carene in mammalians. In order to determine the toxic potential of this monoterpene we studied the human metabolism of delta-3-Carene in vitro. Therefore we used pooled human liver S9 and human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes. By using GC-MS analysis we found one main metabolite produced at high rates. The structure was identified by its mass spectra. The mass fragmentation indicated hydroxylation in allyl position. After synthesis of the assumed product in a four step reaction, it was characterized as delta-3-Carene-10-ol. There was a clear correlation between the concentration of the metabolite production, incubation time and enzyme concentration, respectively. Kinetic analysis showed that Km and Vmax values for the oxidation of delta-3-Carene by human liver microsomes were 0.39??M and 0.2?nmol/min/nmol P450. It is the first time that delta-3-Carene-10-ol is described as human metabolite of delta-3-Carene.

AB  - Effective evaluation of skin sensitisation demands that potential contact allergens are identified and the risk of sensitisation amongst exposed populations assessed. Sensitisation hazard is not an all or nothing phenomenon; dose response relationships can be discerned and thresholds identified for induction and elicitation of contact allergy. These parameters, under the heading of potency, are vital for the risk assessment process. The murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is an accepted method for the identification of sensitisation hazards (a sensitiser is a chemical that induces a stimulation index 3 or more times that of the concurrent vehicle control). The LLNA has also been used to determine the potency of sensitisers, by derivation of an EC3 value, the estimated concentration of chemical required to induce a stimulation index of 3. At present, various agencies, including in EU and OECD, together with industry bodies, are considering whether and how to adapt these data into regulations which would place sensitisers into one of several potency categories. It is our view, based on an evaluation of over 300 chemicals, that five categories: extreme, strong, moderate, weak and negative represent the optimal approach and is consistent with what is understood regarding the potency of these skin sensitisers in humans. To illustrate this approach, an example dataset of 100 selected organic chemicals is shown, where the accuracy of prediction of human potency is in the region of 90%. This categorisation has utility as a simple guide for risk management strategies as well as representing an important first step in risk assessment.

AB  - Objectives:? To compare the cumulative irritancy potential of adapalene gel, 0.1% to that of tretinoin gel, 0.025% following repeated applications to the skin of human volunteers of different ethnic origins. Methods:? Single center study, randomized, investigator blind, intra-individual, comparison in healthy volunteers, 18 years of age and older. Volunteers were randomized to apply each product daily to one or the other half-face for 21 days. On the forearms products were applied under occlusive conditions for 4 days. Criteria for evaluation were signs and symptoms (erythema, desquamation, dryness, stinging/ burning, pruritus) on the face and on the forearms (irritation, stinging/burning, pruritus, and biophysical measurements: colorimetry-a* and Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)). Overall safety evaluation was based on adverse events information collected throughout the study. Results:? Seventy-three (73) volunteers from 4 ethnic groups (Chinese, European, Indian and Malaysian volunteers) were randomized. On the face the between treatment differences in olerability parameters were similar in all ethnic groups, thus allowing to conclude that adapalene was significantly better tolerated than tretinoin in all ethnic groups. This also allowed us to compare overall irritation susceptibility of different ethnic groups using the sum of clinical sign scores. An overall ethnic effect could be shown (p?<?0.001): Chinese being most susceptible (33.5), followed by Indians (26.9), Malaysians (23.6) and Europeans (14.1). Forearm evaluations showed significantly better tolerability for adapalene than for tretinoin. However in each patient TEWL measurements correlated poorly with clinical assessments. Throughout the study more treatment related adverse events occurred with tretinoin than with adapalene. Conclusions:? ?Adapalene gel, 0.1%showed a better cutaneous tolerability and safety profile than tretinoin gel, 0.025% for all four ethnic groups. An interethnic difference in the irritation susceptibility could be shown.

AB  - Objective:? Recently, several investigators claimed that thimerosal is one of the most irrelevant allergens existing in screening for contact dermatitis. Methods:? 508 patients who were suspected to have allergic contact dermatitis were patch tested at our clinic. They completed a questionnaire including medical, demographic and occupational details. We used the standart tray of Chemotechniqe Diagnostics (MalmÖ, Sweden) and additional series which were case relevant. The relevance of the allergic reaction to thimerosal was scored from 1?6. Results:? ?19 patients (3.7%) had an allergic reaction to thimerosal. Six (31.5%) had a definite relevance and eight (42.1%) had a probable relevance. Only three patients (15.8%) had an irrelevant reaction. SPIN value was 2281. We found a high proportion of mechanics (42.1%) among the patients who had positive reaction to thimerosal (P?<?0.0001). Conclusion:? Although previous reports found thimerosal highly irrelevant, our daily experience being supported by the above data, indicates that positive reactions to thimerosal could be relevant for many patients.

AB  - Objectives:? To investigate the elicitation potency of chloroatranol ? a newly identified allergen in the natural fragrance extract: oak moss absolute. Further to compare chloroatranol and atranol and relate the findings to exposure assessed by chemical analysis. Methods:? A serial dilution patch and repeated open application test was performed in 13 chloroatranol sensitized patients and in 10 healthy controls. Further the relative potency between chloroatranol and atranol in equimolar patch test concentrations was studied and exposure assessed by chemical analysis (liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry) of perfumes on the European Market. Results:? Elicitation occurred in 92%(12/13) to the repeated open application of 5 ppm chloroatranol in ethanol within 14 days of exposure and in none of the controls (p?<?0.001). Patch testing with eqimolar concentrations of chloroatranol and atranol indicated almost similar elicitation potency. Exposure assessment showed that chloroatranol and atranol were widespread in perfumes. Chloroatranol was found at 10 ppm and atranol 74 ppm (90% percentiles). Conclusions:? Chloroatranol and atranol are strong elicitors. The current exposure to these fragrance allergens in perfumes is likely to cause clinical symptoms in sensitised individuals.

AB  - The Dutch government has recently taken initiatives to improve the protection of labourers against diseases which are related to their work, and most especially, to reduce the rapidly increasing number of patients who have to definitely stop working and who, eventually, end up being dependent on social welfare. Firstly, a number of new laws have been adopted which define the responsibilities of both the employers and the employees. Secondly the cooperation is stimulated between the Dermatologist and the Occupational Health Physician of the patient. The latter is (according to law) employed by the employer of the patient and regularly visits the place of work. We now had the opportunity to treat and study both the social, medical and occupational aspects of a patient?s case simultaneously. We decided to eliminate the existing hesitation of consulting or referring, as well as the barriers created by matters of procedure, bureaucracy and waiting lists. In our paper we discuss the above-mentioned laws and regulations, and the way in which cooperation takes place between the doctors. We will present figures showing the effects of this approach on sickleave.

AB  - Aims: To study long-term prognosis of hand eczema and to identify factors of importance for the prognosis. Methods: A cohort of 1238 individuals with verified hand eczema diagnosis was established by a population-based prevalence study in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1982?83. In 1998 a questionnaire was mailed to all individuals with available addresses (n?=?1115). The response ratio was 78%(868/1115). Results: 66% reported periods of hand eczema since 1983, and 44% during the past year. 12% stated continuous symptoms. No significant difference was found between the sexes. 74% of those who reported symptoms after 1983 considered that their hand eczema had improved. Significant differences in the persistence of hand eczema were related to the age at onset of hand eczema, skin atopy, and the extension of eczema at examination. Contact allergy related significantly to occurrence of hand eczema during the year before follow-up. 32% had visited a doctor, 7% reported sick leave periods, 2% sick pension and 3% change of occupation due to hand eczema. Conclusions: In this population-based study, a majority of individuals with hand eczema reported periods of eczema during a 15-year follow-up, implying that hand eczema is a longstanding disease. Young age at onset, history of childhood eczema and extension of the hand eczema were prognostic factors. Hand eczema did entail consequences like change of occupation, sick leave or pension in more than 10% during a 15-year period.

AB  - Since heroin is delivered to a selected group of drug addicts under supervision of nurses in the Netherlands, we reported about several nurses who presented with work-related eczema and positive patch tests to heroin. To investigate the prevalence of heroin contact allergy among all workers in this heroin delivery project, a study was started using questionnaires. Altogether 31 nurses reported work-related complaints out of 100 who returned questionnaires. Besides reports of eczema, mainly of eyelids (probably airborne) and hands, there were mucosal and respiratory complaints. Patch tests were performed in 25 nurses with complaints; in 9 of them a heroin contact allergy could be confirmed. In 6 out of these 9 nurses this was combined with mucosal or respiratory complaints. There were also 6 nurses with mucosal or respiratory complaints without a contact allergy. Contact dermatitis from opioids, such as morphine and codeine, has been documented among opioid industry workers, nurses, doctors, pharmacists, and in patients. In conclusion heroin appears to be a potent contact allergen, causing contact dermatitis. Mucosal and respiratory complaints however, cannot be explained by this contact allergy; they might be caused by a type-1-allergy to heroin, or by a direct histamine liberating effect. Opioids are known histamine liberators causing urticaria, rhinitis and anaphylactoid reactions; therefore intracutaneous tests with heroin are unreliable. In an ongoing research project it will be attempted to detect specific IgE to heroin in the 12 workers with mucosal or respiratory complaints; within the next few months results will be available.

AB  - Capsicum peppers are widespread both in and out the kitchen. ?Human hand? is a contact dermatitis resulting from the direct handling of peppers. Capsaicin also is found in topical agents for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and arthritis. The oleoresin of capsicum is considered a powerfull irritant capable to induce irritant contact dermatitis and non-immunological contact urticaria. A 81 year-old man with a severe itchy macular and papular rash induced by Capsidol? initially located over the shoulder and sudden spread over the thorax is presented. A dense dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate and spongiosis suggested the diagnosis of contact dermatitis. Negative open tests and a positive patch test reaction (++ 96 hours) using the trade cream Capsidol?(capsaicin 5%) led us to contact with the Pharmaceutical Company Viñas. They provided us the components of the cream: capsaicin, isopropyl myristate, estearic acid (DERVACID 3148), propylene glycol, glycerin monomyristate (ESTOL3650GMM), AMPHISOL K, Cetyl alcohol (NACOL 16?85), benzyl alcohol, diazolidinyl urea (GERMALL II), p-hydroxybenzoate?methylsodium (NIPAGIN M sódic), p-hydroxybenzoate propyl (NIPASOL M). Capsaicin in benzyl alcohol at 0,075% was open tested with negative results. Only patch test with capsaicin was positive (++) at 48/96 hours and the excipient components at the appropiate concentrations were all negative. Patch test biopsy showed an eczematous pattern. Twenty controls showed negative results. This case is probably an allergic reaction but shows how still remains difficult to distinguish among allergic and irritative cutaneous reactions.

AB  - The current spectrum of contact allergens in metalworking fluids (MWF) is illustrated based on (I) recent patch test data from the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) concerning metalworkers tested in 2002/2003 due to suspected MWF dermatitis, (II) a study on occupational contact allergies performed in the IVDK 1999?2001 (FaSt study), (III) a patch test study in five centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) with components of MWF not routinely tested, and (IV) information from the interdisciplinary task force on allergy diagnostics in the metal branch. Potential allergens are found in various MWF components, mainly in emulsifiers, rust preventing agents, preservatives, and anti-wear-additives. Various special additives also may contain potential allergens. Currently, the most important MWF allergens are: ? oxidation products from resin acids, e.g. abietic acid, in distilled tall oil, a frequently used base material of MWF. Contact allergy to these is detected by patch testing with colophony. ? monoethanolamine, diglycolamine ? used as rust preventing agents and emulsifiers. ? formaldehyde and various formaldehyde releasers, mainly oxazolidine derivatives ? used as biocides. Other biocides, e.g. Methylchloroisothiazolinone/Methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI), Benzisothiazolinone (BIT) or Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) are also used in MWF and should hence be tested routinely. While odour masks for MWF are available, little is known about the extent of their usage. However, this allergen source should be considered in cases of fragrance allergy. Cobalt apparently is a relevant MWF allergen only in carbid metal processing.

We describe some patients who developed allergic contact dermatitis to specific drugs. Two of them we related to occupational exposure to simvastatin and other to n-acetyl-cysteina. Also one to diphendiprone. The diagnosis of airborne contact dermatitis was confirmed by patch test in all cases. We will do a review in this aspect on occupational contact dermatitis to foccus attention on the increasing importance of this aspect in pharmaceutical workers.

AB  - For new chemicals introduced into the workplace or marketplace, and which come into contact with the skin, it is necessary, to conduct a thorough skin safety testing and risk assessment program to be certain that the exposures will be well tolerated. One vital risk assessment process involves the determination of allergic skin reactions, referred to as skin sensitization, the clinical manifestation of which is allergic contact dermatitis. The process by which low molecular weight chemicals induce and elicit skin sensitization is dependent on many factors including the ability of the chemical to penetrate the skin, react with protein, and trigger a cell-mediated immune response. Based on our chemical, cellular and molecular understanding of allergic contact dermatitis, it is possible to carry out a quantitative risk assessment. It has been well known for years that chemical allergens display dose-response characteristics regardless of whether the sensitization is induced in an experimental system or in humans. Moreover, it is well known that the critical exposure determinant for evaluating skin sensitization risk is dose per unit area of skin exposed. The skin sensitization testing and risk assessment process for new ingredients and consumer products generally follows a step-wise approach that may involve structure-activity evaluations, analytical assessments, preclinical skin sensitization testing (e.g., the mouse local lymph node assay), confirmatory clinical testing (e.g., the human repeat insult patch test), and benchmarking of resulting data against similar ingredients and product types. Essential elements for conducting a sound risk assessment involve the development of an understanding of the sensitization potential of the contact allergen and the likely dose, nature, extent and duration of exposure. With an understanding of the exposure and potency of the chemical one can assess whether the chemical, under the specific conditions of exposure, ould pose an acceptable or unacceptable risk of induction of skin sensitization. As with any test method or risk assessment approach, it is critical to understand the strengths and limitations so that one can conduct the best assessment possible and assure the skin safety of the chemical under evaluation.

AB  - A 35-year-old woman presented with a 8-month history of scaling, hyperkeratotic and fissured lesions of the fingertips of the first three fingers of both the hands. She referred the healing of the dermatitis during the summer holidays. She was employed in a small firm where she was used to glue together silver components with glass ones of decorative pieces. For this aim, she applied a glue (Loxeal UV 30?20) cured by exposition to UV light coming from a proper lamp. The material safety data sheet (MSDS) indicated that the glue contained hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA). Patch tests performed with the standard SIDAPA series gave negative results; patch tests carried out with an additional one (acrylic adhesive series) showed positive reactions towards glue components (HEMA,HPMA) and towards other acrylates (possible cross-reacting). An inspection performed in the work-place showed that the patient was in contact with the glue not only when she applied it on the components, but particularly when she handled the bottle cap (splashed with the glue) in its opening and closing. After the changing of her occupation, the patient has not presented relapse of the dermatitis. The UV-cured acrylic resins are known for some time to be a frequent cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis in dentists and in printing industry. The case reported shows a different exposition source towards these resins, i.e. from UV-cured acrylate adhesive employed for sticking metal pieces with glass ones.

AB  - Background/objectives:? Prevention of hand dermatitis among nurses can be achieved by reduction of wet work exposure. Kwodledge about the amout of wet work in nursing is import implementing hand dermatitis prevention plans. Wet work exposure in nursing can be assessed by questionnaire or observation. Method:? Duration and frequency of wet work activities were assessed by a questionnaire in a population of 1471 nurses.In addition a randomly chosen sample of 53 nurses from this population was observed on duration and frequency of wet work during 112 different morning shifts. Results:? questionnaire: wet work between 26 minutes (at a dialysis ward) and 100 minutes (in nursing homes). For frequency a range between 12 and 21 episodes of wet hands during morning shifts was reported. In nursing homes and regular wards gloves were reported to be used less than once during a shift. Observation:? A duration of wet work of 10 minutes (dialysis ward), 28 minutes (regular ward) and 19 minutes (I.C.-unit) and 45 minutes in a nursing home. Frequency: between 19 and 43 episodes of wet hands during morning shifts. Conclusions:? A questionnaire does not accurately assess the quantity of wet activities; it overestimates the duration of wet work and underestimates the frequency of wet work. On regular wards the exposure to irritants is mainly associated with the frequency of wet hands instead of the duration of wet hands. On specialised care units skin exposure is mainly a matter of occlusion by gloves.

AB  - Introduction:? Nail varnishes are well-known sensitizers, and the most frequent allergen is nowadays tosylamide/formaldehyde resin (TFR). We present 3 cases of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) due an unusual ingredient. Case reports:? The 1st patient presented with atopic dermatitis that progressively worsened, involving face and neck for several months. The 2nd patient had history of occupational allergy to glutaraldehyde, and presented with head and neck dermatitis. The 3rd patient had severe onycholysis and dermatitis of perionychium, face, neck and décolleté. European standard series was negative in all patients, as was TFR, (meth-) acrylates and cosmetic series when tested. Patch tests with patient?s own varnish(es) were ++, and breakdown identified phthalic anhydride/trimellitic anhydride/glycols copolymer (PTG) as the allergen (tested 1 to 5% pet.). Discussion:? PTG results of condensation of phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, ethylene glycol, and neopentyl glycol monomers. It belongs to the copolymer class, and is used in confection of nail polish and enamels, like TFR or phthalic anhydride/glycerine/glycidyl decanoate copolymer. Our patients had long lasting dermatitis, common in ACD to nail varnishes. Sensitivity was proved by patch testing with patient?s own cosmetics. Allergic contact dermatitis to PTG seems to be rare, but has to be considered particularly in patients with negative standard patch tests. An alternative is the use of tosylamide/formaldehyde-based nail polish.

AB  - Objective:? To examine the usefulness of the standard allergen series as a sole tool in the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis and consider the diagnostic benefits yielded by the routine use of an extended standard series in general dermatology practice. Methods:? From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003, one hundred patients attended in a general dermatology unit were recruited for patch testing. Every patient underwent testing with the standard tray recommended by the Spanish Contact Dermatitis Research Group, and simultaneously, with a supplementary series of 35 allergens. Other specific series were performed in some cases, but their results have been omitted in this study. Patients with positive allergic reactions were divided into two groups based on the clinical relevance of their reactions. These groups were subsequently stratified in four subgroups: (1) reactions only to allergens in the standard series; (2) reactions only to additional allergens; (3) reactions to both standard and additional allergens; and (4) reactions to own substances or allergens in other series. Results:? Of patients tested, 62 had at least 1 positive allergic reaction, and among these, 44 had reactions deemed clinically relevant. Of all the patients with relevant positive tests, 70.5%(31/44) reacted only to allergens in the standard tray; 11.4%(5/44) reacted to supplementary allergens exclusively; 4.5%(2/44) reacted to both standard and supplementary allergens. Finally, 6 more patients (13.6%) reacted to other sensitizers. Conclusion:? In our study, 15.9% relevant allergies would have been missed by the standard series alone. Patch testing an extended standard series increased our diagnostic capability, and might be a useful screening tool in those dermatology offices where other series are lacking.

AB  - Prompted by a recent publication on contact allergy to the fragrance mix (FM) declining with age, patch test data of the IVDK (1992?2002, http://www.ivdk.org, n?=?90824 patients) were subjected to a multifactorial logistic regression analysis, employing a finer age categorization than previously used (Uter W et al., Occup. Environ. Med. 2001; 58: 392?8), additionally adjusting for ?polysensitization?, operationalized as the number of additional positive patch test reactions to other standard series allergens. The aim was to disentangle a possible association between age and contact sensitization in general, and age and FM contact allergy in particular. The strongest of all associations observed was to the number of additional positive patch test reactions (?polysensitization?; OR for 1 vs. 0 additional reactions: 2.7 [95% CI: 2.6?2.9] steadily increasing to OR for 4+ vs. 0 additional reactions: 12.8 [11.7?13.9]). Independently from this, the well-known increase of FM contact allergy with age (OR 1.9 beyond age 60) and higher prevalence in female patch test patients, but only up to age 60, was confirmed, however, no decline beyond age 80 was observed. Moreover, it was found that not health care workers in general, but masseurs/physiotherapists, and, to a lesser extent, geriatric nurses have a high risk of FM contact allergy. In conclusion, our results confirm the profound impact of age, and partially of sex, on FM contact allergy, which makes stratification, standardization or adjustment a prerequisite for meaningful comparative analyses. The phenomenon of ?polysensitization? deserves further attention.

AB  - A 42-year?old non-atopic lady was treated with twice daily 2% clindamycin vaginal cream (Dalacin?) and ster-zac (bath antiseptic) for hidradenitis of the groins. She also had mild facial acne. She developed genital pruritus and erythema which quickly became generalised which she related to the use of ster-zac. However, when she applied clindamycin to her face a few weeks later, she developed a severe reaction which became generalised. The patient was patch tested with an extended European series, the clindamycin cream, ster-zac 1:100 and E45 which had also been used. Initially she developed an angry back picture which was difficult to assess but the standard testing was negative. Repeat patch testing to the constituents of the topical preparations used produced a reaction to clindamycin 1%, 5% and to dalacin cream ?as is?. Discussion: Coskey1 first described contact allergy to clindamycin in 1978. Since then there have been 6 further case reports. Mild local adverse reactions to topical clindamycin preparations such as burning, excessive dryness, itching and erythema are not uncommon, but more serious adverse events should prompt exclusion of a contact allergic component. Despite topical clindamycin being used for more than 25 years, sensitisation appears uncommon.

AB  - Objective:? To assess occupational dermal exposure to permanent hair dyes in hairdressers. Methods:? Dermal exposure was assessed in 31 hairdressers using a previously evaluated method, hand wash sampling with bag rinsing. The measurements were performed in hairdressing saloons during working hours. Hand wash samples were collected from each hand before start of the hair dyeing process, after application of the hair dye and after cutting the newly dyed hair. 13 of the hairdressers did not use gloves during application of the hair dye, and during cutting of the dyed hair no one used gloves. The samples were analysed for aromatic amines and resorcinol using an HPLC-method. Results:? After application of the hair dye PPD (p-phenylenediamine) was found in samples from 1 hairdressers (148?185?nmol/hand), TDA (toluenediamine) in samples from 12 hairdressers (range 10?735?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 22 individuals (range 19?769?nmol/hand). In the samples taken after cutting the dyed hair PPD was found in 2 hairdressers (range 36?358?nmol/hand), TDA in 14 (range 8?361?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 20 (range 10?725?nmol/hand. Conclusion:? Skin exposure to aromatic amines and resorcinol was detected in more than half of the hairdressers after application of hair dye and also after cutting newly dyed hair. To reduce exposure improved skin protection is important.

AB  - Questionnaire-tools for surveying occupational skin diseases and exposure are needed for comparable epidemiological research, workplace assessments, and evaluation of workplace interventions. The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire Group supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers has developed a standardized questionnaire-tool for surveys on work-related skin diseases and skin exposures to environmental factors. Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) includes two questionnaires designed for separate purposes. NOSQ-2002/short is a 4-page questionnaire for screening skin problems at workplaces. NOSQ-2002/long is an in-depth survey tool for research purposes. The questionnaire covers occupational history, atopic symptoms, self-reported hand or forearm eczema, exacerbating factors, consequences and life impact of dermatoses, self-reported contact urticaria on hands or forearms, skin symptoms, skin tests, exposures, and protective glove use. For the time being, NOSQ-2002 is available in English, Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Icelandic. Further translations are welcomed. The NOSQ-2002 report includes a review of pertinent literature on questionnaire methods for skin disease studies. Questions on work and exposure can be tailored to specific populations or occupational groups, according to the instructions and recommendations given in NOSQ-2002/INFO version of the questionnaire. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaire files can be downloaded from http://www.ami.dk/NOSQ. The Nordic Council of Ministers has the copyright to the NOSQ-2002 questionnaires. Use of the questionnaires is free of charge. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaires and their present and possible future translations cannot be used commercially.
