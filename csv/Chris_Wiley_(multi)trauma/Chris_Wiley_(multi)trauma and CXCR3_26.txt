AB  - Introduction:? Nail varnishes are well-known sensitizers, and the most frequent allergen is nowadays tosylamide/formaldehyde resin (TFR). We present 3 cases of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) due an unusual ingredient. Case reports:? The 1st patient presented with atopic dermatitis that progressively worsened, involving face and neck for several months. The 2nd patient had history of occupational allergy to glutaraldehyde, and presented with head and neck dermatitis. The 3rd patient had severe onycholysis and dermatitis of perionychium, face, neck and décolleté. European standard series was negative in all patients, as was TFR, (meth-) acrylates and cosmetic series when tested. Patch tests with patient?s own varnish(es) were ++, and breakdown identified phthalic anhydride/trimellitic anhydride/glycols copolymer (PTG) as the allergen (tested 1 to 5% pet.). Discussion:? PTG results of condensation of phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, ethylene glycol, and neopentyl glycol monomers. It belongs to the copolymer class, and is used in confection of nail polish and enamels, like TFR or phthalic anhydride/glycerine/glycidyl decanoate copolymer. Our patients had long lasting dermatitis, common in ACD to nail varnishes. Sensitivity was proved by patch testing with patient?s own cosmetics. Allergic contact dermatitis to PTG seems to be rare, but has to be considered particularly in patients with negative standard patch tests. An alternative is the use of tosylamide/formaldehyde-based nail polish.

AB  - Objective:? To examine the usefulness of the standard allergen series as a sole tool in the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis and consider the diagnostic benefits yielded by the routine use of an extended standard series in general dermatology practice. Methods:? From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003, one hundred patients attended in a general dermatology unit were recruited for patch testing. Every patient underwent testing with the standard tray recommended by the Spanish Contact Dermatitis Research Group, and simultaneously, with a supplementary series of 35 allergens. Other specific series were performed in some cases, but their results have been omitted in this study. Patients with positive allergic reactions were divided into two groups based on the clinical relevance of their reactions. These groups were subsequently stratified in four subgroups: (1) reactions only to allergens in the standard series; (2) reactions only to additional allergens; (3) reactions to both standard and additional allergens; and (4) reactions to own substances or allergens in other series. Results:? Of patients tested, 62 had at least 1 positive allergic reaction, and among these, 44 had reactions deemed clinically relevant. Of all the patients with relevant positive tests, 70.5%(31/44) reacted only to allergens in the standard tray; 11.4%(5/44) reacted to supplementary allergens exclusively; 4.5%(2/44) reacted to both standard and supplementary allergens. Finally, 6 more patients (13.6%) reacted to other sensitizers. Conclusion:? In our study, 15.9% relevant allergies would have been missed by the standard series alone. Patch testing an extended standard series increased our diagnostic capability, and might be a useful screening tool in those dermatology offices where other series are lacking.

AB  - Prompted by a recent publication on contact allergy to the fragrance mix (FM) declining with age, patch test data of the IVDK (1992?2002, http://www.ivdk.org, n?=?90824 patients) were subjected to a multifactorial logistic regression analysis, employing a finer age categorization than previously used (Uter W et al., Occup. Environ. Med. 2001; 58: 392?8), additionally adjusting for ?polysensitization?, operationalized as the number of additional positive patch test reactions to other standard series allergens. The aim was to disentangle a possible association between age and contact sensitization in general, and age and FM contact allergy in particular. The strongest of all associations observed was to the number of additional positive patch test reactions (?polysensitization?; OR for 1 vs. 0 additional reactions: 2.7 [95% CI: 2.6?2.9] steadily increasing to OR for 4+ vs. 0 additional reactions: 12.8 [11.7?13.9]). Independently from this, the well-known increase of FM contact allergy with age (OR 1.9 beyond age 60) and higher prevalence in female patch test patients, but only up to age 60, was confirmed, however, no decline beyond age 80 was observed. Moreover, it was found that not health care workers in general, but masseurs/physiotherapists, and, to a lesser extent, geriatric nurses have a high risk of FM contact allergy. In conclusion, our results confirm the profound impact of age, and partially of sex, on FM contact allergy, which makes stratification, standardization or adjustment a prerequisite for meaningful comparative analyses. The phenomenon of ?polysensitization? deserves further attention.

AB  - A 42-year?old non-atopic lady was treated with twice daily 2% clindamycin vaginal cream (Dalacin?) and ster-zac (bath antiseptic) for hidradenitis of the groins. She also had mild facial acne. She developed genital pruritus and erythema which quickly became generalised which she related to the use of ster-zac. However, when she applied clindamycin to her face a few weeks later, she developed a severe reaction which became generalised. The patient was patch tested with an extended European series, the clindamycin cream, ster-zac 1:100 and E45 which had also been used. Initially she developed an angry back picture which was difficult to assess but the standard testing was negative. Repeat patch testing to the constituents of the topical preparations used produced a reaction to clindamycin 1%, 5% and to dalacin cream ?as is?. Discussion: Coskey1 first described contact allergy to clindamycin in 1978. Since then there have been 6 further case reports. Mild local adverse reactions to topical clindamycin preparations such as burning, excessive dryness, itching and erythema are not uncommon, but more serious adverse events should prompt exclusion of a contact allergic component. Despite topical clindamycin being used for more than 25 years, sensitisation appears uncommon.

AB  - Objective:? To assess occupational dermal exposure to permanent hair dyes in hairdressers. Methods:? Dermal exposure was assessed in 31 hairdressers using a previously evaluated method, hand wash sampling with bag rinsing. The measurements were performed in hairdressing saloons during working hours. Hand wash samples were collected from each hand before start of the hair dyeing process, after application of the hair dye and after cutting the newly dyed hair. 13 of the hairdressers did not use gloves during application of the hair dye, and during cutting of the dyed hair no one used gloves. The samples were analysed for aromatic amines and resorcinol using an HPLC-method. Results:? After application of the hair dye PPD (p-phenylenediamine) was found in samples from 1 hairdressers (148?185?nmol/hand), TDA (toluenediamine) in samples from 12 hairdressers (range 10?735?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 22 individuals (range 19?769?nmol/hand). In the samples taken after cutting the dyed hair PPD was found in 2 hairdressers (range 36?358?nmol/hand), TDA in 14 (range 8?361?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 20 (range 10?725?nmol/hand. Conclusion:? Skin exposure to aromatic amines and resorcinol was detected in more than half of the hairdressers after application of hair dye and also after cutting newly dyed hair. To reduce exposure improved skin protection is important.

AB  - Questionnaire-tools for surveying occupational skin diseases and exposure are needed for comparable epidemiological research, workplace assessments, and evaluation of workplace interventions. The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire Group supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers has developed a standardized questionnaire-tool for surveys on work-related skin diseases and skin exposures to environmental factors. Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) includes two questionnaires designed for separate purposes. NOSQ-2002/short is a 4-page questionnaire for screening skin problems at workplaces. NOSQ-2002/long is an in-depth survey tool for research purposes. The questionnaire covers occupational history, atopic symptoms, self-reported hand or forearm eczema, exacerbating factors, consequences and life impact of dermatoses, self-reported contact urticaria on hands or forearms, skin symptoms, skin tests, exposures, and protective glove use. For the time being, NOSQ-2002 is available in English, Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Icelandic. Further translations are welcomed. The NOSQ-2002 report includes a review of pertinent literature on questionnaire methods for skin disease studies. Questions on work and exposure can be tailored to specific populations or occupational groups, according to the instructions and recommendations given in NOSQ-2002/INFO version of the questionnaire. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaire files can be downloaded from http://www.ami.dk/NOSQ. The Nordic Council of Ministers has the copyright to the NOSQ-2002 questionnaires. Use of the questionnaires is free of charge. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaires and their present and possible future translations cannot be used commercially.

AB  - Introduction:? Cutaneous adverse reactions from topical or systemic administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are frequently described. New cases of adverse reactions from NSAIDs are reported, but the most frequently involved are drugs as ketoprofen or piroxicam. We report a case of photoallergical contact dermatitis from diclophenac with possible cross reaction to aceclophenac. Material and methods:? A 63-year-old-man, allergic to penicillin, developed eczematous lesions on hands and face, after applying a medicament containing diclophenac. Patch test and photopatch test (5?J/cm2) were performed with a photoallergen battery (Chemotechnique diagnostics?), a NSAIDs battery (Aristegui lab.?) and aceclophenac 1%, 5% and 10% in pet. Readings were done at 48 and 96 hours in epicutaneous test and at 24 and 72 hours in photoallergic study, following the ICDRG criteria. Results:? The results of photoallergic study were as follows: diclophenac 1%, 5% and 10% in pet. and aceclophenac 10% in pet. positive at 24 and 72 hours. The remaining compounds of the NSAIDs battery were negative. Conclusions:? Diclophenac is a NAIDs derived from aryl alcanoic acid group used both topically and systemically in Spain. Some adverse reactions have been reported as exanthema, urticaria, eczema or Steven-Johnson?s syndrome. We have found only two cases reported as photosensitization from diclophenac. In one of them, the clinical lesion was described as a granuloma annular-like and photoallergic study was negative. We report a photocontact dermatitis from diclophenac with positive photopatch test. Photopatch test positive to aceclophenac may be explained as a cross reaction among group.

AB  - Classification and labeling of substances and preparations within the EU is made in accordance with the criteria as written out in Directive 67/548/EEC (?the substances directive?) and Directive 1999/45/EC (?the preparation directive? setting general concentration limits for preparations containing substances classified under 67/548). The basis for the criteria concerning hazard for skin sensitisation is based on practical experience showing that the substance or preparation is capable to induce a sensitization by skin contact in a substantial number of persons (appropriate patch testing or epidemiological data); or where positive tests from appropriate animal testing are available. Recently at the EU level and currently continued at the OECD, there is an expert discussion on the appropriateness to make potency considerations of skin sensitisers. The experts evaluate the possibility to set specific concentration limits for induction skin sensitisers contained in preparations. These limits would then give the possibility to classify such preparations better mirroring the reality than the current general limits given in the preparations directive. The first measure to prevent the hazard when a chemical or preparation fulfills the criteria to be classified as a skin sensitiser, is through the labeling indicating the standardized risk phrase: ?May cause sensitization by skin contact?, which also must be followed with an adequate safety advice. The classification of a substance has further consequences in other legal instruments on EU level leading to additional risk management measures.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to review the European legislation concerning the use of textile dyes. It is known that different dyes of different classes can be sensitizing and cause allergic contact dermatitis for both textile workers and consumers. The European Union has created restraining directives regarding the manufacture and distribution of potentially dangerous products, such as aromatic amines. A specific scientific committee of EU stated that the carcinogenic capacity of some azo dyes is related to chemical releasing of aromatic amines (groups MAK III; A1; A2). In this paper, focus will be centred on the latest European Union Directives in this matter and the prohibition of some azo dyes in textile industry.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to know the prevalence of allergic patch test responses in patients with suspected fragrance allergy in Korea and to know the photoxic potentials of limited fragrance substances. Nine dermatology departments of university hospitals and one research institute of cosmetic company were participated in this study for the past 1 year. To inquire the specific fragrance allergens in Korea, eighteen fragrance ingredients were added to Korean standard series and fragrance series (Chemotechnique Diagnosis, Sweden). Among 422 patients, 83% were women and the most common topographic site was face. Except the fragrance mix and Balsam of Peru, Cinnamic alcohol and Sandalwood oil showed high frequency of positive responses. Among the added specific fragrance ingredients, 3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenen-1-yl) pent-4-en-2-ol, alpha-isomethyl-ionone(methyl ionone gamma), Lyral showed high positive responses. With eighteen added specific fragrance substances, we have also performed two in vitro phototoxicity tests, 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test and photohemolysis test. 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test is a screening method for DNA or cellular damage and Photohemolysis test is a useful screening method for phototoxic chemicals that cause oxygen-dependent membrane damage. Only Lyral showed phototoxicity in photohemolysis test and no other fragrance ubstances showed phototoxicity in 3T3 NRU phtototoxicity test. We think our data are useful to know the current status of the frequent fragrance allergens in our society and the possible phototoxic potency of limited fragrance substances.

AB  - Concomitant sensitizations to Nickel, Cobalt and Chromate are often observed among patch test patients. However, the reasons for being sensitized to two or more of these substances are not completely understood. Examination of IVDK (http://www.ivdk.org) patch test results with multivariate procedures has been conducted to further elucidate the mechanisms involved with these sensitizations and potential exposure factors that may have led to the concomitant sensitizations. Gender, age, occupational dermatitis, and construction work were considered and examined with multivariate logistic regression models with the dependent response variable being concurrent reactions to a metal pair versus no reactions. In addition to the aforementioned anamnestic data, examination of a poly-sensitizations variable (reactions to 1, 2, or 3 standard series allergens other than Nickel, Cobalt or Chromate) provided information regarding general susceptibility to positive patch test reactions. Combined reactions to Cobalt and Chromate were strongly linked to construction work (OR?=?11.23 (7.46, 16.90)) and occupational dermatitis. Female patch test patients had a higher odds of a positive patch test reaction to both Nickel and Cobalt (OR?=?4.73 (3.81, 5.87)). Sensitization to other, unrelated standard series substances was associated with concurrent reactions to all of the metal pairs. The association between construction work and Cobalt-Chromate reactions corresponds with the hypothesis that cement exposures lead to cobalt-chromate sensitizations. Individual susceptibility to delayed-type sensitizations, as represented by the poly-sensitization variable, also appears to be associated with coupled sensitizations to metals and warrants further examination.

AB  - Covalent binding of hapten to skin protein is required for sensitisation. It has long been postulated that only sensitising chemicals will modify skin protein(s), whereas non-sensitisers and irritants do not. To pinpoint the amino acid residues involved in such modifications, we employed mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics techniques. Known sensitisers, non-sensitisers and irritants were incubated with human serum albumin (HSA). Modified HSA samples were digested by trypsin and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI-MS) analyses were conducted on the digests. Nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ES-MS/MS) analyses were conducted on modified peptides purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HSA sequence was mapped and modified peptides identified. In HSA samples incubated with non-sensitisers and irritants there was no change compared to HSA incubated without chemical. Modified peptides were purified by HPLC and sequenced using ES-MS/MS. Lysine, histidine and cysteine were found to be involved in covalent modifications by the sensitising chemicals used. A double adduct of one sensitiser (MCI) on His 338 of HSA molecule was also identified. More sensitisers need to be investigated to establish similarities between covalent protein modifications of chemically related compounds. The aim is to develop an assay for protein binding ability of chemicals which could form part of a battery of tests needed to replace animal testing for sensitisation potential.

AB  - Risk assessments of chemicals are key issues in our live. Prior to industrialisation, risk assessments based on individual experience, for the allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) for instance, after contact with allergic plants affecting the skin exposed. Today, the risk to get an ADC becomes more and more important, because of increasing contact to new chemicals because of frequent contact with consumer products. Therefore sufficient test systems are required, appropriate to estimate the sensitisation potential of individual chemicals. To be able to predict weak sensitisers, adjuvants were simultaneously injected to test animals to booster their allergic reactions. One of the most well known test method, is the maximisation test in guinea pigs according to Magnusson and Kligman. Regulatory authorities have required this method for chemical classification, as well as for estimating the risk to get sensitised when dermaly exposed. Beside the advantages of these guinea pig studies, the limitations became prominent not only in respect to ethical aspects, but also because of the lack to quantify the sensitisation potency of chemicals. To be able to perform accurate, realistic risk assessments, the knowledge of potency is becoming mandatory, especially when sensitive test methods are used. Based on the possibility to measure the biological response during induction of sensitisation, the local lymph node assay (LLNA) gets popular. Today, this test is officially accepted by regulators to give information on skin sensitisation potential. With the quantitative approach on potency, risk assessment of ACD will become much more reliable and useful for Men.

AB  - When considering the allergenic activity of a compound not only the possibility of bioactivation by skin metabolism but also air activation by autoxidation must be taken into account. Natural compounds (terpenes) easily oxidize at air exposure. They are found in products that are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) i.e. colophony and fragrances. The introduction of oxygen enables the molecules to form antigens with skin proteins via a nucleophilic- electrophilic interaction or via a radical reaction. The latter mechanism seems to be important since the primary oxidation products, the hydroperoxides, are the most potent sensitizers formed. Oxidative decomposition at air exposure resulting in allergenic oxidation products is observed also for other common compounds e.g. ethoxylated fatty alcohols used as surfactants. It is important to test the patient with the offending compounds for diagnosis of ACD. A negative diagnosis can be due to failure in testing with the correct substances. In the case of air activated compounds, testing should not be performed with the pure substances but rather with the oxidation mixture or the most sensitizing oxidation products (the hydroperoxides). We have in multicenter-studies shown that the common fragrance terpenes, limonene and linalool, are frequent sensitizers when oxidized. This is a challenge in clinical practice since such patch test materials are not easily standardized. Compounds, easily activated at air exposure, should be prevented from oxidative decomposition by addition of antioxidants and proper handling and storage. More research is needed in this area.

AB  - We have previously reported that, with suitable training and experience, skin irritation reactions can be graded visually with a high degree of sensitivity and precision. The objective of the work presented is to demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of the grading of skin irritation reactions by subjective visual assessment. In the present work, we have recorded a wide range of relatively minor skin irritation reactions using a high quality digital camera. The skin reactions recorded have then been graded by independent observers according to their appearance on a computer monitor. The results show that very subtle degrees of both erythema and skin dryness can be accurately described by trained skin graders in a reliable and reproducible manner. Examples of the grading scales and sensitivity of scoring will be shown. We conclude that visual scoring, when conducted well, represents a rapid and accurate method for the assessment of minor degrees of skin irritation. The present evidence, taken in combination with previously presented information on bioengineering techniques, leads us to the conclusion that visual assessment is both an adequate and a robust technique, delivering information of the quality necessary for safety assessment of consumer products.

AB  - Objective:? To determine the efficacy of a topical, MAS063D, in managing the clinical signs and symptoms of experimentally induced irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). Methods:? Two patches of ICD were created using sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in 20 consenting volunteers. MAS063D was applied to one patch and a vehicle-only control to the other. Measurements were taken at baseline, 24, 48 and 72 hours as follows: blood flow volume (BFV); skin color (a*); transepidermal water loss (TEWL); patient?s view of itch and visual scoring. Results: The objective measurements of BFV, a* and TEWL all showed statistically significant benefits of MAS063D over the vehicle-only control. BFV and a* were significantly better at all time points (p?=?0.046, p?=?0.045 respectively at 72 hours) and TEWL at 48 and 72 hours (p?=?0.02 at 72 hours). MAS063D demonstrated benefit in the visual scoring of irritant contact dermatitis that was not statistically significant. Patient-assessed itch was low at baseline; significant improvement was neither expected nor demonstrated although a small benefit of MAS063D over vehicle was seen in the mean values. Conclusions:? BFV and a* are both good indicators of local erythema. TEWL is a good indicator of skin integrity. MAS063D therefore demonstrated statistically significant benefit over vehicle on three clinically meaningful outcomes of SLS-induced ICD, and therefore may benefit irritant contact dermatitis.

AB  - Objectives:? To identify substances and tonnage data for use for hair dyes registered in Europe. To predict the sensitization potential of each substance and to rank the substances due to their sensitization potential. Further to group the substances in clusters based on their physical chemical properties with a cluster analysis. Methods:? The Inventory list of Cosmetics Ingredients (INCI), new regulation on cosmetics, tonnage data for use and Toxnet were used to identify and quantify the hair dyes. Salts were disregarded. A QSAR (Qualitative structure-activity relationship) model called TOPS-MODE, based on local lymph node assay (LLNA) data and physical chemical properties were used to predict the sensitization potential and make a cluster analysis. Results:? Out of 315 hair dye substances 229 meet the inclusion criteria. Most of the hair dye substances 75% were predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers. Less were predicted to be weak 22% and only a small part 3% were predicted to be extremely weak or non sensitizing. The 8 most used hair dye substances were predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers. Ppd is the most used hair dye allergy marker but some azodyes were predicted to be more potent than para-phenylenediamine (ppd). Conclusions:? Most hair dye substances are predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers, which explain why some people gets hair dye dermatitis. A patch test series with potent, much used azodyes, might prove useful in diagnosing ppd-negative patients, with hair dye allergy. The cluster analysis grouped the substances which can be helpful choosing substances for clinical patch test.

AB  - Iodopropynylbutyl carbamate (IPBC)is a preservative that has been increasingly used for skin care products and cosmetics within the last years and the first cases of contact sensitization have meanwhile been reported. Therefore, a surveillance for IPBC contact allergy is now necessary. Our study was aimed to find out a suitable test concentration of IPBC for this purpose. The data 8106 patients tested by 23 centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK)in the time from May 2001 to July 2003 with IPBC in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.5% were retrospectively evaluated. Criteria considered to determine the optimal test concentration of IPBC were the reaction index, the positivity ratio, the rate of crescendo reactions, and the relation of IPBC-reactions with MOAHLFA-indices, with irritant reactions to sodium lauryl sulfate, and with positive reactions to the most common standard contact allergens and 4 other preservatives. For statistical evaluations the exact McNemar test was applied and odds ratios were calculated according to the profile likelihood method, as derived from logistic regression analyses. The rate of positive reactions to IPBC increased from 0.5% with IPBC 0.1% to 1.7% with IPBC 0.5%, but there was a problem with sensitivity or specificity with both of these 2 concentrations. Therefore, we focused on IPBC 0.2%(0.8% positive reactions) and IPBC 0.3%(1.3% positive reactions) for further detailed analyses. An evaluation of the related parameters revealed that with IPBC 0.2% as compared to IPBC 0.3% a higher percentage of crescendo reactions, a higher reaction index, a lower number of doubtful reactions, a plausible association of positive reactions with reactions to other preservatives, nd no association with a pronounced skin irritability was found. In conclusion, we recommend to start with IPBC 0.2% for patch testing of all persons with contact dermatitis that may be related to preservatives.

AB  - Objectives:? Contact allergy to grease is a rare cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis and therefore this case is presented. Thin layer chromatograms were used for patch-testing and helped identify the contact sensitizer in the grease. Methods:? Patch-testing, thin layer chromatography and GC-MS. Case report: A previously healthy man working in an industry where brakes for trains were produced presented in the clinic after having developed a rash in the face, on the neck, volar aspects of the arms and dorsum of the hands. The patient's work in part consisted of putting grease on metal parts. The patient was patch-tested with our standard series, a MWF series and materials from work. He tested positively to the grease. A visit to the industry showed a much greater exposure to grease than was suspected. The investigation that followed was performed to identify the sensitizer in the grease. Thin layer chromatography was performed and the patient was tested with chromatograms. Results:? The patient had positive reactions to several allergens in the series including rubber sensitizers of the PPD type and disperse orange 3. A positive reaction was obtained to a spot on the chromatogram of the grease and investigation by GC-MS identified N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine as the sensitizer. Conclusions:? This case underlines the importance of patch testing with work materials and visiting the work environment. A rare case of contact allergy to grease was found and patch-testing with thin layer chromatograms helped identify the allergen, N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine. The identification of the allergen was made by GC-MS.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of the study was to get information on the chemical exposure and the prevalence of skin and respiratory symptoms among Finnish machinists. Methods:? A cross-sectional study was carried out on a population of 961 Finnish machinists. Skin and respiratory symptoms, atopy, exposure at work, etc. were inquired by a telephone interview. Working conditions were assessed and the data were combined with the data from the interview. Technical office personnel in the same companies were used as a control group. Results:? A third of the interviewees reported prolonged rhinitis. A fifth had continuous or relapsing hand or forearm dermatitis, cough, phlegm production or eye symptoms. Wheezing, dyspnea, laryngeal symptoms, or relapsing low fever were reported by 8?2%. 5% reported having asthma. In total, 35% of the machinists considered the skin or respiratory symptoms as work-related. Conclusion:? This study shows that work-related skin and respiratory symptoms are common among machinists in Finland. Those reporting symptoms have been examined in more detail at FIOH. New results of the statistical analysis and medical investigations will be presented.
