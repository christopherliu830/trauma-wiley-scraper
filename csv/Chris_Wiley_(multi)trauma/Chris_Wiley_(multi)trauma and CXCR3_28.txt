AB  - Iodopropynylbutyl carbamate (IPBC)is a preservative that has been increasingly used for skin care products and cosmetics within the last years and the first cases of contact sensitization have meanwhile been reported. Therefore, a surveillance for IPBC contact allergy is now necessary. Our study was aimed to find out a suitable test concentration of IPBC for this purpose. The data 8106 patients tested by 23 centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK)in the time from May 2001 to July 2003 with IPBC in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.5% were retrospectively evaluated. Criteria considered to determine the optimal test concentration of IPBC were the reaction index, the positivity ratio, the rate of crescendo reactions, and the relation of IPBC-reactions with MOAHLFA-indices, with irritant reactions to sodium lauryl sulfate, and with positive reactions to the most common standard contact allergens and 4 other preservatives. For statistical evaluations the exact McNemar test was applied and odds ratios were calculated according to the profile likelihood method, as derived from logistic regression analyses. The rate of positive reactions to IPBC increased from 0.5% with IPBC 0.1% to 1.7% with IPBC 0.5%, but there was a problem with sensitivity or specificity with both of these 2 concentrations. Therefore, we focused on IPBC 0.2%(0.8% positive reactions) and IPBC 0.3%(1.3% positive reactions) for further detailed analyses. An evaluation of the related parameters revealed that with IPBC 0.2% as compared to IPBC 0.3% a higher percentage of crescendo reactions, a higher reaction index, a lower number of doubtful reactions, a plausible association of positive reactions with reactions to other preservatives, nd no association with a pronounced skin irritability was found. In conclusion, we recommend to start with IPBC 0.2% for patch testing of all persons with contact dermatitis that may be related to preservatives.

AB  - Objectives:? Contact allergy to grease is a rare cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis and therefore this case is presented. Thin layer chromatograms were used for patch-testing and helped identify the contact sensitizer in the grease. Methods:? Patch-testing, thin layer chromatography and GC-MS. Case report: A previously healthy man working in an industry where brakes for trains were produced presented in the clinic after having developed a rash in the face, on the neck, volar aspects of the arms and dorsum of the hands. The patient's work in part consisted of putting grease on metal parts. The patient was patch-tested with our standard series, a MWF series and materials from work. He tested positively to the grease. A visit to the industry showed a much greater exposure to grease than was suspected. The investigation that followed was performed to identify the sensitizer in the grease. Thin layer chromatography was performed and the patient was tested with chromatograms. Results:? The patient had positive reactions to several allergens in the series including rubber sensitizers of the PPD type and disperse orange 3. A positive reaction was obtained to a spot on the chromatogram of the grease and investigation by GC-MS identified N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine as the sensitizer. Conclusions:? This case underlines the importance of patch testing with work materials and visiting the work environment. A rare case of contact allergy to grease was found and patch-testing with thin layer chromatograms helped identify the allergen, N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine. The identification of the allergen was made by GC-MS.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of the study was to get information on the chemical exposure and the prevalence of skin and respiratory symptoms among Finnish machinists. Methods:? A cross-sectional study was carried out on a population of 961 Finnish machinists. Skin and respiratory symptoms, atopy, exposure at work, etc. were inquired by a telephone interview. Working conditions were assessed and the data were combined with the data from the interview. Technical office personnel in the same companies were used as a control group. Results:? A third of the interviewees reported prolonged rhinitis. A fifth had continuous or relapsing hand or forearm dermatitis, cough, phlegm production or eye symptoms. Wheezing, dyspnea, laryngeal symptoms, or relapsing low fever were reported by 8?2%. 5% reported having asthma. In total, 35% of the machinists considered the skin or respiratory symptoms as work-related. Conclusion:? This study shows that work-related skin and respiratory symptoms are common among machinists in Finland. Those reporting symptoms have been examined in more detail at FIOH. New results of the statistical analysis and medical investigations will be presented.

AB  - Contact dermatitis among hairdressers is common and is one of the most frequent occupational dematoses due to continual exposure to water, detergents, hair dyes, permanent waves and metal equipment. Use of individual protection systems ? as gloves ? is considered a good measure of prevention. Few data exist about the real permeation resistance (PR) of gloves, also in term of time of PR. We tested two types of djsposable latex gloves different by thickness and density of the manufacture material. We used a permeation cell composed of two separated parts: in the upper part we introduced the hair colouring formulation and in the lower one the collection medium (NaHSO3 1% in water); the two parts were separated by a portion of the glove material. A 100 microL volume of the collection medium was collected and injected onto a HPLC apparatus after 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours. A diode array detector was utilised selecting two wavelengths in the UV range (240 and 275?nm) with a linear concentration gradient up to 60% of methanol/acetonitril mixture. We can simultaneously analyse 9 oxidation dyes and the detection limits were sufficient to determine these substances at very low concentrations. We obtained respectively a breakthrough time less than 24 hours for the lower thickness glove and of over 24 hours for the other one; the latex gloves are suitable for prevent the skin contamination during the preparation of the colourings mixture in the hairdresser activity. The obtained data show those latex gloves, of both thickness, have a very high PR. On the other hand, the use of latex gloves has been associated with the more frequent recognition of immediate-type hypersensitivity responses related to latex products. The prosecution of the study will evaluate the PR of latex-free gloves.

AB  - In dentistry there are many potential allergens and irritants. Patients may have an adverse reaction in minutes, hours or days after dental procedures. Dentists use many metals e.g. mercury in amalgam restorations, which may give an oral lichenoid eruption, and gold, and platinum group metals for inlays, crowns or bridges, which may give allergic reactions. Dentists, for dentures, use acrylate resins extensively and traces of which can give rise to allergic symptoms, though most cases are not ?allergic? in origin. Dental personnel have a high frequency of occupational skin problems and may complain of hand dermatitis or itching, facial eruptions or respiratory symptoms. With regard to oral lichenoid lesions, the proportion of patients allergic to mercury on patch testing varies according to series, from 67% down to 8%. In some cases, the mechanism can be irritant as well as allergic. Gold can cause lichenoid eruption or other changes. The role of palladium is still very difficult to judge. Cheilitis is particularly difficult to investigate, as there are many causes. The aetiology is irritant in 33%, allergic contact dermatitis in 25% and atopic eczema in 20%. Benzoates, antioxidants or flavourings in foods sometimes cause lip swelling. Hand dermatitis is common in dental personnel. Common causes are irritancy, latex contact urticaria, and allergic contact dermatitis to acrylates, Myroxolon, fragrance, thiuram and colophonium. In the investigation of reactions in dental patients many things need to be considered and often the cause is not related to the dental materials suspected.

AB  - Germall 115 and Germall II are well known cosmetic preservatives, widely used as such since the early 1970?s and 1980?s, respectively. This investigation reveals that they have mistakenly been regarded as pure chemical entities with specific structures by the majority of the chemical society. In fact Germall 115 and Germall II both consist of complex mixtures of numerous and fast degradable allantoin-formaldehyde condensation products and may not even contain the conventionally assigned chemical structures of imidazolidinyl urea (Germall 115) and diazolidinyl urea (Germall II). Equilibrium between different structures may be formed in different cosmetic formulations/test materials. This may have led to the discrepancies in the literature: Are the Germalls themselves sensitizers or are the allergic reactions caused by formaldehyde release? The identification and structure assignment of (4-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-4-yl)-urea (HU) will be presented, as it is the major and chemically stable degradation product of both Diazolidinyl urea and Imidazolidinyl urea. A guinea pig maximization test has been performed to determine the potential of HU to induce delayed contact hypersensibility in guinea pigs. Separate chemically stable TRUE Test patches containing the mixtures have shown clinical efficacy.

AB  - Linalool is one of the most frequently used fragrance chemicals in scented products and a large population is exposed to it. It is therefore important to study the allergenic properties of linalool, and the effect of autoxidation. Objectives:? To study the autoxidation of linalool and identify formed oxidation products, to investigate the impact of autoxidation on the sensitizing capacity and to study the frequency of contact allergy to oxidized linalool among consecutive dermatitis patients. Methods:? Linalool was air-exposed and the degradation followed with GC. Oxidation products were identified with GC-MS and NMR. Pure linalool, 2 different states of oxidized linalool and 3 oxidation products were tested for their sensitizing capacity in the local lymph node assay (LLNA). Consecutive dermatitis patients were patch-tested with oxidized linalool and a fraction of oxidized linalool. Results:? Linalool started to decompose immediately when air-exposed. Several oxidation products were identified among which 3 (2 hydroperoxides and an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde) contain structural features that make them potential allergens. LLNA showed that the 3 oxidation products were moderate allergens, and that the sensitizing potential of linalool increased with longer air-exposure times. In the patch-test study positive reactions were observed to oxidized linalool in 1.65% of the patients. Conclusions:? The extensively used fragrance chemical linalool is not allergenic in itself. The autoxidation process that takes place at air-exposure leads to the formation of sensitizing oxidation products. The frequency of consecutive patients reacting to oxidized linalool shows that the experimental findings are clinically important.

AB  - Objectives:? This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between QoL scores for patients with ACD and confounders, such as gender, race, age, and occupation. Methods:? A total of 428 subjects with ACD were, at varying times after diagnosis, mailed a QoL questionnaire modified from Skindex-16 to include an additional 5 items pertaining to occupational impact. The QoL scores were analyzed by gender, race, age, and occupation to ascertain factors that impact QoL in subjects with ACD. Results:? Three of the four confounders examined have a significant connection with QoL in patients with ACD. Non-Caucasians had significantly worse QoL scores than Caucasians within the functioning scale, and had more emotional distress secondary to their disease. There were no statistically significant gender-related differences in QoL scores, although females felt a higher degree of embarrassment and depression. Age significantly impacted items within the functioning and occupational scales, with subjects nearing retirement age and older reporting better QoL. In contrast, younger subjects, especially those in the 5th decade, were more likely to have difficulty pursuing daily activities, have more fear that they might need to leave their jobs, and have more concern for their financial futures. Office workers, students, and homemakers were primarily diagnosed with non-occupational ACD, while more industrial, health care and other wet workers suffered from occupationally related ACD. In the analyses of QoL by occupation, industrial workers reported significantly more impaired QoL than subjects in other professions.

AB  - Objectives: Persistent post-occupational dermatitis (PPOD) was mentioned by Wall and Gebauer in 1991 to describe ongoing skin disease precipitated by occupational contact dermatitis (OCD). There has been little formal recognition or clarification of this condition. Methods: Approximately 1600 records from our Occupational Dermatology Clinic were searched to identify likely cases. PPOD was difficult to diagnose as relatively few patients had been reviewed after initial assessment. Results: A number of patients with reasonably clear histories of persistent occupational contact dermatitis were identified, which followed either irritant or allergic occupational contact dermatitis. These included a 57?yr old male who worked with photographic chemicals, a 51?yr old female food handler and a 25?yr old female food handler who were all diagnosed with irritant contact dermatitis and yet experienced persistent dermatitis even after avoiding the irritants that were associated with causing their dermatitis. A 51?yr old process worker allergic to acrylates, a 28?yr old laboratory worker allergic to rubber accelerators and coconut diethanolamide in her hand wash and a 48?yr old epoxy applicator allergic to epoxy resins experienced recurrent dermatitis for years after avoiding their causative allergens, although with gradual decrease in the frequency of outbreaks of dermatitis. Unfortunately, many patients experienced difficulties with workers? compensation because the persistence of their dermatitis was thought by some medical examiners negate its work-relatedness. Conclusion: There needs to be greater recognition and understanding of PPOD. We are planning to follow-up patients from our clinic to better study and define this condition.

Method:? Twenty patients with a contact allergy to SL were recalled and patch-tested with aqueous, ethanol and acetone extracts of 8 different herbal teas based on Asteraceae plants as well as with parthenolide and other SL. Results:? In 18/20 patients with SL allergy there were positive test reactions to the Asteraceae teas, mainly to those based on German chamomile, dandelion and milfoil. Among the SL, parthenolide was the most frequent co-reactor. Conclusion:? Most patients with a contact allergy to SL are allergic to commercial teas derived from the Asteraceae plant family as well.

AB  - Plastic gloves are made of polymers including polyvinylchloride, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene and polyvinylacetate. Additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers, UV light absorbers, fungicides, bactericides, flame retardants and colourants are added to the polymer, and these are potential allergens. Contact allergy to plastic gloves is rare. The allergen responsible for the sensitization usually remains unknown. An organic pigment, Irgalite Orange F2G, and bisphenol A have both caused contact allergy from household-type PVC gloves. 1 patient with allergic contact dermatitis from his PVC gloves reacted also to tricresyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate, chemicals known to be used as plasticizers in PVC. A plasticizer, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), caused 1 case of contact urticaria from the vinyl chloride slip guard of cotton gloves. 1 patient with contact urticaria from his polyethylene gloves reacted to 3 antioxidants, octadecanoic acid methyl ester and di-tertiary butyl phenol of the gloves on scratch testing. We report 3 additional cases of allergic contact dermatitis from PVC gloves due to bisphenol A. 2 of the patients reacted also to para-tertiary butyl catechol, a polymerization inhibitor in PVC. In chemical analysis, the connection between sensitization to para-tertiary butyl catechol and the use of vinyl gloves could not be proven. We analysed 16 brands of disposable PVC gloves for medical use, covering at least 80% of the Finnish market. We found a very small amount of bisphenol A in 1 brand, and no para-tertiary butyl catechol in any of the gloves. However, bisphenol A should be remembered as a possible allergen in PVC gloves.

AB  - Objective:? To assess the cumulative incidence and characteristics of self reported skin disease in hydrotherapists. Methods:? Hydrotherapists, who had completed a hydrotherapy training course answered a questionnaire in reference to newly appeared skin disease. Data were analyzed statistically. Results:? 190 subjects presently working as hydrotherapists were studied. Of them 75.8% were female and 24.2% were male. 80% of the hydrotherapists worked up to 10 000 cumulative hours defined by the formula: working hours per weeks ? number of weeks per year ? years of work in the pool. 85 of the subjects (45%) reported on the development of skin disease for the first time after starting work at the swimming pool. 21 (11.8%) had a preexisting skin disease. The most frequent symptoms included pruritus, burning, stinging, erythematous patches and xerotic skin on the extremities, trunk and folds. A statistically significant relationship between the cumulative working time and the incidence of dermatological pathology compatible with contact dermatitis was found. Conclusions:? The incidence of self reported skin diseases, developing for the first time or due to exacerbation of preexisting dermatological conditions, in hydrotherapists working in swimming pools is high. Statistically significant relationship between the cumulative hours of immersion in the pool and the incidence of the dermatological pathology was observed suggesting a dose response relationship between exposure and effect.

AB  - Skin problems are often regarded as part of the job in wet occupations. Bad habits as not using protective gloves and moisturizers are often justified by the workers and ignored by the management. To change habits at the shop floor, involvement of the whole organisation is necessary. The objective of an intervention in 6 gut-cleaning departments was to implement good habits by establishing a safety management system to manage skin risk. Local teams with representatives from all levels of the organisation were trained to run the process. Each team included 2?5 gut-cleaners, who should embody good habits and supervise their colleagues. Implementation research studies evaluate the understanding and acceptance of the intervention at the workplace and the association of the implementation and the reduction of work related diseases. Data are collected from questionnaires, interviews, written documents, etc. The change after one year in the frequency of eczema on hands and forearms within the past 3 months, varied in the 6 departments from a minor increase to a 2/3 reduction. 3 months after the start of the intervention the gut-cleaners in the team were asked to grade their expectations for success on a scale from 1 to 10; 10 being the optimum. The average grade varied from 4,8 to 10, indicating very different local expectations to the colleagues? acquisition of new habits. Further data and analysis will show if there is a covariance between the local changes in eczema frequency and the degree of implementation.

AB  - Introduction:? A recent survey of the UK printing industry found a prevalence of 11% of occupational contact dermatitis (OCD), much higher than previously identified. Objective:? This pilot study aimed to evaluate risk reduction strategies derived from recommendations of a literature review of preventive intervention studies and a series of focus groups of printers and observations of printers undertaking their normal duties. Methods:? Four interventions were evaluated: (1) Provision of gloves of the correct size/type, plus use of an after-work skin cream; (2) Provision of information; (3) Provision of skin checks; (4) Development of best practice skin care policy. Each intervention was evaluated in two companies over a three-month period, at the end of which printers and managers were interviewed as to the effectiveness and acceptability of each intervention. Results:? Although this pilot study was short, all interventions were acceptable to some extent. The prevalence of frank dermatitis fell over the study period, particularly in intervention (3). Intervention (1) achieved an improvement of awareness in both management and workforce and an increase in the use of both gloves and cream. Intervention (2) highlighted problems of dissemination and the need for relevant information in an appropriate format. However. no single intervention was completely effective. Conclusions:? This qualitative research approach forms an essential first stage to improving understanding of ways in which OCD may be reduced among workers in the printing industry, and points towards the need for further testing of preventive strategies in larger-scale intervention trials, in printing and other industries.

AB  - Introduction:? Occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) is very common in the printing industry due to contact with chemicals, paper, and wet work. It can be avoided by adequate protective measures, but the effectiveness of intervention depends heavily on the employer?s and employee?s awareness of this health risk. Objectives:? The study aimed to collect information on the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of print workers about the risk of OCD and methods of prevention. Methods:? A series of focus groups were held with print workers, health and safety officers and managers to discuss their awareness of dermal risk factors, risk behaviour at work, attitudes to health and safety and options on possible preventive measures. A number of companies were also visited to observe, overtly and covertly, the normal work practices. Results:? OCD was not perceived to be either a major problem or a health and safety priority. There was general agreement about the processes and work practices that could cause skin problems. However, work practices varied considerably and did not always reflect this awareness. There was general concern about the type and availability of personal protective equipment, especially gloves and after-work skin cream. The provision of an occupational health service was generally felt to be inadequate, and no company had a policy in place that specifically addressed skin care. Conclusions:? These findings highlight the urgency to intensify health and safety education on skin care within the printing industry. Recommendations were developed for the evaluation of a series of risk reduction strategies.

AB  - Cultured monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) have been shown to provide a promising alternative for identifying potential sensitisers in vitro. Allergen induced moDC maturation results in elevated expression of the cell surface markers CD83 and CD86. Unfortunately, this increase in CD83 and CD86 expression is not sensitive enough to identify moderate and weak contact sensitisers. In this study, we investigated whether chemokine production by moDC is increased upon maturation and, ultimately, whether chemokine production can be used as a sensitive method to discriminate allergens from irritants. Methods:? MoDC were exposed for 48 hours to allergens (NiSO4, CoCl2, PdCl2, CuSO4, CrCl3, K2Cr2O7, PPDA and DNCB) and irritants (SDS, DMSO, BCl2 and propan-1-ol). CD83 and CD86 expression was analysed by flow cytometric determination and chemokine production (CXCL8, CCL5, CCL17 and CCL20) was determined by ELISA. Results:? Exposure to strong allergens caused up-regulation of CD83 and CD86 expression whereas exposure to irritants did not. Remarkably, increased CXCL8 production by moDC was detected after allergen exposure whereas a decrease in CXCL8 production was observed after irritant exposure. CCL20 production was induced only by NiSO4. CCL5 and CCL17 production was increased upon exposure to both allergens and irritants. Conclusion:? CXCL8 production by moDC can be used to distinguish allergens from irritants. This chemokine is a potentially novel marker for determining the sensitising capacity of a chemical in vitro. Furthermore, our results suggest an important role for CXCL8 in the sensitization phase of ACD.

AB  - Safe exposure limits for the elicitation of fragrance contact allergy have been a subject of research in several EU-funded studies, against the background of high frequencies of contact allergy to certain fragrance ingredients. Elicitation studies can be easily performed in already sensitised individuals, they bear no ethical problems and by using simulated realistic exposures, safe thresholds relevant for exposure can be determined. The challenge in establishing safe thresholds for fragrance ingredients is the many different applications and thus potential exposures to fragrances. Deodorant exposures have been regarded a worst case assumption model for safety assessment and the fragrance ingredients: isoeugenol, hydroxycitronellal and cinnamic aldehyde, have been studied, showing that current exposure to these ingredients in some deodorants exceeds the safe limits for elicitation. Recent investigations show that the impact of fragrance allergy on hand eczema may need to be looked at a different angle, as it appears that it is more the combined exposures to several allergens and irritants that matters than the action of a single ingredient. At the moment, studies are being performed to elucidate whether dose-response patch test data can be used more systematically as the basis of safety assessments. This will make studies even easier and it will be possible to provide data on more allergens than at the present time.

AB  - A 8 year old boy was seen in our department with a allergic contact dermatits to a temporary tattoo done at his arm 1 week before. It was the third temporary tattoo (called ?henna? tattoo) done over a 3 month period of school holidays. He was treated with topical corticosteroid and reobserved with an residual hypopigmentation. He was patch tested with our standard series with positive reaction to p-phenylenediamine; later test with ?henna? powder was negative. Temporary ?henna? tattoos are very popular, specially during holidays. Several cases are reported in the literature of sensitization to p-phenylenediamine, contained in the henna tincture, but few of these are pediatric cases. It is important to discouraged the use of these tattoos, due to the consequences that a sensitization to p-phenylenediamine could have in their future.

AB  - A fifty five year-old man had experienced itching sensation when he applied analgesic plasters for his lumbago. He tried to use several kinds of analgesic plasters, however he felt itching sensation whenever he used them. He applied a plaster containing ferbinac for his left elbow joint?s pain on April 2003. On the next day, an itching erythema developed on the area where the plaster was applied. He was treated with a difluprednate ointment, and his dermatitis gradually improved. He visited our clinic for precise medical examination for finding out the causative agent of his dermatitis on May 13, 2003. We conducted 48 hours closed patch testing with the plaster he used and it?s ingredients. He reacted positively to the plaster containing ferbinac and crotamiton 5%p that was used for dissolute the active drug. He also reacted positively to a cream containing ketoprofen, however he reacted negatively to ketoprofen 1%p. Crotamoton was also used in the ketoprofen cream.

AB  - Because of its numerous etiologies, foot dermatitis can be difficult to diagnose despite of thorough history and physical examination. The differential diagnoses are challenging and include allergic contact dermatitis, dyshidrosis, juvenile plantar dermatosis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus. Methods:? In the Cutaneous Allergology Unit of the Department of Dermatovenereology of Pedro Hispano Hospital, between 1999 and 2003, 804 patients were observed with suspicion of contact dermatitis. In 9,3% there was a history of recurrent foot dermatitis. All these patients were patch tested with GPEDC standard and shoe series and shoe fragments. Results:? Twenty-five patients revealed shoe contact dermatitis with positive reactions to the series tested, with an average age of 40 years. The dermatitis involved the dorsal aspect of the foot in 20 patients and the volar aspect in 8, the lateral aspects in 4, typically sparing the instep and flexural creases of the toes. The most common allergen were para-tertiary-butylphenol formaldehyde resin ? PTBFR (12 patients-48%), mercapto mix (7 patients-28%), potassium dichromate (24%), mercaptobenzothiazole (24%). Conclusions:? The most common causes of shoe contact dermatitis were glues, followed by rubber components and chromated leather. As in other studies the most common allergen in shoe dermatitis in Portugal is PTBFR in neoprene adhesives. Rubber components (accelerators) were the second more frequent allergen in this study, probably a direct result of improved fixation of chrome and a change in footwear style and chrome sensitivity explains leather allergy. Other causes of foot contact dermatitis are iatrogenic complication, clothing (socks), cosmetics, adhesive tape and professional etiology.
