AB  - Summary The use of adult stem cells to regenerate damaged tissue circumvents the moral and technical issues associated with the use of those from an embryonic source. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be isolated from a variety of tissues, most commonly from the bone marrow, and, although they represent a very small percentage of these cells, are easily expandable. Recently, the use of MSC has provided clinical benefit to patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, graft-versus-host disease and myocardial infarction. The cellular cues that enabled the MSC to be directed to the sites of tissue damage and the mechanisms by which MSC then exert their therapeutic effect are becoming clearer. This review discusses the relative therapeutic importance of the ability of MSC to differentiate into multiple cell lineages or stimulate resident or attracted cells via a paracrine mode of action. It also reviews recent findings that MSC home to damaged tissues in a similar, but somewhat distinct, manner to that of leucocytes via the utilisation of adhesion molecules, such as selectins and integrins, and chemokines and their receptors in a manner reminiscent of leucocytes trafficking from the blood stream to inflammatory sites.

AB  - Introduction:? Chronic, nonhealing wounds are often observed in tissues with poor oxygen supply. Impaired reepithelialization is a hallmark of these wounds; however, the pathogenesis of the retarded reepithelialization in chronic, ischemic wounds remains poorly understood. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) is involved in both normal and hypoxic wound healing response and exogenous overexpression of Smad3, a TGF-beta signaling intermediate, has been known to accelerate reepithelialization. In a recent study, Ad-Smad3 injection in the rabbit ear dermal ulcer model showed enhanced reepithelialization and granulation tissue area suggesting a positive effect of Smad3 on wound healing. However, little is known about the role of Smad3 in the ischemic wound healing process. In this study we examined the effect of Smad3 in an ischemic wound model. Methods:? Ad-Smad3 or LacZ (108?pfu/wound) empty vector was injected in either ear of White New Zealand Rabbits. Twenty-four hours later, these ears were rendered ischemic using an established model and four 7-mm full-thickness punch wounds were made on each ear. Results:? Histological evaluation showed a highly significant increase in reepithelialization, epithelial ingrowth and percentage of epithelialization in Ad-Smad3 transfected wounds versus ischemic wounds transfected with LacZ-empty vector (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Our data confirm the enhancing effect of Smad3 on reepithelialization in an ischemic wound model. The deficiency in reepithelialization, as evident in chronic ischemic wounds, could thus be ameliorated by excess Smad3. Therapeutic interventions using overexpressed Smad3 may improve wound healing through accelerated epithelialization in chronic wounds.

AB  - Introduction:? Early excision and closure is standard for severe burn management. Cadaver skin is generally used as temporary coverage if autograft donor sites are inadequate. However, it is associated with an inherent risk of antigenicity and infection and has a limited shelf life and availability. Use of Integra?, a dermal substitute, is well established for postburn reconstruction, but its efficacy as primary coverage for severe burns it is not well documented. Therefore the aim of the present study was to determine the short- and long-term efficacy of Integra? as an acute cover. Method:? Twenty children with >40 total body surface area (TBSA) burn, were randomized to be grafted with Integra? or with the autograft-allograft technique. Short-term outcome measures such as length of hospital stay, mortality, incidence of infection/sepsis, cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic indexes were compared between and within groups before and after Integra?/graft application. Long-term outcome measures such as number of reconstructive procedures and blinded scar scoring were performed up to 2 years postinjury. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and unpaired t-test. Values are expressed as Mean?±?SEM and significance accepted at p?<?0.05. Results:? There were no significant differences between groups, in burn size (Controls 74?±?4% and Integra? 70?±?5%), mortality (Control 30%, Integra? 40%), length of hospital stay (Control 39?±?4 days, Integra? 41?±?4 days), and metabolic rates. In addition, there was no significant incidence of infection or sepsis in the Integra? group compared to controls. Long-term follow-up (Integra n?=?5, control n?=?5) revealed a significantly improved scar, in terms of height, thickness, vascularity, and maturity, in the Integra? group compared to the control group, at 12 months and 18?24 months postburn, (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Integra? can be safely used for immediate wound coverage in children with severe burns, with better functional and aesthetic outcomes up to 2 years postinjury.

AB  - A prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded study of diabetic foot ulcers was conducted to answer questions of safety and impact on wound healing of a noncontact ultrasound device. Standard of care included moist dressings, debridement, offloading, and adequacy vascular supply for both groups. Patients were randomized to receive a saline mist or 40?KHz ultrasound therapy delivered to the wound bed using the spray as the coupler. The study was 12 weeks in duration or until the wound closed. Sixty-six patients were entered with intent to treat. Fifty-five patients were evaluable and constitute the outcomes of the study. MIST therapy resulted in 42.3% rate of healing versus 14.3% for sham treated significant at 0.028 Chi square. Kaplan Meier survival plots resulted in p?<?0.0087?log rank and p?<?0.011 Wilcoxon. Rate of wound closure was 22% faster with MIST compared to sham treated patients. There was no statistically significant difference with regard to adverse events in any category (mild, moderate, or severe) MIST ultrasound therapy is a new, safe, novel FDA-cleared device that improves diabetic foot ulcer healing compared to standard of care. Details of the study will be presented. Acknowledgments:? This study was funded by Celleration Inc. Eden Prairie, MN.

AB  - Introduction:? Cyclophilin C-associated protein (CyC-AP) expression is up-regulated during wound healing. CyC-AP deletion causes greater expression of TNFα, MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14 during cutaneous repair. Furthermore, CyC-AP is a mediator for fibronectin-fragment induced MMP-13 expression. In order to understand the effects of the deletion of CyC-AP at the cellular level, we investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathways of CyC-AP null and wild-type mice during skin wound healing. Methods:? Two-month-old CyC-AP null or wild-type mice were anesthetized and two 0.6?cm diameter excisional skin wounds were made on the dorsum of each mouse. Wounds were collected up to 10 days after injury. Total protein was purified from each wound and the protein expression of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE), integrin beta 1, ERK 1, ERK 2, p38, PCNA, and smooth muscle actin (sm-actin) was analyzed by immunoblot. Results:? TNFα expression was higher in CyC-AP null mice in unwounded skin. However, the elevated TNFα in CyC-AP null wounds was lower compared to the wild-type mice. To further understand the relationship of CyC-AP and TNFα, TACE expression was examined. TACE expression was less in the skin of CyC-AP null mice compared to wild-type mice. Expression of p38 and PCNA increased while sm-actin decreased in both unwounded and wounded CyC-AP null skin compared to wild type. PCNA expression in CyC-AP null fibroblasts was also higher compared to wild type, supporting our in vivo observations. In addition, the expression of integrin beta 1 was lower during wound healing. Conclusion:? The increased PCNA and decreased sm-actin expression suggests that CyC-AP null fibroblasts have higher proliferation and lower differentiation rates compared to wild types. These effects might be regulated through the p38 signaling pathway, which was increased in CyC-AP null mice. The decreased TACE expression in CyC-AP null skin suggests CyC-AP may also regulate TACE via the altered expression of integrin beta 1. Our data suggest CyC-AP is involved in TNFα activation.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that cyclic mechanical stretching exerts anti-inflammatory effects on rabbit chondrocytes. But whether mechanical stretching has similar effects on human tendon fibroblasts are not known. This study therefore aimed to test the hypothesis that cyclic mechanical stretching regulates IL-1? induced COX-2 gene expression in a stretching magnitude-dependent manner. In custom-made silicone dishes, human patellar tendon fibroblasts (HPTFs) were grown on microgrooved culture surfaces, with which the shape and organization of HPTFs in vivo were closely mimicked. To induce inflammatory responses in HPTFs, 10?pM of IL-1? was added to the culture medium. A 4% or 8% cyclic uniaxial stretching was then applied to silicone dishes for 4?hrs using a custom-design stretching apparatus. After the end of stretching, total RNA of stretched and nonstretched tendon fibroblasts was collected, and RT-PCR was performed for measuring COX-2?mRNA expression levels. We found that tendon fibroblasts subjected to 4% stretching decreased COX-2?mRNA expression level by 20%(p?=?0.0002; n?=?6) compared to that of nonstretched, IL-1?-treated cells. However, cells subjected to 8% stretching showed a 39% increase (p?=?0.007, n?=?6) in COX-2?mRNA expression. Thus, the results of this study suggest that small stretching (4%) has anti-inflammatory effects on HPTFs in a mildly inflammatory environment such as that induced by 10?pM of IL-1?. In contrast, large stretching (8%) may amplify inflammatory responses of tendon fibroblasts. Therefore, physical therapy with low levels of tendon stretching may be beneficial in reducing mild tendon inflammation. Supported by the Arthritis Investigator Award and NIHAR049921 (JHW)

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) continue to present a formidable challenge in terms of morbidity and healthcare costs. Increasing evidence ascertains the important role of Matrix Metallo-Proteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors TIMPS in wound healing. Imbalance of MMPs in the DFU microenvironment has been associated with poor wound healing. Current research is directed toward therapeutic agents that could redress the imbalance of MMPs?/?TIMPs. Polyhydrated Ionogens (PHIs) formulation is based on metallic ions and citric acid. PHI application aims to positively restore MMP ratios within chronic wounds. This initial multicenter pilot study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the PHI formulation in achieving stable wound closure in recalcitrant DFUs. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients with therapy resistant DFUs of at least 2?cm2 and 3 months duration were treated with PHI formulation in an acetate carrier dressing. Wound debridement, digital imaging, and wound perimeter tracing were performed weekly. Serum samples and punch biopsies were taken from random ulcers for quantitative MMP/TIMP analysis at three time points to assess feasibility of this method. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Results:? Stable wound closure with high patient satisfaction was achieved in 15 (75%) DFUs. MMP/TIMP ratios within different healing phases were delineated. Discussion:? This pilot study?s encouraging results prompt us to further investigate the PHI efficacy in DFU treatment in a Web-based, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

AB  - We are studying in the role of endogenous electric fields in mammalian skin wound healing. The epidermis generates a transepithelial potential (TEP) of 20?50?mV across itself, inside positive. Any wound or break in the epidermis creates a low resistance pathway and the TEP at the wound site is 0?mV. However, the TEP of the intact epidermis around the wound is still present, resulting in a lateral voltage gradient or electric field along the skin surrounding the wound. We have evidence that this lateral electric field stimulates keratinocytes in the area to migrate towards the wound with the optimal response occurring at a field strength of 100?mV/mm. In order to determine the actual field strength present in mammalian wounds, we have developed a new instrument called the Bioelectric Field Imager (BFI). The BFI vibrates a small sensor perpendicular to the skin about 200??m above the surface and uses the capacitance signal to determine the surface potential of the epidermis just beneath the stratum corneum. By measuring this surface potential in many positions around the wound, we generate a spatial map of the surrounding electric field. We have measured the wound field near a 1?mm long, full thickness skin wound in mice. A field of 100?200?mV/mm is present immediately following wounding and persists until wound healing is complete. The topical application of a blocker of Na+ channels (amiloride) reduces this wound field by about 50%, supporting the hypothesis that it is generated by the TEP. Preliminary measurements on human skin wounds detect lateral electric fields that are similar to those measured in mice. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Tissue repair and wound healing are complex processes that involve inflammation, granulation, and tissue remodeling. Angiogenesis plays a central role in wound healing. Previously, we have shown that picroliv, a natural product obtained from the roots of Picrorhiza kurrooa upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and insulin like growth factor (IGF) in rats during hypoxia (Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 1999; 56: 348?55). In the present study, we have investigated the effect of Picroliv in an ex vivo rat aorta ring model of angiogenesis. Picroliv enhanced the sprouting and migration of endothelial cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of picroliv in both unimpaired and dexamethasone (DX)-induced impaired cutaneous healing in a full thickness punch wound model in rats. The animals in the impaired healing group having been pretreated with DX. We studied the tissues by histology and morphometry. The data showed picroliv treatment resulted in improved reepithelialization, neovascularization, and migration of various cells such as endothelial, dermal myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts into the wound bed. Immunohistochemical localization showed an increased VEGF and alpha smooth muscle actin staining consistent with increased number of micro vessels in granulation tissue. These findings suggest that picroliv accelerated wound repair and thus could be developed as a therapeutic angiogenic agent for the wound healing.

AB  - Electrospinning is a nonmechanical processing strategy that is used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of submicron diameter, banded fibrils of collagen. In biocompatibility tests these fibers are nonimmunogenic. Fiber diameter can be manipulated over a wide range by regulating the concentration of collagen present in the starting electrospinning solutions. Table 1 illustrates average fiber diameters and pore dimensions achieved under different conditions. Collagen Concentration Fiber Diameter Pore Area 40?mgs/ml TFE ???113?±?51?nm ????184?±?87.6?nm2 60?mgs/ml TFE ???304?±?120?nm ?1,311?±?384?nm2 80?mgs/ml TFE ???761?±?276?nm ?4,913?±?3978?nm2 100?mgs/ml TFE ???745?±?314?nm ?5,039?±?2947?nm2 120?mgs/ml TFE 1,534?±?448?nm 19,154?±?20809?nm2 We prepared four 1?cm2 full thickness dermal injuries on the dorsum of the guinea pig. Electrospun scaffolds composed of different fiber diameters were cut to fit the defects, sutured in place and then recovered at 7 and 14 days. Injuries treated with scaffolds composed of electrospun collagen fibers greater than 300?nm in diameter exhibited extensive tongue formation, dense dermal cell infiltration and functional capillary beds. Dermal regeneration was substantially complete by 14 days. Scaffolds prepared with individual fiber diameters of less than 300?nm were well epithelialized but, less densely 'populated by dermal fibroblasts and capillaries. Fibrils of electrospun gelatin, a collagen isolate that is heat denatured prior to electrospinning, lack the banded appearance of electrospun collagen. Scaffolds of electrospun gelatin were less densely infiltrated than electrospun collagen at all fiber diameters and pore dimensions, and induced inflammation. We conclude that banded fibrils of electrospun collagen have unique biological activity. Funded in part NIH R01 EB003087. US & International Patents Issued and Pending.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars can be reduced by application of silicone dressing; however, the detailed mechanism of silicone action is still unknown. It is known that silicone gel sheets cause a hydration of the epidermal layer of the skin. An in vitro coculture experiment has shown that hydration of keratinocytes has a suppressive effect on the metabolism of the underlying fibroblasts resulting in reduced collagen deposition. We tested the hypothesis that silicone gel sheeting in vivo has a beneficial effect on scar reduction by a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation, with a resulting reduction in dermal thickness. Silicone adhesive gel sheets were applied to scars in our rabbit ear model of hypertrophic scarring 14 days post wounding for a total of 14 days. Scarring was measured in this model by the Scar Elevation Index (SEI), a ratio of the scar height over normal skin, and the Epidermal Thickness Index (ETI), a ratio of the epidermal height of the scar over normal epidermis. Ultrastructural changes were investigated using electron microscopy (EM). SEIs were significantly reduced after only 2-week applications of silicone gel sheets versus untreated scars (1.18?±?0.05 vs. 1.45?±?0.09, respectively; P?<?0.05)? corresponding to a 48.8% reduction of scar hypertrophy. The epidermal layer in scars was in general thicker than in unwounded skin. However, ETIs of untreated scars increased by 103% versus 71% after silicone gel treatment ? corresponding to a significant reduction of epidermal thickness by 24.4%. EM showed a basal layer in untreated scars that was very different than normal skin with many vacuoles at the basement membrane level, while silicone gel-treated scars had a basal cell layer which resembled unwounded epidermis. Our findings demonstrate that 2 weeks of silicone gel application at a very early onset of scarring reduces dermal thickness which appears to be due to a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation. These findings are consistent with our coculture results.
