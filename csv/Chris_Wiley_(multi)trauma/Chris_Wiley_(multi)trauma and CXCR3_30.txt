AB  - Background:? PTD, a component of oxidative hair dyes, is a frequent sensitizer in hairdressers. Investigations on the stability of the patch test preparation PTD 1% pet. revealed a decline of the PTD concentration to 0.1% within 6 months, possibly due to a reaction of PTD molecules to dye complexes. This raises the question if the long-term diagnostic quality of the PTD preparation is hampered by chemical changes. Objective:? To systematically compare intra-individually patch test results obtained with three PTD patch test preparations of different age, tested synchronously in a multicenter study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG). Methods:? 3 PTD preparations, produced in January 2002 (batch A), August 2001 (batch B), and April 2001 (batch C), were patch tested in 177 patients from March to December 2002. Patch testing was performed blinded, with respect to the production date. Results:? There were 150 concordant reactions to batch A, B, and C, i.e. 133 negative, 1 doubtful (?), 11 weak positive (+), 3 strong positive (++ and +++), and 2 irritant reactions. In 27 patients, discordant reactions to batch A, B, and C had been observed. Altogether, 22 positive reactions were noted to batch A, and 19 to batch B and C, respectively (difference not significant). There was no clear cut time trend concerning the occurrence of positive or discordant reactions. Conclusions:? Reproducibility of patch test reactions was within a normal range. The chemical changes mentioned above apparently do not affect the diagnostic quality of the PTD patch test preparation.

AB  - Objective:? The first Spanish patch-test study of patients with contact dermatitis was performed in 1977. We aimed to determine the prevalence of hypersensitivity for Spanish standard allergens in patients suspected of contact dermatitis in 2001. Methods:? A total of 3832 patients of 13 dermatological centers were patch-tested with Spanish standard series. Age, gender, occupation, dermatitis site and type, and positive patch test were tabulated. Results:? 2300 female and 1532 male patients, aged 0 to 70 years were observed with contact dermatitis. Origin of eczema was occupational in 16.66% of patients. Eczema was located on hands in 54.34% of cases. Allergic contact dermatitis in 31.02% and irritative contact dermatitis in 15.88% were the most frequent diagnosis. Positive patch tests was observed in 55.11% of patients. Prevalence of positives reaction was obtained with nickel (26.64%), cobalt (9.89%), chrome (8.66%), PPDA (5.27%), thimerosal (5.21%), fragance mix (5.03%), Kathon CG (4.04%) and thiuram mix (2.87%). Conclusions:? The results emphasize that nickel, cobalt, chrome are by far the most common allergens. A increase in the frequency of allergic patch test reactions to nickel has been noted (18,78 in 1977; 26,64 in 2001). However the contact sensitivity to cobalt, chrome and thiuram mix has decreased. Currently, allergy to cosmetics constitutes a significant portion of the cases of contact dermatitis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of contact sensitization to preservatives in a pediatric population and to compare the data to our previous findings referring to the period 1988?1994. From January 1995 to December 2002, 1255 patients aged 7 months-12 years, 583 boys and 672 girls, with suspected allergic contact dermatitis underwent patch testing with our pediatric series of 30 allergens including 5 different preservatives: methyldibromoglutaronitrile, methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone, imidazolidinyl urea, paraben mix, and formaldehyde. Of the 1255 children tested, 108 (8.6%), 52 boys and 56 girls, showed positive reactions to 1 or more of the preservatives listed above. In particular, 55 subjects reacted to methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone, 22 to methyldibromoglutaronitrile, 20 to paraben mix, 17 to formaldehyde, and 13 to imidazolidinyl urea. Among our preservative-positive children, 77% of patients reacted to other haptens of the series, and 44% were affected by atopic dermatitis. In comparison with our previous data referring to the period 1988?1994, a significant increase has been observed in the frequency of positive reactions to methyldibromoglutaronitrile, paraben mix, and formaldehyde. Our findings confirm the importance of patch testing children with preservatives since the wider and wider use of cosmetics in the pediatric age.

AB  - Objectives:? To show cases of contact dermatitis (CD) provoked by different factors and possibility of their treatment with ozone application. Methods:? Description of clinical cases: Patient S., female, 17 years old, came to dermatologist with complaints on erythema and vesicles, sense of burning on the face during two weeks. The patient works on the market, exposures by sun. As a result of a talk with the patient, new perfume as a possible reason of photoallergic reaction was suspected. The patient was successfully treated by use of ozone therapy: 6 autochemotherapy minor (AHTmin) treatments were applied. By the end of the course crusts and hyperpigmentation only were observed. Patient T., male, 36 years old, suffered from erythema and vesicles, itching and sense of burning on both hands and arms for 3 days. During weekend he had contact with cow-parsnip plant. The patient got 5 AHT minor treatments: clinical recovery was registered. Patient S., 36 years old, frosted his hands two weeks ago. When he came to dermatologist, erythema, vesicles, erosions and crusts on the backs of the hands were observed. Ozone therapy (AHTmin ? 5 treatments plus ozonized water externally) was successfully applied: full recovery was registered. Summary of results:? Different cases of CD were successfully treated by ozone therapy use. Conclusions:? CD provoked by different factors can be cured with ozone.

AB  - It is well known that a subtle balance exists between consumer desire to use hair dyes of various kinds and the sensitizing effects of particular dye ingredients. Of these, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) is the mostly commonly reported contact allergen and which serves as a general model for hair dye allergy. PPD is reported as a strong sensitizer in all predictive tests; it is fairly commonly identified as a contact allergen in diagnostic patch testing, with relevance to hair dye ACD being about 50%. Whilst it may not be possible always to eliminate, or even greatly reduce, the extent to which sensitisation is induced, a final opportunity for limiting the degree of ACD occurs at the elicitation phase. Here, ensuring the extent of skin exposure is below the level at which all except the most strongly sensitized will react can provide clear consumer benefits. To achieve this aim, it is necessary to ensure a full appreciation of the variables impacting the elicitation of ACD exist. To this end, series of investigations of the elicitation of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) sensitization has been conducted. In particular, the impact of duration and frequency of exposure on elicitation has been studied. Using groups of PPD sensitized volunteers, in patch tests and repeated open application tests, we have shown that exposures of only a few minutes are often without consequence in such individuals, except where the exposure is often repeated and/or the individual is highly allergic. With volunteers who were 1+ or 2+ positive to the diagnostic patch test, and where exposure to PPD was at 0.5%?1.0% in a short contact rinse-off hair colouring product, no scalp reactions were experienced. It is our view that the establishment of safe exposure limits to contact allergens should be based wherever possible on a detailed assessment of the risk to sensitized humans.

AB  - A 60-year-old non atopic was referred to our Unit due to the onset of severe eczematous contact dermatitis on the lumbar region, following repeated applications of a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) with flurbiprofen for lumbar pain. Patch testing with the SIDAPA (Italian Society of Allergological, Occupational and Environmental Dermatology) standard series, the TTS as is and the constituents of TTS, including flurbiprofen 2% pet., isopropyl myristate 5% pet., polysorbate 80 5% pet., sorbitan sesquioleate 20% pet., peppermint oil 2% pet. and menthol 1% pet. gave a strong positive reaction to TTS, peppermint oil and menthol and a weak reaction to fragrance mix. Allergic contact dermatitis to peppermint oil and its principal constituent (menthol) is rare. Isolated cases of patients with oral symptoms after the use of mentholated cigarettes, toothpaste flavours and fragrances have been reported. Peppermint oil and menthol are used in TTS with anti-inflammatory activity for their anesthetic properties and their vasodilatation effects that aid topical drug penetration. Reapplication of the device to the same site, the irritant action of the vehicle or adhesive, the length of occlusion, associated with warm and humid climates, may promote sensitization to menthol otherwise rarely a cause of contact dermatitis, when used in products designed for a brief contact with the oral mucosa. In contact allergies induced by TTS-treatment patch tests are needed to make a precise identification of the causative agent.

AB  - Background:? Occupation related dermatitis is a common problem in health care workers, especially in nurses, who are exposed to a wide variety of allergenic and irritant substances. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence rate of skin symptoms among personnel handling chemical disinfectants and to examine which allergens were important. Methods:? We investigated 460 randomly selected health care workers (HCW), who had constant contact with chemical disinfectants during their work. The study was performed by means of a questionnaire, a medical examination, skin patch test using Finn chambers and glutaraldehyde, benzalkonium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and chlorine compounds at 0,1, 0,5 and 1,0% wat. Results:? 241 HCW (52,5%) described various skin symptoms they attributed to disinfectant exposure. Generally, these symptoms were mild and ranged from pruritis to hand eczema. Of these 66 (14,4%) tested were skin patch test positive. Of the 460 HCW tested, 37 (8%) had positive patch test reactions to benzalkonium chloride, 22 (4,8%) to chlorine compounds, 18 (4%) to glutaraldehyde, 6 (1,2%) to hydrogen peroxide. 5 HCW (7,6%) testing positive to disinfectants gave no history of reactivity to them. History of atopic dermatitis was found in 50 (10,9%) and it was associated with diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis and positive patch test reactions to benzalkonium chloride. Also positive patch tests reactions were associated with frequent use of latex gloves in contrast to those, which used latex gloves while working constantly or didn?t use them at all. Conclusions:? 1. Skin symptoms related to work with chemical disinfectants are common, but mostly mild. 2. Benzalkonium chloride is one of the strongest sensitizing disinfectants used in health care professions, especially for atopic persons who do not take measures of protection during exposure to it.

AB  - The production of jewellery is currently mostly industrial and the jewellers perform only one or two stages in the manufacturing process. The jewellers make jewellery by hand in small workshops and are more polyvalent: they shape the metal with pliers or hand tools or cast it in moulds, assemble the individual parts with glues, carve metal, diamonds and other stones, clean metals with soaps and ultrasonic baths. The occupational dermatitis is of irritant nature (acid and alkalis in metal cleaners, soaps, detergents, metal dust, abrasions from polishing wheels and emery paper, heat, adhesives, etc) and allergic nature (potassium dichromate, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, ammoniated mercury, carba mix, epoxy resin, mercapto mix, formaldehyde, nickel, colophony). We report the cases of two jewellers working in workshops. A 47 year old atopic woman already known for a sensitivity to metals (nickel, potassium dichromate and cobalt) developed recurrent vesiculo-pustular erythematous lesions of both palms with occasional infections treated with systemic antibiotics and topical steroids. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, woods, and personal series. There were positive?+?reactions at 96?h to colophony, palladium, and personal waxes. Information obtained through the manufacturer revealed colophony in the waxes frequently used by jewellers to fix the precious stones to woods and metal allowing the stones to be carved. A 47 years old atopic man working as a jeweller for 32 years developed recurrent eczematous lesions of the fingers of the right hand. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, preservatives, plastics, acrylates and personals series and were positive?+?+?at 96?h for urea formaldehyde, diethylenetriamine, araldite hardener and the soap used to clean the jewels. Uncommonly this contact allergy is not due to the epoxy resins themselves but to the hardener. The urea formaldehyde and the diethylenetriamine are in fact used as epoxy resins hardeners. There were no reactions to the araldite resin but there was one to its hardener. In conclusion we report two unusual cases of hand contact dermatitis in jewellers. Because jewellers are exposed to a variety of substances, to detect the allergens the inquiry must be accurate and extensive patch testing may be required. Common allergens are compounds of uncommon substances and tools and uncommon allergens are compounds of well-known sensitizers.

AB  - The aim of the work is to present the incidence and the main reasons for this illness at women who live in very bad and poor conditions, in town and in village. Material and methods:? 137 women were included, who were inspected during the time period of 8 months in 2003. A proper therapy was introduced-per os and in loco, and all of them were controled for 14 days. Results:? All together, 137 women were inspected and they were classified by their age, place of leaving and nationality. The detail anamnesis showed that 80% are housewifes who live in poverty and who are in contact with detergents everyday, becouse they do the dish-washing and the laundry with hands, without any machines. The following therapies were applicated: corticosteroid and antihystaminic therapy per os and corticosteroid therapy in loco. After 14 days, a control look over was made, and they were given the preparation with vitamin A and lanolinum, for 14 days more. All of them were adviced to use protection gloves when they are in contact with detergents, especially for the laundry. Conclusion:? One of the reasons for the appearance of chronic toxic contact dermatitis is the low standard of living when, becouse of the poverty, people can?t use machines and still in the 21th Century they wash the clothes and dishes with hands. The only help at this category of people is to give them advices for using protection gloves.

AB  - Background:? Psoriasis prevalence in the Spanish population is around 1.4%(2000). The last epidemiological enquire of the GEIDC (2001) showed that 55.11% of the patients revised in specialized units presented Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD). Concomitance of both processes has been widely studied being the opinions of the different authors controversial. Palmo-plantar psoriasis seems to be the most frequent type in patients presenting delayed hypersensitivity. Aim and methods:? A retrospective study (2002?2003) of the incidence of ACD in patients previously diagnosed of psoriasis was performed in the allergy unit of our hospital. The aim of our study was to investigate the delayed hypersensitivity among psoriatic patients as well as its clinical relevance in our influence area. 604 consecutive patients were studied. Standard batteries of the GEIDC as well as complementary series (True-Test and Chemotecnique) were performed. Allergen application and posterior evaluation were done according to the ICDRG rules. Results:? We studied 26 patients affected of Psoriasis, (4,3% of total). In contrast to the general population, 9 were female (mean age 49 years) and 17 male (mean age 48,4 years). ACD suggestive lesions were located in the hands of 15 patients, feet in three of them and in 4 patients both. Patch test was negative in 8 cases. The most detected allergens were Nickel and Fragrance-mix. Occupational origin was discussed in 6 cases. Sensitivity to formaldehyde resins was demonstrated in several patients. Medicamentous origin due to ethylendiamine and Peru Balsam was also demonstrated. Comments:? Several revisions about the relationship of ACD and psoriasis have been published in the last years and most of the authors think that there are no differences between healthy, psoriatic and atopic subjects. These studies have focused on adverse drug reactions or standard series of allergens, taking not in consideration an occupational origin. We suggest epicutaneous tests as a reliable method to diagnose ACD in psoriatic patients with chronic and/or refractory lesions in hands.

AB  - Investigations in several western countries, especially european, have shown an increase in the frequency of psoriasis. To investigate these trends in Norway, the following procedure was followed. Using four standardized interview-reports the development and the frequency of atopic dermatitis was determined. The questionnaires were conducted in the years 1968, 1975, 1985 and 1995. The results were registred electronically, and made available on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) in Windows version. In 1968 420 out of 11101 persons suffered from a skin disease, in 1975 the number had increased to 690 out of 11014 persons. These numbers still increased; in 1985 1136 out of 10576 and in 1995 1026 out of 10248 said to suffer from a skin disease. The diagnosis psoriasis was reported by 34 persons in 1968 (8% of all skin disease), increased to 97 in 1975 (14.1%), to 149 in 1985 (13.1%), and finally to 284 in 1995 (26.7%). In all, the infectious skin diseases decreased in number, whereas inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis but also atopic dermatitis increased. Connections to air pollution, indoor environment, especially smoking are at present under investigation. These results indicate that psoriasis is among the most frequent skin diseases in Norway, comparable to other western industrialized countries.

AB  - Objective: the increasing industrial use of platinum?group elements (PGEs), namely Ir, Pd, Pt and Rh and related hypersensitivity such as respiratory symptoms, urticaria and contact dermatitis, have led to a growing need to monitor selected populations of exposed workers. Our aim is to determine the prevalence and the clinical characteristics of hypersensitivity to the platinum-group elements; the levels of PGE measured in indoor airborne particulate matter and in biological samples (serum, urine and hair) taken from of employees in a platinum refining and catalyst manufacture; to correlate environmental exposure role and platinum salts concentrations in biological samples in the onset of allergy. Material and methods:? 132 subjects variable exposed were informed about the purpose of this study and gave their consent. The examination consisted of a work exposure and medical questionnaire, physical examination, skin prick test to platinum salts and to other common allergens and patch test to platinum salts. Airborne PGEs was collected by personal and area samples. Biological samples (serum, urine and hair) were collected. Analitical procedure based on sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectometry (SP-ICP-MS) for the analysis of airborne filter, serum, urine and hair was used. Results: positive prick test to platinum salts were found in 18 workers, 4 out 14 gave simultaneous positive reactions to Pt, Rh and Ir. 2 out 14 gave a positive reaction to Pt and Pd. Positive patch test reactions to Pt were found in 2 subjects, 1 out 2 gave positive reaction also to Pd Conclusion:? the preliminary results of the investigation indicate that Pt-salts are important allergens in catalyst industry and that the clinical manifestation involves both the respiratory system and the skin

AB  - Conventional models of the immune response are based on distinguishing self and non-self. However, the more recently proposed ?danger? model may be an illuminating alternative for studying allergic contact dermatitis. In the presence of a ?danger? signal, which in some cases of allergic contact dermatitis could be cutaneous ?irritancy?(ie cytokine release from non-immune/keratinocyte cells in response to chemical stimulus in a non-sensitising manner), the immune system would become activated, leading first to the induction of sensitisation and then subsequently to the elicitation of a contact hypersensitivity response. In most cases both the antigenic signal and signal for keratinocyte cytokine release will come from the hapten, although for example in an occupational setting, traumiterative dermatitis would be the source of the ?danger? signal. A further prediction of this hypothesis is that reported animal experiments demonstrating low dose tolerance with contact allergens may be explained by the loss of the ?irritant? effect at lower dilutions whilst an antigenic stimulus remains present.

AB  - Allergic reactions to arylamine dyes are well-known causes for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). These compounds are found in synthetic and natural materials, hair dyes, sun screen, photographic additives as well as temporary tattoos. Cross-reactions between different para-compounds have been frequently observed but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We investigated the immunogenic capacities of p-phenylendiamine (PPD), Bandrowski?s base (BB), 2-methyl-1,4-phenylendiammoniumsulfat (PTD), 4-aminoazobenzene (AAB), disperse orange (DO), disperse yellow (DY), 4?4-diaminophenylmethan (DDM), bismarckbrown (BBY) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) by measuring the proliferative responses of T-cells on polyclonal and monoclonal level (thymidine incorporation). T cell responses were based on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recently, we characterized PPD/BB T cell clones (TCC) as predominantly CD4+/CD45RO+ cells with a alpha/beta T cell receptor (Sieben et?al., 2002). We isolated T cell lines (TCL, n?=?16) and T cell clones (TCC, n?=?20) from totally 11 PPD-allergic persons and 5 exposed persons. We established TCLs and TCCs to 4 para-amino compounds. We found some PPD and/or BB specific TCCs with no cross-reactivity to the other compounds tested. Some TCCs showed a narrow range of cross-reactions (BB, BBY, MBT), while others reacted to 6 different para-amino compounds. We observed similiar patterns of crossreaction for the TCLs. The stimulation indices (SI) varied between 2.2 and 14.0. Our preliminary results on cross-reactions between para-amino compounds support recent findings in mice (Wulferink et?al., 2002) demonstrating a limited discriminatory capacity of T cells carrying an alpha/beta T cell receptor. Further studies on the mechanisms of cross-reactivities and the cytokine profiles are now under investigation. This study was supported by the Interdiciplinary Center for Clinical Research and Biomaterials (IZKF, Germany) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany).

AB  - TRUE Test? is the only standardized patch test system for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis based on 24 fully stable and reproducible formulations. New standardized patches are in process of development for TRUE Test? Panel 3. The allergens chosen are well-known sensitizers and include preservatives, steroids, metals and others. 14 new patches are included in an Experimental panel which is tested in several European clinics. 11 of the patches contain new allergens while 3 patches consist of improved TRUE Test? formulations with Neomycine sulphate, Fragrance mix and Potassium dichromate. A number of the patches from the Experimental panel will be selected for TRUE Test? Panel 3. The overall purpose with pharmaceutical development of patch test materials for TRUE Test? is to obtain a precise dose, bioavailability and stability in every single patch. The patches have to be chemically stable for at least 2 years at refrigerated temperature. The selected preservatives on the Experimental panel are Methyldibromoglutaronitrile, Germall 115, Germall II and Bronopol. All 4 patches have proven to be difficult to stabilize because of the natural reactivity of the allergenic substances. The steroids chosen are Budesonide, Tixocortol-21-pivalate and Hydrocortisone-17-butyrate. All 3 steroids are stable in TRUE Test? formulations. Other allergens on the Experimental panel are Ammoniated Mercury, Goldsodiumthiosulphate, Parthenolide and Disperse blue 106, where the latter consists of a complex mixture. Chemical stabilization of the patches as well as clinical studies will be presented.

AB  - Milia are small sub epidermal keratin cysts. They may be seen following bullous diseases disrupting the dermo-epidermal junction. They may occur rarely as a complication to contact allergic reactions. An oak moss allergic patient participated in a dose response ROAT with chloratranol, shown to be a potent allergen in oak moss. The patient reacted to choratranol at patch testing down to 0.0063?ppm, and started a ROAT by application of 2 drops of a 5?ppm solution to an area of 3???3 centimetres on the volar aspect of one forearm. After 1 day severe oedematous dermatitis was observed and blistering was seen at day 2. The test was stopped and the patient treated with systemic prednisolone. At a 3 month control visit milia were seen at the application site on the forearm but not on the back where the patch tests were applied. The patient had no subjective symptoms and the milia were easily removed with a sterile needle. The presence of milia as sequelae seems to reflect the depth and severity of the allergic contact dermatitis developed months earlier. This observation underlines the potency of chloratranol as a very strong allergen.

AB  - During the last two decades the incidence of contact allergy to preservatives in consumer products has increased. It is of crucial importance for the prognosis that sensitised patients avoid contact with the allergens, and they are informed how to take precautions, e.g. by reading the descriptions of contents on consumer products. Discrepancy between ?doctors orders? and patients? actions is often taken as an expressions of patients? lack of knowledge. However, sociologically inspired studies show that differences in social experiences and in social life circumstances non-consciously lead to socially different ways of coping with illness. This study investigates in a sociological perspective, how people handle contact allergy in everyday life and the social genesis of their actions. Interviews were carried out with 8 women selected according to medical and sociological criteria. The study indicates that patients with contact allergy comply with ?doctors orders? in different ways depending on patients? resources, possibilities and social class. The study also indicates, that information given by health staff to a considerable extent is directed to patients from the higher social classes, who possess the ability to read the linguistic difficult names of the preservatives and to a lesser extend to patients from lower social classes, who do not possess this ability.

AB  - Aims:? The aims were to study health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with hand eczema, and to compare two different instruments for assessment of HRQL. Methods:? 100 consecutive hand eczema patients (51 females and 49 males) at an occupational dermatology clinic completed the generic questionnaire Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the dermatology specific Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). To compare the instruments factor analysis, with a polychoric correlation matrix as input, was performed, thus taking the ordinal aspect of the data into account. Results:? HRQL was affected by hand eczema, measured with both SF-36 and DLQI. The mean (SD) sum scores of DLQI was 7.4 (5.8), no difference between genders. However, the SF-36 showed more impaired HRQL for females than for males in the mental health dimension. There was a high correlation between the instruments for physical health, but lower for mental health. Conclusions:? Hand eczema has an impact on HRQL, and both SF-36 and DLQI are suitable instruments. Our conclusion from the factor analysis is that the SF-36 measures mental health better than the DLQI. The choice of instrument to be used in a specific study depends on the purpose of the study. A generic instrument has the advantage of making comparisons with other diseases possible. The SF-36 also appears suitable for use in hand eczema studies where gender differences in HRQL are of interest.

AB  - It has been shown by series of experiments that the induction of contact allergy depends on the concentration of allergen per unit skin rather than the total dose delivered. This means that a high concentration of allergen delivered to a small area of the skin comprise a higher risk of induction than if the same total amount is applied to a larger skin area. Attempts have been made to exploit this knowledge in risk assessment models for induction of contact allergy. The concentration (dose per unit skin) applied at induction also determines the sensitivity of the individual at elicitation. It also seems that smaller concentrations of allergen are required to sensitise individuals with pre-existing contact allergy than those without.Once a person is sensitised to a substance, the sensitivity of the individual in combination with the level of exposure to the allergen, determines whether clinical symptoms will occur. These dose-response relationships can be studied in sensitised individuals by re-application of a serial dilution of the relevant allergen either under patch test conditions or by repeated open applications. Thresholds for no-response or minimum effect levels may be determined for different allergens and used systematically for preventive purposes. Practical examples of such successful prevention exist regarding nickel and chromium allergy, providing both primary and secondary preventive effects. Further understanding of the dose- response relationships is important in diagnosing contact allergy and advising the patient relevantly.
