AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis to prepackaged disposable alcohol prep swabs is infrequently reported. A 60-year-old woman developed repeated episodes of dermatitis at sites of injections and venipunctures. History and patch testing revealed contact allergy to Kendall Webcol alchol prep swabs. There were negative patch test results to isopropyl alcohol (IPA), but positive reactions to the Webcol swab, to the inner surface of the packaging foil, to two other brands of alcohol swabs, and to bacitracin. UV absorbance profile analysis revealed the presence of UV absorbing materials at peaks of 221 and 280?nm within commercial IPA samples, including one from Kendall, which were absent from reagent grade IPA. Reports of similar cases identified IPA, propylene oxide, or both as the allergens; when swab ingredients were negative, compound allergy was proposed. A recent report from Korea identified dodecyldiaminoethylglycine and IPA as the allergens in the commercial disinfectant swab. Although the exact allergen is undetermined in our case, it may represent a chemical compound or contaminant that is used or acquired during the manufacturing of the swabs or foils.

AB  - The term baboon syndrome was introduced 20 years ago. It was proposed for a particular eruption mimicking the red gluteal area of the baboon after systemic exposure either to the contact allergens nickel and mercury or to oral ampicillin. Previously this phenomen was e.g. termed flexural exanthema to mercury. Since then similar incidences have been reported after systemic exposure to betalactam antibiotics and other drugs, sometimes under different terms. Clinically sharp demarcation of a V-shaped erythema is present in inguinal/genital and gluteal/perianal areas. Additionally papules, vesicles and hemorrhagic lesion may be found. In most patients presence of exanthema in other anatomical flexural regions (axilla, elbow, knee, ventral neck) has been identified. However, involvement of the plantar/palmar regions, face and mucosal sites has not been documented. Typically blood tests are normal and systemic symptoms are absent. Histological results vary but a predominance of superficial perivascular infiltrate with mononuclear cells has been reported. Occasional positive patch tests or stimulation of lymphocytes in the LTT may be suggestive for a type IV allergic reaction. Since the drug-related baboon syndrome shows clinically and histologically different findings to systemic contact dermatitis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), it should be seen as a separate entity. The mainstay for the diagnosis of systemic contact dermatitis requires contact sensitization and elicitation by a contact allergen. In contrast in the baboon syndrome and AGEP history for sensitization is often negative, although sometimes positive patch and LTT results can be found. AGEP, on the other hand, requires a distinct score including systemic signs and leucocytosis. In all three symptoms typically occur within 1 to 2 days. The term baboon syndrome does not reflect the whole range of symptoms and signs. And, although it is easily remembered, the comparison to an animal may be insulting. Therefore, we suggest that drug-induced baboon syndrome should be separated from the contact allergen-induced form, and should be recognized as a separate entity within the spectrum of drug eruptions. For this reason we propose the acronym SDRIFE (symmetrical drug related intertriginous flexural exanthema). This refers to the distinctive clinical pattern of this drug eruption without implicating any pathomechanism, which has not been clearly elucidated. The following criteria are proposed: 1) Exposure to a systemically administered drug, 2) Sharply demarcated erythema of the gluteal/perianal area and/or V-shaped erythema of the inguinal/perigenital area, 3) Involvement of at least one other intertriginous/flexural fold, 4) Bilaterally or symmetrically affected areas, and 5) Absence of systemic symptoms and signs.

AB  - Objectives:? The Surveillance by General Practitioners of Occupational Contact Dermatitis Project (Spot) has been designed to provide disease estimates for occupational contact dermatitis within a defined geographic area in Melbourne, Australia. Method:? Spot collected reports of occupational contact dermatitis from four separate sources: general practitioners, dermatologists, a Dermatology Outpatient clinic, and an Occupational Dermatology Clinic. Case definition was stratified into two levels, suspected and confirmed. All cases of suspected occupational contact dermatitis reported to Spot were assessed and required to undergo diagnostic confirmation, including appropriate patch testing by an occupational dermatologist. The rates generated by Spot were compared to the rates generated by Victorian workers? compensation data (Victorian Work Cover Authority) for ?Contact dermatitis and other and unspecified dermatitis.? Results:? To date, a total of 125 suspected cases have been reported to Spot. 56 cases of occupational contact dermatitis have been confirmed with an incidence rate of 12.5 per 100,000 full-time workers and a prevalence rate of 28 per 100,000. This can be compared to the rate from Victorian WorkCover Authority of 4 per 100,000 (with information not available for incidence or prevalence). Conclusions:? Although limited by resources, clinician and worker participation rates, Spot provides a better estimate for occupational contact dermatitis in an Australian urban setting than that currently available through workers? compensation statistics. The information generated by Spot will provide an important contribution towards the characterisation of occupational contact dermatitis in Australia.

AB  - The successful acquisition of skin sensitisation requires orchestrated cellular and molecular interactions that collectively result in the induction of a cutaneous immune response of the required quality and vigour. Pivotal roles are played by epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), and by the mature immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DC) into which they mature. LC serve as sentinels of the adaptive immune system with responsibility for surveying changes in the local microenvironment and for processing antigen (and chemical allergens) encountered at skin surfaces. Following such encounters LC are mobilised and stimulated to migrate, via afferent lymphatics, to regional lymph nodes. While in transit they lose the properties of antigen processing cells and acquire instead the characteristics of mature DC that are able to interact effectively with, and present antigen to, T lymphocytes. To gain a greater understanding of the molecular events that induce and regulate cutaneous immune responses to chemical allergens, we have used microarray transcript profiling and related experimental approaches to characterise changes in gene expression and protein production associated with the development of skin sensitisation. Our attention has focused particularly on changes in the expression of mRNA and protein resulting from the interaction of chemical allergens with DC, and associated with the presentation of antigen to T lymphocytes.

AB  - Work-related skin problems are frequent in the food processing industry. A randomised intervention study with a one-year follow up was carried out among gut cleaners in order to prevent work-related skin problems due to wet work. The effects of the intervention were primarily measured by telephone interviews using questionnaires based on a standardized questionnaire for work-related skin diseases and exposure (NOSQ-2002).* The intervention activities included an evidence-based prevention program and an evidence-based method for implementation. Six of the 18 participating departments were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the remaining 12 departments to the comparison group. A total of 644 employees responded in the baseline interview and 622 in the follow-up interview carried out a year later. The participation rates were 87,5% and 71,6% respectively. Among the 495 participants answering in both interviews the frequency of eczema on hands or forearms within the past 3 months was reduced significantly by more than 25% in the intervention departments. A minor increase was observed in the comparison departments. This study has shown that even in jobs without the possibility to reduce high exposure to wet work work-related skin problems can be reduced by proper preventive measures. *) Susitaival P, Flyvholm M-A, Meding B, Kanerva L, Lindberg M, Svensson Å, ?lafsson JH.

AB  - Tattoos are becoming increasingly popular, although reactions to tattoos remain relatively uncommon. We describe 4 patients with a variety of red tattoo reactions, one responding well to intralesional steroid therapy. Case 1:? A 50-year-old man presented with a florid, inflammatory reaction confined to the red area of his forearm tattoo. Biopsy showed a dense lymphocytic and focal macrophage response to tattoo pigment. Mass spectrometry of biopsy tissue revealed high concentrations of titanium and iron. Patch testing was negative. Intralesional steroid injection has produced a marked improvement. Case 2:? A 42-year-old man presented with an inflammatory reaction affecting the red area of his leg tattoo. Biopsy revealed a florid lymphoid reaction. Case 3:? A 30-year-old man presented with an eczematous reaction within the red/brown pigmented areas of his tattoos, which was exacerbated by sun exposure. Patch testing showed a (+) positive reaction to cadmium after 96 hours. Photo patch testing was negative. The reaction settled spontaneously within 12 months. Case 4:? A 37-year-old woman presented with a florid, indurated inflammatory reaction involving the red area of a shoulder tattoo. Patch testing revealed a (++) and (+) positive reaction to nickel and cobalt respectively with a doubtful (?+) reaction to mercury 0.5% in petrolatum after 96 hours. Tattoo reactions, especially red tattoo reactions can present with a spectrum of histological changes, including lichenoid, granulomatous, hypersensitivity, nodular, pseudolymphomatous or sarcoidal reactions. One of our cases responded well to intralesional steroid injection and one case resolved spontaneously.

AB  - Skin tests are important diagnostic tools. To establish reactivity, a single allergen test concentration is considered to be sufficient. To diagnose sensitivity serial dilution or endpoint titration is recommended. Skin testing in drug allergy is complex, since pathogenetic mechanisms are diverse, and for many drugs cut-off skin test concentrations have not been established. Therefore, after a negative prick/puncture test with the stock solution, intradermal tests with serial (ten-fold) dilutions are recommended. Surprisingly in most publications dealing with serial skin test dilution, the technique is not described in detail. Aim:? Comparison of the variability of test substance concentrations produced with two serial dilution techniques conducted by experienced allergy nurses. Methods:? Two allergy nurses produced dilution series. Isosulfane blue was chosen as test substance, since it enabled easy and sensitive detection. Dilution series of isosulfan blue (aqueous solution of 10?mg/ml) from 1:10 to 1:10?000 were produced under sterile conditions by two dilution techniques: 1) Dilution in vials: 0.5?ml isosulfane blue solution was serially transferred with 1?ml tuberculine syringes to vials containing exactly 4.5?ml NaCl 0.9% 2) Dilution in syringes: 0.1?ml isosulfane blue solution with the higher concentration was aspirated into 1?ml tuberculine syringes followed by 0.9?ml NaCl 0.9%. These procedures were compared with a controlled experiment carried out using piston-stroke pipettes. The concentrations of isosulfan blue in all dilutions were determined by UV/VIS-spectroscopy and external standard calibration. Results:? In almost all samples the concentrations were higher than expected. In vials the concentrations varied from 83 to 360%, in syringes from 83 to 711% of the expected values. The dilution in vials gave consistently better results than dilution in syringes. A considerable interindividual variability was observed between the conducting nurses, however variability over time was smaller. Conclusions:? In routinely performed serial dilutions of allergen test preparation considerable deviations from the expected allergen test concentration have been observed. This might be of minor importance for an individual patient, however, in establishing e.g. cut-off concentrations for non-irritant drug concentrations or in multicenter studies such variations may result in major errors. Quality management of skin testing should not only include the recording, injection technique and test reactivity evaluation, but also the exact description of the preparation of test dilutions. In clinical routine dilution techniques should be applied, which give more accurate results.

AB  - An epidemiological study is made to evaluate the present or past relevance of positivity to the allergens pertaining to the GEIDC standard series. A retrospective study was made of patients evaluated with patch tests corresponding to the GEIDC standard series by 14 GEIDC dermatologists in the course of 2001. The following parameters were evaluated: age, sex, positive allergens, and present, past and total relevance. A total of 3343 patients were studied, of which 1892 had at least one positive test (56.59%). The most relevant allergens were mercaptobenzothiazole (93,93%), thiuram mix (93%) and nickel sulfate (92.33%). In women, paraphenylenediamine was moreover also very relevant, while in males epoxy resin, butylphenol formaldehyde resin and colophony were particularly relevant. Among the less relevant allergens in both sexes, we found the following in relation to the total: quinolein (44.44%), lactones (45.45%) and caine mix (48.07%). In 1783 patients with at least one positive test, an evaluation was made of whether allergen relevance was past or present. In 60.78% of the positive tests present relevance was established. The allergens of greatest present relevance were ethylenediamine (100%), budesonide (100%), euxyl K 400 (96.96%), epoxy resin (93.33%), and Quaternium 15 (92.85%). The allergens of least present relevance were nickel sulfate (36.38%), caine mix (40%), and neomycin (41.37%). Determination of the relevance of positive patch test is fundamental in all cases. In our study nickel and rubbers were the most relevant allergens, though nickel was essentially of past relevance. Few studies have addressed the present or past relevance of the standard allergen series.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a chemokine for T-lymphocytes and as a marker of magnitude of contact allergy. Subjects, Materials and Methods:? Urushiol, the contact allergen of poison ivy, was applied to allergic and anergic volunteers. Suction blisters of urushiol exposed and non-exposed skin were produced 48?h later and the fluids were analyzed for chemotactic activity for T-lymphocytes using modified Boyden chambers. Anti-IL-8-antibodies were added to the fluids to investigate their effect on the chemotactic activity. IL-8 protein concentration of the fluids was determined by ELISA and its correlation with visible test responses was investigated. Results:? Significant chemotactic activity for T-lymphocytes was only present in blister fluid from urushiol exposed skin and only from the allergic subjects. The chemotactic activity could be neutralized with the anti-IL-8 antibodies. There was an excellent correlation between the IL-8 protein concentration in blister fluids and the clinical appearance of the inflammatory reactions at the skin test sites. Conclusions:? The results support the hypothesis that IL-8 in blister fluid is both chemotactic for T-lymphocytes and is a sensitive marker of an inflammatory response. Determination of the concentration of IL-8 proteins in blister fluid of patch tests may be of future use for objective assessment of clinically important contact allergies.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether application of allergic patch tests with transparent semi-occlusive adhesive plastic foils yields higher test sensitivity than when tapes are used. To study whether such foils compared to tapes allow a shorter application time of tests. Methods:? We applied different doses of budesonide printed on polyester squares and vehicle control squares to budesonide allergic subjects for 4 days. Each subject was tested with a set of tests both with a tape and a foil. We assessed all tests when they had been detached and additionally those applied with foils at earlier time points. All assessments were performed both visually and with a laser Doppler perfusion imaging technique. Results:? Test sensitivity is higher with foil applications than when tapes are used and the perfusion is higher with the foils in many cases. The foils allow detachment of visually positive tests before 48 hours in some subjects, regardless of dose. Conclusions:? Test applications with transparent semi-occlusive adhesive plastic foils is sensitive and should be considered for application of patch tests when a short application time is important as when tests are carried out with occupationally hazardous allergens or when test substances containing allergens are expected to be irritating.

AB  - Fragrance substances represent a diverse group of chemicals, some being associated with the ability to cause allergic skin reactions. In recent work, we evaluated two groups of fragrance chemicals, saturated aldehydes (aryl substituted and aliphatic aldehydes) and ?,?-unsaturated aldehydes. QSAR models relating the LLNA EC3 values to a measure of the lipophilicity of a chemical (log P) and s*(a measure of reactivity) were developed for both sets of aldehydes. The outcome was consistent with ?,?-unsaturated aldehydes reacting via Michael addition, whilst saturated aldehydes formed Schiff bases with proteins. In the present study we evaluated further aldehydes to test the robustness and extend the scope of the QSARs. The QSAR models were used to predict EC3 values for 4 new Michael addition aldehydes and 6 new Schiff base formers. LLNA data generated for these compounds demonstrated the original QSARs were fairly accurate but still required improvement. Development of the QSAR models has provided us with a better understanding of the potential mechanisms of action for aldehydes and hence how to avoid or limit allergy. Knowledge generated from this project is being incorporated into new/improved rules for sensitisation in the expert toxicity prediction system Deductive Estimation of Risk from Existing Knowledge (DEREK).

AB  - Objective:? The purpose of this study is to investigate if patients with neomycin sulfate allergy may develop test responses that are unclassifiable by commonly used assessment scales but which should be considered positive. Materials:? 16 patients who tested positive to neomycin sulfate patch tests are retested with different dose levels and application times. Test areas are assessed visually up to 11 days. Results:? Three types of reactions were observed. The first type was characterized by erythema and diffuse infiltrate. Some of these had in addition either discrete papules or both papules and vesicles on their surface. The second type of reaction initially developed large perifollicular papules which later developed into coalescent erythema and diffuse infiltrate. The third type of reaction exhibited perifollicular papules only which declined over time. This type was unclassifiable by commonly used assessment scales. All types of reactions were of clinical significance. Conclusion:? The results support that universal assessment scales for patch-test responses due to different test agents may be inappropriate for assessment of neomycin sulfate patch tests. The clinician should only consider assessment scales as an aid in the assessment of test responses and be aware that morphology of test responses may differ between test agents and test techniques.

AB  - Objective:? In this study the statistical data on occupational dermatoses of Finnish machinists in 1992?2001 were analysed. Methods:? The data were collected from the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases (FROD) to which physicians are obligated to report all cases of occupational disease. Each case record consists of information on the patient and the employer, date and diagnosis, causative agents, etc. Results:? During the 10-year period, a total of 281 occupational dermatoses of machinists were diagnosed. Dermatoses consisted mostly of irritant contact dermatitis (N?=?144), allergic contact dermatitis (N?=?108) and unspecified contact dermatitis (N?=?21). Only few cases of protein contact dermatitis and contact urticaria as well as occupational acne were reported. The main causes of irritant contact dermatitis were cutting oils and fluids, oils and lubricants, and organic solvents; the commonest inducers of allergic contact dermatitis were formaldehyde, cutting oils and fluids, metals (nickel, chromium and cobalt) and various antimicrobial agents. Conclusion:? Dermatoses were the second commonest occupational diseases of machinists, after hearing loss, and they accounted for 27% of all occupational diseases within the profession. Machinists are a large occupational group (about 19 000 employees; 0.8% of the work force) in Finland, and their dermatoses formed a noteworthy proportion (about 2.6%) of the occupational skin diseases reported during the study period.

AB  - Case report:? A 54-year-old woman, with no family or personal history of atopy, developed skin symptoms and cough after she had been cultivating shiitake mushrooms for 12 months. The patient reported dermatitis on the backs of her hands, fingers and on her wrists, after 1 or 2 days of being in contact with shiitake mushrooms. The skin lesions and cough disappeared entirely during the holidays. Result: Prick tests to common inhalant allergens, molds and flours were negative, with the exception of D. farinae (3?mm). The prick-to-prick test was positive for shiitake gill (3?mm), shiitake stalk (3?mm) and dry shiitake (8?mm?ps). The histamine wheal was 5?7?mm. Control prick tests with shiitake on 5 nonexposed subjects were negative. An open test was performed with shiitake on the flexor side of the upper arm. Within 20 minutes a positive reaction appeared comprising two wheals and flare reactions. Patch test with shiitake gave a strong toxic reaction in 2 days, which continued to diminish on days 3 and 4. Conclusion: Contact urticaria is the clinical skin symptom of immediate allergy, but repeated exposure may lead to protein contact dermatitis. However, our patient has not had urticaria symptoms from shiitake, although the prick-to-prick and open tests were positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report of protein contact dermatitis from shiitake in a patient with a positive immediate skin reaction and negative patch test result.

AB  - Objective:? Study permeability of gloves to plant allergens, therefore evaluating glove efficacy for hand protection. Material and methods:? We studied 20 female patients (aged 21?71; mean 45,1 years) with ACD from plants, 10 allergic to diallyl disulfide (DAD) from Allium sativa, 8 allergic to alpha-methylene-gama-butyrolactone (AMGBL) from Alstroemeria ligtu and 2 allergic to primin from Primula obconica. Patch testing was performed applying the allergens, for 24 or 48?h, directly on the skin and over fragments of different gloves: domestic rubber gloves (RG), nitrile latex gloves (NG), vinyl gloves (VG), surgical latex gloves (LG) and polyethylene gloves (PG). Results:? VG, PG or LG gloves offered no protection for these 3 allergens. With RG and NG gloves, DAD reactivity was abolished or significantly reduced, respectively, in 5 and 7 cases. Reactivity to AMGBL wasn?t abolished by any glove material. NG abolished skin reactivity to primin; RG was efficacious only in 1 patient. Conclusions:? Advising gloves in patients with ACD from plants is difficult, as allergen permeability through gloves associated with occlusion may intensify the dermatitis, as occurred during skin testing. Nitrile latex gloves may protect from primin and garlic dermatitis, whereas they are not helpful for manipulating Alstroemeria. Although exposure time in this study is higher than in real life, results show interesting data on glove permeability to these plant allergens and support our patients? complaints that gloves didn?t protect them.

AB  - There is only very limited data on the prevalence of contact allergy, as judged by a positive diagnostic patch test, in unselected, non-clinical populations. We carried out a 48?h patch test to 7 common allergens and to the petrolatum vehicle in a total of 2545 adult volunteers in Bangkok. The patch tests were read at 48?h approximately 1?h after patch removal. Positive results were as follows Ni 27.8%, fragrance mix 2.9%, Cr 2.6%, PPD 2.3%, colophony 2.1%, MI/MCI 1.2% and formaldehyde 0.7%. No reactions were found to petrolatum. The particularly high frequency of reactions to Ni was surprising. However, the large female bias (approximately 75:1) strongly suggested that, despite the absence of a 96?h score, that irritancy did not play a significant part in these reactions. Reaction rates to the other 6 contact allergens appeared to confirm predictions made from the extrapolation of diagnostic patch testing or from previous published studies on smaller population groups. The rates of reaction to these allergens also are likely to reflect the extent of exposure in the Bangkok region. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that over 2% of this adult population appear to be allergic to the cosmetic related allergens PPD and fragrance.
