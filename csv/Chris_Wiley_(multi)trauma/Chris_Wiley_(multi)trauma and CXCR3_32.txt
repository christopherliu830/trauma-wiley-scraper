AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether interleukins in blisters formed at patch-test sites can be used as markers of the grade of contact allergy. Methods:? Recently patch-tested volunteers with and without allergy to nickel sulfate were retested with 5 nickel sulfate patch tests and 5 control tests. 48 hours later, the test were removed and the perfusion of the test sites was assessed with a laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) technique. Then, suction blisters were made at the test sites. Blister fluids were collected separately from the allergen test sites and the control-test sites. Results:? The patch-test results prior to the study and in current study, and the results with the LDPI helped to distinguish between subjects with and without allergy to nickel sulfate. The concentration of one of the interleukins was high in the blister fluid from the nickel-test sites in all of the allergic subjects while the concentration was not detectable or low in fluid from the control sites and in fluid both from the nickel and the control sites in subjects without nickel allergy. Conclusion:? Immunological factors in fluid from blisters at patch-test sites may be important for the detection of contact allergy. Acknowledgement:? Icelandic Research Council.

AB  - A 37-year-old female cashier working in a drugstore developed a dyshidrotic hand eczema in summer 2001. Positive patch test results were obtained against nickel and cobalt. When the new euro coins were introduced in January 2002, the skin symptoms disappeared. Five months later the work-related hand eczema flared up with massive aggravation. Money-triggered hand eczema has occasionally been reported. Its low incidence is probably due to the absence of wet or irritant work. Coins are not mentioned in the EU nickel directive as ?products intended to come into direct and prolonged contact with the skin?. Nestle et?al. (Nature, Vol 419, p 132, 2002) found that 1- and 2- euro coins released more nickel than pure nickel itself in vitro. A factor contributing to this high release of nickel is corrosion due to the bimetallic structure of these coins, which generates a galvanic potential of 30?40?mV in human sweat. A current can enhance galvanic corrosion and thereby cause more nickel release. In a thin irregular electrolyte layer such as a sweat deposit, galvanic corrosion occur primarily near the bimetallic junction owing to the high resistance to lateral current flow in the thin layer.

AB  - There exists within the population subsets of individuals who display heightened skin reactivity to materials the majority find tolerable. In a series of investigations, we have examined interrelationships between many of the endpoints associated with the term ?sensitive skin?. In the most recent work, 58 volunteers were treated with 10% lactic acid, 50% ethanol, 0.5% menthol and 0.1% capsaicin on the nasolabial fold, unoccluded, for 8 minutes. Sensory reactions were recorded at 2.5, 5 and 8 minutes. Urticant susceptibility was evaluated with 1?M benzoic acid and 125?mM trans-cinnamic acid applied to the volar forearm for 20 minutes. Visual assessments were taken at intervals for up to 4 hours after treatment. A 2???23 hour patch test was also conducted using 0.1% and 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 0.3% and 0.6% Tegobetain F50 and 0.1% and 0.2% benzalkonium chloride to determine irritant susceptibility. As found in previous studies, increased susceptibility to one endpoint was not predictive of sensitivity to another. In our hands, nasolabial stinging is a poor predictor of sensory as well general skin sensitivity. However, it may be possible to identify in the normal population individuals who are more generally sensitive to a range of non-immunologic adverse skin reactions. Whether such individuals are those who experience problems with skin care products is open to question.

AB  - Patch testing with materials brought in by the patient is useful to identify the cause(s) of current allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). However, little is known (i) on the contribution of such tests to diagnostic success and (ii) on the spectrum of contact allergens associated with ACD to certain product categories. Between 1998 and 2002, 5911 out of 48381 patients patch tested in the centres of the IVDK (http://www.ivdk.org) have been tested with own cosmetics and toiletries in addition to commercial allergens. These were manually assigned to 26 categories, based on a EU classification (annex I to 76/768/EEC), which was further refined. As illustrative example, data on ?Bath and shower preparations? are presented: out of 1333 patients tested with a total of 2336 single patches (1102 with 1%, 391 with 10% and 280 with 0.1% in water, remainder with other preparations, depending on the actual kind of product), 71 had positive reactions at the D3 reading. Only in 46 of these, reactions to potential cosmetic ingredients, tested as commercially available allergens, were observed. Among these, fragrance mix (30.0% vs. 12.9% in those not reacting positively to this product category), Myroxylon Pereirae resin (18.6% vs. 8.4%) and some biocides like MCI/MI (11.4% vs. 1.8%) and methyldibromo glutaronitrile?+?phenoxyethanol (12.1% vs. 5.3%) were the most common allergens. In conclusion, patch testing own products ? although not without pitfalls ? may (i) help to correctly diagnose ACD and (ii) give important hints on the occurrence of allergens in a particular type of (cosmetic) product.

AB  - A retrospective study was done of allergic contact dermatits to cosmetics, seen at the department of dermatology of Curry Cabral Hospital, over a six year period (1998 to 2003). Of 2848 patients patch tested during this period, 314 had cosmetic contact allergy and represented about 15.7% of all patients with at least one positive patch test. The patients aged between 13 and 82 years old, and were mostly female (78%). Skin reactions occurred most often on the face, followed by hands, neck and the eyelids. All the patients were tested with the standard series, with supplementary series when appropriate, and whenever possible, with the personal cosmetic products. 92% had positive reactions to standard series allergens; 226 patiens to allergens of the standard series, which may be used in cosmetics. The majority of reactions were due to fragrance mix, followed by balsam of Peru, p-phenylenediamine, kathon CG and colophony. Fragrance series was tested in 118 patients, with the following most frequent positive reactions: oak moss absolute, isoeugenol, hydroxycitronellal. Cosmetic series was tested in 147 patients with the following most frequent positive reactions: toluenesulphonamide-formaldehyde resin and propolis. 30 patients tested with photoallergen series, 4 reacted to oxybenzone. Skin care products and fragrances were the most commonly involved product categories. Twelve patients reacted only with their own products. The fragrances were the most frequent ingredient recorded as the cause of cosmetic contact allergy. Our standard series detected 70% of cases of allergic contact dermatitis to cosmetics.

AB  - Chronic hand dermatitis is a common and distressing condition with a complex, multifactorial aetiology. In order to better understand its pathophysiology and hopefully improve diagnosis, we have begun a systematic histopathological study of various forms of hand dermatitis, with a particular emphasis on those in which exposure to irritants and allergens is strongly implicated. Suitable patients were recruited from amongst those presenting at the contact dermatitis clinic. Detailed past and present medical and personal histories, clinical examination, patch testing and prick testing were conducted in order to classify the eczema into one of several broad entities e.g. chronic irritant contact dermatitis (CICD), with or without atopy. After performing a range of bio-engineering measurements on a pre-selected affected area of the hand, biopsies were removed and processed for high resolution light microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Age/sex matched, healthy, non-atopic individuals provided control skin from similar sites of the hand. Using a range of antibodies and quantification techniques, we examined the status and expression of certain immune-associated cells and receptor/adhesion molecules. Of note amongst these, were the differences in epidermal CD1a+ cell density between groups. Non-atopics with CICD, for example, had significantly fewer CD1a+ cells than both atopics with CICD and those with normal skin. CD54 (ICAM-1) and several cytokine/chemokine receptors were more widely and strongly expressed by keratinocytes in those with an atopic diathesis. Although preliminary in nature at this stage, our results suggest that different forms of hand dermatitis display characteristic immunopathological features which may possibly be of diagnostic value.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the effects of a SLS toothpaste formulation with and without betaine on skin and oral mucosa using electrical bioimpedance (IMP). Two groups, in total 47 participants, were recruited. In the skin group (27 participants) four test sites on the volar forearms were used: SLS paste, SLS?+?betaine paste, betaine paste, and one unoccluded control site. In the oral group (20 participants) the same toothpaste formulations were used. The test substances were applied in 12?mm Finn chambers for 24 hours at randomised test sites on the skin, and in 18?mm Finn chambers for 15 minutes on the oral mucosa. Visual examination and readings with IMP were taken before application and 24 hours after removal of the chambers for the skin, and for the oral mucosa before and 15 minutes after exposure. Information was extracted from the impedance spectra using four indices based on magnitude and phase at 2 frequencies, emphasising different aspects of the impedance properties of the tissues. The SLS-containing pastes showed for both skin and oral mucosa some positive visual grade 1 reactions. Significant changes were found for the impedance indices, and the reaction patterns of the indices differed between the skin and the oral mucosa. We conclude that very slight reactions of skin and oral mucosa are detected by IMP. Furthermore, betaine containing toothpaste does not irritate neither skin nor oral mucosa, but the effect together with SLS is insignificant.

AB  - Repeated tape stripping of the skin associated with e.g. the use of stoma care products can cause irritant dermatitis. This experimental study in 12 healthy volunteers was designed to assess the effects of 3 chemically and physically different adhesives commonly used in stoma care products. Two different frequencies of stripping (daily vs twice weekly) were tested, and the various parameters of inflammation and barrier integrity were studied with established non-invasive methods (Measurement of erythema, conductance, and Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)) on day 0, 4, 6, 10, 16, 22 and 28. All adhesives caused increases in all the studied parameters during the 28 day period compared to the corresponding non-stripped values. Furthermore, daily stripping caused significantly greater inflammation and barrier disruption than stripping twice weekly. In conclusion, it was possible by measuring skin erythema, conductance and TEWL to detect different patterns of inflammatory changes and barrier disruption in areas treated with the 3 adhesives. As expected, more frequent stripping caused greater changes. These differences did however appear at different times during the study period, suggesting that the chemical and mechanical properties of the adhesives may affect the skin differently.

AB  - The objective of the study was to establish eliciting threshold concentrations of diazolidinyl urea (Germall II)? derived formaldehyde in formaldehyde and/or in diazolidinyl urea ? sensitive patients, using a leave-on face cream formulation in a repeated open application test (ROAT) applied to different anatomical regions. 150 patients with known formaldehyde allergy were reviewed for inclusion in the study. 108 patients were contacted and in 65 patients the formaldehyde sensitisation was reconfirmed by a patch test. Four groups of 10 formaldehyde allergic subjects were exposed to 0.05%, 0.15%, 0.3% and 0.6% diazolidinyl urea, corresponding to approximately 50, 100, 200 and 400?ppm free formaldehyde, respectively. Additional 10 individuals allergic to the formaldehyde donor ? diazolidinyl urea itself ? were exposed to 0.15% diazolidinylurea, corresponding to approximately 100?ppm free formaldehyde and 10 healthy non-allergic individuals were exposed to 0.6% of diazolidinylurea (approximately 400?ppm free formaldehyde). A ROAT was performed in a scheduled sequence: upper arm, neck and face. Contact allergy reactions were elicited in 39 out of 58 formaldehyde-sensitive and in 5 out of 7 diazolidinyl urea-sensitive individuals. Elicitation responses were dose- and anatomical region ? dependent. No reactions were observed at the lowest dose, suggesting that an elicitation threshold was attained in the study.

AB  - The objective of the study was to investigate, using the Repeated Open Application Test (ROAT), two key parameters of exposure ? allergen concentration (dose/unit area) and time in terms of the elicitation capacity of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) in MCI/MI-sensitised individuals and to explore the inter-relationship between these two key factors. The study was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response ROAT preceded by a Diagnostic Patch Test (DPT). 79 patients with a known MCI/M allergy were contacted, 29 were diagnostically patch tested and 25 had their allergy confirmed. 25 MCI/M-allergic subjects and 10 healthy non-allergic control subjects were challenged with 2?ppm of MCI/MI/unit area of skin for 4 weeks. After a wash out period of at least 4 weeks the subjects were challenged with 7.5?ppm of MCI/MI/unit area of skin for 4 weeks. A ROAT with 2 drops of solution twice a day was conducted on the volar aspect of the left and right forearms on a 3???3?cm area resulting in dose/unit area of MCI/MI of 0.025?mg/cm2 and 0.095?mg/cm2 for 2?ppm and 7,5?ppm MCI/MI respectively. The elicitation capacity of MCI/MI in MCI/MI sensitive patients is dependent on the exposure dose/unit area and time The results of this study will be a useful addition to the risk assessment information available for MCI/MI. The risk assessment for the use of MCI/MI in rinse off consumer products is unaffected by the results of this study.

AB  - The U.S. Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) program has evaluated safety in use data on approximately 1300 ingredient since 1976. The review process, which relies on open public meetings and the active participation of the public, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the cosmetics and chemical industries, has identified many cosmetic ingredients that should only be used under limited conditions. Adhearance to the limitations on use in the conclusions of the CIR reports, in the U.S., appears to have limited exposure and patient population sensitivity to some widely used cosmetic ingredients that have produced high rates of reactions in Europe. The advantages of the CIR process for the public and the medical community; the deliberations leading to the use limitations on two example ingredients, and sources for attendees to locate CIR Reports and conclusions will be presented.

AB  - Background:? The preservative methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) has been used extensively in various products since the 1980s. Recently, a biocide containing only MI and not MCI has been launched on the Swedish market for use in industrial settings, paints and glues. Objectives:? To describe sensitization to the unchlorinated isothiazolinone 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MI) in 2 workers, a technician after a chemical burn and a painter, both exposed to a preservative containing MI. Methods: Patch testing with serial dilutions of MCI/MI, MCI, MI, 2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (OIT) and a commercial preservative containing MI in the 2 workers. Results:? The patients reacted positively to MCI/MI and to the separate active ingredients (MCI, MI). The patch test reactivity to MI was higher than the reactivity to MCI, which is a reversed pattern to what is usually seen in patients sensitized to MCI/MI. Both patients also had positive test reactions to OIT. Conclusion:? MI may sensitize on it?s own, and in patients allergic to MI, cross-reactions are also seen to MCI.

We patch tested: 1997?59 dentists and 21 non-dentists; 1998?40 and 13; 2000?21 and 7; 2002?33 and 6; 2003?25 and 4. We patch-tested participants using T.R.U.E. Test panels and/or Finn chambers containing Trolab allergens. Due to the time constraints of the ADA meeting dates, patches were placed for 48 hours and skin reactions read at 0 and/or 24 hours after patch removal. Overall, 49% of patch-testing participants tested positive to at least one allergen. The most prominent dental-related allergens were rubber compounding agents and methacrylates. Positive reactions in the former were due to thiurams (10%) and carbamates (12%). Positive reactions to acrylates were most frequent to ethylene glycol dimethacrylate. All acrylate allergies were in dentists; typically theses dentists had chronic fingertip dermatitis. Preservative allergies were also common, including thimerosal (31%) and benzoyl peroxide (11%). Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde each produced 3.5% of positive reactions with no evidence of cross-reactivity Common allergies that may be occupationally related were nickel (20%) in tools and orthodontic appliances and fragrance mix (16%) containing eugenol and cinnamates. These results indicate that allergies other than type I hypersensitivity to NRL proteins occur in dental professionals with current or past dermatitis.

AB  - To predict the sensitising capacity of a chemical, the only existing reliable method is testing in animals and alternative methods are requested. One approach is to use databases that predict the toxicity of novel compounds by comparing the chemical structure with data stored in the database. A chemical (hapten) must contain a chemically reactive site to be able to bind to skin macromolecules and a good predictor for sensitising capacity is the electrophilic character of the molecule. Objectives:? The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitising capacity of 5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-1-methylene-2-cyclohexene, a conjugated diene with no electrophilic positions or any other structural alert for skin sensitisation. Methods:? 5-Isopropenyl-2-methyl-1-methylene-2-cyclohexene and two possible epoxide metabolites of the model compound were synthesised. Sensitisation and elicitation experiments were performed using the predictive guinea pig method FCAT. The diene system was analysed in the computer based knowledge system DEREK (Deductive Estimation of Risk from Existing Knowledge). Results:? The model diene was found to be a potent contact allergen able to sensitise the control animals after only one dermal exposure. Both epoxides gave elicitation in the animals sensitised to the diene indicating that they are formed from the diene in the skin during induction. The diene system was considered as a non-sensitiser in DEREK. Conclusions:? This study demonstrates that conjugated dienes can be metabolised to strong contact allergens in the skin and that it is important to consider possible metabolic pathways when constructing predictive databases, otherwise potent prohaptens might be considered as harmless chemicals.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate contact sensitization in children over a 7 year period and to compare these data to our previous findings. From January 1995 to December 2001, 1094 children with suspected allergic contact dermatitis were patch tested with our paediatric series of 30 substances. 404 were affected by atopic dermatitis. 570 children (52.1%), 300 girls and 270 boys, proved to be sensitized. Among them, 291 (51%) were polysensitized. Neomycin, nickel sulfate, wool alcohols, thimerosal, ammoniated mercury, and propolis gave the highest number of positive responses. No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of contact sensitization among the patients with atopic dermatitis and non atopics. However, in the latter the frequency of positive responses to nickel sulfate and Kathon CG was significantly lower than in the former. The face (25%), the hands (23%), and the flexural areas of the limbs (18%) were most frequently affected in children with positive patch tests. In this study population the frequency of sensitized children was significantly higher than the one found from 1988 to 1994, in particular for neomycin, nickel sulfate, wool alcohols, ammoniated mercury, propolis, potassium dichromate, mercaptobenzothiazole and thiuram mix. Our data demonstrate that contact sensitization is more and more frequent in children referring to our department and that the importance of some allergens, such as neomycin, wool alcohols, propolis and potassium dichromate, is increasing in the paediatric age with respect to previous results.

AB  - Objective:? The incidence of occupational hand dermatitis in geriatric nurses (GN) is increasing. 102 GN were involved in a program of secondary individual prevention at the University of Osnabrück. Prior to participation a patch test was performed in 99 of 102 IG by the dermatologist in charge. Sensitization to the fragrance mix was noted in 16% of cases. However, not once the fragrance mix was splitted. One of the GN was presented for further work up, revealing sensitizations to cinnamic alcohol and aldehyde, hydroxycitronellal, isoeugenol, lyral as well as ylang-ylang oil. Method:? Patch tests according to the DKG guidelines were performed. To reveal the composition, fragrance oils were submitted to gas chromatography. Results:? Additional patch tests to various ylang-ylang oils employing various concentrations reveal different patch test reactions. Further work up employing gas chromatography of different ylang-ylang oils will be presented and relevance of patch test will be discussed. Hence cinnamic alcohol is frequently employed by the perfume and cosmetic industry, further patch tests of cinnamic alcohol in petrolatum at various concentrations as well as given cinnamic-alcohol-containing-products are performed. Relevance of patch test results will be presented and discussed with respect to the current discussion of labelling skin sensitizers. Conclusion:? At present the fragrance mix is not commonly splitted. Dermatologist in practice test the fragrance mix. When patch testing naturally occurring fragrance oils, origins and extracts thereof must be considered, because they may contain different allergens relevant for sensitization.

AB  - This lecture will focus on consequences for the affected labour force following contact with well-known allergens in new technical applications, or when the risk assessment of chemicals has been done by persons without sufficient knowledge of factors significant for the induction and elicitation of contact allergy and allergic contact dermatitis. When chemicals with noxious characteristics to both the airways and the skin are handled, the focus is by far and foremost on protection of the airways. However, one must consider the difference of dose needed for airway diseases compared to skin diseases with regard to allergic contact dermatitis. For contact allergy, it is not the total dose that is the culprit but the dose/unit area, i.e. a high concentration of a chemical on a limited skin area may be deleterious. This implies that contamination outside the working operation (e.g. on handles and doors) may lead to sensitisation and allergic contact dermatitis. Examples will be given from the dental profession ((meth)acrylates), the manufacture of resol resins based on phenol and formaldehyde in the production of laminate, and from manual labour including contact with isocyanates and epoxy resins in the manufacture of water-repelling surfaces on floor boards and in the production of wings for wind mills, respectively.

AB  - The rapidly increasing frequency of contact allergy to methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN) is of concern. This study investigates the allergic response elicited in pre-sensitised individuals from exposure to a leave-on product preserved with 50 or 100?ppm MDBGN. Material and methods:? Eighteen volunteers with contact allergy to MDBGN and 10 healthy controls were exposed to repeated open allication tests (ROAT) with two moisturisers with a high and a low lipid content, respectively, both containing MDBGN in a concentration of 50?ppm. The ROATs were performed on the left and the right side of the neck for 14 days, or until a positive reaction was seen. If a positive reaction did not develop within the first 14 days the application with analogous moisturisers containing 100?ppm MDBGN continued for further 14 days. Results:? Eleven (61.1%) developed dermatitis on the test area, and 10 (55.5%) developed a positive reaction to 50?ppm moisturiser. Reactions to the low- moisturiser were the most frequent. the controls all had negative ROATs. Conclusion:? A concentration of 50?ppm MDBGN in a leave-on product was found to elicit an allergic reaction in more than half of sensitised individuals when applied on the neck.

AB  - Occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) take the first rank of all occupational diseases in many countries. The incidence rate is believed to be around 0.5 to 1.9 cases per 1000 full-time workers per year. However, the true incidence of work-related hand eczema (mostly irritant hand eczema) is highly underreported. The development of OCD is determined by a combination of individual susceptibility (endogenous factors) and exposure characteristics (exogenous factors). Skin contact with irritants and/or allergens is a necessary condition of contact dermatitis and the probability and severity of a reaction depend on the type and intensity of exposure. Epidemiological studies play an important role in observing disease trends, analysing risk factors, and monitoring the effect of preventive measures. Occupational Contact Dermatitis (OCD) has become an issue of increasing importance world-wide, not only due to cost- intensification for employers but also due to impairment of employees? quality of life. This lecture summarizes some important causes of occupational contact dermatitis in Europe, demonstrates possibilities of prevention based on recently conducted epidemiological studies, and ends by highlighting important future health service and population research issues. The following questions will be discussed: ???How common are OCD in different industries and what is the extent of underestimation ???What kind of regulations are needed to prevent OCD ???How to deal with high risk individuals (atopics) Research into the causes and prevention of occupational contact dermatitis using an epidemiological approach is still in its infancy, yet already there are some pointers that OCD can be prevented effectively.

AB  - Background:? A 63-year old female gardener developed eczema on her hands, arms and face. She suspected cushion bush, Calocephalus brownii F. Muell., a plant introduced in Sweden by her. This plant belongs to the Asteraceae family. Methods:? Patch testing with our standard series, plant series and acetone extract of cushion bush. The predominating sesquiterpene lactone (SL) calocephalin identified in the plant extract was patch tested in the patient and 20 controls. Calocephalin was isolated from the plant extract of cushion bush by column chromatography and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results:? The patient was negative to the standard series but positive to parthenolide and to the cushion bush extract. Likewise, positive reactions to cushion bush extracts were seen in SL-mix positive but not in negative patients. Parthenolide was not present in the plant extract as shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, while the guaianolide calocephalin was identified as the major SL. The patient tested positively to calocephalin while the controls tested negatively. Conclusion:? The plant cushion bush can cause occupational allergic contact dermatitis and the major contact sensitizer in the plant is the SL calocephalin.
