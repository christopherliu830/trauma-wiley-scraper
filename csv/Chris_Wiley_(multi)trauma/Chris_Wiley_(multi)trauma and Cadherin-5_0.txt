AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that neutrophils are essential for the protection from invading pathogens, hyperactive neutrophils may elicit detrimental cerebral damage after severe trauma. The neutrophil interactions with the neurovascular unit entail endothelial dysfunction involving endothelial leakage, formation of edema, coagulation abnormalities, disturbed hemodynamics, tissue infiltration etc. These elements of the ?whole body inflammation,? designated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in conjunction with intracerebral proinflammatory activities, are important triggers of post-traumatic cerebral damage and mortality according to the ?second hit? concept. From the immunologic point of view, the brain is an immune privileged site, known to resist autodestructive inflammatory activity much more efficiently than other organs because of the highly efficient diverse functions of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). However, both the underlying strategy of the BBB to maintain cerebral protecting functions against the post-traumatic neutrophil-mediated ?second hit? and how activated neutrophils may overcome the BBB are currently unknown. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of the ?second hit,? the BBB physiology, and its role in the maintenance of cerebral immune privilege, and discusses recent findings that may explain the pathophysiologic neutrophil?BBB interactions occurring after severe trauma, thus offering novel therapeutic options to protect from post-traumatic brain damage. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective Yiqifumai injection is a compound Chinese medicine used to treat microcirculatory disturbance-related diseases clinically. Our previous study proved that Yiqifumai injection pretreatment inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced venular albumin leakage in rat mesentery. This study aimed to investigate whether Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability and corresponding contribution of its main ingredients. Methods Rats were challenged by lipopolysaccharide infusion (5 mg/kg/h) for 90 minutes. Yiqifumai injection (160 mg/kg/h), Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h), Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h), and Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h) + Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h) were infused 30 minutes before (pretreatment) or after (post-treatment) lipopolysaccharide administration. Results Both pretreatment and post-treatment with Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral venular albumin leakage during lipopolysaccharide infusion and cerebrovascular hyperpermeability at 72 hours after lipopolysaccharide infusion. Yiqifumai injection restrained the decreased junction protein expression, adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria complex I, II, IV, and V activities. Moreover, Yiqifumai injection inhibited toll-like receptor-4 expression, Src phosphorylation, and caveolin-1 expression. Its main ingredients Rb1 and Sch alone worked differently, with Rb1 being more effective for enhancing energy metabolism, while Sch attenuating toll-like receptor-4 expression and Src activation. Conclusion Yiqifumai injection exerts a protective and ameliorated effect on cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability, which is more effective than any of its ingredients, possibly due to the interaction of its main ingredients through a multi-pathway mode.

AB  - Abstract? The phenomenon of regeneration is of growing interest to medical researchers. Until recently this was an area in which research in flatworms and newts predominated, but there is now a proliferation of research concerning regeneration in virtually all of the organs, not only the heart One of the object is restoration of function to a failing heart through cell transplantation, and there have been many reports seeking donor sources of somatic stem cells, i.e.: stem cells in marrow or skeletal muscle and ES cells, beginning with those in embryonic myocardial cell transplant experiments. In particular, reports of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into nerve cell, myocardial cell, skeletal muscle cell, and vascular endothelial cell series have drawn attention to cell plasticity, and clinical applications are awaited.

AB  - Abstract Mospd1 codes for a small protein with unknown physiological function, which is part of a family of genes, including Mospd2 and Mospd3, defined by the presence of the major sperm protein domain and two transmembrane domains. This work characterizes the Mospd1 gene, the intracellular location of the protein and its expression in different mouse tissues and mesenchymal cell lines during differentiation. The role of Mospd1 in mesenchymal cellular differentiation was studied by siRNA knockdown experiments in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Transfection experiments of the targeted cDNA show MOSPD1 located in the endoplasmatic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus. Removal of the last exon of the gene resulted in localization of the protein in the nucleus, which was attributed to a nuclear export sequence in the N-terminal part. In mouse tissues the gene was generally strongly expressed while mesenchymal tissues showed the highest expression. In mesenchymal cell lines Mospd1 mRNA was higher expressed in cells with advanced differentiation status. In osteoblastic, myoblastic, and adipocytic cell lines Mospd1 was up-regulated during differentiation. Genome-wide gene expression analysis after knockdown of Mospd1 by siRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells revealed a shift in the gene expression pattern from mesenchymal to epithelial genes featuring up-regulation of the epithelial cadherin Cdh1 and down-regulation of its inhibitors Snail1 and 2 and the mesenchymal cadherin Cdh11, suggesting a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. From these data we conclude that Mospd1 plays a pivotal role in the developmental regulation at the switch between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. J. Cell.

AB  - Purpose:? Studies out of the United States and United Kingdom show great variability in practices relating to prostatic biopsy. This survey was performed to evaluate current practices in Australia and New Zealand. Methods:? Questionnaires were sent to Australian and New Zealand Urologists and Trainees on the database of the Urological Society of Australasia. Results:? Significant variability exists with regard to antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation; analgesic use; number of cores taken; and repeat biopsy practices. Most urologists (91%) perform their own biopsies. 9% refer to another urologist or radiologist. Transrectal biopsy is the favoured approach in 97%. Most urologists (96%) use antibiotic prophylaxis with the quinolone antibiotics being the most commonly used. Only 42% use bowel preparation for their biopsies. Analgesia is used in 79% with equal numbers using sedation and periprostatic nerve block. 77% take 10 cores or more for first biopsy. 28% do not inform their patients of a false negative rate with TRUS biopsy of the prostate. There were 36% and 60% who would not re-biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP respectively. Conclusions:? Prostate biopsy is a commonly performed procedure to diagnose carcinoma of the prostate. Despite significant variability, most Urologists and Trainees in Australia and New Zealand have safe biopsy protocols, given the evidence that is currently available. Evidence supports the use of analgesia and repeating biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP.

AB  - Abstract The endothelial barrier consists of intercellular contacts localized in the cleft between endothelial cells, which is covered by the glycocalyx in a sievelike manner. Both types of barrier-forming junctions, i.e. the adherens junction (AJ) serving mechanical anchorage and mechanotransduction and the tight junction (TJ) sealing the intercellular space to limit paracellular permeability, are tethered to the actin cytoskeleton. Under resting conditions, the endothelium thereby builds a selective layer controlling the exchange of fluid and solutes with the surrounding tissue. However, in the situation of an inflammatory response such as in anaphylaxis or sepsis intercellular contacts disintegrate in post-capillary venules leading to intercellular gap formation. The resulting oedema can cause shock and multi-organ failure. Therefore, maintenance as well as coordinated opening and closure of interendothelial junctions is tightly regulated. The two principle underlying mechanisms comprise spatiotemporal activity control of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA and the balance of the phosphorylation state of AJ proteins. In the resting state, junctional Rac1 and RhoA activity is enhanced by junctional components, actin-binding proteins, cAMP signalling and extracellular cues such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). In addition, phosphorylation of AJ components is prevented by junction-associated phosphatases including vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). In contrast, inflammatory mediators inhibiting cAMP/Rac1 signalling cause strong activation of RhoA and induce AJ phosphorylation finally leading to endocytosis and cleavage of VE-cadherin. This results in dissolution of TJs the outcome of which is endothelial barrier breakdown.

AB  - Abstract Skin tissue engineering is a possible solution for the treatment of extensive skin defect. The ultimate goal of skin tissue engineering is to restore the complete functions of native skin, but until now the structures and functions of skins are only partially restored. By negative immunoselection (CD45 and glycophorin A), we isolated and cultivated adult human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) that are of multilineage differentiation potential. In this study, we first demonstrated that by using gelatin/thermo-sensitive poly N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAAm) and the immunocompromised mice model, the hBMSCs possess the differentiation potential of epidermis and the capability of healing skin wounds. The in vitro observations and the results of the scanning electron microscope showed that the hBMSCs can attach and proliferate in the gelatin/thermo-sensitive pNIPAAm. To further monitor the in vivo growth effect of the hBMSCs in the skin-defected nude mice, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was transduced into the hBMSCs by the murine stem cell viral vector. The results showed that the rates of cell growth and wound recovery in the hBMSC-treated group were significantly higher than those in the control group, which was only treated with the gelatin/pNIPAAm (p < 0.01). More importantly, the re-epithelialization markers of human pan-cytokeratin and E-cadherin were significantly increased on day 7, day 14, and day 21 after the hBMSC-scaffold with the pNIPAAM in the mice with skin defects (p < 0.05). Moreover, the stem cell markers of human CD13 and CD105 were gradually decreased during the period of wound healing. In sum, this novel method provides a transferring system for cell therapies and maintains its temperature-sensitive property of easy-peeling by lower-temperature treatment. In addition, the in vitro and in vivo GFP imaging systems provide a new imaging modality for understanding the differentiation process and the effective expression of stem cells in wound healing. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The concept that the mammalian glycoprotein vitronectin acts as a biological ?glue? and key controller of mammalian tissue repair and remodelling activity is emerging from nearly 50 years of experimental in vitro and in vivo data. Unexpectedly, the vitronectin-knockout (VN-KO) mouse was found to be viable and to have largely normal phenotype. However, diligent observation revealed that the VN-KO animal exhibits delayed coagulation and poor wound healing. This is interpreted to indicate that VN occupies a role in the earliest events of thrombogenesis and tissue repair. VN is the foundation upon which the thrombus grows in an organised structure. In addition to sealing the wound, the thrombus also serves to protect the underlying tissue from oxidation, is a reservoir of mitogens and tissue repair mediators, and provides a provisional scaffold for the repairing tissue. In the absence of VN (e.g., VN-KO animal), this cascade is disrupted before it begins. A wide variety of biologically active species associate with VN. Although initial studies were focused on mitogens, other classes of bioactives (e.g., glycosaminoglycans and metalloproteinases) are now also known to specifically interact with VN. Although some interactions are transient, others are long-lived and often result in multi-protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes provide several advantages: prolonging molecular interactions, sustaining local concentrations, facilitating co-stimulation of cell surface receptors and thereby enhancing cellular/biological responses. We contend that these, or equivalent, multi-protein complexes facilitate VN polyfunctionality in vivo. It is also likely that many of the species demonstrated to associate with VN in vitro, also associate with VN in vivo in similar multi-protein complexes. Thus, the predominant biological function of VN is that of a master controller of the extracellular environment; informing, and possibly instructing cells ?where? to behave, ?when? to behave and ?how? to behave (i.e., appropriately for the current circumstance). ? 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(10):807-818, 2013

AB  - Abstract The periosteum serves as bone's bounding membrane, exhibits hallmarks of semipermeable epithelial barrier membranes, and contains mechanically sensitive progenitor cells capable of generating bone. The current paucity of data regarding the periosteum's permeability and bidirectional transport properties provided the impetus for the current study. In ovine femur and tibia samples, the periosteum's hydraulic permeability coefficient, k, was calculated using Darcy's Law and a custom-designed permeability tester to apply controlled, volumetric flow of phosphate-buffered saline through periosteum samples. Based on these data, ovine periosteum demonstrates mechanically responsive and directionally dependent (anisotropic) permeability properties. At baseline flow rates comparable to interstitial fluid flow (0.5?µL/s), permeability is low and does not exhibit anisotropy. In contrast, at high flow rates comparable to those prevailing during traumatic injury, femoral periosteum exhibits an order of magnitude higher permeability compared to baseline flow rates. In addition, at high flow rates permeability exhibits significant directional dependence, with permeability higher in the bone to muscle direction than vice versa. Furthermore, compared to periosteum in which the intrinsic tension (pre-stress) is maintained, free relaxation of the tibial periosteum after resection significantly increases its permeability in both flow directions. Hence, the structure and mechanical stress state of periosteum influences its role as bone's bounding membrane. During periods of homeostasis, periosteum may serve as a barrier membrane on the outer surface of bone, allowing for equal albeit low quiescent molecular communication between tissue compartments including bone and muscle. In contrast, increases in pressure and baseline flow rates within the periosteum resulting from injury, trauma, and/or disease may result in a significant increase in periosteum permeability and consequently in increased molecular communication between tissue compartments. Elucidation of the periosteum's permeability properties is key to understanding periosteal mechanobiology in bone health and healing, as well as to elucidate periosteum structure and function as a smart biomaterial that allows bidirectional and mechanically responsive fluid transport. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
