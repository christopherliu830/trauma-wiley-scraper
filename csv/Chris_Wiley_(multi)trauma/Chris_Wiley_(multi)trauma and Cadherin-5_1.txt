AB  - Abstract ?-Secretase is an aspartyl protease composed of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), APH1, and PEN2. These proteins assemble into a membrane complex that cleaves a variety of substrates within the transmembrane domain. The ?-secretase cleavage products play an important role in various biological processes such as embryonic development and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The major role of ?-secretase in brain pathology has been linked to AD and to the production of the amyloid ?-peptide. However, little is known about the possible role of ?-secretase following acute brain insult. Here we examined by immunostaining the expression patterns of two ?-secretase components, PS1 and Nct, in three paradigms of brain insult in mice: closed head injury, intracerebroventricular injection of LPS, and brain stabbing. Our results show that in naïve and sham-injured brains expression of PS1 and Nct is restricted mainly to neurons. However, following insult, the expression of both proteins is also observed in nonneuronal cells, consisting of activated astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, the proteins are coexpressed within the same astrocytes and microglia, implying that these cells exhibit an enhanced ?-secretase activity following brain damage. In view of the important role played by astrocytes and microglia in brain disorders, our findings suggest that ?-secretase may participate in brain damage and repair processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation and/or function. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The small intestine plays a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure following circulatory shock. Current results show that reduced perfusion of the small intestine compromises the mucosal epithelial barrier, and the intestinal contents (including pancreatic digestive enzymes and partially digested food) can enter the intestinal wall and transport through the circulation or mesenteric lymph to other organs such as the lung. The extent to which the luminal contents of the small intestine mediate tissue damage in the intestine and lung is poorly understood in shock. Therefore, rats were assigned to three groups: No-hemorrhagic shock (HS) control and HS with or without a flushed intestine. HS was induced by reducing the mean arterial pressure (30 mmHg; 90 min) followed by return of shed blood and observation (3 h). The small intestine and lung were analyzed for hemorrhage, neutrophil accumulation, and cellular membrane protein degradation. After HS, animals with luminal contents had increased neutrophil accumulation, bleeding, and destruction of E-cadherin in the intestine. Serine protease activity was elevated in mesenteric lymph fluid collected from a separate group of animals subjected to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. Serine protease activity was elevated in the plasma after HS but was detected in lungs only in animals with nonflushed lumens. Despite removal of the luminal contents, lung injury occurred in both groups as determined by elevated neutrophil accumulation, permeability, and lung protein destruction. In conclusion, luminal contents significantly increase intestinal damage during experimental HS, suggesting transport of luminal contents across the intestinal wall should be minimized.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell microenvironments are enriched by signals from a variety of components, which cooperate spatially and temporally to regulate cellular function. In vitro recapitulating such complexity in a well-controlled manner is elusive. Here, a platform for patterning multiple bio-active proteins on a single substrate is developed and optimized, and is used it to study the cooperative involvement of cell?matrix interaction and cell?cell signaling in regulating neural stem cell (NSC) function. An affinity-capturing-based multi-step microcontact printing is used to pattern, extracellular matrix proteins, and cell?cell signaling ligands, as intersecting lines on a nonadhesive background. Such design provides spatial segregation of signals from different extrinsic components, while allowing cell traffic between them during their proliferation and differentiation processes. Rat embryonic neural stem cells are cultured and characterized on the multicomponent substrates patterned with different combinations of fibronectin, N-cadherin, and Jagged1 proteins and allow to proliferate and differentiate over long term. It is found that local presentation of Notch signaling ligand (Jagged1) or cell adhesion molecule (N-cadherin) effectively modulate the balance between cell?cell and cell?matrix interaction, and significantly change the overall spatial remodeling of NSC differentiation. This platform provides an unambiguous approach to study the spatial and temporal cooperative involvement of different extrinsic components in regulating stem cell behavior. It is also readily expandable for inclusion of extra components and applicable to use with other types of cells, which provide a powerful tool for basic study of cell?material interaction or advanced tissue-interface engineering.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.

AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that extensive studies have focused on heterotopic ossification (HO), its molecular mechanism remains unclear. The endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which may be partially modulated by neuroendocrine cytokines is thought to play a major role in HO. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which has neuroendocrine characteristics is believed to promote skeletal remodeling. Herein, we suggest that that NT-3 may promote HO formation through regulation of EndMT. Here, we used an in vivo model of HO and an in vitro model of EndMT induction to elucidate the effect and underlying mechanism of NT-3 on EndMT in HO. Our results showed that heterotopic bone and cartilage arose from EndMT and NT-3 promoted HO formation in vivo. Our in vitro results showed that NT-3 up-regulated mesenchymal markers (FSP-1, α-SMA and N-cadherin) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers (STRO-1, CD44 and CD90) and down-regulated endothelial markers (Tie-1, VE-cadherin and CD31). Moreover, NT-3 enhanced a chondrogenesis marker (Sox9) and osteogenesis markers (OCN and Runx2) via activation of EndMT. However, both EndMT specific inhibitor and tropomyosin-related kinase C (TrkC) specific inhibitor rescued NT-3-induced HO formation and EndMT induction in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that NT-3 promotes HO formation via modulation of EndMT both in vivo and in vitro, which offers a new potential target for the prevention and therapy of HO.

AB  - A novel method for repair of vascular disease, mechanical damage, and tissue rebuilding is urgently required. Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) play an essential role in vascular rebuilding and vasotransplantation. In the present study, human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were cultured and induced into endothelial-like cells in vitro in order to confirm that HGFs with stem cell properties possessed the potential for differentiation into endothelial-like cells. The epithelium was extracted from normal human gingiva consisting of epithelium and connective tissue, which was isolated from patients. The identification of HGFs and induced endothelial-like cells were confirmed by flow cytometry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT?PCR), immunocytochemical stain (ICS), and immunofluorescence stain (ISA). The morphology of human gingival fibroblasts with 8 ng/mL VEGF165 induced for different periods of days were observed by inverted microscope. Before induction, flow cytometry analysis showed that HGFs were positive for vimentin, but negative for CD31. RT?PCR, ICS, and ISA showed vimentin, S100A4, α-SMA, collagen III, and S100A4 were specifically expressed in these fibroblast cells. After induction, ICS showed induced vascular endothelial-like cells were positive for CD34 and CD31; ISA showed cells induced were positive for vWF and E-cadherin; RT?PCR results demonstrated that tie2 was specifically expressed in the cells induced. Flow cytometry analysis of the transformation efficiency from HGFs to endothelial-like cells. In conclusion, we found that HGFs possessed capacity for being induced and differentiated into vessel endothelial-like cells with typical and specific morphological, ultrastructural, and immunological characters of endothelial-like cells by induction with VEGF.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeutic approaches in bone-healing disorders. Although bone marrow-derived MSCs are most frequently used, the knowledge that many other adult tissues represent promising sources for potent MSCs has gained acceptance. In the present study, the osteogenic differentiation potential of porcine skin fibroblasts (FBs), as well as bone marrow- (BMSCs), adipose tissue- (ASCs) and dental pulp-derived stromal cells (DSCs) were evaluated. However, additional application of BMP-2 significantly elevated the delayed osteogenic differentiation capacity of ASC and FB cultures, and in DSC cultures the supplementation of platelet-rich plasma increased osteogenic differentiation potential to a comparable level of the good differentiable BMSCs. Furthermore, microarray gene expression performed in an exemplary manner for ASCs and BMSCs revealed that ASCs and BMSCs use different gene expression patterns for osteogenic differentiation under standard media conditions, as diverse MSCs are imprinted dependent from their tissue niche. However, after increasing the differentiation potential of ASCs to a comparable level as shown in BMSCs, a small subset of identical key molecules was used to differentiate in the osteogenic lineage. Until now, the importance of identified genes seems to be underestimated for osteogenic differentiation. Apparently, the regulation of transmembrane protein 229A, interleukin-33 and the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 in the early phase of osteogenic differentiation is needed for optimum results. Based on these results, bone regeneration strategies of MSCs have to be adjusted, and in vivo studies on the osteogenic capacities of the different types of MCSs are warranted.

HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process, which is not yet completely understood. Satellite cells, the skeletal muscle stem cells, become activated after trauma, proliferate, and migrate to the site of injury. Depending on the severity of the myotrauma, activated satellite cells form new multinucleated myofibers or fuse to damaged myofibers. The specific microenvironment of the satellite cells, the niche, controls their behavior. The niche contains several components that maintain satellite cells quiescence until they are activated. In addition, a great diversity of stimulatory and inhibitory growth factors such as IGF-1 and TGF-?1 regulate their activity. Donor-derived satellite cells are able to improve muscle regeneration, but their migration through the muscle tissue and across endothelial layers is limited. Less than 1% of their progeny, the myoblasts, survive the first days upon intra-muscular injection. However, a range of other multipotent muscle- and non-muscle-derived stem cells are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. These stem cells can occupy the satellite cell niche and show great potential for the treatment of skeletal muscle injuries and diseases. The aim of this review is to discuss the niche factors, growth factors, and other stem cells, which are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. Knowledge about the factors regulating satellite cell activity and skeletal muscle regeneration can be used to improve the treatment of muscle injuries and diseases. J. Cell.

AB  - BACKGROUND Although a majority of the studies conducted to date on platelet (PLT) storage have been focused on PLT hemostatic function, the effects of 4°C PLTs on regulation of endothelial barrier permeability are still not known. In this study, we compared the effects of room temperature (22°C) stored and (4°C) stored PLTs on the regulation of vascular endothelial cell (EC) permeability in vitro and in vivo. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Day 1, Day 5, and Day 7 leukoreduced apheresis PLTs stored at 4 or 22°C were studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, PLT effects on EC permeability and barrier function, adhesion, and impedance aggregometry were investigated. In vivo, using a mouse model of vascular leak, attenuation of vascular leak and circulating PLT numbers were measured. RESULTS Treatment of EC monolayers with Day 5 or Day 7 PLTs, stored at both 22°C and 4°C, resulted in similar decreases in EC permeability on average. However, analysis of individual samples revealed significant variation that was donor dependent. Additional in vitro measurements revealed a decrease in inflammatory mediators, nonspecific PLT-endothelial aggregation and attenuated loss of aggregation over time to TRAP, ASPI, ADP, and collagen with 4°C storage. In mice, while 22°C and 4°C PLTs both demonstrated significant protection against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)-induced vascular leak 22°C PLTs exhibited increased protection compared to 4°C PLTs. Systemic circulating levels of 4°C PLTs were decreased compared to 22°C PLTs. CONCLUSIONS In vitro, 4°C-stored PLTs exhibit a greater capacity to inhibit EC permeability than 22°C-stored PLTs. In vivo, 22°C PLTs provide superior control of vascular leak induced by VEGF-A. This discrepancy may be due to increased clearance of 4°C PLTs from the systemic circulation.

AB  - Abstract The skin expansion technique is widely used to induce skin growth for large-scale skin deformity reconstruction. However, the capacity for skin expansion is limited and searching for ways to improve the expansion efficiency is a challenge. In this study, we aimed to explore the possible mechanism of skin expansion and to find a potential therapeutic target on promoting skin growth. We conducted weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of microarray data generated from rat skin expansion and found CCN1 (CYR61) to be the central hub gene related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CCN1 up-regulation was confirmed in human and rat expanded skin and also in mechanically stretched rat keratinocytes, together with acquired mesenchymal phenotype. After CCN1 stimulation on keratinocytes, cell proliferation was promoted and partial EMT was induced by activating ?-catenin pathway. Treatment of CCN1 protein could significantly increase the flap thickness, improve the blood supply and restore the structure in a rat model of skin expansion, whereas inhibition of CCN1 through shRNA interference could dramatically reduce the efficiency of skin expansion. Our findings demonstrate that CCN1 plays a crucial role in skin expansion and that CCN1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target to promote skin growth and improve the efficiency of skin expansion.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - Abstract Increased tissue permeability is a common characteristic of a number of diseases such as pulmonary edema, inflammatory bowel disease, several kidney diseases, diabetic retinopathy, and tumors. We hypothesized that growth factors increase permeability by redistribution of tight junction proteins away from the cell border. To investigate mechanisms of growth factor-mediated permeability, we examined the effect of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell tight junction protein distribution and on permeability. PDGF altered the cellular distribution of occludin and ZO-1 from the cell border to the cytoplasm and increased permeability to 70 kDa dextran in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of MDCK cells with PDGF prior to fixation allowed binding of the lectin concanavalin A to the basement membrane of fixed cells, while binding was prevented in untreated control monolayers, implying that PDGF induced the formation of a paracellular transport pathway. Cell fractionation experiments with PDGF-treated cells revealed a novel occludin-containing low-density, detergent resistant subcellular structure, which increased in the buoyant fractions relative to occludin in the pellet in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Immunocytochemistry revealed that a pool of internalized occludin co-labels with the early endosome marker, EEA1, suggesting that PDGF may stimulate occludin to enter an endosomal pathway. PDGF may act as a permeabilizing agent by moving tight junction proteins away from the cell border in discrete microdomains, and the effects of PDGF on permeability and tight junction protein distribution may model the regulation of epithelial and endothelial barrier properties by other peptide growth factors.

AB  - Abstract Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in the United States. The majority of these deaths are due to metastasis, with the liver easily accounting as the most common site of deposit. While there are multiple steps in the CRC hepatic metastatic cascade, this review attempts to summarize the different processes involved, focusing on the most recent discoveries, as well as the associated effects in relation to prognosis.

AB  - Opioid systems mainly regulate physiological functions such as pain, emotional tone and reward circuitry in neural tissues (brain and spinal cord). These systems are also found in extraneural tissues (ganglia, gut, spleen, stomach, lung, pancreas, liver, heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent studies have elucidated their roles in various organs. The current review focuses on the roles of opioid systems in blood vessels, especially angiogenesis, during development and tumour malignancy. The balance between endogenous activators and inhibitors of angiogenesis delicately maintains a normally quiescent vasculature to sustain homeostasis. Disturbance of this balance causes pathogenic angiogenesis and, especially in tumours, several activators such as VEGF are highly expressed in the tumour microenvironment and strongly induce tumour angiogenesis, the so-called angiogenic switch. Recently, we demonstrated that ? opioid receptor agonists function as anti-angiogenic factors, which impede the angiogenic switch, in vascular development and tumour angiogenesis by inhibiting the expression of receptors for VEGF. In clinical medicine, angiogenesis inhibitors that target VEGF signalling such as bevacizumab are used as anti-cancer drugs. Although therapies that inhibit tumour angiogenesis have been highly successful for tumour therapy, most patients eventually develop resistance to this anti-angiogenic therapy. Thus, we must identify novel targets for anti-angiogenic agents to sustain inhibition of angiogenesis for tumour therapy. The regulation of responses to ? opioid receptor ligands could be useful for controlling vascular formation under physiological conditions and in cancers, and thus could offer therapeutic benefits beyond the relief of pain.
