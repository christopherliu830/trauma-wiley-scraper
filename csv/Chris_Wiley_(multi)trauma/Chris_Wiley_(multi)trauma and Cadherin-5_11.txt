Transcriptional and non-transcriptional Pax7 functions in myogenic progenitors ?? Protein interactions, post-translational modifications and the regulation of Pax7 ?? Extracellular signalling and the control of Pax7 in muscle progenitors -? Wnt signalling -? Notch signalling -? The transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) superfamily -? Syndecans -? Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and p38 ?? Concluding remarks Post-natal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle is highly dependent on a population of resident myogenic precursors known as satellite cells. Transcription factors from the Pax gene family, Pax3 and Pax7, are critical for satellite cell biogenesis, survival and potentially self-renewal; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unsolved. This is particularly true in the case of Pax7, which appears to regulate myogenesis at multiple levels. Accordingly, recent data have highlighted the importance of a functional relationship between Pax7 and the MyoD family of muscle regulatory transcription factors during normal muscle formation and disease. Here we will critically review key findings suggesting that Pax7 may play a dual role by promoting resident muscle progenitors to commit to the skeletal muscle lineage while preventing terminal differentiation, thus keeping muscle progenitors poised to differentiate upon environmental cues. In addition, potential regulatory mechanisms for the control of Pax7 activity will be proposed.

AB  - Aggressive behavior has both genetic and environmental components. Many association studies have been performed to identify genetic factors underlying aggressive behaviors in humans. In this review we summarize the previous work performed in this field, considering both candidate gene (CGAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), excluding those performed in samples where the primary diagnosis is a psychiatric or neurological disorder other than an aggression-related phenotype. Subsequently, we have studied the enrichment of pathways and functions in GWAS data. The results of our searches show that most CGAS have identified associations with genes involved in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission and in hormone regulation. On the other hand, GWAS have not yet identified genome-wide significant associations, but top nominal findings are related to several signaling pathways, such as axon guidance or estrogen receptor signaling, and also to neurodevelopmental processes and synaptic plasticity. Future studies should use larger samples, homogeneous phenotypes and standardized measurements to identify genes that underlie aggressive behaviors in humans. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, provide a powerful platform for mechanistic studies of disorders of neurodevelopment and neural networks. hPSC models of autism, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders are also advancing the path toward designing and testing precision therapies. The field is evolving rapidly with the addition of genome-editing approaches, expanding protocols for the two-dimensional (2D) differentiation of different neuronal subtypes, and three-dimensional (3D) human brain organoid cultures. However, the application of these techniques to study complex neurological disorders, including the epilepsies, remains a challenge. Here, we review previous work using both 2D and 3D hPSC models of genetic epilepsies, as well as recent advances in the field. We also describe new strategies for applying these technologies to disease modeling of genetic epilepsies, and discuss current challenges and future directions.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent cause of dementia, is escalating as a global epidemic, and so far, there is neither cure nor treatment to alter its progression. The most important feature of the disease is neuronal death and loss of cognitive functions, caused probably from several pathological processes in the brain. The main neuropathological features of AD are widely described as amyloid beta (A?) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of the aggregated protein tau, which contribute to the disease. Nevertheless, AD brains suffer from a variety of alterations in function, such as energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic activity. The latest decades have seen an explosion of genes and molecules that can be employed as targets aiming to improve brain physiology, which can result in preventive strategies for AD. Moreover, therapeutics using these targets can help AD brains to sustain function during the development of AD pathology. Here, we review broadly recent information for potential targets that can modify AD through diverse pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches including gene therapy. We propose that AD could be tackled not only using combination therapies including A? and tau, but also considering insulin and cholesterol metabolism, vascular function, synaptic plasticity, epigenetics, neurovascular junction and blood?brain barrier targets that have been studied recently. We also make a case for the role of gut microbiota in AD. Our hope is to promote the continuing research of diverse targets affecting AD and promote diverse targeting as a near-future strategy.
