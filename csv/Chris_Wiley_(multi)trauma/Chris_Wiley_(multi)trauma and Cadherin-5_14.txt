AB  - Abstract The NF Conference is the largest annual gathering of researchers and clinicians focused on neurofibromatosis and has been convened by the Children's Tumor Foundation for over 20 years. The 2009 NF Conference was held in Portland, Oregon from June 13 to June 16, 2009 and co-chaired by Kathryn North from the University of Sydney and The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia; and Joseph Kissil from the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia. The Conference included 80 platform presentations in 9 sessions over 4 days; over 100 abstracts presented as posters; and three Keynote presentations. To date, there have been tremendous advances in basic research in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis, and more recently in progress toward identifying effective drug therapies and the commencement of neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The NF Conference attendees have significantly increased (doubling from 140 in 2005 to 280 attending in 2009) with a significant increase in attendance of physicians and clinical researchers. Correspondingly the NF Conference scope has expanded to include translational research, clinical trials and clinical management issues while retaining a core of basic research. These themes are reflected in the highlights from the 2009 NF Conference presented here. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Molecularly, breast cancer represents a highly heterogenous family of neoplastic disorders, with substantial interpatient variations regarding genetic mutations, cell composition, transcriptional profiles, and treatment response. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient-by-patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA-specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene-therapy, while its catalytically-dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses. In this review, CRISPR strategies for the advancement of breast cancer diagnostics, modeling, and treatment are highlighted, culminating in a perspective on developing a precision medicine-based approach against breast cancer.

AB  - Abstract The global epidemic of chronic degenerative diseases represents an increasing burden on all healthcare systems. Regenerative medicine has promise to become the next generation therapy as this strategy can potentially restore/establish the normal function of damaged organs and tissues. Regeneration refers to engraftment of progenitor cells that require in vivo growth and differentiation to establish recipient homeostasis through de novo function of the stem cell-based transplant. An intense search is ongoing for tissue-specific stem cells that have the capacity to re-establish lost function when ectopically transplanted into a wide range of diseased tissues, as evident in diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and degenerative neurological diseases. Most regenerative medicine strategies rely on stem cells, growth factors, biomaterials, and their combination. The alginate hydrogel has been widely explored over the past several decades as a cell delivery vehicle for different cell populations intended to direct the regeneration and function restoration of various tissues and organs in the body.

AB  - Abstract Polysucrose (PSuc) is hydrophilic, has excellent biocompatibility with cells as a density gradient and is resistant to enzymes. Its use in electrospun mats for tissue engineering applications has not been investigated due to its amorphous nature. For spinnability and robustness, polysucrose was blended with poly-L-lactide (PLLA) and polydioxanone (PDX) respectively and electrospun into nanofibrous mats. Interaction with cells was assessed using L929 mouse fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes separately and in co-culture. Effect of parameters such as porosity, fiber diameter, surface wettability and mechanical properties of mats on cell-scaffold interactions was studied. Depending on nature and composition of mats, fibroblasts showed dendritic, spindle or round cell morphologies along with the formation of lamellipodia, filopodia, fibrillar or fiber-like projections of 100 nm and 200?300 nm in diameter respectively from the periphery or center of cells. Granular extracellular matrix was formed on both PLLA-PSuc and PDX-PSuc 50?50 seeded with keratinocytes. Growth of keratinocytes was enhanced in co-culture with fibroblasts with the formation of a skin-like layer. Both cells showed the ability to form multilayer structures. The mats maintained their physical integrity during the period of study. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 106A: 3275?3291, 2018.
