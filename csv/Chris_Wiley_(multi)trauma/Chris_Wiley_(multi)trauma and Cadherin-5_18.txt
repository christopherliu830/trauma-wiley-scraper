AB  - Abstract Cervical cancer is the third leading cause of female death in the world. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are currently considered to be valuable as noninvasive cancer biomarkers, but their role in the prognosis of cervical cancer has not been elucidated. We aimed to find serum miRNAs that can be used as prognostic factors for cervical cancer. A traumatic pathological biopsy is the only reliable method for determining the severity of cervical cancer currently. Thus, noninvasive diagnostic markers are needed. The serological expression of candidate miRNAs were measured in 90 participants, including 60 patients with cervical cancer and 50 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Two patients with cervical cancer were excluded from the study because of lack of data. miRNAs were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-143/?4636 appeared specific for cervical cancer compared with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (P?<?.001). The classification performance of validated miRNAs for cervical cancer [Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)?=?0.942] was better than that reached by squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag; AUC?=?0.727). Poor-differentiation group has lower miR-143/?4636 levels in serum (P?<?.05). miR-4636 level was correlated gross tumor volume and the depth of invasion (P?<?.0001). In our study, we found a combination of miR-143 and miR-4636 that is independently and strongly associated with cervical cancer prognosis and can be used as a clinically prognostic factor.

AB  - Abstract To introduce a functional vascular network into tissue-engineered bone equivalents, human endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be cocultured. Here, we studied the impact of donor variation of human bone marrow-derived MSCs and cord blood-derived ECFCs on vasculogenesis and osteogenesis using a 3D in vitro coculture model. Further, to make the step towards cocultures consisting of cells derived from a single donor, we tested how induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human endothelial cells (iECs) performed in coculture models. Cocultures with varying combinations of human donors of MSCs, ECFCs, or iECs were prepared in Matrigel. The constructs were cultured in an osteogenic differentiation medium. Following a 10-day culture period, the length of the prevascular structures and osteogenic differentiation were evaluated for up to 21 days of culture. The particular combination of MSC and ECFC donors influenced the vasculogenic properties significantly and induced variation in osteogenic potential. In addition, the use of iECs in the cocultures resulted in prevascular structure formation in osteogenically differentiated constructs. Together, these results showed that close attention to the source of primary cells, such as ECFCs and MSCs, is critical to address variability in vasculogenic and osteogenic potential. The 3D coculture model appeared to successfully generate prevascularized constructs and were sufficient in exceeding the ~200 ?m diffusion limit. In addition, iPSC-derived cell lineages may decrease variability by providing a larger and potentially more uniform source of cells for future preclinical and clinical applications.

AB  - Abstract Recently the role of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) as a gasotransmitter stimulated wide interest owing to its involvement in Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke. Previously we demonstrated the importance of functional ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) by neurons is critical for H2S-mediated dose- and time-dependent injury. Moreover N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists abolished the consequences of H2S-induced neuronal death. This study focuses on deciphering the downstream effects activation of NMDAR on H2S-mediated neuronal injury by analyzing the time-course of global gene profiling (5, 15, and 24?h) to provide a comprehensive description of the recruitment of NMDAR-mediated signaling. Microarray analyses were performed on RNA from cultured mouse primary cortical neurons treated with 200?µM sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) or NMDA over a time-course of 5?24?h. Data were validated via real-time PCR, western blotting, and global proteomic analysis. A substantial overlap of 1649 genes, accounting for over 80% of NMDA global gene profile present in that of H2S and over 50% vice versa, was observed. Within these commonly occurring genes, the percentage of transcriptional consistency at each time-point ranged from 81 to 97%. Gene families involved included those related to cell death, endoplasmic reticulum stress, calcium homeostasis, cell cycle, heat shock proteins, and chaperones. Examination of genes exclusive to H2S-mediated injury (43%) revealed extensive dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These data form a foundation for the development of screening platforms and define targets for intervention in H2S neuropathologies where NMDAR-activated signaling cascades played a substantial role.
