AB  - ABSTRACT Tendons mainly function as load-bearing tissues in the muscloskeletal system; transmitting loads from muscle to bone. Tendons are dynamic structures that respond to the magnitude, direction, frequency, and duration of physiologic as well as pathologic mechanical loads via complex interactions between cellular pathways and the highly specialized extracellular matrix. This paper reviews the evolution and current knowledge of mechanobiology in tendon development, homeostasis, disease, and repair. In addition, we review several novel mechanotransduction pathways that have been identified recently in other tissues and cell types, providing potential research opportunities in the field of tendon mechanobiology. We also highlight current methods, models, and technologies being used in a wide variety of mechanobiology research that could be investigated in the context of their potential applicability for answering some of the fundamental unanswered questions in this field. The article concludes with a review of the major questions and future goals discussed during the recent ORS/ISMMS New Frontiers in Tendon Research Conference held on September 10 and 11, 2014 in New York City. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary The cardiovascular system is a dynamic, cyclically loaded, pressure-driven flow system that involves ongoing mechanical feedback loops directing cell response and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which sustain homeostasis of the system, guide adaptive remodeling of the vessel wall, and perpetuate disease progression. Mechanotransduction thus represents an important mechanism in determining vascular health and disease response, and can be exploited to provide improved vascular treatments. This chapter reviews research related to cardiovascular mechanobiology, focusing on two main topics: (i) arterial wall mechanics and mechanobiology, and their exploitation in understanding arterial disease progression and therapeutics; and (ii) the role of computational hemodynamics in cardiovascular mechanobiology, and its exploitation in vascular graft application.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a comprehensive summary of the basic criteria that are critical to the histologic diagnosis of melanoma. It focuses on the clinical features of the prototypic subgroups of melanoma such as lentiginous melanoma. After a consideration of the clinical features, the histology of the radial growth phase as it relates to specific subtypes of melanoma is addressed followed by a discussion on the recognition of the vertical growth phase. Five-year survival rates according to measured Breslow thickness are given in the chapter for patients with stage I lesions, where the tumor is confined to the primary site of the melanoma without regional lymph node involvement or distant metastatic disease. Unusual forms of melanoma are discussed at the end of the chapter.

AB  - Abstract Cells are covered by a surface layer of glycans that is referred to as the ?glycocalyx?. In this review, we focus on the role of the glycocalyx in vascular diseases (atherosclerosis, stroke, hypertension, kidney disease and sepsis) and cancer. The glycocalyx and its principal glycosaminoglycans [heparan sulphate (HS) and hyaluronic acid (HA)] and core proteins (syndecans and glypicans) are degraded in vascular diseases, leading to a breakdown of the vascular permeability barrier, enhanced access of leucocytes to the arterial intima that propagate inflammation and alteration of endothelial mechanotransduction mechanisms that protect against disease. By contrast, the glycocalyx on cancer cells is generally robust, promoting integrin clustering and growth factor signalling, and mechanotransduction of interstitial flow shear stress that is elevated in tumours to upregulate matrix metalloproteinase release which enhances cell motility and metastasis. HS and HA are consistently elevated on cancer cells and are associated with tumour growth and metastasis. Later, we will review the agents that might be used to enhance or protect the glycocalyx to combat vascular disease, as well as a different set of compounds that can degrade the cancer cell glycocalyx to suppress cell growth and metastasis. It is clear that what is beneficial for either vascular disease or cancer will not be so for the other. The overarching conclusions are that (i) the importance of the glycocalyx in human medicine is only beginning to be recognized, and (ii) more detailed studies of glycocalyx involvement in vascular diseases and cancer will lead to novel treatment modalities.

AB  - Abstract The zonal organization of osteochondral tissue underlies its long term function. Despite this, tissue engineering strategies targeted for osteochondral repair commonly rely on the use of isotropic biomaterials for tissue reconstruction. There exists a need for a new class of highly biomimetic, anisotropic scaffolds that may allow for the engineering of new tissue with zonal properties. To address this need, we report the facile production of monolithic multidirectional collagen-based scaffolds that recapitulate the zonal structure and composition of osteochondral tissue. First, superficial and osseous zone-mimicking scaffolds were fabricated by unidirectional freeze casting collagen-hyaluronic acid and collagen-hydroxyapatite-containing suspensions, respectively. Following their production, a lyophilization bonding process was used to conjoin these scaffolds with a distinct collagen-hyaluronic acid suspension mimicking the composition of the transition zone. Resulting matrices contained a thin, highly aligned superficial zone that interfaced with a cellular transition zone and vertically oriented calcified cartilage and osseous zones. Confocal microscopy confirmed a zone-specific localization of hyaluronic acid, reflecting the depth-dependent increase of glycosaminoglycans in the native tissue. Poorly crystalline, carbonated hydroxyapatite was localized to the calcified cartilage and osseous zones and bordered the transition zone. Compressive testing of hydrated scaffold zones confirmed an increase of stiffness with scaffold depth, where compressive moduli of chondral and osseous zones fell within or near ranges conducive for chondrogenesis or osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells. With the combination of these biomimetic architectural and compositional cues, these multidirectional scaffolds hold great promise for the engineering of zonal osteochondral tissue. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
