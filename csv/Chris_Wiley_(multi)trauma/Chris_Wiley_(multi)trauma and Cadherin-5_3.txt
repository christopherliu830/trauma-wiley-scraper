AB  - Summary Avascular, aneural articular cartilage has a low capacity for self-repair and as a consequence is highly susceptible to degradative diseases such as osteoarthritis. Thus the development of cell-based therapies that repair focal defects in otherwise healthy articular cartilage is an important research target, aiming both to delay the onset of degradative diseases and to decrease the need for joint replacement surgery. This review will discuss the cell sources which are currently being investigated for the generation of chondrogenic cells. Autologous chondrocyte implantation using chondrocytes expanded ex vivo was the first chondrogenic cellular therapy to be used clinically. However, limitations in expansion potential have led to the investigation of adult mesenchymal stem cells as an alternative cell source and these therapies are beginning to enter clinical trials. The chondrogenic potential of human embryonic stem cells will also be discussed as a developmentally relevant cell source, which has the potential to generate chondrocytes with phenotype closer to that of articular cartilage. The clinical application of these chondrogenic cells is much further away as protocols and tissue engineering strategies require additional optimization. The efficacy of these cell types in the regeneration of articular cartilage tissue that is capable of withstanding biomechanical loading will be evaluated according to the developing regulatory framework to determine the most appropriate cellular therapy for adoption across an expanding patient population.

AB  - Abstract Background PCDH19 has become the second most relevant gene in epilepsy after SCN1A. Seizures often provoked by fever. Methods We screened 152 children with fever-sensitive epilepsy for gene detection. Their clinical information was followed up. Results We found eight PCDH19 point mutations (four novel and four reported) and one whole gene deletion in 10 female probands (seven sporadic cases and three family cases) who also had cluster seizures. The common clinical features of 16 patients in 10 families included fever-sensitive and cluster seizures, mainly focal or tonic-clonic seizures, and absence of status epilepticus, normal intelligence, or mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment, the onset age ranges from 5 months to 20 years. Only four patients had multiple or focal transient discharges in interictal EEG. Focal seizures originating in the frontal region were recorded in four patients, two from the parietal region, and one from the occipital region. Conclusion PCDH19 mutation can be inherited or de novo. The clinical spectrum of PCDH19 mutation includes PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy with or without mental retardation, psychosis, and asymptomatic male. The onset age of PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy can range from infancy to adulthood. Sisters in the same family may be sensitive to the same antiepileptic drugs. And our report expands the mutation spectrum of PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy.

AB  - The 14th Annual Meeting of the Winter Conference on Neural Plasticity was held in Moorea, French Polynesia from February 22 ? March 02, 2002. The Conference was attended by approximately 80 participants from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Hungary, New Zealand and the United States. Most of the participants were neuroscientists from universities and basic research departments of applied institutions. The primary focus of the conference is to annually review recent advances in the area of neural plasticity from multi-disciplinary and lifespan perspectives. There was an initial ?New Concepts Session? and nine scientific sessions each lasting two hours.

AB  - Summary Studies published in recent years have highlighted the role of epidermal barrier defects in both atopic skin disease and the development of broader allergic manifestations. While genetic determinants of barrier function are important, it is clear that local acquired effects are also involved in disease pathogenesis. In this review, we aimed to summarize the known influences of cytokines abundantly expressed during atopic skin disease on components of epidermal barrier integrity and function.

AB  - Abstract Over the past few years, issues related to the commitment and potential of reservoir precursor cells that reside in most tissues have been revisited. Many reports have documented either plasticity or de-differentiation of a number of precursor cells isolated from several tissues, including bone marrow, brain, and skeletal muscle. These findings have challenged the dogma that mononuclear cells derived from adult, post-mitotic tissues can differentiate and contribute only to the tissue from which they originate. Thus, much current research in stem cells is testing the therapeutic potential of these cells to deliver normal genes and their encoded proteins into damaged or injured tissues. This review will focus on muscle-derived precursor cells and their apparently heterogeneous nature and summarize some of the most recent findings and hypotheses on their characterization and practical use.

AB  - Summary 1. The role of satellite cells in muscle growth during development is well documented, but the involvement of these cells in muscle repair after contusion is less well known. In the present study, we investigated the time-course of satellite cell activity (from 3?h to 7?days) after contusion of rat gastrocnemius muscle using specific molecular markers for immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 2. Inflammation of the injured muscle occurred within 6?h, followed by disintegration of the damaged myofibres within 12?h. Newly formed myofibres appeared by Day 7. 3. The number of MyoD-positive nuclei (activated satellite cells) in the injured muscle was significantly increased by 6?h, reaching a maximum by 12?h after contusion. However, the number of MyoD-positive nuclei decreased towards control levels by Day 7. Changes in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labelled nuclei (proliferating satellite cells) paralleled the changes seen in the number of MyoD-positive nuclei. Conversely, expression of myogenin protein was not apparent until Day 3 and increased further by Day 7. Colabelling of MyoD and myogenin was seen in only a few cells. 4. The time-course of MyoD mRNA expression corresponded with MyoD protein expression. However, there were two peaks in myogenin mRNA expression: 6?h and Day 7 after contusion. The second peak coincided with upregulation of myostatin mRNA levels. 5. The results of the present study suggest that contusion activates a homogeneous population of satellite cells to proliferate within 3?days, followed by differentiation to form new myofibres. The latter may be regulated, in part, by myostatin.

AB  - Abstract Individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of developing substance use disorders (SUDs) and nicotine dependence. The co-occurrence of ADHD and SUDs/nicotine dependence may in part be mediated by shared genetic liability. Several neurobiological pathways have been implicated in both ADHD and SUDs, including dopamine and serotonin pathways. We hypothesized that variations in dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission genes were involved in the genetic liability to develop SUDs/nicotine dependence in ADHD. The current study included participants with ADHD (n?=?280) who were originally part of the Dutch International Multicenter ADHD Genetics study. Participants were aged 5?15 years and attending outpatient clinics at enrollment in the study. Diagnoses of ADHD, SUDs, nicotine dependence, age of first nicotine and substance use, and alcohol use severity were based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Genetic risk scores were created for both serotonergic and dopaminergic risk genes previously shown to be associated with ADHD and SUDs and/or nicotine dependence. The serotonin genetic risk score significantly predicted alcohol use severity. No significant serotonin???dopamine risk score or effect of stimulant medication was found. The current study adds to the literature by providing insight into genetic underpinnings of the co-morbidity of ADHD and SUDs. While the focus of the literature so far has been mostly on dopamine, our study suggests that serotonin may also play a role in the relationship between these disorders.
