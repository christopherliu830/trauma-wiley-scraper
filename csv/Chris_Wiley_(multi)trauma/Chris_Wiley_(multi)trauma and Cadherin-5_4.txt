AB  - Abstract In the epidermal compartment of skin, keratinocytes (KC), Langerhans cells (LC), and their soluble products, i.e. cytokines, constitute a unique immunologic microenvironment. KC participate in cutaneous immune responses by producing various cytokines. LC, a member of the dendritic cell (DC) family, represent the professional antigen-presenting cells in the epidermis. Although it has been demonstrated that migration of LC from skin to lymph nodes is a critical step for the antigen presentation, molecular mechanisms for such an event remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that cytokines are able to modulate LC/DC migration. There is accumulating evidence that proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor a promote LC emigration from the skin, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is a counter-regulator. LC/DC express chemokine receptors. Chemokines generated from lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph node cells play a role in the directional migration of LC/DC into lymph nodes. This article reviews current studies on the role of cytokines in LC/DC migration. J. Leukoc. Biol. 66: 33?39; 1999.

AB  - Advances in our understanding of desmosomal diseases have provided a clear demonstration of the key role played by desmosomes in tissue and organ physiology, highlighting the importance of their dynamic and finely regulated structure. In this context, non-desmosomal regulatory molecules have acquired increasing relevance in the study of this organelle resulting in extending the desmosomal interactome, named the ?desmo-adhesome.? Spatiotemporal changes in the expression and regulation of the desmo-adhesome underlie a number of genetic, infectious, autoimmune, and malignant conditions. The aim of the present article was to examine the structural and functional relationship of the desmosome, by providing a comprehensive, yet focused overview of the constituents targeted in human disease. The inclusion of the novel regulatory network in the desmo-adhesome pathophysiology opens new avenues to a deeper understanding of desmosomal diseases, potentially unveiling pathogenic mechanisms waiting to be explored.

However, only recently have we begun to understand the effects of hemodynamic force on embryonic development. In this review, we will discuss specific examples illustrating the role of hemodynamic force during the development of the embryo, with particular focus on the development of the vascular system and the morphogenesis of the heart. We will also discuss the important functions served by mechanotransduction and hemodynamic force during placentation, as well as in regulating the maintenance and division of embryonic, hematopoietic, neural, and mesenchymal stem cells. Pathological misregulation of mechanosensitive pathways during pregnancy and embryonic development may contribute to the occurrence of cardiovascular birth defects, as well as to a variety of other diseases, including preeclampsia. Thus, there is a need for future studies focusing on better understanding the physiological effects of hemodynamic force during embryonic development and their role in the pathogenesis of disease.

AB  - Abstract:? In this review, we summarize how FTY720 came from the lab bench to the bedside by examining its structural similarities to natural occuring sphingosine analogues, the mechanism of action, and clinical applicability to not only transplantation but also autoimmune, oncological, and neurobiological fields. FTY720, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) analogue, promotes the survival of human and animal allografts by sequestering T lymphocytes within peripheral lymphoid tissue. The mechanism of sequestration is three-fold:(1) T lymphocytes are driven into peripheral lymph nodes in a chemokine dependent manner by FTY720;(2) FTY720 downregulates sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) on the T lymphocyte surface, rendering it unable to migrate along a S1P gradient; and (3) FTY720 closes stromal gates on the abluminal side of the lymphatic endothelium. Future areas of investigation include developing S1P analogues that have specific agonist binding to S1PRs avoiding side effects seen in non-specific binding.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Vitamin D is implicated in the etiology of several neoplastic diseases, but its relationship with colorectal cancer survival is still unclear. Aim of this study was to determine whether vitamin D levels influence survival outcomes in colorectal cancer liver metastases patients treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. Methods We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in 143 patients with 215 colorectal liver metastases who underwent radiofrequency ablation between 1999 and 2011 at our institution. The influence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on overall survival and time to recurrence was evaluated in univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. Results Median age was 68?years (range 41?85), and median number of nodules was 2 (1?3) with a median maximum diameter of 26?mm (10?48). Median survival was 44?months (36?62), and survival rate was 91.4%, 46.5%, and 42.2% at 1, 4, and 5?years in the whole cohort. Median survival was 65?months (52?74) if 25-hydroxyvitamin D?>20?ng/mL and 34?months (24?41) if?≤20?ng/mL (P?<?0.001). In the whole cohort, median time to recurrence was 34?months (26?47), 50?months (36?62) in the case of 25-hydroxyvitamin D?>20?ng/mL and 24?months (20?32) if?≤20?ng/mL (P?<?0.001). Nodule size and 25-hydroxyvitamin D resulted as significant predictors of both overall survival and time to recurrence in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Our study provides support for the use of 25-hydroxyvitamin D as a new predictor of outcome for colorectal liver metastases patients.

AB  - Abstract Kindlin-1 is an epithelium-specific phosphoprotein and focal adhesion adaptor component. Mutations in the corresponding gene (KIND1) cause Kindler syndrome (KS), which is manifested by skin blistering, poikiloderma, photosensitivity and carcinogenesis. Some patients also exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, but it has remained unclear whether these represent a feature of Kindler syndrome or a coincidence. We examined kindlin-1 in human gastrointestinal epithelia and showed that it is involved in the aetiopathology of Kindler syndrome-associated colitis. Kindlin-1 expression was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, western blot and RT?PCR. Kindlin-1 is expressed in oral mucosa, colon and rectum. Both the full-length 74 kDa kindlin-1 protein and a 43 kDa isoform were detected in CaCo2 cells, the latter resulting from alternative splicing. In the first months of life, patients (homozygous for null mutations) had severe intestinal involvement with haemorrhagic diarrhoea and showed morphological features of severe ulcerative colitis. Later in childhood, histopathology demonstrated focal detachment of the epithelium in all segments of the colon, chronic inflammation and mucosal atrophy. These findings define an intestinal phenotype for Kindler syndrome as a consequence of a primary epithelial barrier defect. The different clinical intestinal manifestations in Kindler syndrome patients may be explained by partial functional compensation of kindlin-1 deficiency by the intestinal isoform or by the presence of truncated mutant kindlin-1.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - Abstract The purposes of this study were to identify signaling pathways that were specifically activated in ATDC5 cells cultured on poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) gel in insulin-free maintenance medium and to evaluate the significance of the determined signaling pathways in the chondrogenic differentiation induced by this gel. In this study, ATDC5 cells cultured on PAMPS gel using the maintenance medium without insulin (PAMPS Culture) were compared with cells cultured on polystyrene using the differentiation medium containing insulin (PS-I Culture). The microarray analysis, Western blot analysis, and real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the TGF-?/BMP signaling pathway was significantly enhanced at Days 1, 2, and 3 in the PAMPS Culture when compared with the PS-I Culture. Inhibition of the BMP type-I receptor reduced the phosphorylation level of Smad1/5 and expression of type-2 collagen and aggrecan mRNA in the cells accompanied by a reduction in cell aggregation at Day 13 in the PAMPS Culture. The inhibition of the TGF-?/BMP signaling pathway significantly inhibited the chondrogenic differentiation induced by the PAMPS gel. The present study demonstrated that synthetic PAMPS gel activates the TGF-?/BMP/Smad signaling pathway in the ATDC5 cells in the absence of insulin, and that this activation plays a significant role in the chondrogenic differentiation induced by PAMPS gel. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
