AB  - Abstract Small-diameter blood vessel substitutes are urgently needed for patients requiring replacements of their coronary and below-the-knee vessels and for better arteriovenous dialysis shunts. Circulatory diseases, especially those arising from atherosclerosis, are the predominant cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world. Current therapies include the use of autologous vessels or synthetic materials as vessel replacements. The limited availability of healthy vessels for use as bypass grafts and the failure of purely synthetic materials in small-diameter sites necessitate the development of a biological substitute. Tissue engineering is such an approach and has achieved promising results, but reconstruction of a functional vascular tunica media, with circumferentially oriented contractile smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and extracellular matrix, appropriate mechanical properties, and vasoactivity has yet to be demonstrated. This review focuses on strategies to effect the switch of SMC phenotype from synthetic to contractile, which is regarded as crucial for the engineering of a functional vascular media. The synthetic SMC phenotype is desired initially for cell proliferation and tissue remodeling, but the contractile phenotype is then necessary for sufficient vasoactivity and inhibition of neointima formation. The factors governing the switch to a more contractile phenotype with in vitro culture are reviewed. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res, 2009

AB  - Abstract Angiogenesis and inflammation are clearly interconnected and interdependent processes that are dysregulated in a series of systemic and brain pathologies. Herein, key aspects regarding endothelial cell function and tissue remodelling that are particularly affected or aggravated by inflammation are presented. Most importantly, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the vascular regulation of the inflammatory processes occurring in several brain disorders and how they impact on disease/injury progression are detailed, highlighting potential targets for therapy. Finally, nanomedicine-based approaches designed to overcome limitations pertaining to low systemic bioavailability, light, pH and temperature sensitivity and/or rapid degradation of these targets, and to optimize their mode of action are discussed. Ultimately, we expect this review to provide new insight and to suggest novel approaches for the treatment of blood?brain barrier dysfunction per se or as a means to treat the injured or diseased central nervous system.

AB  - Summary Stem cells are a novel source of cells with capability of unlimited self-renewing. Stem cells represent the ability to predict health effects, the influence of genetic factors, different susceptibilities within the human population, and also the influence on early human developmental processes. Screening of formulated drugs/chemicals for efficacy and safety is always a challenging task due to lack of reliable platform/assays. Screening is currently performed using immortalized/primary cell lines, however the results are compromised. Implementing existing platforms for large scale screening via HTS can lead to inappropriate screening. Use of stem cell based platforms can be very efficient and reliable in the field of toxicology. Remarkable properties of stem cells allow for large scale screening and HTS testing of drugs/chemical libraries. This chapter focus on importance of stem cell technology in HTS for toxicological studies. The extended concept includes cell viability assays as well as transcript analyses, and is a valuable tool for identifying species-independent molecular markers.

AB  - Abstract It is difficult to convey the accelerating rate and growing importance of mass spectrometry applications to human blood proteins and peptides. Mass spectrometry can rapidly detect and identify the ionizable peptides from the proteins in a simple mixture and reveal many of their post-translational modifications. However, blood is a complex mixture that may contain many proteins first expressed in cells and tissues. The complete analysis of blood proteins is a daunting task that will rely on a wide range of disciplines from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, electromagnetic instrumentation, mathematics and computation. Therefore the comprehensive discovery and analysis of blood proteins will rank among the great technical challenges and require the cumulative sum of many of mankind's scientific achievements together. A variety of methods have been used to fractionate, analyze and identify proteins from blood, each yielding a small piece of the whole and throwing the great size of the task into sharp relief. The approaches attempted to date clearly indicate that enumerating the proteins and peptides of blood can be accomplished. There is no doubt that the mass spectrometry of blood will be crucial to the discovery and analysis of proteins, enzyme activities, and post-translational processes that underlay the mechanisms of disease. At present both discovery and quantification of proteins from blood are commonly reaching sensitivities of ?1?ng/mL. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:685?732, 2011
