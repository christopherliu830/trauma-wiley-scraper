AB  - Summary The intestine may be subjected to simple obstruction, in which only the lumen is obstructed, strangulating obstruction, in which both the lumen and vasculature are obstructed, or infarction, in which only the vasculature is obstructed. Each of these may injure intestinal tissues, particularly with interruption of blood flow and subsequent ischemic injury. This can also occur in simple obstruction as the luminal pressure causes collapse of the vasculature within the intestinal wall. Once reperfused, ischemic-injured mucosa may undergo reperfusion injury, depending on the circumstances. This relates to the level of reactive oxygen metabolite generation and infiltration of neutrophils. More recently, repair of the mucosa has been studied in depth, including villus contraction (in the small intestine), epithelial restitution, tight junction closure, and mucosal proliferation. Other layers of the intestine are also injured, particularly the serosa, which can lead to inflammation and development of adhesions.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

Kalaria (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 94?113?Molecular genetics and pathology of hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of several monogenic conditions involving small vessels predisposing to ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and diffuse white matter disease. With emphasis on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we review the molecular pathogenesis of recently characterized disorders including cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) and the Collagen type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1)-related disorders. CADASIL remains the most common hereditary small vessel disease (SVD) caused by >190 different mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a cell-signalling receptor. Mutant NOTCH3 instigates degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles leading to recurrent lacunar infarcts. Mutations in the serine protease HTRA1 gene are associated with CARASIL. Aberrant HTRA1 activity results in increased transforming growth factor-? signalling provoking multiple actions including vascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix synthesis. The RVCL disorders characterized by profound retinopathy are associated with mutations in TREX1, which encodes an abundant 3??5? DNA-specific exonuclease. TREX1 mutations lead to detrimental gain-of-function or insufficient quantities of enzyme. The COL4A1-related disorders are highly variable comprising four major phenotypes with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including SVD with cerebral haemorrhages in children and adults. Mutant COL4A1 likely disrupts the extracellular matrix resulting in fragile vessel walls. The hereditary SVDs albeit with variable phenotypes demonstrate how effects of different defective genes converge to produce the characteristic arteriopathy and microvascular disintegration leading to vascular cognitive impairment.

AB  - Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the generation of the body's blood and immune cells. This process takes place primarily in the bone marrow in specialized 'niche' microenvironments, which provide signals responsible for maintaining a balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage specification required for life-long hematopoiesis. While our understanding of these signaling mechanisms continues to improve, our ability to engineer them in vitro for the expansion of clinically relevant HSC populations is still lacking. In this review, we focus on development of biomaterials-based culture platforms for in vitro study of interactions between HSCs and their local microenvironment. The tools and techniques used for both examining HSC-niche interactions as well as applying these findings towards controlled HSC expansion or directed differentiation in 2D and 3D platforms are discussed. These novel techniques hold the potential to push the existing boundaries of HSC cultures towards high-throughput, real-time, and single-cell level biomimetic approaches that enable a more nuanced understanding of HSC regulation and function. Their application in conjunction with innovative biomaterial platforms can pave the way for engineering artificial bone marrow niches for clinical applications as well as elucidating the pathology of blood-related cancers and disorders.

AB  - Recipients of live donor transplant kidneys (LIV) exhibit a significantly longer allograft half-life compared with cadaveric donor organs (CADs). The reasons are incompletely understood. Therefore this study sought to elucidate the genome-wide gene expression profiles in microdissected transplant kidney biopsies obtained from five cadaveric and five matched live donors before transplantation. cDNA microarrays were used to determine the transcripts in isolated glomeruli (G) and the tubulointerstitial (TI) compartment. Data were subjected to hierarchical clustering, maxT adjustment and a jackknife procedure to ensure robustness of reported findings; validation was performed by independent analysis of split biopsies and TaqMan-PCR. One hundred and thirteen sequences representing 62 unique genes (17 redundant features), and 34 ESTs separated G from TI. No difference in gene expression was found in G between LIV and CAD kidneys, but nine genes (two represented twice) and three ESTs were abundantly expressed in the CAD TI compared with LIV. The main biological function of these genes is counter regulation of oxidative stress. Promoter analysis of significant features suggested coregulated gene groups. These data suggest that CAD kidneys exhibit a distinctly different set of transcripts in the TI compartment but not in the G compartment when compared with LIV kidneys.

AB  - Abstract Whilst the importance of mutations in a wide range of keratins in skin fragility disorders is now well established, there is much less evidence for simple epithelial keratin involvement in disease. Some simple epithelial keratin mutations have been reported in liver cirrhosis and pancreatitis patients, and recently mutations in the simple epithelial keratin K8 were identified in a group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis). In comparison with the mutations seen in epidermal keratins, these simple epithelial mutations would be predicted to have mild consequences, although analysis shows that they do have a distinct effect. This review article discusses the evidence that these mutations are a predisposing factor for inflammatory bowel disease. Copyright ? 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
