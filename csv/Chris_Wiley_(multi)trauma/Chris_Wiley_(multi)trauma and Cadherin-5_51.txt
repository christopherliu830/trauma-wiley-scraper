AB  - Summary Oesophageal cancer has a male to female ratio of over 2:1 and a peak incidence in the 60?80 age group. Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is rising in incidence and now accounts for an increasing proportion of cases, particularly in the gastro-oesophageal junction. The risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is almost eight times higher in persons with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is generally agreed that adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus (almost always lower-third lesions) is best treated by surgery for attempted cure if the lesion is technically operable. Fifty years ago, stomach cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in the United Kingdom. It has sharply declined in incidence but still remains an important cause of mortality worldwide, with an estimated 790 000 new cases occurring annually. The standard diagnostic investigation was the double contrast barium meal examination but this has been almost totally replaced by endoscopy.

AB  - Abstract Hyperosmotic stress initiates a variety of compensatory and adaptive responses, which either serve to restore near-normal volume or remodel and reinforce the cell structure to withstand the physical challenge. The latter response is brought about by the reorganization of the cytoskeleton; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Recent research has provided major breakthroughs in our knowledge about the link between message and structure, i.e. between signalling and cytoskeletal remodelling, predominantly in the context of cell migration. The major components of this progress are the in-depth characterization of Rho family small GTPases, master regulators of the cytoskeleton, and the discovery of the actin-related protein 2/3 complex, a signalling-sensitive structural element of the actin polymerization machinery. The primary aim of this review is to find the place of these novel and crucial players in osmotically induced (volume-dependent) remodelling of the cytoskeleton. We aim to address three questions: (1) What are the major structural changes in the cytoskeleton under hyperosmotic conditions? (2) Are the Rho family small GTPases (Rho, Rac and Cdc42) regulated by osmotic stress, and if so, by what mechanisms? (3) Are Rho GTPases involved, as mediators, in major adaptive responses, including cytoskeleton rearrangement, changes in ion transport and genetic reprogramming? Our answers will show how fragmentary our current knowledge is in these areas. Therefore, this overview has been written with the hardly disguised intention that it might foster further research in this field by highlighting some intriguing questions.

AB  - Ba.cil'lus. N.L. masc. n. Bacillus a rodlet. Firmicutes / ?Bacilli? / Bacillales / Bacillaceae / Bacillus Cells rod-shaped, straight or slightly curved, occurring singly and in pairs, some in chains, and occasionally as long filaments. Endospores are formed, no more than one to a cell; these spores are very resistant to many adverse conditions. Gram-positive, or Gram-positive only in early stages of growth, or Gram-negative. A meso-DAP direct murein cross-linkage type is commonest, but L-Lys-D-Glu, Orn-D-Glu and L-Orn-D-Asp have occasionally been reported. Motile by means of peritrichous or degenerately peritrichous flagella, or nonmotile. Aerobes or facultative anaerobes, but a few species are described as strictly anaerobic. The terminal electron acceptor is oxygen, replaceable by alternatives in some species. Most species will grow on routine media such as nutrient agar and blood agar. Colony morphology and size very variable between and within species. A wide diversity of physiological abilities is exhibited, ranging from psychrophilic to thermophilic, and acidophilic to alkaliphilic; some strains are salt tolerant and some are halophilic. Catalase is produced by most species. Oxidase-positive or -negative. Chemo-organotrophic; two species are facultative chemolithotrophs: prototrophs to auxotrophs requiring several growth factors. Mostly isolated from soil, or from environments that may have been contaminated directly or indirectly by soil, but also found in water, food and clinical specimens. The resistance of the spores to heat, radiation, disinfectants, and desiccation results in species being troublesome contaminants in operating rooms, on surgical dressings, in pharmaceutical products and in foods. Most species have little or no pathogenic potential and are rarely associated with disease in humans or other animals; an exception is Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax; several other species may cause food poisoning and opportunistic infections, and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis are pathogenic to invertebrates. DNA G + C content (mol%): 32?66 (Tm ). Type species: Bacillus subtilis Cohn 1872, 174AL.

AB  - Abstract Adult neurogenesis was first observed nearly 60 years ago, and it has since grown into an important neurochemistry research field. Much recent research has focused on the treatment of brain diseases through neuronal regeneration with endogenously generated neurons. In the adult brain, immature neurons called neuroblasts are continuously generated in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). These neuroblasts migrate rapidly through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb, where they mature and are integrated into the neuronal circuitry. After brain insult, some of the neuroblasts in the V-SVZ migrate toward the lesion to repopulate the injured tissue. This notable migratory capacity of V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts is important for efficiently regenerating neurons in remote areas of the brain. As these neurons migrate for long distances through adult brain tissue, they are supported by various guidance cues and structures that act as scaffolds. Some of these mechanisms are unique to neuroblast migration in the adult brain, and are not involved in migration in the developing brain. Here, we review the latest findings on the mechanisms of neuroblast migration in the adult brain under physiological and pathological conditions, and discuss various issues that still need to be resolved. This article is part of the mini review series ?60th Anniversary of the Japanese Society for Neurochemistry?.

AB  - Abstract The present study was designed to investigate the adherence mechanism(s) and behaviour of cultured chondrocytes under various culturing conditions, co-culturing with fibroblasts, or growth in the presence of conditioned medium either of fibroblasts or chondrocytes. The findings obtained indicate that chondrocyte time-adhesion curves and the final percentiles of attached cells to a plastic substrate are much slower and lower respectively than those of anchorage dependent cell types. The poorest adhesion occurs employing chondrocytes originated from suspension cultures, as compared to chondrocytes grown in monolayers. No interference with chondrocyte adhesion was found by inhibiting the production of proteoglycan (PG). Puromycin and to a lesser degree actinomycin but not cytosine arabinoside interfered with chondrocyte adhesion, suggesting the importance of protein synthesis in this process. The nature of proadhesion modifying molecules in synoviocytes conditioned media and antiadhesive agents in chondrocyte conditioned media suggests that both substances are heat labile, non-dialyzable, protein containing factors.

AB  - Abstract The transplantation of neural progenitors or stem cells has been attempted for several decades, in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS), to repair tissue damage or cell degeneration. In most circumstances the success of cell replacement in the brain depends on the capability to rewire precisely patterned connections. Several concurrent factors determine the outcome and efficacy of this approach, including the intrinsic properties of donor progenitors, the environmental cues provided by the recipient environment, and the complexity and precision of the connection patterns that must be restored in order to recover adaptive function. In this chapter, some major concepts concerning these issues are reviewed, with special attention being paid to studies involving neural transplantation in the rodent cerebellum and in animal models of cerebellar disorders. These approaches are considered the most suitable for the design and testing of cell-based therapeutic approaches aimed at reconstructing specific connections in point-to-point circuits.
