AB  - Injuries to the nervous system are the result of mechanical, thermal, chemical or congenital pathologies and, if function is not restored, they lead to loss of muscle function, pain and impaired sensation. Current treatment modalities essentially coapt the two nerves ends together or place a nerve graft between the cut ends. However, clinical results have never been optimal, and therefore a quest for better options has taken place. In this review article we look at the synthetic and biomimetic options currently being tested as potential nerve grafts.

AB  - Escin, a natural triterpene saponin mixture obtained from the horse chestnut tree (Aesculus hippocastanum), has been used for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), hemorrhoids, and edema. However, it is unclear how escin protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by pro-inflammatory high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1). Here, we report that escin can suppress (a) HMGB1-induced overexpression of the aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water channel in endothelial cells and (b) HMGB1-induced increases in endothelial cell permeability. This is the first report that escin inhibits AQP1 and alleviates barrier dysfunction in HMGB1-induced inflammatory response.

AB  - Abstract We previously proposed and provided proof of principle for the use of a complementary approach, convergent functional genomics (CFG), combining gene expression and genetic data, from human and animal model studies, as a way of mining the existing GWAS datasets for signals that are there already, but did not reach significance using a genetics-only approach [Le-Niculescu et al., 2009b]. CFG provides a fit-to-disease prioritization of genes that leads to generalizability in independent cohorts, and counterbalances the fit-to-cohort prioritization inherent in classic genetic-only approaches, which have been plagued by poor reproducibility across cohorts. We have now extended our previous work to include more datasets of GWAS, and more recent evidence from other lines of work. In essence our analysis is the most comprehensive integration of genetics and functional genomics to date in the field of bipolar disorder. Biological pathway analyses identified top canonical pathways, and epistatic interaction testing inside these pathways has identified genes that merit future follow-up as direct interactors (intra-pathway epistasis, INPEP). Moreover, we have put together a panel of best P-value single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), based on the top candidate genes we identified. We have developed a genetic risk prediction score (GRPS) based on our panel, and demonstrate how in two independent test cohorts the GRPS differentiates between subjects with bipolar disorder and normal controls, in both European-American and African-American populations. Lastly, we describe a prototype of how such testing could be used to categorize disease risk in individuals and aid personalized medicine approaches, in psychiatry and beyond. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The effective regulation of fluid shear stress (FSS) on the lineage specification of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains to be addressed. We hypothesized that when MSCs are recruited to musculoskeletal system following stimulation, their differentiation into osteogenic or chondrogenic cells is directed by the rate of FSS (?SS) through modulation of the mechanosensitive, cation-selective channels (MSCCs), intracellular calcium levels, and F-actin. To this end, MSCs were exposed to laminar FSS linearly increased from 0 to 10?dyn/cm2 in 0, 2, or 20?min and maintained at 10?dyn/cm2 for a total of 20?min (termed as ?SS 0-0?, 0-2?, and 0-20?, respectively, representing more physiological (0-0?) and non-physiological (0-2? and 0-20?) ?SS treatments). Our results showed 0-0? facilitated MSC differentiation towards chondrogenic and not osteogenic phenotype, by promoting moderate intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) increase from the calcium channels with the exception of MSCCs or intracellular calcium stores, and F-actin organization. In contrast, 0-2? promoted MSCs towards osteogenic and not chondrogenic phenotype, by inducing significant [Ca2+]i increase mainly from the MSCCs, and F-actin assembly. However, 0-20? elicited the modest osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotypes, as it induced the lowest [Ca2+]i increase mainly from MSCCs, and F-actin assembly. Our results suggest that compared to the more physiological ?SS, the non-physiological ?SS favors [Ca2+]i influx from MSCCs. An appropriate non-physiological ?SS (0-2?) even elicits a large [Ca2+]i influx from the MSCCs that reverses the lineage specification of MSCs, providing validation for the high mechanosensitivity of MSCs and guidance for training osteoporosis and osteoarthritis patients.

AB  - Abstract EFSA received a request from the Hellenic Food Authority (EFET) for a scientific opinion on the risk to human health from the presence of nickel (Ni) in food, particularly in vegetables. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) decided to extend the risk assessment also to drinking water. The reproductive and developmental toxicity in experimental animals was selected as the critical effect for the assessment of chronic effects of Ni. A tolerable daily intake of 2.8 µg Ni/kg body weight (b.w.) per day was derived from a lower 95 % confidence limit for a benchmark dose at 10 % extra risk (BMDL10) of 0.28 mg/kg b.w. for post-implantation fetal loss in rats. The current dietary exposure to Ni raises concern when considering the mean and 95th percentile chronic exposure levels for all different age groups. The systemic contact dermatitis (SCD) elicited in Ni-sensitive humans after oral exposure to Ni was selected as the critical effect suitable for the assessment of acute effects of Ni. A lowest BMDL10 of 1.1 µg Ni/kg b.w. was derived for the incidence of SCD following oral exposure to Ni of human volunteers. The CONTAM Panel applied a margin of exposure (MOE) approach and considered an MOE of 10 to be indicative of a low health concern. The MOEs calculated considering the estimated mean and the 95th percentile acute exposure levels were considerably below 10 for all age groups. Overall, the CONTAM Panel concluded that, at the current levels of acute dietary exposure to Ni, there is a concern that Ni-sensitized individuals may develop eczematous flare-up skin reactions. The CONTAM Panel noted the need for mechanistic studies to assess the human relevance of the effects on reproduction and development observed in experimental animals and for additional studies on human absorption of nickel from food, for example in combination with duplicate diet studies.

AB  - Early case reports of port site tumour implants led to debate regarding the appropriateness of laparoscopic techniques for abdominal malignancies. Review of clinical, animal and cell culture studies addresses the relationships between tumour staging and shed cell behaviour that contributes to the peri-operative spread of tumours. In addition, a porcine model was used to test tumour cell distribution after laparoscopic and open colonic resections. Clinical evidence indicate that wound recurrence rates are 0.60 and 0.85% for open and laparoscopic colon cancer operations, respectively. Tumour staging and operative techniques are the most important factors determining wound implantation. Port site and open wounds are at equal risk of tumour implantation.
