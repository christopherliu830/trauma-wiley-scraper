AB  - Abstract Many traditional medicines have demonstrated immune activity, however, research has largely neglected their effects on cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). This review reports on extracts from 37 medicinal plant species, similar to or replicating traditional preparations, that up- or downregulate either gene or protein activity of CAMs. The majority of the investigations were in vitro, primarily of the immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs, specifically intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and secondarily on the integrin (CD11b or MAC-1) and selectin (E-selectin and P-selectin) families of CAMs. The following plant species have demonstrated modulation of multiple CAMs: Artemisia asiatica, Boswellia serrata, Canscora decussata, Cinnamomum povectum, Dehaasia incrassate, Ganoderma lucidum, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum, Juglans regia, Lycopus lucidus, Panax notoginseng, Rheum undulatum, Salvia miltiorrhiza. Many other species have documented activity on one CAM. Currently there are limited in vivo/ex vivo investigations, including a clinical trial on Mahonia aquifolium. Although further evidence is needed, the data suggest that the reviewed botanical medicines may have the potential to provide therapeutic potential in disease processes involving CAMs. Additionally, the reported success of many of these plant extracts by traditional cultures and modern phytotherapists may involve the modulation of CAMs. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering is rapidly progressing from a research-based discipline to clinical applications. Emerging technologies could be utilized to develop therapeutics for a wide range of diseases, but many are contingent on a cell scaffold that can produce proper tissue ultrastructure. The extracellular matrix, which a cell scaffold simulates, is not merely a foundation for tissue growth but a dynamic participant in cellular crosstalk and organ homeostasis. Cells change their growth rates, recruitment, and differentiation in response to the composition, modulus, and patterning of the substrate on which they reside. Cell scaffolds can regulate these factors through precision design, functionalization, and application. The ideal therapy would utilize highly specialized cell scaffolds to best mimic the tissue of interest. This paper discusses advantages and challenges of optimized cell scaffold design in the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm for clinical applications in tracheal transplant, cardiac regeneration, and skin grafts, respectively.

AB  - Abstract Mind how you go: The current strategies for the development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease are very diverse. Particular attention is given to the search for inhibitors (see picture for two examples) of the proteolytic enzyme ?- and ?-secretase, which inhibits the cleavage of the amyloid precursor proteins into amyloid?? peptides, from which the disease-defining deposits of plaque in the brains of Alzheimer's patients originates. Research on senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease covers an extremely broad range of scientific activities. At the recent international meeting of the Alzheimer's Association (ICAD 2008, Chicago) more than 2200 individual scientific contributions were presented. The aim of this Review is to give an overview of the field and to outline its main areas, starting from behavioral abnormalities and visible pathological findings and then focusing on the molecular details of the pathology. The ?amyloid hypothesis? of Alzheimer's disease is given particular attention, since the majority of the ongoing therapeutic approaches are based on its theoretical framework.
