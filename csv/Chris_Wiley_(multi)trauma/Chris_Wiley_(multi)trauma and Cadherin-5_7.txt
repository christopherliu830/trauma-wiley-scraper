AB  - Abstract Terrorist attacks or nuclear accidents could expose large numbers of people to ionizing radiation, and early biomarkers of radiation injury would be critical for triage, treatment, and follow-up of such individuals. However, no such biomarkers have yet been proven to exist. We tested the potential of high throughput proteomics to identify protein biomarkers of radiation injury after total body X-ray irradiation (TBI) in a rat model. Subtle functional changes in the kidney are suggested by increased glomerular permeability for macromolecules measured within 24?h after TBI. Ultrastructural changes in glomerular podocytes included partial loss of the interdigitating organization of foot processes. Analysis of urine by LC-MS/MS and 2-DE showed significant changes in the urine proteome within 24?h after TBI. Tissue kallikrein 1-related peptidase, cysteine proteinase inhibitor cystatin C and oxidized histidine were found to be increased while a number of proteinase inhibitors including kallikrein-binding protein and albumin were found to be decreased postirradiation. Thus, TBI causes immediately detectable changes in renal structure and function and in the urinary protein profile. This suggests that both systemic and renal changes are induced by radiation and it may be possible to identify a set of biomarkers unique to radiation injury.

Stewart (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 3?23?Molecular pathogenesis of blood?brain barrier breakdown in acute brain injury Historically, the blood?brain barrier (BBB) was considered to be at the level of cerebral endothelium. Currently, the interaction of endothelium with other components of the vessel wall and with neurones and glial cells is considered to constitute a functional unit, termed the neurovascular unit that maintains cerebral homeostasis in steady states and brain injury. The emphasis of this review is on cerebral endothelium, the best-studied component of the neurovascular unit, and its permeability mechanisms in health and acute brain injury. Major advances have been made in unravelling the molecular structure of caveolae and tight junctions, both of which are components of the structural barrier to the entry of plasma proteins into brain. Time course studies suggest that caveolar changes precede junctional changes in acute brain injury. Additional factors modulating BBB permeability in acute brain injury are matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 and angiogenic factors, the most notable being vascular endothelial growth factor-A and angiopoietins (Ang) 1 and 2. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A and Ang2 have emerged as potent inducers of BBB breakdown while Ang1 is a potent anti-leakage factor. These factors have the potential to modulate permeability in acute brain injury and this is an area of ongoing research. Overall, a combination of haemodynamic, structural and molecular alterations affecting brain endothelium results in BBB breakdown in acute brain injury.

AB  - Abstract Malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the three most common types of skin cancer. Malignant melanoma commonly arises from melanocytes in the epidermis and is the most lethal of skin cancers. BCC arises from keratinocytes and is the commonest cancer. There is considerable debate as to whether BCC arises from hair follicle keratinocytes and also because of the association of BCC with mutations that activate the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, whether BCC may reflect failed organogenesis. SCC also arises from keratinocytes and is a more aggressive tumour than BCC and can form lethal metastases, whereas BCC rarely metastasize. All three skin cancers lend themselves to both in vivo and in vitro models and these are discussed in this chapter.

Mesodermal tissues ?? Heart ?? Bone and cartilage ?? Circulatory system ?? Endodermal tissues ?? Pancreas ?? Liver ?? Future challenges Abstract Recent advances in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology now offer an alternative cell source for tissue engineers, as these cells are capable of proliferating indefinitely and differentiating to many clinically relevant cell types. Novel culture methods capable of exerting spatial and temporal control over the stem cell microenvironment allow for more efficient expansion of hESCs, and significant advances have been made toward improving our understanding of the biophysical and biochemical cues that direct stem cell fate choices. Effective production of lineage specific progenitors or terminally differentiated cells enables researchers to incorporate hESC derivatives into engineered tissue constructs. Here, we describe current efforts using hESCs as a cell source for tissue engineering applications, highlighting potential advantages of hESCs over current practices as well as challenges which must be overcome.

AB  - Abstract Extensive loss of skeletal muscle tissue results in mutilations and severe loss of function. In vitro-generated artificial muscles undergo necrosis when transplanted in vivo before host angiogenesis may provide oxygen for fibre survival. Here, we report a novel strategy based upon the use of mouse or human mesoangioblasts encapsulated inside PEG-fibrinogen hydrogel. Once engineered to express placental-derived growth factor, mesoangioblasts attract host vessels and nerves, contributing to in vivo survival and maturation of newly formed myofibres. When the graft was implanted underneath the skin on the surface of the tibialis anterior, mature and aligned myofibres formed within several weeks as a complete and functional extra muscle. Moreover, replacing the ablated tibialis anterior with PEG-fibrinogen-embedded mesoangioblasts also resulted in an artificial muscle very similar to a normal tibialis anterior. This strategy opens the possibility for patient-specific muscle creation for a large number of pathological conditions involving muscle tissue wasting.

AB  - Regenerative medicine holds the promise of engineering functional tissues or organs to heal or replace abnormal and necrotic tissues/organs, offering hope for filling the gap between organ shortage and transplantation needs. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is evolving into an unparalleled biomanufacturing technology due to its high-integration potential for patient-specific designs, precise and rapid manufacturing capabilities with high resolution, and unprecedented versatility. It enables precise control over multiple compositions, spatial distributions, and architectural accuracy/complexity, therefore achieving effective recapitulation of microstructure, architecture, mechanical properties, and biological functions of target tissues and organs. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in 3D bioprinting technology, as well as design concepts of bioinks suitable for the bioprinting process. We focus on the applications of this technology for engineering living organs, focusing more specifically on vasculature, neural networks, the heart and liver. We conclude with current challenges and the technical perspective for further development of 3D organ bioprinting.
