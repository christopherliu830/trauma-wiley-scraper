AB  - Abstract Development of a multicellular organism is accomplished through a series of events that are preprogrammed in the genome. These events encompass cellular proliferation, lineage commitment, lineage progression, lineage expression, cellular inhibition, and regulated apoptosis. The sequential progression of cells through these events results in the formation of the differentiated cells, tissues, and organs that constitute an individual. Although most cells progress through this sequence during development, a few cells leave the developmental continuum to become reserve precursor cells. The reserve precursor cells are involved in the continual maintenance and repair of the tissues and organs throughout the life span of the individual. Until recently it was generally assumed that the precursor cells in postnatal individuals were limited to lineage-committed progenitor cells specific for various tissues. However, studies by Young, his colleagues, and others have demonstrated the presence of two categories of precursor cells that reside within the organs and tissues of postnatal animals. These two categories of precursor cells are lineage-committed (multipotent, tripotent, bipotent, and unipotent) progenitor cells and lineage-uncommitted pluripotent (epiblastic-like, ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal) stem cells. These reserve precursor cells provide for the continual maintenance and repair of the organism after birth. Anat Rec Part A 276A:75?102, 2004. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary For explaining such a fundamental and contradictory phenomenon as self-maintenance of the pool of hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and subsequent choice of differentiation program into this or that hemopoietic lineage, Schofield (1978) put forward a hypothesis on a hemopoietic niche (specialized cell microenvironment). Schofield's paper gave rise to 30-year studies devoted to hypothetic models and various aspects of HSC niche functioning and hierarchy. Detection of close contacts between HSCs and osteoblasts located in the endosteum and adventitial cells of blood vessels made a scientific breakthrough in this field, and the existence of osteoblastic and vascular niches for HSCs has been postulated since 2003. One of the promising directions is the design and modification of materials for control over the fate of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) that will allow stroma of various human and animal organs and tissues to be constructed. However, the discussion about the existence and functioning of MMSCs niche is only developing. The design of artificial materials capable of biomimetical reproducing of the cellular and tissue microenvironment based on ideas and main elements borrowed from wildlife is a main direction in the development of medical materials technology and tissue bioengineering. Scaffold technology is an experimental approach to the search of the stem cell niches. Recent attempts to model the microterritories (niches) for HSCs have been undertaken and the behavior of cells in such structures has been investigated. However, the main quantitative factors involved in the original design of stem cell microterritories remain unknown. It hampers the development of cell biology and tissue engineering. At the modern stage, the topography, hierarchy, and the size of the niches have to be determined, because the definition of the niches as morphological (structural and functional) units (microterritories), which provides the conditions for vital activity of stem cells, implies finite values of its parameters. The aim of the chapter was the critical review of key milestones of the niche concept for HSCs and MMSCs as we understood it. We speculated our definition of the stem cell niche proposed and described certain stages (postulated; morphofunctional; topographical; quantitative; bioengineering) of the niche theory development as well as prospective directions of the niche designing for regenerative medicine were noted.

AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.

AB  - Stem cell-based tissue engineering provides a prospective strategy to bone tissue repair. Bone tissue repair begins at the recruitment and directional movement of stem cells, and ultimately achieved on the directional differentiation of stem cells. The migration and differentiation of stem cells are regulated by nucleoskeletal stiffness. Mechanical properties of lamin A/C contribute to the nucleoskeletal stiffness and consequently to the regulation of cell migration and differentiation. Nuclear lamin A/C determines cell migration through the regulation of nucleoskeletal stiffness and rigidity and involve in nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling. Moreover, lamin A/C is the essential core module regulating stem cell differentiation. The cells with higher migration ability tend to have enhanced differentiation potential, while the optimum amount of lamin A/C in migration and differentiation of MSCs is in conflict. This contrary phenomenon may be the result of mechanical microenvironment modulation.

AB  - Abstract Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing cells that generate the major cell types of the central nervous system, namely neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, during embryonic development and in the adult brain. NSCs reside in a complex niche where they are exposed to a plethora of signals, including both soluble and physical signals such as compressive and shear stresses, but also discontinuities and differences in morphology of the extracellular environment, termed as topographical features. Different approaches that incorporate artificial micro- and nano-scale surface topographical features have been developed aiming to recapitulate the in vivo NSC niche discontinuities and features, particularly for in vitro studies. The present review article aims at reviewing the existing body of literature on the use of artificial micro- and nano-topographical features to control NSCs orientation and differentiation into neuronal and/or neuroglial lineage. The different approaches on the study of the underlying mechanism of the topography-guided NSC responses are additionally revised and discussed.
