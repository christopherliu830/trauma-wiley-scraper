AB  - Abstract Endothelial metabolism is a key regulator of angiogenesis. Glutamine metabolism in endothelial cells (ECs) has been poorly studied. We used genetic modifications and 13C tracing approaches to define glutamine metabolism in these cells. Glutamine supplies the majority of carbons in the tricyclic acid (TCA) cycle of ECs and contributes to lipid biosynthesis via reductive carboxylation. EC-specific deletion in mice of glutaminase, the initial enzyme in glutamine catabolism, markedly blunts angiogenesis. In cell culture, glutamine deprivation or inhibition of glutaminase prevents EC proliferation, but does not prevent cell migration, which relies instead on aerobic glycolysis. Without glutamine catabolism, there is near complete loss of TCA intermediates, with no compensation from glucose-derived anaplerosis. Mechanistically, addition of exogenous alpha-ketoglutarate replenishes TCA intermediates and rescues cellular growth, but simultaneously unveils a requirement for Rac1-dependent macropinocytosis to provide non-essential amino acids, including asparagine. Together, these data outline the dependence of ECs on glutamine for cataplerotic processes; the need for glutamine as a nitrogen source for generation of biomass; and the distinct roles of glucose and glutamine in EC biology.

AB  - Abstract The infrapatellar pad, a fibro-adipose tissue with peculiar microscopic and mechanical features, is gaining wide attention in the field of rheumatological research. The purpose of this descriptive review is to summarize the most recent published evidence on the anatomic, physiologic and biomechanical inter-relationship between the infrapatellar fat pad and the knee synovial membrane. As an extrasynovial tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad does not directly interact with the articular cartilage; based on its location in close contact with the synovial membrane, and due to the metabolic properties of adipose tissue, it may influence the behavior of the synovial membrane. In fact, considering evidence of macroscopic and microscopic anatomy, the infrapatellar fat pad is the site of insertion of the infrapatellar and medial synovial plicae. Also biochemically, there is much evidence highlighting the interaction among these two structures; in the case of inflammation, the mutual interplay is ascribable to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators stimulating the proliferation of inflammatory cells and promoting tissue modifications in both. All these assumptions could support the emerging idea that the infrapatellar fat pad and the synovial membrane may be considered a morpho-functional unit.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the genetic epidemiology and molecular genetics of psychiatric disorders. The first section on genetic epidemiology reviews the background disciplines and methods for identifying the role of genetic factors in mental disorders, followed by a review of the current evidence on the genetic epidemiology of mental disorders. The second section describes approaches to gene identification and reviews the findings on specific genes underlying mental disorders. More genetic epidemiologic studies of mental disorders have been conducted than of all other chronic disorders including heart disease and cancer. The results of genetic epidemiologic studies demonstrate that the magnitude of the risk to relatives of affected probands compared to those of controls is 10 for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, 5 for anxiety disorders and 6 for substance use disorders. The proportions of variance in the familial aggregation attributable to genes are 0.80 for schizophrenia, 0.65 of bipolar disorder, 0.35 of anxiety disorders, and 0.40 for substance use disorders. Mental disorders are genetically complex and multifactorial, with environmental exposures also contributing to their expression. The findings from most linkage and association studies to date have been limited by the lack of comparability of samples and methods and require replication. The major methods used to identify genes underlying mental disorders include linkage and association studies and investigation of candidate genes. Genes are considered candidates for a psychiatric disorder because either their function is plausibly related to the pathophysiology or their genomic location relates them to linkage signals or chromosomal abnormalities that have been associated with the disease. Fine mapping of cytogenetic abnormalities that are associated with a disease has been a productive approach. Genetic mouse models hold promise for elucidating the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, but unfortunately, in the case of complex genetic disorders, the associated variants usually have no obvious effect on protein structure. It is widely believed that use of endophenotypes holds promise in making the mapping of candidate genes for the complex phenotype more successful. It is also hypothesized that genetic interactions among susceptibility genes (especially epistasis, a phenomenon whereby the effects of a given gene on a biological trait are masked or enhanced by one or more other genes) lie at the core of psychiatric disorders'complexity. To date these have been little studied. Statistical methods of analysis designed to probe epistasis are clearly of growing importance in the genetic dissection of complex disorders. Understanding the function and the interactions among individual susceptibility genes could eventually lead to the design of highly effective targeted therapies for patients with fewer side effects.

AB  - Summary Background Understanding of the role of vitamin D in health and disease has increased markedly in the past decade, with its involvement extending well beyond traditional roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and musculoskeletal health. This conceptual expansion has been underpinned by identification and exploration of components of this axis including vitamin D-binding protein, key enzymes and receptors in multiple cell types, and a greater recognition of nonclassical autocrine and paracrine effects. Its influence in IBD remains uncertain. Aim To review the role of vitamin D in bone health, immune regulation and cancer prevention in IBD, and to outline practical issues and limitations of its use. Methods An extensive online literature review including PubMed and Medline. Results In patients with IBD, the vitamin D axis provides an important and often underutilised pathway to preserving bone health. Furthermore, an exciting body of clinical and basic science research demonstrates that these pathways may have an integral part to play in regulation of the immune response in IBD, through effects on the intestinal barrier, antigen presenting cells and adaptive T cells. The possibility of chemoprevention requires further study. The optimal target level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with IBD is currently uncertain, as is the best therapeutic modality. Conclusions Study of vitamin D pathways may result in the development of relatively inexpensive therapeutic options to optimise patient outcomes. Further prospective clinical research is required to address efficacy and long-term safety.
