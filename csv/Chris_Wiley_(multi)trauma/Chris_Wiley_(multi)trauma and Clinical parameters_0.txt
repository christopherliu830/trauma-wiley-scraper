AB  - Background:? The results of intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures from Australian institutions have not been widely reported. This study examines a consecutive group of patients treated at a major metropolitan trauma centre and reports on the injury statistics and outcome data, and compares this to previously reported results from the literature. Methods:? A total of 101 fractures in 97 consecutive adult patients were included in the study. Nine patients were excluded. At a minimum of 6?months post injury, 54 patients were interviewed by telephone and 35 patients presented for clinical review and underwent physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scanogram of the lower limbs and Short Form 36 questionnaires. Results:? Road trauma accounted for 81% of injuries and 15% of fractures were open. Of the 54 patients reviewed, 13 (23%) required further surgery for delayed or non-union. Of the 35 who presented for physical examination, there was poor correlation between perceived leg length discrepancy and measured leg length discrepancy on examination or scanogram. Presence of a limp correlated with measured leg length discrepancy of more than 1?cm but did not correlate with rotational abnormality measured on CT scanogram. Pain at the hip, thigh or knee was present in 60% of patients. The Short Form 36 scores for physical functioning, role ? physical, bodily pain, general health and vitality were all significantly lower than population norms with P values ranging from <0.001?0.05. Subgroup analysis comparing isolated femur fracture to multi-trauma patients for all five of these parameters revealed significant differences only in the multi-trauma group. Conclusion:? The incidence of pain, limp, leg length discrepancy and delayed or non-union is higher in this study than in previously reported results of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures. This may be due to differences in the patient population, the skill level of the operating surgeon, or incomplete follow up.

AB  - Summary Burns are classified by cause and mechanism, as well as by extent (expressed as percentage of total body surface area or TBSA) and depth. Inhalation injury is caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion or chemical powders and vapours. Its presence is associated with a worse prognosis for a given extent of cutaneous injury. Timely initiation of appropriate first aid (20 minutes of cool running water for thermal injuries) minimises the extent of tissue damage. Extensive burns constitute major trauma and may be associated with multi-trauma. Patients with major burns require primary and secondary survey, and active resuscitation according to a formula related to size of burn. Burn wounds evolve and require regular review and appropriate dressings. Deep circumferential burns may require escharotomy. Extensive burns are associated with systemic effects, which are a manifestation of a systemic inflammatory response that involves all organs and necessitates provision of critical and multidisciplinary care. Surgical management of extensive burns entails early excision of all necrotic tissue, temporisation of the wound with skin substitutes, and timely grafting according to an established algorithm.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aimed to determine factors related to ICU mortality in critically ill patients transferred by Adult Retrieval Victoria (ARV) medical staff. Patients who died in ICU after interhospital transfer were compared against those who survived. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of ARV cases between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010. Retrieval data were linked with data from the ANZICS CORE APD (Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation Adult Patient Database). Victoria Data Linkage (VDL) performed linkage of data. Data included demographic and clinical data obtained during transfer and clinical data recorded in ICU. Results Of the 601 cases transferred by ARV during the study period, 549 cases were eligible for linkage to 25?543 ANZICS APD case records for the same period. VDL matched 460 of these cases (83.8%). Mortality rate in the matched sample was 13.9%. Variables associated with mortality were: advanced age (odds ratios [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00?1.04, P = 0.02), principal referral problem cardiac (OR 1.84, 95%CI 1.02?3.32, P = 0.04), lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95?0.99, P = 0.005) and tachycardia (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00?1.03, P = 0.008) on arrival at destination hospital. Conclusions Advanced age, lower mean arterial blood pressure and tachycardia towards the completion of transfer were associated with increased ICU mortality in this population. Clinicians should be aware of the additional risk for cardiac patients.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.
