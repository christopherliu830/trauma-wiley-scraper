AB  - Background and Objectives? Keeping a small stock of liquid plasma readily available for transfusion is common practise in Sweden. We report data on complement activation markers in plasma components during storage in the liquid state and the kinetics of C3a-desArg after transfusion of autologous plasma with high content of C3a-desArg. Material and Methods? Plasma components were prepared by apheresis or from whole blood. C3 fragments (C3a-desArg, C3d,g, iC3), and soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9) were investigated. C3a-desArg kinetics was investigated in regular apheresis donors. Results? Apheresis plasma prepared by membrane centrifugation had significantly higher level of C3a-desArg, C3d,g and sC5b-9 from day 0 and low iC3, than plasma prepared by other methods. By storage day 7, C3a-desArg -levels were above the reference value in 88% of all components. After re-infusion of autologous plasma with high C3a-desArg content, there were rapid a1 and a2-distribution followed by a slower b-elimination phase. Conclusion? Plasma components prepared by different methods and stored in the liquid phase differ significantly in the amount and timing of complement activation. C3a-desArg present in plasma is rapidly eliminated after transfusion. Autologous plasma could be used to study complement kinetics in different clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients, second hits are known to potentiate the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response, thus increasing the risk of multi-organ dysfunction. In accordance with ?damage control orthopaedic surgery? principles, fractures are initially treated with external fixators, which are replaced by internal osteosynthesis once the immunological status of the patient is considered stable. Recently, we demonstrated that a severe trauma impaired the healing of fractures stabilized by external fixation during the entire healing period. The question arose, whether switching to intramedullary nailing increases the inflammatory response in terms of a second hit, leading to a further impairment of bone healing. Wistar rats received a femoral osteotomy stabilized by an external fixator. Simultaneously half of the rats underwent an additional thoracic trauma. After 4 days, the external fixator was replaced by an intramedullary nail in half of the rats of the two groups. The inflammatory response was evaluated by measuring serum C5a levels. Fracture healing was determined by three-point-bending, µCT, and histomorphometry. The thoracic trauma significantly increased C5a concentrations 6, 24, and 72?h after the second surgical intervention. After 40 days, conversion to intramedullary nailing considerably decreased the flexural rigidity of the callus, with no significant differences between rats with or without thoracic trauma. After 47 days, flexural rigidity in rats subjected to conversion remained decreased compared to animals solely treated by external fixation, particularly in combination with blunt chest trauma. The results indicate that accumulation of second hits after multiple injuries could lead to aggravation of the fracture healing outcome. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract There is a growing awareness that complement plays an integral role in human physiology and disease, transcending its traditional perception as an accessory system for pathogen clearance and opsonic cell killing. As the list of pathologies linked to dysregulated complement activation grows longer, it has become clear that targeted modulation of this innate immune system opens new windows of therapeutic opportunity for anti-inflammatory drug design. Indeed, the introduction of the first complement-targeting drugs has reignited a vibrant interest in the clinical translation of complement-based inhibitors. Compstatin was discovered as a cyclic peptide that inhibits complement activation by binding C3 and interfering with convertase formation and C3 cleavage. As the convergence point of all activation pathways and a molecular hub for crosstalk with multiple pathogenic pathways, C3 represents an attractive target for therapeutic modulation of the complement cascade. A multidisciplinary drug optimization effort encompassing rational ?wet? and in silico synthetic approaches and an array of biophysical, structural and analytical tools has culminated in an impressive structure-function refinement of compstatin, yielding a series of analogues that show promise for a wide spectrum of clinical applications. These new derivatives have improved inhibitory potency and pharmacokinetic profiles and show efficacy in clinically relevant primate models of disease. This review provides an up-to-date survey of the drug design effort placed on the compstatin family of C3 inhibitors, highlighting the most promising drug candidates. It also discusses translational challenges in complement drug discovery and peptide drug development and reviews concerns related to systemic C3 interception.

Sepsis-induced changes in signalling cascades -? Divergent effects on phagocytic cells during sepsis -? Harmful effects of C5a and C5a receptors in experimental sepsis ?? Future directions Sepsis in human beings is a major problem involving many individuals and with a high death rate. Except for a single drug (recombinant activated protein C) that has been approved for treatment of septic patients, supportive measures represent the main clinical approach. There are many models of experimental sepsis, mostly in rodents. A commonly used model is cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, robust activation of complement occurs together with up-regulation of C5a receptors (C5aR, C5L2) in a variety of different organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart). In septic human beings there is abundant evidence for complement activation. Interception of C5a or its receptors in the CLP model greatly improves survival in septic rodents. There is compelling evidence that CLP causes an intense pro-inflammatory state and that C5a interaction with its receptors can be linked to apoptosis of the lymphoid system and cells of the adrenal medulla, loss of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils, consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac dysfunction. These findings may have implications for therapeutic interventions in human beings with sepsis.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article examines two novels by seminal German-language Jewish authors, Benjamin Stein's Die Leinwand (2010) and Eva Menasse's Quasikristalle (2013), to shed light on major shifts in Holocaust memory since the turn of the millennium. I argue that developments such as the disappearance of the eyewitness generation, coupled with the increasing hypermediation and globalisation of Holocaust memories, force us to reconsider certain conceptions of trauma which for a long time have dominated engagements with the Holocaust and its representation. Instead of approaching Holocaust trauma as unspeakable and inherently inaccessible, I propose to read the novels? engagements with the Holocaust through the lens of Terri Tomsky's concept of ?travelling trauma?, which allows us to conceive of the Holocaust as a culturally mediated signifier that moves transgenerationally, transmedially, and transnationally through various discursive networks. The novels by Stein and Menasse furthermore enable us to examine critically certain manifestations of ?travelling trauma? and the current state of Holocaust representation in a way that Tomsky's more descriptive approach does not.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.

AB  - Complement fragment (C)5a is a 74 residue pro-inflammatory polypeptide produced during activation of the complement cascade of serum proteins in response to foreign surfaces such as microorganisms and tissue damaged by physical or chemical injury. C5a binds to at least two seven-transmembrane domain receptors, C5aR (C5R1, CD88) and C5L2 (gpr77), expressed ubiquitously on a wide variety of cells but particularly on the surface of immune cells like macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. C5aR is a classical G protein-coupled receptor that signals through Gαi and Gα16, whereas C5L2 does not appear to couple to G proteins and has no known signalling activity. Although C5a was first described as an anaphylatoxin and later as a leukocyte chemoattractant, the widespread expression of C5aR suggested more general functionality. Our understanding of the physiology of C5a has improved significantly in recent years through exploitation of receptor knockout and knockin mice, C5 and C5a antibodies, soluble recombinant C5a and C5a analogues and newly developed receptor antagonists. C5a is now also implicated in non-immunological functions associated with developmental biology, CNS development and neurodegeneration, tissue regeneration, and haematopoiesis. Combined receptor mutagenesis, molecular modelling, structure-activity relationship studies and species dependence for ligand potency on C5aR have been helpful for identifying ligand binding sites on the receptor and for defining mechanisms of receptor activation and inactivation. This review will highlight major developments in C5a receptor research that support C5aR as an important therapeutic target. The intriguing possibilities raised by the existence of a non-signalling C5a receptor are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract The study was designed to investigate whether complement is activated in patients subject to rectal surgery and whether the choice of surgical technique (open or laparoscopic) has any impact on the activation of complement. Our hypothesis is that laparoscopic surgery leads to a lower-level activation of complement than open surgery. Patients (n?=?24) subject to rectal surgery owing to rectal cancer were included. The study was prospective and randomized. The patients were randomized to either laparoscopic surgery (n?=?12) or open surgery (n?=?12). Blood samples for determination of complement activation (C4d, Bb, C3bc and the terminal C5b-9 complex TCC) were drawn before start of surgery (T0) and at the following time-points after start of surgery: 180?min (T1), 360?min (T2), 24?h (T3) and 3?5?days (T4). A significant increase in the alternative pathway activation product Bb and in the terminal pathway activation product TCC was seen over time in both groups (P?<?0.001). Bb peaked early (T1) and returned to baseline levels post-operatively, whereas TCC increased steadily with maximum values in the late post-operative period. The plasma concentrations of C4d and C3bc decreased significantly in both groups at T1 and T2 and returned to baseline levels at T4. There was no significant difference between the groups. Rectal surgery causes activation of the complement system. Complement is activated through the alternative pathway. Results mostly showed no significant differences between laparoscopic and open rectal surgery apart from lower levels of factor Bb in the former group in the perioperative period.

AB  - Summary Coagulation and innate immunity are linked evolutionary processes that orchestrate the host defence against invading pathogens and injury. The complement system is integral to innate immunity and shares numerous interactions with components of the haemostatic pathway, helping to maintain physiological equilibrium. The term ?immunothrombosis? was introduced in 2013 to embrace this process, and has become an area of much recent interest. What is less apparent in the literature however is an appreciation of the clinical manifestations of the coagulation-complement interaction and the consequences of dysregulation of either system, as seen in many inflammatory and thrombotic disease states, such as sepsis, trauma, atherosclerosis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and some thrombotic microangiopathies to name a few. The growing appreciation of this immunothrombotic phenomenon will foster the drive for novel therapies in these disease states, including anticoagulants as immunomodulators and targeted molecular therapies.

AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that neutrophils are essential for the protection from invading pathogens, hyperactive neutrophils may elicit detrimental cerebral damage after severe trauma. The neutrophil interactions with the neurovascular unit entail endothelial dysfunction involving endothelial leakage, formation of edema, coagulation abnormalities, disturbed hemodynamics, tissue infiltration etc. These elements of the ?whole body inflammation,? designated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in conjunction with intracerebral proinflammatory activities, are important triggers of post-traumatic cerebral damage and mortality according to the ?second hit? concept. From the immunologic point of view, the brain is an immune privileged site, known to resist autodestructive inflammatory activity much more efficiently than other organs because of the highly efficient diverse functions of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). However, both the underlying strategy of the BBB to maintain cerebral protecting functions against the post-traumatic neutrophil-mediated ?second hit? and how activated neutrophils may overcome the BBB are currently unknown. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of the ?second hit,? the BBB physiology, and its role in the maintenance of cerebral immune privilege, and discusses recent findings that may explain the pathophysiologic neutrophil?BBB interactions occurring after severe trauma, thus offering novel therapeutic options to protect from post-traumatic brain damage. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two categories of joint overloading cause post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA): single acute traumatic loads/impactions and repetitive overloading due to incongruity/instability. We developed and refined three classes of complementary models to define relationships between joint overloading and progressive cartilage loss across the spectrum of acute injuries and chronic joint abnormalities: explant and whole joint models that allow probing of cellular responses to mechanical injury and contact stresses, animal models that enable study of PTOA pathways in living joints and pre-clinical testing of treatments, and patient-specific computational models that define the overloading that causes OA in humans. We coordinated methodologies across models so that results from each informed the others, maximizing the benefit of this complementary approach. We are incorporating results from these investigations into biomathematical models to provide predictions of PTOA risk and guide treatment. Each approach has limitations, but each provides opportunities to elucidate PTOA pathogenesis. Taken together, they help define levels of joint overloading that cause cartilage destruction, show that both forms of overloading can act through the same biologic pathways, and create a framework for initiating clinical interventions that decrease PTOA risk. Considered collectively, studies extending from explants to humans show that thresholds of joint overloading that cause cartilage loss can be defined, that to at least some extent both forms of joint overloading act through the same biologic pathways, and interventions that interrupt these pathways prevent cartilage damage. These observations suggest that treatments that decrease the risk of all forms of OA progression can be discovered. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adversity early in life can disrupt the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes and increase risk for negative health outcomes. The interplay between these axes and the environment is complex, and understanding needs to be advanced by the investigation of the multiple hormonal relationships underlying these processes. The current study examined basal hormonal associations between morning levels of cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone in a cohort of adolescents (mean age 15.56 years). The moderating influence of childhood adversity was also examined, as indexed by self-reported trauma (at mean age 14.91), and observed maternal aggressive parenting (at mean age 12.41). Between-person regressions revealed significant associations between hormones that were moderated by both measures of adversity. In females, all hormones positively covaried, but also interacted with adversity, such that positive covariation was typically only present when levels of trauma and/or aggressive parenting were low. In males, hormonal associations and interactions were less evident; however, interactions were detected for cortisol-testosterone ? positively covarying at high levels of aggressive parenting but negatively covarying at low levels ? and DHEA-cortisol ? similarly positively covarying at high levels of parental aggression. These results demonstrate associations between adrenal and gonadal hormones and the moderating role of adversity, which is likely driven by feedback mechanisms, or cross-talk, between the axes. These findings suggest that hormonal changes may be the pathway through which early life adversity alters physiology and increases health risks, but does so differentially in the sexes; however further study is necessary to establish causation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Trauma resuscitation is a complex situation, and most organisations have multi-professional trauma teams. Non-technical skills are challenged during trauma resuscitation, and they play an important role in the prevention of critical incidents. Simulation-based training of these is recommended. Our research question was: Does simulation-based trauma team training of non-technical skills have effect on reaction, learning, behaviour or patient outcome? The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library and found 13 studies eligible for analysis. We described and compared the educational interventions and the evaluations of effect according to the four Kirkpatrick levels: reaction, learning (knowledge, skills, attitudes), behaviour (in a clinical setting) and patient outcome. No studies were randomised, controlled and blinded, resulting in a moderate to high risk of bias. The multi-professional trauma teams had positive reactions to simulation-based training of non-technical skills. Knowledge and skills improved in all studies evaluating the effect on learning. Three studies found improvements in team performance (behaviour) in the clinical setting. One of these found difficulties in maintaining these skills. Two studies evaluated on patient outcome, of which none showed improvements in mortality, complication rate or duration of hospitalisation. A significant effect on learning was found after simulation-based training of the multi-professional trauma team in non-technical skills. Three studies demonstrated significantly increased clinical team performance. No effect on patient outcome was found. All studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. More comprehensive randomised studies are needed to evaluate the effect on patient outcome.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate whether major abdominal surgery leads to complement activation and interleukin response and whether the kind of anaesthesia influence complement activation and the release of inflammatory interleukins. The study design was prospective and randomised. Fifty patients undergoing open major colorectal surgery due to cancer disease or inflammatory bowel disease were studied. Twenty-five patients were given total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil, and 25 patients were given inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl. To determine complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9) and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins (tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-8, IL-4 and IL-10), blood samples were drawn preoperatively, 60 minutes after start of surgery, 30 minutes after end of surgery and 24 hours postoperatively. Complement was activated and pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-10) were released during major colorectal surgery. There was no significant difference between TIVA and inhalational anaesthesia regarding complement activation and cytokine release. Major colorectal surgery leads to activation of the complement cascade and the release of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There are no significant differences between total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil and inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl regarding complement activation and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins.

AB  - Abstract Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a systems-focused philosophy of service delivery based upon principles of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety and trustworthiness that recognizes the pervasive impact of trauma across the human experience. In a grassroots effort, one organization developed an innovative, trauma-informed day program to meet the needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who were recently deinstitutionalized. The present study is intended to provide an initial conceptualization and preliminary assessment of TIC within IDD services in order to understand its impact among individuals and staff. The study sought to answer the following questions: Has the program's culture been stable over time? How have individuals? behaviors changed over time? What have been the experiences of the program's staff members with TIC? Through a mixed methods design, secondary data analysis and semi structured staff interviews were used to assess the impact of TIC. Findings revealed an initial strong presence of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety, and trustworthiness within the program's culture, with non significant changes at follow-up. Significant reductions were noted in overall challenging behavior, aggression, and PRN medication usage; while non significant changes were noted in physical interventions with the exception of ?other? interventions (i.e., least restrictive) which significantly increased. Three major categories emerged from the qualitative data (making a difference, recognizing progress and compromising factors), illuminating staff satisfaction with work experiences, individuals? progress, and factors that challenged fidelity to TIC. The study provides a preliminary conceptualization and evidence for the efficacy of the integration of TIC into IDD services despite methodological limitations and concerns regarding the use of physical interventions. Directions for future research are presented.

AB  - Trauma can be defined as an event that goes beyond ordinary modes of experience and linguistic representation. It represents a break not just with a particular form of representation but with the possibility of representation at all. Drawing on a large corpus of domestic migrant worker narratives, the article analyses trauma narratives in which migrant women share their experiences while working for abusive employers. The stories deal with unspeakable suffering and humiliation, and the article attempts to outline the narrative structures that characterise trauma storytelling: broken narratives with voids in the narrative flow. It also analyses the emotional component of trauma narratives focusing on crying, which is seen as an authentication of feeling and meaning. Finally, the article considers how the women make sense of their traumatic experiences, and how peer support becomes essential in the narrators' attempts to rewrite their life stories from victimhood to survival and beyond.
