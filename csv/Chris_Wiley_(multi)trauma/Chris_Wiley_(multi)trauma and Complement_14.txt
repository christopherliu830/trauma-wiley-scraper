AB  - Abstract The human interosseous membrane (IOM) is a fundamental stabilizer during forearm rotation. To investigate the dynamic aspects of forearm stability, we analyzed sensory nerve endings in the IOM. The distal oblique bundle (DOB), the distal accessory band (DAB), the central band (CB), the proximal accessory band (PAB), the dorsal oblique accessory cord (DOAC) and the proximal oblique cord (POC) were dissected from 11 human cadaver forearms. Sensory nerve endings were analyzed at two levels per specimen as total cell amount/mm2 after immunofluorescence staining with low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, protein gene product 9.5, S-100 protein and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole on an Apotome microscope, according to Freeman and Wyke?s classification. Sensory nerve endings were significantly more commonly found to be equally distributed throughout the structures, rather than being epifascicular, interstitial, or close to the insertion into bone (P ≤ 0.001, respectively). Free nerve endings were the predominant mechanoreceptor in all six structures, with highest density in the DOB, followed by the POC (P ≤ 0.0001, respectively). The DOB had the highest density of Pacini corpuscles. The DOAC and CB had the lowest amounts of sensory innervation. The high density of sensory corpuscles in the DOB, PAB and POC indicate that proprioceptive control of the compressive and directional muscular forces acting on the distal and proximal radioulnar joints is monitored by the DOB, PAB and POC, respectively, due to their closed proximity to both joints, whereas the central parts of the IOM act as structures of passive restraint.

AB  - Scand J Caring Sci; 2010; 24; 266?273 ? Being first on the scene of an accident ? experiences of ?doing? prehospital emergency care Prehospital emergency care includes the care and treatment of patients prior to them reaching hospital. This is generally a field for the ambulance services, but in many cases firemen or police can be the ones to provide the first responses. The aim of this study was to describe and understand experiences of being the first responder on the scene of an accident, as described by policemen, firemen and ambulance staff. A lifeworld perspective was used in four different traumatic situations from southern Sweden. The data consisted of 13 unstructured interviews with first responders. The phenomenological analysis showed that experiences of being the first responder on the scene of an accident is expectations of doing a systematic course of action, dressed in the role of a hero, and at the same time being genuine in an interpersonal encounter. This entails a continuous movement between ?being? and ?doing?. It is not a question of either ? or, instead everything is to be understood in relation to each other at the same time. Five constituents further described the variations of the phenomenon; a feeling of security in the uncertainty, a distanced closeness to the injured person, one moment in an eternity, cross-border cooperation within distinct borders and a need to make the implicit explicit. This finding highlights the importance of using policemen and firemen in doing life support measures while waiting for the ambulance staff, and would in turn increase the importance of the relationship between the different professionals on the scene of an accident.

AB  - Traditional medical systems are challenging because their theories and practices strike many conventionally trained physicians and researchers as incomprehensible. Should modern medicine dismiss them as unscientific, view them as sources of alternatives hidden in a matrix of superstition, or regard them as complementary sciences of medicine? We make the latter argument using the example of Tibetan medicine. Tibetan medicine is based on analytic models and methods that are rationally defined, internally coherent, and make testable predictions, meeting current definitions of ?science.? A ninth century synthesis of Indian, Chinese, Himalayan, and Greco-Persian traditions, Tibetan medicine is the most comprehensive form of Eurasian healthcare and the world's first integrative medicine. Incorporating rigorous systems of meditative self-healing and ascetic self-care from India, it includes a world-class paradigm of mind/body and preventive medicine. Adapting the therapeutic philosophy and contemplative science of Indian Buddhism to the quality of secular life and death, it features the world's most effective systems of positive and palliative healthcare. Based on qualitative theories and intersubjective methods, it involves predictions and therapies shown to be more accurate and effective than those of modern medicine in fields from physiology and pharmacology to neuroscience, mind/body medicine, and positive health. The possibility of complementary sciences follows from the latest view of science as a set of tools?instruments of social activity based on learned agreement in aims and methods?rather than as a monolith of absolute truth. Implications of this pluralistic outlook for medical research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Neurotrauma, as in the case of traumatic brain injury, promotes protease over-activation characterized by the select fragmentation of brain proteins. The resulting polypeptides are indicators of biochemical processes, which can be used to study post-injury dynamics and may also be developed into biomarkers. To this end, we devised a novel mass spectrometry approach to characterize post-injury calpain proteolytic processing of myelin basic protein (MBP), a biomarker of brain injury that denotes white matter damage and recovery. Our approach exceeds conventional immunological assays in its deconvolution of multiple protein isoforms, its absolute quantification of proteolytic fragments and its polypeptide selectivity. We quantified and characterized post-injury proteolytic processing of all MBP isoforms identified in adult rat cortex. Further, the translation of calpain-cleaved MBP into CSF was verified following brain injury. We ascertained that the exon-6 sequence of MBP resulted in a characteristic shift in gel migration for intact and fragmented protein alike. We also found evidence for a second post-TBI cleavage event within exon-2 and for the dimerization of the post-TBI 4.3?kDa fragment. Ultimately, the novel methodology described here can be used to study MBP dynamics and other similar proteolytic events of relevance to brain injury and other CNS processes.

AB  - Abstract The concept of ?learning by doing? has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are required. Restrictions on medical educators have prompted them to seek alternative methods to teach medical knowledge and gain procedural experience. Fortunately, the last decade has seen an explosion of the number of tools available to enhance medical education: web-based education, virtual reality, and high fidelity patient simulation. This paper presents some of the consensus statements in regard to these tools agreed upon by members of the Educational Technology Section of the 2004 AEM Consensus Conference for Informatics and Technology in Emergency Department Health Care, held in Orlando, Florida. Findings: Web-based teaching: 1) Every ED should have access to medical educational materials via the Internet, computer-based training, and other effective education methods for point-of-service information, continuing medical education, and training. 2) Real-time automated tools should be integrated into Emergency Department Information Systems [EDIS] for contemporaneous education. Virtual reality [VR]: 1) Emergency physicians and emergency medicine societies should become more involved in VR development and assessment. 2) Nationally accepted protocols for the proper assessment of VR applications should be adopted and large multi-center groups should be formed to perform these studies. High-fidelity simulation: Emergency medicine residency programs should consider the use of high-fidelity patient simulators to enhance the teaching and evaluation of core competencies among trainees. Conclusions: Across specialties, patient simulation, virtual reality, and the Web will soon enable medical students and residents to? see one, simulate many, do one competently, and teach everyone.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims To (1) describe the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU), (2) describe trends and associated consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use in South Africa for January 1997 to December 1999 and (3) outline selected policy implications identified by SACENDU participants. Methods A descriptive epidemiological study of AOD indicators based on data gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, trauma units and quantitative studies of target groups such as school students and arrestees. Networks were established in five sentinel sites to facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results Over time alcohol has been the most frequently reported primary substance of abuse across sites. Trauma and psychiatric data highlight the burden associated with alcohol abuse. Cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone), alone or in combination, are the most frequently reported illicit drugs of abuse, generally comprising the largest proportions of drug-related arrests, drug-related psychiatric diagnoses and drug-positive trauma patients. From 1997 to 1999, a significant increase in indicators for cocaine/crack and heroin occurred in two sites. Ecstasy (MDMA) use, alone or in combination with other substances, is reported among young people. Conclusions A broad range of globally abused substances is present in South Africa and the use and burden of illicit substances appears to be increasing. This points to the importance of ongoing monitoring of AOD trends. Through regular, systematic data collection the SACENDU project has made available more evidence-based information to direct AOD abuse policy and practice and has had an impact on research agendas.

AB  - Objective? To review the gross, microscopic, and functional anatomy of the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) in dogs. Study Design? Literature review. Methods? Reports of the anatomy and function of the cruciate ligaments in dogs were retrieved by search of the 1975?2005 PubMed database. Results? The CCL has an important biomechanical function resisting cranial drawer, hyperextension, and internal rotation and acts to fine tune and guide the stifle through its rolling and sliding motion. It has a complex architecture, and distinct geographic regions within the ligament have different functional roles depending on the angle and loading conditions. Collagen type I is the main component of the extracellular matrix; the fibrils have a crimped structure. The cruciate ligaments are almost completely covered by synovium, protecting them from synovial fluid. Cruciate blood supply is mainly of soft tissue origin. The intraligamentous network is relatively limited whereas the core of the middle third of the CCL is even less well vascularized. Neurohistologic studies are very limited in the dog. Various mechanoreceptors and proprioceptive receptors have been identified within the substance of the cruciate ligaments. Conclusions? CCL structural characteristics play an important part in its complex behaviour with the crimped pattern of the collagen fibrils being an important determinant of its biomechanical properties. In contrast to reports of managing CCL rupture, there are few reports describing the microanatomy and neurovascular morphology of the cruciate ligaments. Clinical Relevance? Cruciate disease is likely multi-factorial. Improved understanding of CCL degradation leading to CCL rupture is critical to development of new diagnostic tests for cruciate disease in dogs. Appropriate intervention during the early stages of disease process might preserve CCL structural properties by preventing further collagen degradation. Accurate knowledge of functional and fiber bundle anatomy is imperative for reconstruction and restoration of normal stifle joint physiology. Reconstructive goals should alleviate existing instability and mimic normal kinematics. Knowledge of the exact function of the CCL in the neuromuscular control around the stifle joint could possibly explain osteoarthritis progression after CCL damage.

AB  - This position paper proposes a modeling pipeline to develop clinically relevant neuromusculoskeletal models to understand and treat complex neurological disorders. Although applicable to a variety of neurological conditions, we provide direct pipeline applicative examples in the context of cerebral palsy (CP). This paper highlights technologies in: (1) patient-specific segmental rigid body models developed from magnetic resonance imaging for use in inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics pipelines; (2) efficient population-based approaches to derive skeletal models and muscle origins/insertions that are useful for population statistics and consistent creation of continuum models; (3) continuum muscle descriptions to account for complex muscle architecture including spatially varying material properties with muscle wrapping; (4) muscle and tendon properties specific to CP; and (5) neural-based electromyography-informed methods for muscle force prediction. This represents a novel modeling pipeline that couples for the first time electromyography extracted features of disrupted neuromuscular behavior with advanced numerical methods for modeling CP-specific musculoskeletal morphology and function. The translation of such pipeline to the clinical level will provide a new class of biomarkers that objectively describe the neuromusculoskeletal determinants of pathological locomotion and complement current clinical assessment techniques, which often rely on subjective judgment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate post-war context have forced us to re-think our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention. Recognizing the role of culture has allowed us to rethink trauma-in-context, how people and communities understand trauma, and how to explore the most effective psychotherapeutic treatments in these post-war cultural contexts. Dawes and Honwana (Children, culture and mental health: Interventions in Conditions of War. In B. Efraime Jr, P. Riedesser, J. Walter, H. Adam, & P. Steudtner (Eds), Children, war and persecution ? rebuilding hope. Maputo: Rebuilding Hope, 1998) suggest a holistic view of the individual-in-context in order to fully understand the meaning an individual brings and gives to a stressful experience. This perspective allows also for an understanding of the healing resources within a community available to the individual, and the psychologist, dealing with a traumatic event. By exploring both the universal and specific cultural dimensions of trauma, while working with former child soldiers on Josina Machel Island, Mozambique, the authors seek to illuminate how these cultural dimensions, and wealth of healing resources, shaped their understanding of culture in the treatment process and the creation of treatment teams. A comprehensive cultural understanding also allowed the author to use and integrate important cultural dimensions of understanding in to the treatment process to aid in the elaboration of traumatic events associated with being a child soldier. These treatment methods are described via a case example, which represents much of the work carried out with the community of Josina Machel. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Campbell systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions in reducing symptoms of distress and trauma for victims of sexual assault and rape. Six studies including 405 participants met eligibility criteria, with data from 358 participants available for analysis. Results of this systematic review provide tentative evidence that cognitive and behavioural interventions, in particular Cognitive Processing Therapy, Prolonged Exposure therapy, Stress Inoculation Therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing can be associated with decreased symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety in victims of rape and sexual assault. There is a need for further well-designed controlled studies which differentiate victims of sexual assault and rape from other traumatic events. Executive summary/Abstract BACKGROUND Beginning with the articulation of Rape Trauma Syndrome (Burgess 1974), the traumatic aftermath of sexual assault on victims has become a focus of social and legal policy, scholarly inquiry, and mental health interventions. The wide variety of psychosocial treatment modalities for victims of sexual violence reported in the literature and used in practice are predominantly based on psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioural or feminist-informed theoretical frameworks. Some modalities have been specifically designed for victims of sexual violence while others have been adapted from use with other traumatized populations. Although there is evidence of effective treatments for addressing traumatic stress in victims of many types of trauma, modalities specific to victims of sexual assault have not been systematically tested. Evidence suggests that trauma associated with rape or sexual assault differs from trauma stemming from other experiences, in part due to the strong element of self-blame, the individualized nature of this type of trauma, social support and social acceptance factors, and the higher incidence of concurrent depression. Therefore, it is critical to examine the effectiveness of interventions specific to victims of sexual violence and rape. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions in reducing symptoms of distress and trauma for victims of sexual assault and rape. SEARCH STRATEGY Both published and unpublished work was considered eligible for the review. Electronic searches were conducted in June 2009 and in April 2011 within the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR); MEDLINE; EMBASE; EMBASE Classic; All EBM Reviews; PsycINFO; ASSIA (Applied Social Sciences Indexes and Abstracts); ERIC; Social Sciences Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Sciences Citation Index; Criminal Justice Abstracts; Violence and Abuse Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI); CINAHL; Gender Studies Database; and Contemporary Women's Issues. Reference lists of all relevant articles were also screened and requests for additional studies made to authors and key informants. To supplement the electronic searches, seven journals relevant to the sexual assault, rape or sexual violence were hand-searched up to April 2009: Journal of Traumatic Stress; Journal of Interpersonal Violence; Victims and Offenders; Trauma Abuse and Violence; Violence against Women; American Journal of Psychiatry; and British Journal of Psychiatry. SELECTION CRITERIA Studies were eligible for the review if (a) the allocation of study participants to experimental or control groups was by random allocation or quasi-experimental parallel cohort design; (b) participants were adults who had experienced sexual assault or rape as adults; and (c) the intervention specifically focused on victims of sexual assault or rape. Studies with participants that identified primarily as victims of childhood sexual abuse were not included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors screened abstracts and read the full-text of all eligible articles. Standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all relevant outcomes. RESULTS Six studies including 405 participants met eligibility criteria, with data from 358 participants available for analysis. Two of the studies evaluated Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT, totalling 80 participants); three evaluated Prolonged Exposure (PE, n= 94); two evaluated Stress Inoculation Therapy (SIT, n=26); one evaluated Supportive Psychotherapy (SP, n=12) and two examined Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing therapy (EMDR, n=34). Meta-analysis comparing all treatments against no treatment for the randomized controlled trials revealed significant results for PTSD symptoms, both independently observed [SMD -1.81 (95% CI -2.90 to -0.72, four studies)] and self-reported [SMD -1.90 (95% CI -2.73 to -1.07, three studies)] at post-treatment. Meta-analyses of relevant outcomes from the six included studies revealed that all the treatments had a statistically significant effect on PTSD and depression symptoms in comparison to the control groups at post-test. The four studies that included anxiety as an outcome also showed significant improvements. Other outcomes that demonstrated improvements included guilt (following CPT and to a lesser extent, PE) and dissociation (following EMDR treatment). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Results of this systematic review provide tentative evidence that cognitive and behavioural interventions, in particular Cognitive Processing Therapy, Prolonged Exposure therapy, Stress Inoculation Therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing can be associated with decreased symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety in victims of rape and sexual assault. There is a need for further well-designed controlled studies which differentiate victims of sexual assault and rape from other traumatic events.

AB  - Summary Evidence for Iron Age funerary treatments remains sporadic across Britain and formal cemeteries are especially elusive. One important exception is Broxmouth hillfort, East Lothian, excavated during the late 1970s but not yet published. New analysis of the human remains from Broxmouth provides evidence for three distinct populations: a formal cemetery outside the hillfort, isolated graves within the ramparts, and a scatter of disarticulated fragments from a range of domestic and midden contexts. The latter group in particular provides significant evidence for violent trauma; isotopic evidence suggests that they may be the remains of outsiders. Together the human remains shed light on complex and changing attitudes to death and the human body in Iron Age Britain. The material from Broxmouth is considered in the light of emerging evidence for fluid and pluralistic treatments of the dead in the Iron Age of south-east Scotland.

AB  - Abstract:? This study examined the prevalence, demographic variables and adverse outcomes associated with non-adherence to post-transplant care in adolescent liver transplant recipients. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 111 adolescent patients (age 12?21?yr) greater than six months post-transplantation and defined non-adherence as not taking the immunosuppressive(s) or not attending any clinic visit in 2005. Fifty subjects (45.0%) were non-adherent and 61 (55.0%) were adherent. Twenty percent of the subjects did not attend clinic and 10.9% did not complete laboratory tests. Non-adherence was significantly associated with fewer completed laboratory tests (p?<?0.0001), single parent status (p?<?0.0186), and older age and greater years post-transplantation by both univariate and multivariate analyses (p?<?0.008, p?<?0.0141 and p?<?0.0012, p?<?0.0174, respectively). Non-adherence to medication was significantly associated with a rejection episode in 31 patients (p?<?0.0069) but not in the subgroup of seven patients who stopped their immunosuppression completely. Non-adherence to post-transplant care is a prevalent problem in adolescents particularly of an older age and greater years post-transplantation. Rejection was a significant consequence of medication non-adherence except in a subgroup with presumed graft tolerance who discontinued their immunosuppression. These results emphasize the need for strict monitoring of adherence to post-transplant care to improve long-term survival and quality of life in adolescent transplant patients.

AB  - This article investigates conceptual and strategic relationships between corporate identity, organizational identity and ethics, utilizing the Benetton Corporation as an illustrative case study. Although much attention has been given to visual aspects of Benetton's renowned ethical brand building efforts, few studies have looked at how Benetton's employees, retail environments and trade events express ethical aspects of their well-known corporate identity. A multi-method case study, including interviews at retail outlets and trade events, sheds light on several important yet under-studied components of corporate identity, including stakeholders such as retail managers and contract employees. Analysis of Benetton's operations revealed disconnection and inconsistency, as well as a failure to communicate ethical values and socially responsible attributes throughout organizational identity. Operational identity emerged as a useful complement to models of corporate identity. We demonstrate the way in which organizations may fail to capitalize on positive aspects of their organizational identity by neglecting their operational identity.

AB  - Abstract Research in humans and animals has shown that negative childhood experiences (NCE) can have long-term effects on the structure and function of the brain. Alterations have been noted in grey and white matter, in the brain's resting state, on the glutamatergic system, and on neural and behavioural responses to aversive stimuli. These effects can be linked to psychiatric disorder such as depression and anxiety disorders that are influenced by excessive exposure to early life stressors. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of NCEs on these systems. Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), aversion task fMRI, glutamate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) were combined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in healthy subjects to examine the impact of NCEs on the brain. Low CTQ scores, a measure of NCEs, were related to higher resting state glutamate levels and higher resting state entropy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). CTQ scores, mPFC glutamate and entropy, correlated with neural BOLD responses to the anticipation of aversive stimuli in regions throughout the aversion-related network, with strong correlations between all measures in the motor cortex and left insula. Structural connectivity strength, measured using mean fractional anisotropy, between the mPFC and left insula correlated to aversion-related signal changes in the motor cortex. These findings highlight the impact of NCEs on multiple inter-related brain systems. In particular, they highlight the role of a prefrontal-insular-motor cortical network in the processing and responsivity to aversive stimuli and its potential adaptability by NCEs.

AB  - Summary To consider the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to the pathology of equine joint diseases, 3 autoimmune responses were assayed in sera and synovial fluids. IgM-rheumatoid factor and antibodies to heat shock protein 65 kDa were determined by ELISA; anti-nuclear antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence to whole cell nuclear components. All parameters showed only modest increases, if any and not in a pattern related to disease, although some statistically significant increases were detected. Group analysis showed significantly elevated synovial fluid IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) in horses with OA (P<0.01), traumatised joints (P<0.01) and articular fractured bones (P<0.001). There was no significantly increased IgM-RF in the sera of horses with joint disorders compared to control horses. Significantly raised anti-heat shock protein molecular weight 65 kDa (HSP65) antibodies were only found in the synovial fluids of the horses with traumatised joints (P<0.001). No correlations were found between the synovial fluid and sera levels of IgM-RF or anti-HSP65 antibodies. Synovial fluid anti-HSP65 antibody and IgM-RF levels positively correlated in the OCD (P<0.001), fracture (P<0.01) and synovitis (P<0.05) groups. As antibodies to HSP65 correlated with IgG concentrations in synovial fluids, it is not possible to draw conclusions on HSP roles in joint disease pathogenesis. No serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by immunofluorescence using rat liver and a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) as substrates. Compared with autoimmune responses in human and canine arthropathies, the low levels of autoimmune reactivity detected in this study can only suggest a minor contributory role to joint disease pathology in the horse. These results have 2 important implications. Firstly, other pathogenetic mechanisms should be considered and secondly, autoimmune mechanisms cannot be used to monitor disease progress and therefore should not be targetted for treatment.

AB  - Abstract Pupil examination has been used as a basic measure in critically ill patients and has great importance for the prognosis and management of disease. An automated pupillometer is a computer-based infrared digital video system by which the accuracy and precision of the pupil examination are markedly improved. We conducted an observational study of pupil assessment with automated pupillometry in clinical liver transplantation settings, including pretransplant evaluations and posttransplant surveillance. Our results showed that unconscious patients (grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy) had a prolonged latency phase (left side: 283 ± 80 milliseconds; right side: 295 ± 96 milliseconds) and a reduced pupillary constrictive ratio (left direct response: 0.23 ± 0.10; left indirect response: 0.21 ± 0.07; right direct response: 0.20 ± 0.08; right indirect response: 0.21 ± 0.08) in comparison with normal and conscious patients. After liver transplantation, the recovery of pupillography in these patients was slower than that in conscious patients. However, the surviving recipients without major complications all had a gradual recovery of pupillary responses, which occurred on the first or second posttransplant day. We also reported 4 cases of futile LT in the absence of pretransplant pupillary responses and other pupillary abnormalities revealed by automated pupillometry in our study. In conclusion, patients with grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy had a sluggish pupil response and a delayed recovery pattern after LT. An automated pupillometer is potentially a supplementary device for pretransplant screening and posttransplant monitoring in patients undergoing LT, but further prospective studies are required.
