AB  - ABSTRACT: Wound cleansing has been practised for centuries and despite our advances in the medical field there is still much confusion about which solution to use for cleansing wounds in practice. From boiled water to cytotoxic chemicals the annihilation of bacteria has become our biggest obsession but it should not be at the expense of the healing process. As multi-resistant organisms begin to reduce our options for antibiotic use it appears that dilution remains the solution to pollution.

AB  - Abstract Teamwork has become a major focus in healthcare. In part, this is the result of the Institute of Medicine report entitled To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, which details the high rate of preventable medical errors, many of which are the result of dysfunctional or nonexistent teamwork. It has been proposed that a healthcare system that supports effective teamwork can improve the quality of patient care and reduce workload issues that cause burnout among healthcare professionals. Few clear guidelines exist to help guide the implementation of all these recommendations in healthcare settings. In general, training programs designed to improve team skills are a new concept for medicine, particularly for physicians who are trained largely to be self-sufficient and individually responsible for their actions. Outside of healthcare, research has shown that teams working together in high-risk and high-intensity work environments make fewer mistakes than individuals. This evidence originates from commercial aviation, the military, firefighting, and rapid-response police activities. Commercial aviation, an industry in which mistakes can result in unacceptable loss, has been at the forefront of risk reduction through teamwork training. The importance of teamwork has been recognized by some in the healthcare industry who have begun to develop their own specialty-driven programs. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current literature on teaching about teamwork in undergraduate medical education. We describe the science of teams, analyze the work in team training that has been done in other fields, and assess what work has been done in other fields about the importance of team training (ie, aviation, nonmedical education, and business). Additionally, it is vital to assess what work has already been done in medicine to advance the skills required for effective teamwork. Much of this work has been done in fields in which medical professionals deal with crisis situations (ie, anesthesia, trauma, and labor and delivery). We describe the current programs for teaching medical students these essential skills and what recommendations have been made about the best ways to introduce teaching this skill set into the curriculum. Finally, we include a review on assessing teamwork because one cannot teach team training without implementing an assessment to ensure that the skills are being learned.

AB  - Abstract Parametric subtracted post-ictal diffusion tensor imaging (pspiDTI) is a novel imaging technique developed at our center to visualize transient, patient-specific, ictal-associated water diffusion abnormalities in hippocampal-associated axonal tissue. PspiDTI can elucidate putative connectivity patterns, tracing ictal propagation following a partial-onset seizure without generalization secondarily. PspiDTI compares two DTI volumes acquired during the early post-ictal period (<4 hr), and baseline inter-ictal interval (>24?hr post-seizure). This technique performs a voxel-wise parametric test to identify statistically significant transient ictal-associated changes in water diffusivity involving white matter (WM). Our technique was applied to six patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy who were candidates for direct cortical responsive neurostimulation (RNS) therapy. Global and region-specific fractional anisotropy decreases, relative to baseline, were detected in all patients with a 17.01% (p <?.01) relative mean decrement, while trace increases were found in 6/6 (100%) patients with a 13.30% (p <?.01) relative global mean increment. Changes in diffusivity were anatomically compared with transient hyper-perfusion as detected by subtracted ictal SPECT co-registered to MRI (SISCOM). In 5/6 (83.33%) patients, alterations in WM diffusivity were detected adjacent to the SISCOM signal localized predominantly in gray matter. In 4/6 patients, post-implant RNS electrocorticography revealed early ictal propagation between implanted RNS depth leads guided by pspiDTI, hence validating concordant abnormal diffusivity regions detected by our technique. PspiDTI can complement the conventional pre-surgical evaluation to provide additional crucial information regarding WM ictal-propagation pathways between predominantly gray matter ictal-onset zones. When incorporated into a multi-modality pre-surgical workflow, pspiDTI can aid in defining critical nodes between ictogenic regions. This information can be used to strategically implant a limited set of two RNS depth leads for maximizing the extent to which direct cortical RNS can modulate a potentially extensive epileptogenic network.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report long-term clinical outcome in dogs treated for single congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEHPSS) with a ameroid ring constrictor (ARC) and to identify perioperative variables associated with outcome. Study Design Retrospective, multi-institutional study. Animals Dogs (n?=?206) with CEHPSS. Methods Medical records of dogs with CEHPSS treated by ARC were reviewed for perioperative and short-term (<1 month) data. Long-term follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview with referring veterinarians and/or owners. Kaplan?Meier analysis was used to estimate median survival time. Factors associated with short-term survival, outcome grade, and total survival time were identified. Results Fifteen dogs died <1 month after ARC placement. Follow-up data were obtained for 112 of 191 dogs that survived >1 month; median follow was 54 months (range, 1?175 months) and 103 (92%) dogs had no clinical signs. Estimated median survival time was 152 months. Variables significantly associated with short-term survival included being intact and a low total white blood cell (WBC) count. Variables significantly associated with a successful outcome included having surgery later in the study period and negative postoperative nuclear scintigraphy. In the long-term survival analyses, intact dogs and those with higher WBC counts and occlusion pressures and lower bile acid concentrations were more likely to survive. Conclusions Dogs with CEHPSS treated by ARC generally have a good prognosis and prolonged postoperative survival.

AB  - Ranched southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii were fed baitfishes supplemented with vitamins (predominantly E and C) or vitamins and immunostimulants, nucleotides and ?-glucans, over 12 weeks after transfer and monitored for enhancement in immune response, health and performance through their 19 week grow-out period. Fish from two different tows were sampled separately at three different sampling points: at transfer to grow-out pontoons, at 8 weeks post-transfer and at harvest, 19 weeks post-transfer. Lysozyme activity was enhanced during vitamin supplementation compared to control fish. Performance (i.e. survival, condition index and crude fat), health (i.e. blood plasma variables including pH, osmolality, cortisol, lactate and glucose) and alternative complement activity were not commonly improved through diet supplementation. There were some tow-specific improvements in performance through vitamin supplementation including survival, selected parasite prevalence and intensity, and alternative complement activity. Immunostimulant supplementation also showed a tow-specific improvement in plasma cortisol level. Tow-specific responses may suggest that life history, previous health condition and husbandry can affect the success of vitamin and immunostimulant enhancement of immune response, health and performance of ranched T. maccoyii.

AB  - Researchers have illustrated the deleterious psychological effects that racial discrimination has exerted on Black Americans. The resulting racial stress and trauma (RST) from experiences with discrimination has been linked to negative wellness outcomes and trajectories for Black youth and families. Racial socialization (RS)?defined as the verbal and nonverbal messages that families use to communicate race to their children?can be a cultural strength and has been associated with positive outcomes in Black youth. Furthermore, the Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST) encourages the frequent and competent use of RS between family members to cope with the negative impact of RST. Guided by RECAST, the purpose of this article is to describe the development of the Engaging, Managing, and Bonding through Race (EMBRace) intervention targeting the RS practices between Black adolescents and families. The authors explore current research on RST, discuss why traditional coping models for stress are inadequate for racially specific stressors, highlight RECAST as a burgeoning racial coping and socialization model, and describe how RS can be used as a tool to intervene within Black families. This is followed by a detailed description of the development and use of the EMBRace intervention which seeks to reduce RST through RS psychoeducation and practice, stress management, and the promotion of bonding in Black families. This article aims to serve as an example of a culturally relevant RS intervention for Black families who may benefit from clinical treatment for psychological distress from racially discriminatory encounters.

AB  - In the context of relationship trauma, partners' reactive patterns of engagement can disrupt and derail attempts at relationship correction and healing. A circumplex typology of couple patterns of engagement in relational trauma context is defined in terms of partners' underlying views of self in relation to other (VSIRO). VSIRO is conceptualized along a continuum anchored at opposite poles by inflated (self-aggrandizing) versus collapsed (self-abnegating) VSIRO, with a balanced (egalitarian) VSIRO, characterized by accountability and forbearance, as the target position. The circumplex model delineates four problematic couple configurations?a dejected couple, a taker?enabler couple, an ultimate fighting couple, and a debtor?collector couple. Where problematic engagement occurs, therapists need to reshape couple engagement toward the balanced, egalitarian position prior to relational trauma work. Clinical vignettes depict these couples and springboard an analysis of unique needs and interventions associated with each couple configuration. Reshaping couple patterns of engagement using a circumplex model of couple configurations is an essential prerequisite to effective and ethical relational trauma work.

AB  - Human skeletal remains of sixteen individuals found at Dibba al-Hisn in the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE) are analysed with regard to standard anthropological criteria. They represent the poorly known pre-Islamic period of the first centuries AD. Remains of at least fifteen individuals were recovered from a semi-subterranean grave-chamber together with rich archaeological grave-goods. An additional, almost complete skeleton was found in the open area near the chamber. While the size and nature of the sample prevent demographic analyses, skeletal features studied with the help of macro- and microscopic as well as radiographic methods provide details on individual life histories and living conditions, as well as mortuary habits and taphonomic processes. Of special interest is a case of intentional tooth mutilation as well as two cases of skull trauma apparently caused by violent inter-personal conflict. The results of the analysis of the faunal remains from the grave-chamber and its surroundings are presented in an appendix.

AB  - Abstract Mycotic keratitis (an infection of the cornea) is an important ocular infection, especially in young male outdoor workers. There are two frequent presentations: keratitis due to filamentous fungi (Fusarium, Aspergillus, phaeohyphomycetes and Scedosporium apiospermum are frequent causes) and keratitis due to yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans and other Candida species). In the former, trauma is usually the sole predisposing factor, although previous use of corticosteroids and contact lens wear are gaining importance as risk factors; in the latter, there is usually some systemic or local (ocular) defect. The clinical presentation and clinical features may suggest a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis; increasingly, in vivo (non-invasive) imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography) are also being used for diagnosis. However, microbiological investigations, particularly direct microscopic examination and culture of corneal scrape or biopsy material, still form the cornerstone of diagnosis. In recent years, the PCR has gained prominence as a diagnostic aid for mycotic keratitis, being used to complement microbiological methods; more importantly, this molecular method permits rapid specific identification of the aetiological agent. Although various antifungal compounds have been used for therapy, management of this condition (particularly if deep lesions occur) continues to be problematic; topical natamycin and, increasingly, voriconazole (given by various routes) are key therapeutic agents. Therapeutic surgery, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, is needed when medical therapy fails. Increased awareness of the importance of this condition is likely to spur future research initiatives.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess health and musculoskeletal function in survivors of pediatric sarcomas. Patients and Methods Thirty-two individuals treated for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), or non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NR-STS) with multi-modality therapy were enrolled on this cross-sectional study. Median age at the time of therapy was 15.4 years (range 7.1?34.2), median age at the time of analysis was 37.4 years (17.5?55.4), and median duration of time elapsed from completion of therapy was 17.3 years (2.9?32.6). Participants underwent assessments of musculoskeletal functioning, cardiac function, metabolic and lipid analyses, renal and gonadal function, and psychological evaluation. Results This cohort of sarcoma survivors shows expected locoregional limitations in function of the area affected by sarcoma, and impaired global musculoskeletal functioning as evidenced by limited endurance and limited overall activity levels. The cohort also demonstrated substantial rates of cardiac dysfunction, elevated body fat index, hyperlipidemia, chronic psychological distress, and infertility in men (76%) and premature menopause (49%) in women. Conclusion Sarcoma survivors demonstrate diminished locoregional and global musculoskeletal functioning which likely limit occupational opportunities and socioeconomic health. In addition, the combination of diminished cardiac reserve, limited activity levels, and lipid dysregulation in sarcoma survivors suggests that this population is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, even many years following completion of sarcoma therapy. Sarcoma survivors may benefit from life long follow-up for cardiovascular disease and from occupational counseling upon completion of therapy. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2007;48:192?199.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the perioperative findings and outcome of dogs undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the management of pyothorax. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?14). Methods Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. Results Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n?=?2), migrating plant material (n?=?2), and idiopathic (n?=?10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved. One patient had recurrence of a pyothorax requiring revision surgery 17 months postoperatively. Conclusion VATS allows minimally invasive treatment of uncomplicated canine pyothorax. Preoperative thoracic CT may help identify candidates for VATS among dogs with pyothorax.

The adjusted participation rate was similar in cases and controls (64%), and 131 cases and 196 controls finally participated in the study. RESULTS:?Compared with the controls, the cases were more likely to report that their teeth felt as though they did not fit together properly [odds ratio (OR) 8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6?13] and report history of facial trauma (OR 3, 95% CI 2?6). Both diurnal and nocturnal grinding were significantly associated with PDS, and individuals who reported grinding their teeth both during the day and at night had a risk of 6; 95% CI 3?13 for PDS compared with those who did not. A history of orthodontic treatment, having any dentures, having missing teeth, use of chewing gum or biting the fingernails did not show any relationship with PDS. People who took medication for the bowels had a higher risk of PDS (OR 2, 95% CI 1?4). Participants with frequent headaches had a threefold increase in risk of having PDS (OR 3, 95% CI 2?5) while having pain in parts of the body other than the head was associated with an OR of 3 (95% CI 2?5). An increased propensity to have PDS was seen in those individuals with higher levels of psychological distress (OR 3; 95% CI 1?4 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001) and sleep disturbance (OR 5; 95% CI 2?94 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001). Aspects of illness behaviour, such as disease conviction (OR 4; 95% CI 2?9 in the highest category) and perception of illness (0.3; 95% CI 0.2?0.5) were associated with PDS. The result for the denial scale became statistically significant after adjustment for age and gender (2; 95% CI 1?3). CONCLUSIONS:?The current case?control study provides complementary epidemiological information on oro-facial pain (OFP) and supports a multifactorial aetiology of PDS, with factors from many domains, including local mechanical factors, psychological and co-morbidities. People with PDS were characterized by frequent headaches, history of facial trauma, teeth grinding, sleep problems, pain elsewhere in the body and high levels of psychological distress. From the results of current study and available evidence it seems inappropriate to consider PDS in isolation and future research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach to OFP.

AB  - A five-month-old female Jack Russell terrier was presented for investigation of acute lethargy, anorexia, coughing, respiratory distress and weakness. Examination findings included cyanosis, a grade 3 of 6 systolic heart murmur and prolonged capillary refill time. Radiography and echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure. Indirect measurement of the systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated pressures over 100 mmHg. Despite treatment the patient died. Post-mortem examination did not identify a congenital cardiovascular anomaly. Histopathology confirmed acute necrotising pulmonary arteritis and immunohistochemistry failed to identify any immune complex or complement deposition.

AB  - Abstract The development of an infection is a major complication for some patients with implanted biomaterials. Whether the material or surface composition of the used biomaterial influences infection has not been directly compared for key biomaterials currently in use in human patients. We conducted a thorough in vitro and in vivo investigation using titanium (Ti) and polyether?ether?ketone (PEEK) as both commercially available and as modified equivalents (surface polished Ti, and oxygen plasma treated PEEK). Complement activation and cytokine secretion of cell of the immune system was assessed in vitro for all materials in the absence and presence of bacterial stimulants. In a follow-up in vivo study, we monitored bacterial infection associated with clinically available and standard Ti and PEEK inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. Complement activation was affected by material choice in the absence of bacterial stimulation, although the material based differences were largely lost upon bacterial stimulation. In the in vivo study, the bacterial burden, histological response and cytokine secretion suggests that there is no significant difference between both PEEK and Ti. In conclusion, the underlying material has a certain impact in the absence of bacterial stimulation, however, in the presence of bacterial stimulation, bacteria seem to dictate the responses in a manner that overshadows the influence of material surface properties. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The atrocities of war have detrimental effects on the development and mental health of children that have been documented since World War II. To date, a considerable amount of knowledge about various aspects of this problem has been accumulated, including the ways in which trauma impacts child mental health and development, as well as intervention techniques, and prevention methods. Considering the large populations of civilians that experience the trauma of war, it is timely to review existing literature, summarize approaches for helping war-affected children, and suggest future directions for research and policy.

AB  - Background Workers' compensation (WC) data traditionally provides information to stakeholders on work-related disabling injuries. It is important to complement this with information on serious threat to life (TTL) injury, which is the focus of this paper. Methods In this cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study, based on New Zealand's WC data linked to hospital discharge data, TTL was measured using the ICD10-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS); ICISS?â¤?0.941 was used to define serious TTL injury. Results During 2002?2004, there was an average of 368 serious TTL work-related injury cases annually. The distribution of these injuries was very different from those traditionally found using WC data to describe disabling injury. For example, for serious TTL injury the main injury types included traumatic brain injury, whereas for disabling injury it was sprains and dislocations. Conclusions The method presented provides the opportunity for government agencies to produce a national description of the epidemiology of serious TTL work-related injuries. Am. J. Ind.

AB  - Purpose:? The objective was to investigate the association between corneal sensitivity and established measures of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Methods:? Corneal sensitivity was measured in 93 individuals with diabetes, 146 diabetic individuals without neuropathy and 61 control individuals without diabetes or neuropathy using a non-contact corneal aesthesiometer at the baseline visit of a five-year longitudinal natural history study of DPN. The correlation between corneal sensitivity and established measures of neuropathy was estimated and multi-dimensional scaling was used to represent similarities and dissimilarities between variables. Results:? The corneal sensitivity threshold was significantly correlated with a majority of established measures of DPN. Correlation coefficients ranged from -0.32 to 0.26. Using multi-dimensional scaling, non-contact corneal aesthesiometry was closer to the neuropathy disability score, diabetic neuropathy symptom score and Neuropad and most dissimilar to electrophysiological parameters and quantitative sensory testing. Conclusion:? Corneal sensitivity, although not strongly related, is associated with other functional measures of DPN and might provide a useful adjunct in identifying functional loss of small nerve fibre integrity.

AB  - Summary? Findings from human experimental studies suggest that mastication positively influences cognitive function. The participants in those studies were relatively young. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between the functional status of the masticatory system, episodic memory, and executive functions in elderly people. The participants, elderly people living independently at home, were divided into two groups. One group had a full complement of natural teeth (n?=?19) and the other group had full dentures (n?=?19). The functional status of the masticatory system was assessed by measuring mandibular excursions (i.e. the distances over which the mandible can move in the open, lateral, and forward directions), bite force, number of occluding pairs and complaints of the masticatory system (facial pain, headaches/migraine). Executive functions and episodic memory were assessed by neuropsychological tests. Backward regression analysis showed that only in the group of elderly people with full dentures, 22% of executive functions were predicted by complaints of the masticatory system and 19Â·4% of episodic memory was predicted by masticatory performance (composed of mandibular excursions and bite force). The conclusion of this study is that only in older persons with full dentures the relationship between mastication, episodic memory, and executive function becomes evident when the functional status of the masticatory system decreases.
