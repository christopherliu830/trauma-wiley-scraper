AB  - Abstract Objective: Effective adjuvant treatments proven to prolong survival for breast cancer exist, yet many women, particularly minority women, do not receive them. Little work has focused on improving the quality of, and reducing racial disparities in, cancer treatment. We describe the application of a conceptual model to direct, design, and implement trials to reduce underuse of effective adjuvant breast cancer treatments. Methods: Content analysis of extensive interviews and focus groups was used to construct a framework of patient, physician, and system-level reasons for underuse. Use of the model then directed development of targeted interventions aimed at ameliorating underlying causes. Results: The process of identifying patient, physician, and system-level reasons for underuse involved patients, surgeons, surgeon's office staff, and providers of patient assistance. Engaging these individuals both informed the design of our multi-focused interventions and generated interest in trial participation. All 38 surgeons in six unaffiliated institutions and all 25 patient assistance programs approached agreed to participate in the intervention trials. Interpretation: Identifying reasons for underuse by interviewing patients, physicians, physician office staff, and allied care providers about episodes in which needed care failed to occur helps engage key individuals, and can inform the design and implementation of interventions targeting barriers to delivering high quality breast cancer care to all.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteochondrosis is an ischemic chondronecrosis of epiphyseal growth cartilage that results in focal failure of endochondral ossification and osteochondritis dissecans at specific sites in the epiphyses of humans and animals, including horses. The upstream events leading to the focal ischemia remain unknown. The epiphyseal growth cartilage matrix is composed of proteoglycan and collagen macromolecules and encases its vascular tree in canals. The matrix undergoes major dynamic changes in early life that could weaken it biomechanically and predispose it to focal trauma and vascular failure. Subregions in neonatal foal femoral epiphyses (n?=?10 osteochondrosis predisposed; n?=?6 control) were assessed for proteoglycan and collagen structure/content employing 3T quantitative MRI (3T qMRI: T1? and T2 maps). Site-matched validations were made with histology, immunohistochemistry, and second-harmonic microscopy. Growth cartilage T1? and T2 relaxation times were significantly increased (p?<?0.002) within the proximal third of the trochlea, a site predisposed to osteochondrosis, when compared with other regions. However, this was observed in both control and osteochondrosis predisposed specimens. Microscopic evaluation of this region revealed an expansive area with low proteoglycan content and a hypertrophic-like appearance on second-harmonic microscopy. We speculate that this matrix structure and composition, though physiological, may weaken the epiphyseal growth cartilage biomechanically in focal regions and could enhance the risk of vascular failure with trauma leading to osteochondrosis. However, additional investigations are now required to confirm this. 3T qMRI will be useful for future non-invasive longitudinal studies to track the osteochondrosis disease trajectory in animals and humans. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Disasters are unpredictable and frequently lead to chaotic post-disaster situations, creating numerous methodologic challenges for the study of the mental health consequences of disasters. In this commentary, we expand on some of the issues addressed by Kessler and colleagues, largely focusing on the particular challenges of (a) defining, finding, and sampling populations of interest after disasters and (b) designing studies in ways that maximize the potential for valid inference. We discuss these challenges ? drawing on specific examples ? and suggest potential approaches to each that may be helpful as a guide for future work. We further suggest research directions that may be most helpful in moving the field forward. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract In this current study, a novel multilayer porous composite scaffold was fabricated with chitosan (CS), silk fibrin (SF) and nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA). Scanning electron microscope was utilized to detect the characteristics of the composed scaffold. Rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSC) were loaded onto the CS/SF/n-HA scaffold and cultured in a bioreactor under an on?off dynamic compression (10% compressive strain, 0.5 Hz, [2 h action?+?4 h pause]/cycle, 4 cycles/day). Metabolism of the loaded rBMSC was assessed through CCK-8 test. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot were applied to assess the chondrogenic differentiation of the seeded cells. Compressive modulus of the cell/scaffold constructs was analyzed. Additionally, a pig model was employed to evaluate the effect of the tissue-engineered cartilage on repairing of cartilage defect. Results showed that the four layers within the scaffold were tightly connected without gaps between porous interfaces of the layers. Scaffold porosity was 92.20%?±?1.30%. The cyclic compression upregulated chondrogenesis markers (Aggrecan, Sox-9, and collagen II). Increased compressive modulus of the cell/scaffold complex was detected after dynamic compression. The pig bone marrow stromal cells/scaffold complex exposed to cyclic compression presented most favorable reparative effect on the mini pig femoral condyle cartilage defects. Our study suggested that the on?off dynamic compression might be a promising approach to fabricate tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Rehabilitation evaluation of orthopedic conditions includes six components: capturing subjective data, obtaining objective findings, completing a problem list, developing an assessment, building a treatment plan, and re-evaluating for treatment efficacy. Capturing subjective data occurs with the client and includes the client's subjective perception of the patient's current condition, history of the present injury, the client's goals for their animal, and a thorough medical history from the referring veterinarian including diagnostics and medications. Objective data are then obtained during the hands-on portion of the evaluation and includes posture, function, strength, gait, palpation, passive range of motion, muscle flexibility, clearing the spine, joint play, and special tests. Findings from each of these areas are placed on a problem list. The problem list is critically analyzed by the therapist to develop a working hypothesis, an assessment, that explains all the findings on the problem list. The assessment may be an expansion of the primary orthopedic diagnosis, including the sequelae of the primary diagnosis, and it may also include underlying physical limitations that may not be associated with the primary orthopedic condition. To build the treatment plan, the problem list is prioritized starting with pain, then primary tissue type injured, followed by sequelae. The treatment plan is then executed and may include modalities, manual therapies, and therapeutic exercise, each of which follows physiologically based levels of frequency, intensity, and duration. Treatment efficacy is then re-evaluated within a session and over a course of treatment to ensure treatment effectiveness. Treatments may be modified within a treatment session or over the course of a treatment plan. When re-evaluation reveals the patient has reached the rehabilitation goals, they are discharged to a health maintenance program.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a cognitive insight on stress and post-traumatic growth related to hydrometeorological extreme events. The goal is to better assess both the vulnerability and impact generated by this climate change issue in order to offer preparedness, response, and post-crisis solutions for individuals, societies, and ecosystems in the European Union. The chapter begins by discussing the concept of resilience and its evolution in order to demonstrate its relationship with ecological, social, and psychological issues and its buffer against traumatic developments. It outlines the strong relation between ecosystem degradation and socio-economic status by analysing humanity's negative ecological impact and how this increases vulnerability to hydrometeorological extremes. In fact, disasters like tsunami and hurricane Katrina have brought mental health issues into the limelight. The consequences of climate change can affect nearly every aspect of human life, including physical and mental health, in the form of dysfunctional responses.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Owner informed consent was obtained for all horses in the study.

AB  - Abstract In this series we address important topics for clinicians who participate in research or are considering research as part of their career path in emergency medicine. While much emergency research is successfully done by clinicians without a research higher degree (RHD), undertaking a master's degree or doctorate allows a research topic to be pursued in greater depth. It also provides a solid basis for a future research career in terms of research quality, advanced skills, academic progression and track record, as well as eligibility for grants and RHD supervision. The decision to undertake a RHD is not an easy one, and requires consideration of the time and cost involved, as well as the impact on a clinician's life plans. However, the expertise provided through a RHD often ultimately complements clinical training and establishes an excellent foundation for future research and career. This article provides an overview of RHDs and what to consider before embarking on one.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, special considerations, and prognosis of gastric foreign body retrieval in dogs and cats, along with a few complication examples. Gastric foreign bodies are a common emergency in veterinary medicine and require appropriate case management for the most successful outcomes. A standard gastroduodenoscope is utilized to visualize the foreign body. A wide variety of instruments including baskets, nets, graspers, snares and forceps can be utilized for retrieval. Every endoscopic foreign body retrieval should include a duodenoscopy, as there could be an additional foreign body in the duodenum. The most frustrating aspect of gastric foreign body retrieval involves resistance that is encountered at the lower esophageal stricture (LES) that continually dislodges the foreign body from engagement. This can be minimized by selecting and instrument that complements the foreign body and provides the most rigid, firm grasp possible, minimizing slipping.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.
