AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - The author, following André Green, maintains that the two most original psychoanalytic thinkers since Freud were Donald Winnicott and Jacques Lacan. Winnicott, it has been said, introduced the comic tradition into psychoanalysis, while Lacan sustained Freud?s tragic/ironic vision. Years of mutual avoidance by their followers (especially of Lacan by Anglophone clinicians) has arguably diminished understanding of the full spectrum of psychoanalytic thought. The author outlines some basic constructs of Winnicott and of Lacan, including: their organizing tropes of selfhood versus subjectivity, their views of the ?mirror stage?, and their definitions of the aims of treatment. While the ideas of Winnicott and Lacan appear at some points complementary, the goal is not to integrate them into one master discourse, but rather to bring their radically different paradigms into provocative contact. A clinical vignette is offered to demonstrate concepts from Lacan and Winnicott, illustrating what it might mean to think and teach in the potential space between them.

AB  - Summary Koebner?s phenomenon (KP) has been observed in a number of skin diseases, including vitiligo. Its clinical significance in vitiligo with respect to disease activity and course is still debatable, while its relevance for surgical techniques has been demonstrated in some reports. We present a literature review on the currently known facts about KP in vitiligo, including details of clinical, experimental, and histopathological changes. The consensus view is that there are still no methods to define and assess KP in vitiligo. A new classification is proposed to allow an evaluation of KP in daily practice or in experimental studies. However, many unanswered questions still remain after redefining KP in patients with vitiligo. Active research focusing on KP in vitiligo may not only provide unexpected clues in the pathogenesis of vitiligo but also help to tailor novel therapies against this chronic and often psychologically devastating skin disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - SUMMARY When IAT is used, the patient's shed blood is collected continuously from the wound site during surgery. The salvaged red cells are stored in a dedicated reservoir and subsequently processed by cell separation (continuous centrifugation), washed with saline, concentrated and retransfused to the patient. In the context of perioperative blood saving strategies, IAT has gained standard-of-care status in many surgical procedures as it is especially cost-effective when the anticipated intraoperative blood loss is likely to exceed 1000 mL (major orthopedic, cardiac, vascular and emergency trauma surgery). IAT is not primarily recommended for cancer surgery or whenever the operative field is contaminated. Intraoperative plasmapheresis (IP) is used in cardiac surgery to minimize coagulation deficiencies caused by the traumatizing effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on platelets. A substantial amount of the patient's circulating platelets is withdrawn prior to heparinization and initiation of CPB. The collected autologous platelet-rich plasma is then stored at room temperature, preserving platelet function and plasmatic coagulation factors, and retransfused to the patient after heparin reversal. There is controversy about the actual blood saving benefit of IP, but this method may be effective in complicated procedures precipitating high blood loss and long CPB times. In addition, IP may be used when other autologous whole blood harvesting techniques are not an option.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - The usefulness of current psychiatric classification, which is based on ICD/DSM categorical diagnoses, remains questionable. A promising alternative has been put forward as the ?transdiagnostic? approach. This is expected to cut across existing categorical diagnoses and go beyond them, to improve the way we classify and treat mental disorders. This systematic review explores whether self-defining transdiagnostic research meets such high expectations. A multi-step Web of Science literature search was performed according to an a priori protocol, to identify all studies that used the word ?transdiagnostic? in their title, up to May 5, 2018. Empirical variables which indexed core characteristics were extracted, complemented by a bibliometric and conceptual analysis. A total of 111 studies were included. Most studies were investigating interventions, followed by cognition and psychological processes, and neuroscientific topics. Their samples ranged from 15 to 91,199 (median 148) participants, with a mean age from 10 to more than 60 (median 33) years. There were several methodological inconsistencies relating to the definition of the gold standard (DSM/ICD diagnoses), of the outcome measures and of the transdiagnostic approach. The quality of the studies was generally low and only a few findings were externally replicated. The majority of studies tested transdiagnostic features cutting across different diagnoses, and only a few tested new classification systems beyond the existing diagnoses. About one fifth of the studies were not transdiagnostic at all, because they investigated symptoms and not disorders, a single disorder, or because there was no diagnostic information. The bibliometric analysis revealed that transdiagnostic research largely restricted its focus to anxiety and depressive disorders. The conceptual analysis showed that transdiagnostic research is grounded more on rediscoveries than on true innovations, and that it is affected by some conceptual biases. To date, transdiagnostic approaches have not delivered a credible paradigm shift that can impact classification and clinical care. Practical ?TRANSD?iagnostic recommendations are proposed here to guide future research in this field.

AB  - Key points Optic nerve axons get less excitable with warming. F-fibre latency does not shorten at temperatures above 30°C. Action potential amplitude falls when the Na+-pump is blocked, an effect speeded by warming. Diuretics reduce the rate of action potential fall in the presence of ouabain. Our data are consistent with electroneutral entry of Na+ occurring in axons and contributing to setting the resting potential. Abstract Raising the temperature of optic nerve from room temperature to near physiological has effects on the threshold, refractoriness and superexcitability of the shortest latency (fast, F) nerve fibres, consistent with hyperpolarization. The temperature dependence of peak impulse latency was weakened at temperatures above 30°C suggesting a temperature-sensitive process that slows impulse propagation. The amplitude of the supramaximal compound action potential gets larger on warming, whereas in the presence of bumetanide and amiloride (blockers of electroneutral Na+ movement), the action potential amplitude consistently falls. This suggests a warming-induced hyperpolarization that is reduced by blocking electroneutral Na+ movement. In the presence of ouabain, the action potential collapses. This collapse is speeded by warming, and exposure to bumetanide and amiloride slows the temperature-dependent amplitude decline, consistent with a warming-induced increase in electroneutral Na+ entry. Blocking electroneutral Na+ movement is predicted to be useful in the treatment of temperature-dependent symptoms under conditions with reduced safety factor (Uhthoff's phenomenon) and provide a route to neuroprotection.

AB  - Although disasters remain statistically rare events, the last decade has seen an increase in the number of major incidents affecting the UK. Concurrent with this increase has come clinical data, showing how psychosocial health may be adversely affected by disasters. There is good evidence that many victims of traumatic stress suffer from depression and suicidal behaviour; two of the English Department of Health?s stated objectives for reduction in their publication, Health of the Nation. The objectives of this paper were to give the Department of Health a survey of the current provision of psychosocial care after disasters at English regional health authority level and to make recommendations regarding good practice in the care of victims of trauma by healthcare professionals. The methodology used was varied. Letters were sent to all the regional public health departments asking for information about the psychological care element within their major incident plans. The findings showed that the provision for psychosocial care following a disaster in England is extremely variable and although there are undoubtedly regions with considerable expertise and interest, there are also regions where provision appears to be minimal or non-existent. The provision of specialist traumatic stress services at regional level is recommended.

AB  - Abstract Background Skeletal muscle is central to locomotion and metabolic homeostasis. The laboratory worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been developed into a genomic model for assessing the genes and signals that regulate muscle development and protein degradation. Past work has identified a receptor tyrosine kinase signalling network that combinatorially controls autophagy, nerve signal to muscle to oppose proteasome-based degradation, and extracellular matrix-based signals that control calpain and caspase activation. The last two discoveries were enabled by following up results from a functional genomic screen of known regulators of muscle. Recently, a screen of the kinome requirement for muscle homeostasis identified roughly 40% of kinases as required for C. elegans muscle health; 80 have identified human orthologues and 53 are known to be expressed in skeletal muscle. To complement this kinome screen, here, we screen most of the phosphatases in C. elegans. Methods RNA interference was used to knockdown phosphatase-encoding genes. Knockdown was first conducted during development with positive results also knocked down only in fully developed adult muscle. Protein homeostasis, mitochondrial structure, and sarcomere structure were assessed using transgenic reporter proteins. Genes identified as being required to prevent protein degradation were also knocked down in conditions that blocked proteasome or autophagic degradation. Genes identified as being required to prevent autophagic degradation were also assessed for autophagic vesicle accumulation using another transgenic reporter. Lastly, bioinformatics were used to look for overlap between kinases and phosphatases required for muscle homeostasis, and the prediction that one phosphatase was required to prevent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was assessed by western blot. Results A little over half of all phosphatases are each required to prevent abnormal development or maintenance of muscle. Eighty-six of these phosphatases have known human orthologues, 57 of which are known to be expressed in human skeletal muscle. Of the phosphatases required to prevent abnormal muscle protein degradation, roughly half are required to prevent increased autophagy. Conclusions A significant portion of both the kinome and phosphatome are required for establishing and maintaining C. elegans muscle health. Autophagy appears to be the most commonly triggered form of protein degradation in response to disruption of phosphorylation-based signalling. The results from these screens provide measurable phenotypes for analysing the combined contribution of kinases and phosphatases in a multi-cellular organism and suggest new potential regulators of human skeletal muscle for further analysis.

High-affinity glutamate uptake was studied in platelets from 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 multi-infarct dementia patients, and 35 age-matched normal controls; it was decreased by 40% in platelets from Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls and with multi-infarct dementia patients. Platelet glutamate uptake could be used as peripheral marker of glutamatergic involvement and as adjunctive diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. Ann Neurol 2000;47:641?643

AB  - Objectives. The claim that topics in children's drawings convey the children's emotional attitude towards those topics was investigated. Design. The influence of an emotional topic (neutral man, friendly and enemy soldier) and trauma group (child with father or father killed in war) was examined on the size of the topics and their placement relative to a self-portrait drawing. Methods. Sixty Croatian children drew a man, followed on a separate page by either (a) a Croatian soldier, (b) an enemy soldier or (c) a second drawing of a man. The child's self-portrait drawing was placed on each page. Results. There were no significant main or interaction effects on size or placement of topic. Conclusions. There are unlikely to be reliable features of drawings that portray the child's emotional attitude towards the topic drawn.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.
