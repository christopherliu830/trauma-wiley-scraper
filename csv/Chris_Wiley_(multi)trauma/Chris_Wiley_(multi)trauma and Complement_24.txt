AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Summary This chapter commences with the management of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). It is recommended to consider vasculitis in the patient with systemic symptoms and headache or evidence of organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is based on the pattern of organ injury, characteristic features on imaging, the size of involved blood vessels and histological findings on biopsy. GCA usually presents with new-onset headache in older people, associated with constitutional upset; it carries a significant risk (20-30%) of visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy, and so needs urgent assessment and treatment. Typical presentations of acute vasculitis include headache, neurological presentation with stroke, hearing loss, and haemoptysis. With the exception of suspected GCA, early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy is rarely needed, and should not be given unless advised by a specialist. The chapter also presents information on considerations in suspected GCA and new presentation of suspected systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Summary A low platelet count is a frequently encountered haematological abnormality in patients treated in intensive treatment units (ITUs). Although severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ? 109/l) can be associated with bleeding, even moderate-degree thrombocytopenia is associated with organ failure and adverse prognosis. The aetiology for thrombocytopenia in ITU is often multifactorial and correcting one aetiology may not normalise the low platelet count. The classical view for thrombocytopenia in this setting is consumption associated with thrombin-mediated platelet activation, but other concepts, including platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and leucocytes, platelet aggregation by increased von Willebrand factor release, red cell damage and histone release, and platelet destruction by the complement system, have recently been described. The management of severe thrombocytopenia is platelet transfusion in the presence of active bleeding or invasive procedure, but the risk-benefit of prophylactic platelet transfusions in this setting is uncertain. In this review, the incidence and mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITU, its prognostic significance and the impact on organ function is discussed. A practical approach based on the authors' experience is described to guide management of a critically ill patient who develops thrombocytopenia.

AB  - Abstract We examined social role functioning and depressive symptoms of young adults who were abused as children in data from a longitudinal community sample. Sexually abused women and men were more depressed during their senior year of high school, and this difference was more pronounced 2 years later. We then examined a mediational model to determine whether social functioning explained the course of depressive symptoms over this transitional period. Focusing only on young women, for whom the prevalence of abuse was much higher, results indicated that two-thirds of the effect of abuse on depressive symptoms was explained by experiences and choices in the domains of work, education and intimate relationships. Having less supportive intimate relationships and lower rates of attendance at 4-year colleges were particularly important. Findings reveal the key role played by early adult interpersonal and occupational development in perpetuating the mental health impact of childhood trauma.

AB  - Abstract Aim Over the past several decades, there has been a growing research interest in the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This review aims to summarize evidence in support of this relationship, to discuss biological mechanisms that might explain it, and to explore the translational impact by examining evidence from trials of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of schizophrenia. Methods This narrative review of the literature summarizes evidence from observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and to discuss associated implications for treatment. Results Epidemiological evidence and animal models support a hypothesis of maternal immune activation during pregnancy, which increases the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. Several biomarker studies have found associations between classical pro-inflammatory cytokines and schizophrenia. The precise biological mechanisms by which inflammatory processes might contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain unclear, but likely include the actions of microglia and the complement system. Importantly, several trials provide evidence that certain anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents show beneficial effects in the treatment of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is a need for further precision-focused basic science and translational research. Conclusions Increasing our understanding of the role of inflammation in schizophrenia will enable novel opportunities for therapeutic and preventative interventions that are informed by the underlying pathogenesis of this complex disorder.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.

Radiological changes included loss of joint space and proliferation of new bone around the joints. Resection of part of the zygoma, condyle and vertical ramus resulted in freeing of the joint and a return to normal function.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? To describe the derivation of recent status scores (RSSs) for version 6 of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI-6). Design? 118 ASI-6 recent status items were subjected to nonparametric item response theory (NIRT) analyses followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Generalizability and concurrent validity of the derived scores were determined. Setting and participants? A total of 607 recent admissions to variety of substance abuse treatment programs constituted the derivation sample; a subset (n?=?252) comprised the validity sample. Measurements? The ASI-6 interview and a validity battery of primarily self-report questionnaires that included at least one measure corresponding to each of the seven ASI domains were administered. Findings? Nine summary scales describing recent status that achieved or approached both high scalability and reliability were derived; one scale for each of six areas (medical, employment/finances, alcohol, drug, legal, psychiatric) and three scales for the family/social area. Intercorrelations among the RSSs also supported the multi-dimensionality of the ASI-6. Concurrent validity analyses yielded strong evidence supporting the validity of six of the RSSs (medical, alcohol, drug, employment, family/social problems, psychiatric). Evidence was weaker for the legal, family/social support and child problems RSSs. Generalizability analyses of the scales to males versus females and whites versus blacks supported the comparability of the findings, with slight exceptions. Conclusions? The psychometric analyses to derive Addiction Severity Index version 6 recent status scores support the multi-dimensionality of the Addiction Severity Index version 6 (i.e. the relative independence of different life functioning areas), consistent with research on earlier editions of the instrument. In general, the Addiction Severity Index version 6 scales demonstrate acceptable scalability, reliability and concurrent validity. While questions remain about the generalizability of some scales to population subgroups, the overall findings coupled with updated and more extensive content in the Addiction Severity Index version 6 support its use in clinical practice and research.

AB  - Summary Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and injury and are critical for antimicrobial host defense. Through the generation of reactive oxidants, activation of granular constituents and neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils target microbes and prevent their dissemination. While these pathways are beneficial in the context of trauma and infection, their off-target effects in the context of tumor are variable. Tumor-derived factors have been shown to reprogram the marrow, skewing toward the expansion of myelopoiesis. This can result in stimulation of both neutrophilic leukocytosis and the release of immature granulocytic populations that accumulate in circulation and in the tumor microenvironment. While activated neutrophils have been shown to kill tumor cells, there is growing evidence for neutrophil activation driving tumor progression and metastasis through a number of pathways, including stimulation of thrombosis and angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, and impairment of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. There is also growing appreciation of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, with distinct neutrophil populations promoting cancer control or progression. In addition to the effects of tumor on neutrophil responses, anti-neoplastic treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and growth factors, can influence neutrophil responses. Future directions for research are expected to result in more mechanistic knowledge of neutrophil biology in the tumor microenvironment that may be exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Background The increasing use of fresh blood group O whole blood in acute trauma medicine makes it important to reevaluate the issue of hemolytic reactions related to the transfusion of ABO-incompatible plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This review summarizes and evaluates published articles and case reports concerning hemolytic reactions in connection with the transfusion of group O whole blood or blood products to nongroup O recipients. Results In 1945-1986, 15 nonmilitary publications reported hemolytic transfusion reactions with group O blood/blood products. All patients recovered except for two fatalities. Late in World War II and during the Korean and Vietnam wars and onward in Iraq and Afghanistan only ?low anti-A, anti-B titer? group O whole blood has been used as universal blood. In spite of a large number of units transfused, there are no reports of hemolytic reactions. Twenty-five publications report hemolytic reactions after transfusion of group O platelets to nongroup O recipients. In all patients but one, the titer of the implicated A- or B-antibody was >100 (saline) or >400 (antiglobulin) and all cases with an infused volume of incompatible plasma <200?mL were related to anti-A or anti-B antiglobulin titers >1000. Conclusion In emergency lifesaving resuscitation, the risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions from transfusion of group O blood to nongroup O recipients constitutes risk that is outweighed by the benefits. A low titer of anti-A/B will minimize the risk for a hemolytic reaction, particularly if the screening is repeated after an immunization episode, e.g., blood transfusion, vaccination, or pregnancy.
