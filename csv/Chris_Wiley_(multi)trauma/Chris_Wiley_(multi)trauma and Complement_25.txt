AB  - Abstract Background Low back pain (LBP) is a widespread problem and the leading cause of disability worldwide. While the cause of LBP is multifactorial, several studies suggested that inflammatory mediators in damaged subchondral plates of degenerating discs may lead to chemical sensitization and mechanical stimulation, eventually causing pain. The goal of this study was to explore associations between such changes and LBP-related disability using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Methods Thirty-two patients diagnosed with nonspecific LBP and 24 healthy control subjects were studied with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCEMRI) MRI and T1r (spin?lattice relaxation in the rotating frame) acquisitions. DCEMRI enhancement in disc endplate regions and average T1? measurements in the nucleus pulposus were extracted. The LBP patients were grouped based on their Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores and associations between MRI measurements and ODI scores were analyzed. Results Significant associations were found between ODI scores and DCEMRI enhancement in the cartilaginous endplate regions of the most degenerated discs. ODI scores also correlated with T1? measurements in the nucleus pulposus of degenerating discs. Conclusions DCEMRI enhancement in the cartilaginous endplate regions and lower T1? measurements in the nucleus pulposus (NP) were associated with greater disability that is related to low back pain as reported on the ODI. This complements earlier reports suggesting a link between LBP and endplate degeneration. Further studies are needed to validate these findings. Significance Our findings indicated that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI signal enhancement in the cartilaginous endplate regions were associated with greater disability related to low back pain. This signal enhancement might be an indication of inflammatory changes in disc endplate regions. Therefore, advanced quantitative imaging techniques like the ones presented in this study might be needed to complement conventional radiological evaluations to identify the subset of patients who could potentially benefit from novel therapies directed towards treating the disc endplate regions.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and describe the extent and severity of periodontal disease and associated periodontal parameters in beagle dogs. Methods: A full-mouth, site-specific examination was performed in 98 beagle dogs. Focus was placed on clinical attachment loss, pocket depth and bleeding on probing. Results: The prevalence of clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm was 20 per cent in the one-year-old dogs, increasing to 84 per cent of the dogs aged more than three years. The number of sites affected with clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm showed a skewed distribution. The prevalence of clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 4 mm was only seven per cent. A probing pocket depth of 4+ mm was observed in 44 to 81 per cent of the dogs, depending on age. Also, the distribution of the number of deepened pockets/dog was skewed. The teeth most prone to clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm were the P2, the P3 and the P4 of the maxilla. The teeth most prone to pocket depth greater than equal to 4 mm were the maxillary canines. Clinical Significance: Periodontal disease in terms of clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm and pocket depth greater than equal to 4 mm is common in beagle dogs, but the major disease burden is carried by only a few dogs. The prevalence increases with increased age but is high already at the age of two years.

AB  - Abstract M-type (KCNQ2/3) K+ channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike-frequency adaptation, and hyper-excitatory states. However, plasticity of M-channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability-induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48?hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant-induced hyperexcitability at 48?hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper-excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2-mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7?days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain-slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M-current amplitudes 48?hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M-current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic?clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M-channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell-type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.

AB  - Aim.? This paper presents the findings of a staff survey conducted at a 350-bed acute care facility located on the periphery of Toronto, Canada. Background.? Toronto's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis resulted in trauma-like effects at hospitals hardest hit by the disease. A systematic examination of the impact on staff working in hospitals that saw relatively few cases, while maintaining the precautions associated with elevated alert levels, has not been undertaken. Methods.? A questionnaire was distributed for 1?month commencing 17 April 2003 and 300 completed responses were obtained (approximately one in six staff members). The data collected included demographic and occupational information, in addition to perceptions of SARS? impact on patient care, factors contributing to adverse impacts on patient care, working conditions, decision-making, communication and relations, sources of support, and the impact on workers? lives outside work. Items for these sections were developed by a multi-disciplinary team of health care workers and hospital administrators. Results.? In the absence of pre-SARS normative data for the survey, demographic and occupational variables were used to look for patterns of differences between relevant subgroups of respondents. Statistically significant differences were found for gender (73Â·9% women), nurses (24Â·7%) vs. others, doctors (20Â·3%) vs. others, older (40?years or older, 60Â·0%) vs. younger persons, emergency or intensive care unit workers (8Â·0%) vs. others, and those employed fewer years at the hospital (less than 5?years: 46Â·2%) vs. five or more years. These differences varied across the following domains: factors adversely affecting patients, communications, support, working conditions, decision-making and, to a lesser extent, impact on life outside work. While all groups found SARS stressful, nurses reported a greater impact on morale and job satisfaction. Nurses relied more on peer support than doctors, felt less informed and less involved in decision-making than doctors felt, and were more likely to report that infection control procedures were not strict enough. Conclusions.? The between-group differences and the pattern of these differences clearly illustrate the polarizing and stressful impact SARS had at a hospital with only a small number of probable or suspect cases. The clear differences between groups defined by demographics, professions and clinical roles suggest a subtle and pervasive secondary impact of the SARS outbreak, with repercussions health care facilities must contend with while maintaining increased levels of vigilance in the wake of SARS.

AB  - Crime generates external costs for individuals and social costs for nations. This entry reviews the dominant theoretical paradigms that underlie national estimates of the cost of crime and reviews the empirical methodologies that have been employed in the extant literature. The entry closes with a brief review of empirical estimates of the costs of crime to crime victims. In the United States, the cost of crime, narrowly construed, constitutes approximately 2% of gross domestic product (GDP), approximately double the amount of revenue generated by the education sector and half the amount of revenue produced by the US entertainment industry. Some estimates of the cost of crime are as large as 6% of GDP.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Objective To investigate the physiologic reactions after removal of 1st ovary and whether this is repeated during removal of the 2nd ovary in elective ovariohysterectomy. Study Design Prospective study. Animals Dogs (n?=?10). Methods Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine, carprofen, and methadone and anesthetized with propofol and isoflurane. Blood pressure, heart rate, and end-tidal isoflurane concentration were measured every minute. The effects of various events during surgery on physiologic variables were analyzed using mixed linear models. Blood and urine samples were collected before anesthesia, before incision, before and after removal of ovaries with a 15?minute pause between ovary removal, and after abdominal closure. Plasma vasopressin and urinary noradrenalin and creatinine concentrations were analyzed. Results The magnitude of blood pressure increase at removal of the 1st ovary was greater than for the 2nd ovary because of an elevation in baseline. Similarly, the heart rate increased at the removal of the 1st ovary but not at removal of the 2nd ovary. Plasma vasopressin concentration increased at removal of both ovaries. Urinary noradrenalin/creatinine ratio increased at anesthesia, removal of both ovaries, and was elevated at closure of the abdomen. End-tidal isoflurane concentration did not change. Blood pressure and vasopressin concentrations changed in parallel using z-scores for comparison. Conclusions Peak values for blood pressure, heart rate, plasma vasopressin concentration, and urinary noradrenalin/creatinine ratio did not differ between removals of the ovaries. Relative changes differed between repeated noxious stimuli, which should be considered in evaluation of methods at ovary removal.
