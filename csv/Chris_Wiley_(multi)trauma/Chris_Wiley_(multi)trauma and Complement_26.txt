AB  - Purpose In this MRI study, diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and T2* multiecho relaxometry were measured from the white matter (WM) of human brains and correlated with each other, with the aim of investigating the influence of magnetic-susceptibility (??H2O-TISSUE) on the contrast. Methods We focused our in vivo analysis on assessing the dependence of mean, axial, and radial kurtosis (MK, K?, K?), as well as DTI indices on ??H2O-TISSUE (quantified by T2*) between extracellular water and WM tissue molecules. Moreover, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were used to elucidate experimental data. Results A significant positive correlation was observed between K?, MK and R2*?=?1/T2*, suggesting that ??H2O-TISSUE could be a source of DKI contrast. In this view, K? and MK-map contrasts in human WM would not just be due to different restricted diffusion processes of compartmentalized water but also to local ??H2O-TISSUE. However, MC simulations show a strong dependence on microstructure rearrangement and a feeble dependence on ??H2O-TISSUE of DKI signal. Conclusion Our results suggests a concomitant and complementary existence of multi-compartmentalized diffusion process and ??H2O-TISSUE in DKI contrast that might explain why kurtosis contrast is more sensitive than DTI in discriminating between different tissues. However, more realistic numerical simulations are needed to confirm this statement. Magn Reson Med 73:2015?2024, 2015. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Foster parent training is a well-recognized component of providing quality care in child welfare. Well-trained foster parents can improve placement stability, reduce behavioural problems and encourage successful reunification or adoption. A review of the foster parent training programmes can provide a better understanding of the current state of foster parenting training and inform future practice and policy-making. This review examined published and unpublished research on foster parent training conducted from 1970 to 2014 and provided an overview of the structure and content of 22 foster parent training programmes. Common patterns in the content and structure of foster parent training programmes are identified and discussed, highlighting trends towards multi-session in-service training with eclectic content. The development of new training programmes with strong theoretical grounding that train foster parents on specific behavioural skills is recommended.

AB  - Damage to the central nervous system triggers rapid activation and specific migration of glial cells towards the lesion site. There, glial cells contribute heavily to secondary neuronal changes that take place after lesion. In an attempt to identify the molecular cues of glial activation following brain trauma we performed differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screenings from lesioned and control hippocampus. Here we report on the identification of the macrophage/microglia activation factor (MAF), a new membrane protein with seven putative transmembrane domains. Expression analysis revealed that MAF is predominantly expressed in microglial cells in the brain, and is upregulated following brain lesion. Overexpression of MAF in non-glial cells shows an intracellular codistribution with the lysosomal marker endosome/lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (lamp-1). Furthermore, MAF-transfected cells show that MAF is primarily associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and that this association can be disrupted by activation of protein kinase C-dependent pathways. In conclusion, these results imply that MAF is involved in the dynamics of lysosomal membranes associated with microglial activation following brain lesion.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is intended to rapidly assess patients when access to other diagnostic imaging modalities is limited. The advantage of POCUS is that clinicians can use real-time images rather than images recorded and reported by a sonographer or a radiologist, thus allowing immediate correlation of findings with signs and symptoms. Defining POCUS curricula appropriate to specific low resource settings will be important for targeted allocation of training resources. Bedside assessment of deep venous thrombosis is one of the most useful POCUS applications as it is easy to perform, and has immediate therapeutic consequences. As face-to-face POCUS training modules are by definition short and the trainer is usually only available for a short period of time, methods to ensure continuous support and quality assurance need to be considered when designing or implementing training. A POCUS protocol is therefore frequently used in trauma patients and is well established.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

AB  - Summary The study of stress, fear and anxiety was the major focus of research among the early neuroscientists interested in behaviour. This is not surprising because fear, anxiety and alarm play a fundamental role in survival. Thus, research investigating the phenomenology and neurobiology of anxiety, fear, startle, arousal, alarm, vigilance and alerting functions has been conducted for decades. This chapter provides an overview of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder. These anxiety disorders were selected because each of them has an extensive base of knowledge in two or more of the following areas: neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology or neuroimmunology, and neurophysiology.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the accuracy of intestinal ultrasound for diagnosis of intestinal obstruction in dogs and cats. Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed. Inclusion criteria were dogs and cats with clinical signs suggestive of gastrointestinal obstruction. Animals with no obstruction detected on ultrasound were excluded if they could not be monitored for 48 hours to confirm absence of obstruction. Sonographic diagnosis of small intestinal obstruction was based on identification of at least two findings suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Results: Ninety-two patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction were included. Correct diagnosis of intestinal obstruction was made in 21 cases (23%), and in 68 (74%) this diagnosis was excluded. Interpretation of the images on prospective analysis had sensitivity, positive predictive, specificity and negative predictive values of 100%, 87.5%, 95.8% and 100%, respectively. Clinical Significance: Ultrasonography is an excellent method for investigation of animals with gastrointestinal disorders, and is particularly useful for excluding obstructive processes.

AB  - A novel murine experimental wound infection model was used to assess the efficacy of multi-component immunization against Staphylococcus aureus infection. Necrotic lesions were induced in mice with venom from Bothrops asper and infected with a low inoculum, 1 ? 102 CFU. The wound infection model therefore more resembles a clinical case of S. aureus infection compared with conventional infection models where far more bacteria are required. Before infection, mice were immunized with four recombinant S.aureus proteins expressed from Escherichia coli: (i) domains 1?3 of Extracellular adherence protein (Eap), (ii) Efb ? D (fusion protein combining Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb) and a fibronectin binding domain (D) of the fibronectin binding protein (FnBP) and (iii) clumping factor A (ClfA). In the immunized group, lower bacterial colonization, undisturbed crust formation and significantly faster wound healing were found compared with the unimmunized control group. Efb and Eap have previously been found to impair wound healing and neutralization of these proteins by antibodies restores a more natural wound healing process. This effect is further also enhanced by the proposed opsonic activity of antibodies against ClfA and FnBP.

AB  - Abstract Conservation of resources (COR) theory was originally introduced as a framework for understanding and predicting the consequences of major and traumatic stress, but following the work of Hobfoll and Shirom (1993), COR theory has been adopted to understanding and predicting work-related stress and both the stress and resilience that occur within work settings and work culture. COR theory underscores the critical role of resource possession, lack, loss and gain and depicts personal, social and material resources co-travelling in resource caravans, rather than piecemeal. We briefly review the principles of COR theory and integrate it in the crossover model, which provides a key mechanism for multi-person exchange of emotions, experiences and resources. Understanding the impact of resource reservoirs, resource passageways and crossover provides a framework for research and intervention promoting resilience to employees as well as to organizations. It emphasizes that the creation and maintenance of resource caravan passageways promote resource gain climates through resource crossover processes. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Improper application, however, may impede healing and be detrimental to the well-being or athletic future of the horse. Many different types of bandage materials exist and are reviewed in Chapter 6. This chapter is devoted to the principles and techniques of bandaging and casting. Splinting is discussed along with casting because either approach may be used when immobilization is required to support wound healing. Various techniques to improve the application and maintenance of bandages, splints, and casts, as well as to manage complications arising from their use, are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Research diagnostic interviews need to discriminate between closely related disorders in order to allow comorbidity among mental disorders to be studied reliably. Yet conventional studies of diagnostic validity generally focus on single disorders and do not examine discriminant validity. The current study examines the validity of fully-structured diagnoses of closely-related distress disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, and dysthymic disorder) in the lay-administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI) with independent clinical diagnoses based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A). The NCS-A is a national survey of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) among 10,148 adolescents. A probability sub-sample of 347 of these adolescents and their parents were administered blinded follow-up K-SADS interviews. Good concordance [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)] was found between diagnoses based on the CIDI and the K-SADS for generalized anxiety disorder (AUC?=?0.78), post-traumatic stress disorder (AUC?=?0.79), and major depressive episode/dysthymic disorder (AUC?=?0.86). Further, the CIDI was able to effectively discriminate among different types of distress disorders in the sub-sample of respondents with any distress disorder.

AB  - 19F MRI and optical imaging are two powerful noninvasive molecular imaging modalities in biomedical applications. 19F MRI has great potential for high resolution in vivo imaging, while fluorescent probes enable ultracontrast cellular/tissue imaging with high accuracy and sensitivity. A bimodal nanoprobe is developed, integrating the merits of 19F MRI and fluorescence imaging into a single synthetic molecule, which is further engineered into nanoprobe, by addressing shortcomings of conventional contrast agents to explore the quantitative 19F MRI and fluorescence imaging and cell tracking. Results show that this bimodal imaging nanoprobe presents high correlation of 19F MR signal and NIR fluorescence intensity in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, this nanoprobe enables quantitative 19F MR analysis, confirmed by a complementary fluorescence analysis. This unique feature can hardly be obtained by traditional 19F MRI contrast agents. It is envisioned that this nanoprobe can hold great potential for quantitative and sensitive multi-modal molecular imaging.

AB  - Abstract We analyze key proteomic issues and cutting-edge technologies that will spearhead inroads into functional interpretations of human diseases and their therapeutic rectification, following the availability of the predicted human proteome. We contrast the distinctions between high quality data that are low throughput, (e.g., 3-D proteomic reconstructions in embryogenic and nervous system contexts, and multigenerational transgenic studies), versus automated data harvesting that is more distant from human disease phenotypes and currently fulfills a diagnostic role, (e.g., molecular portraits of human diseases via transcriptomic analyses). We examine the extent to which these approaches impinge upon a realistic understanding of human diseases, namely how close they come to revealing the causal events involved in the initiation of disease. While tissue sources from human embryogenesis, foetal development and the brain remain the absolute priority, the pragmatic approaches utilize judicious data integration from selected proteomic studies of model organisms. The role of genome-wide disease-related screens, ?humanized? transgenic analyses, multigenerational gene interference methods, and analyses of post-translational modifications in epigenetic contexts from Drosophila will be crucial, since these avenues are far too slow and transgenically cumbersome in mammals. Finally, the implementation of multi compartment electrolyzers (MCE) and multi photon detection (MPD) systems will be pivotal for the proteomic profiling of human tissue samples.
