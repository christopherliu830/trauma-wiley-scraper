AB  - Purpose. To review critically the evidence for three contemporary theories of delusions. Methods. The theoretical approaches to delusions proposed by Frith and colleagues (?theory of mind? deficits), Garety and colleagues (multi-factorial, but involving probabilistic reasoning biases) and Bentall and colleagues (attributional style and self-discrepancies) are summarised. The findings of empirical papers directly relevant to these proposals are critically reviewed. These papers were identified by computerised literature searches (for the years 1987-1997) and a hand search. Results. The evidence does not unequivocally support any of the approaches as proposed. However, strong evidence is found to support modifications of Garety and colleagues and Bentall and colleagues theories. Studies have replicated a ?jumping to conclusions? data-gathering bias and an externalising attributional bias in people with delusions. There is preliminary evidence for a ?theory of mind? deficit, as proposed by Frith, although possibly related to a more general reasoning bias. Evidence for an underlying discrepancy between ideal and actual self-representations is weaker. Conclusions. A multi-factorial model of delusion formation and maintenance incorporating a data-gathering bias and attributional style, together with other factors (e.g. perceptual processing, meta-representation) is consistent with the current evidence. It is recommended that these findings be incorporated into cognitive therapy approaches. However, there are limitations to existing research. Future studies should incorporate longitudinal designs and first episode studies, and should not neglect the co-morbidity of delusions, including affective processes, or the multi-dimensional nature of delusions.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the effects of 2 training curricula on laparoscopic skills and performance of simulated surgery in veterinary students. Study design Prospective study. Sample population Veterinary students (n?=?33) with no prior hands-on experience in minimally invasive surgery. Methods Basic laparoscopic skills (BLS) were assessed based on 5 modified McGill inanimate system for training and evaluation of laparoscopic skills. Motion metrics and an objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) were used to evaluate surgical skills during a simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in an augmented reality simulator. Students were randomly assigned to either skill-based (group A) or procedural-based (group B) training curriculum. Both tests were performed prior to and after a 10-session training curriculum. Results Post-training BLS results were improved in both training groups (P?<?.001). Seven participants completed both presimulated and postsimulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy, preventing paired analysis. Based on motion metrics analysis, participants completed tasks in a shorter time (P?=?.0187), and with better economy of movement (P?=?.0457) after training. No difference was detected in OSATS before and after training. Conclusion Both training curricula improved BLS, but significant differences were not detected between the procedural-based training program and basic skills training alone in veterinary students. Motion metrics such as time, economy of movement, and instrument path were superior to an OSATS, when assessing surgical performance. Further studies are needed to compare the effects of different simulators on the training of veterinarians with diverse laparoscopic surgical experience.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of oral health conditions on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in population-based sample of Brazilian preschool children. A further aim was to identify the influence of socio-demographic profile and perceptions regarding general health and oral health status on OHRQoL. Methods An epidemiological survey was carried out at public and private preschools in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The sample consisted of 1632 5-year-old male and female preschoolers randomly selected using a multi-stage sampling technique and their parents/caregivers. Oral examinations of the children were performed by a single, previously calibrated examiner for the assessment of dental caries experience, malocclusion, traumatic dental injury and developmental defects of enamel. Caregivers were asked to complete the Brazilian Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS) and a form on socio-demographic data. Descriptive, bivariate and adjusted Poisson regression model analyses were carried out. Results In the child section of the B-ECOHIS, OHRQoL was negatively impacted by decayed, missing and filled teeth [prevalence ratios (PR) = 2.18; 95% CI, 1.88?2.52], position of the child among siblings in the family (PR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04?1.39), type of preschool (PR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.10?1.69), age of parents/caregivers (PR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04?1.34), monthly household income (PR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.18?1.85) and perception of the child's general health status (PR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06?1.51). In the family section, the adjusted results demonstrated a negative impact on OHRQoL associated with dental caries experience (PR = 3.40; 95% CI, 2.83?4.08), age of parents/caregivers (PR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01?1.33) and monthly household income (PR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16?1.72). Conclusions Dental caries experience was the only normative criteria with a negative impact on OHRQoL. Families with low income and younger parents reported a greater impact on quality of life. According to parents' perceptions, a poor general health status rating was related to poorer quality of life among the children.

AB  - Abstract This study draws on the institutional and resource-based theories of the firm and examines whether multi-product firms use mergers as a strategic tool to reconfigure their product-mix toward high-profit products. We propose that mergers facilitate product-mix reconfiguration by relaxing institutional and organizational constraints on resource redeployment. Analysis of data from the U.S. hospital industry reveals that, relative to non-merging hospitals, merging hospitals increased their presence in profitable, insured services but did not shift away from low-profit services used by the uninsured.

AB  - Abstract Dr. David Satcher issued the first Surgeon General Report on oral health in the United States in 2000, drawing attention to a prevailing oral health access crisis. Dr. Satcher's report resonated in Wisconsin where a statewide growing dental access crisis was in progress and inspired grassroots efforts by a Family Health Center to establish a practice-based multi-site dental infrastructure that was integrated into a large regional multi-specialty medical clinic serving a largely rural population. An overview is provided of fundamental elements and relationships that supported establishment of the infrastructure, services, outreach and expanded access offered inclusively to all patients. Further, this community action report presents a blueprint that delineates key dimensions critical to planning and establishing a regionalized infrastructure offering access to all patients. Feasibility of establishing inclusive dental care is documented, and our model is proposed as a potentially replicable prototype for increasing dental access across other federally qualified health centers. Finally, this report is responsive to Dr. Jerome Adam's solicitations for feedback that will inform his plan for issuing a new Surgeon General report that updates status of oral health in America and progress in reversing oral health access disparities.

AB  - ABSTRACT Hindfoot arthritis is an important contributor to foot pain and physical disability. While the subtalar joint (STJ) is most frequently affected, anatomical variants such as facet configuration were suggested to further STJ cartilage deterioration. T2* mapping enables detection of ultra-structural cartilage change, particularly in thin cartilage layers, but its feasibility in the STJ has not yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmentation consistency and inter-scan short-term precision error of T2* mapping of talocalcaneal cartilage and to investigate the relationship between facet configuration and STJ T2* values. Using 3Tesla morphological magnetic resonance imaging, STJ configuration was categorized according to the degree of fusion between anterior, medial, or posterior facets. Subsequently, two repeats of multi-echo gradient recalled echo sequences were performed to obtain T2* maps with repositioning. Segmentation consistency of T2* values attained an ICC of 0.90 (95%CI 0.69?0.99). Precision errors comprised a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging 0.01?0.05, corresponding to a root mean square CV of 0.03?0.04. A 2-joint configuration type (i.e., fused anterior-medial facets) was significantly associated with a decrease in posterior facet T2* values (??=??0.6, p?=?0.046). STJ T2* mapping is a reliable method requiring at least a 4% difference within people to enable detection of significant change. Anatomical variants in STJ configuration were associated with T2* values with the more stable 3-joint types exhibiting more favorable cartilage outcomes. Longer-term larger-scaled studies focusing on arthritis pathology are needed to further support the use of T2* mapping in hindfoot disease monitoring. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is of obvious relevance in situations where there is an interruption of blood supply to the gut, as in vascular surgery, or in the construction of free intestinal grafts. It is now appreciated that IRI also underlies the gut dysfunction that occurs in early shock, sepsis, and trauma. The events that occur during IRI are complex. However, recent advances in cellular biology have started to unravel these underlying processes. The aim of this review is to provide an outline of current knowledge on the mechanisms and consequences of IRI. Initially, IRI appears to be mediated by reactive oxygen metabolites and, at a later stage, by the priming and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury can diminish the barrier function of the gut, and can promote an increase in the leakage of molecules (intestinal permeability) or the passage of microbes across the wall of the bowel (bacterial trans-location). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury to the gut can result in the generation of molecules that may also harm distant tissues.

AB  - The late endosomal adaptor protein LAMTOR2/p14 is essential for tissue homeostasis by controlling MAPK and mTOR signaling, which in turn regulate cell growth and proliferation, migration and spreading. Moreover, LAMTOR2 critically controls architecture and function of the endocytic system, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in lysosomes, positioning of late endosomes and defense against intracellular pathogens. Here we describe the multifaceted ultrastructural phenotype of the endo/lysosomal system of LAMTOR2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Quantitative (immuno-)electron microscopy of cryo-fixed samples revealed significantly reduced numbers of recycling tubules emanating from maturing multivesicular bodies (MVB). Instead, a distinct halo of vesicles surrounded MVB, tentatively interpreted as detached, jammed recycling tubules. These morphological changes in LAMTOR2-deficient cells correlated with the presence of growth factors (e.g. EGF), but were similarly induced in control cells by inactivating mTOR. Furthermore, proper transferrin receptor trafficking and recycling were apparently dependent on an intact LAMTOR complex. Finally, a severe imbalance in the relative proportions of endo/lysosomes was found in LAMTOR2-deficient cells, resulting from increased amounts of mature MVB and (autophago)lysosomes. These observations suggest that the LAMTOR/Ragulator complex is required not only for maintaining the homeostasis of endo/lysosomal subpopulations but also contributes to the proper formation of MVB-recycling tubules, and regulation of membrane/cargo recycling from MVB.

AB  - Abstract We describe a previously unreported association of ankylosing spondylitis with synovial chondromatosis, and briefly review previously reported cases and treatment of synovial chondromatosis in patients with other immune-mediated inflammatory arthritides. A 20-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis whose axial disease was in remission with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs developed recurrent right knee pain and swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging of his right knee revealed calcified loose bodies, suggestive of synovial chondromatosis. While waiting for the surgical intervention and other invasive therapy previously reported in patients with synovial chondromatosis, a trial of etanercept eliminated the pain and swelling of the knee; however, the loose bodies have persisted during the 2-year follow-up. Thus, synovial chondromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnoses of a refractory monoarticular pain and swelling in patients with otherwise controlled inflammatory arthritis. Our report advocates a trial of anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, which might delay the need for invasive therapy in patients with synovial chondromatosis.

AB  - Abstract Neurodegeneration in Parkinson?s disease (PD) is accompanied by a local immune reaction in the affected brain regions. It is well established that α-synuclein is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Development of the disease is often associated with changes of expression and cellular compartmentalisation of this protein; moreover, its oligomers or protofibrils are often released to the CSF and plasma of patients. Aggregated α-synuclein can trigger the activation of microglia; however, its capacity to induce production of specific autoantibodies (AAb) has not been assessed. In this study, we examined the presence of AAb against synuclein family members in the peripheral blood serum of PD patients and control individuals. Presence of AAb against ?-synuclein or ?-synuclein showed no association with PD. Multi-epitopic AAb against α-synuclein were detected in 65% of all patients tested and their presence strongly correlated with an inherited mode of the disease but not with other disease-related factors. The frequency of the presence of AAb in the studied group of patients with sporadic form of PD was not significantly different from the frequency in the control group but very high proportion (90%) of patients with familial form of the disease were positive for AAb against α-synuclein. We hypothesise that these AAb could be involved in pathogenesis of the inherited form of PD.

AB  - Abstract A unique seventeenth?nineteenth century slave cemetery population from Newton plantation, Barbados, allows examination of craniodental characters in relation to ethnohistorical data. Age-at-death estimates suggest life expectancy at birth of 29 years and low infant mortality; historical demography, however, suggests life expectancy of 20 years and very high infant mortality. Tooth decay, bilateral tooth loss, periodontal disease, root hypercementosis, and severe enamel hypoplasia are high in frequency. The teeth yield evidence of such cultural practices as pipe-smoking and incisor mutilation. Several skeletal features reflect periodic near-starvation. Directional and fluctuating dental asymmetry, relative tooth size, and hypoplasia distribution suggest slaves experienced considerable weaning trauma; metabolic stress at this time exceeded that of prenatal and immediate postnatal periods. Odontometrics and dental and cranial nonmetric traits indicate that modern Blacks are intermediate between the ancestral slaves and modern Whites but more similar to the latter, suggesting effects of environmental covariance exceed those of genetic admixture. Nonmetric trait distributions show nonrandom patterns according to area of burial in the cemetery, a possible result of family segregation.
