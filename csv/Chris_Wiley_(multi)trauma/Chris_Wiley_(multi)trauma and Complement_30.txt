AB  - Summary There has been a recent dramatic increase in understanding how to replace neurons lost through aging, trauma or disease and how to repair brain damage with significant functional recovery in a variety of models of human neurodegenerative disease. Donor factors identified in various models indicate that underlying successful cell transplantation in the nervous system critically include cell harvesting at an appropriate stage notably in embryonic or neonatal development. Also necessary are an appropriate nutritive environment for cell growth and appropriate techniques of cell implantation. Animal and other models have demonstrated the potential feasibility of using cells for repair of central nervous system disorders but for the present time functional clinical use of such cells remains an innovation in development at least in part due to the complex and precisely organized anatomical structures involved. There are also donor supply and ethics issues and conflicting clinical trial work, however, clinicians are working to achieve consensus through the application of evidence-based medicine.

AB  - Summary The journey from emerging technology to therapeutic paradigm change follows a rocky road. The development of monoclonal antibodies as a commercially viable industry exemplifies this. Several technological S-curves have been navigated to make mAbs the conventional pharmaceuticals that they have become today: from discovery and engineering to clinical translation and industrial scale manufacturing. The transformational nature of these new molecules has generated a multi-billion dollar global industry. A historic recollection of the defining events that shaped the mAb technology is particularly relevant to regenerative medicine in general and therapeutic stem cells in particular. A point of inflexion in the value of mAb transactions occurred with the commercial success of the first mAb blockbuster (rituximab), triggering multi-billion USD licensing transactions and very large M (3) enhancement of biological attributes, (4) combination with conventional drugs, (5) delivery devices and formulation, and (6) solid organ transplantation. Each co-evolutionary advance contributes to the clinical, economic and access to care value proposition that makes or breaks a technology, as it transitions from bench to bedside.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents information on etiology/pathophysiology, signalment/history, clinical features, differential diagnosis, diagnostics and therapeutics of feline pancreatitis in cats and dogs. Local and systemic tissue injury is due to the activity of released pancreatic enzymes and a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as kinins, free radicals, and complement factors, released by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. The most common pathologies involving the feline pancreas include acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and acute suppurative pancreatitis. Etiology is most often unknown. Serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPL) is a highly sensitive and specific serologic marker of acute pancreatic inflammation. fPL assay and pancreatic ultrasound in combination have the highest specificity for an antemortem diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration biopsy may confirm inflammation (cytology), abscess, or cygst.

AB  - Abstract The popularity of virtual reality headsets have been rapidly increasing. With this technology, students can efficiently interact with the course content and learn the material faster than the traditional methodologies. In addition to this benefit, virtual reality devices also draw the attention of young generation and this helps to the widespread use of this technology among students. In this study, we investigate the use of virtual reality on the performance of computer engineering bachelor science (BS) students within the scope of Data Structures course and develop a software-intensive system called ?Virtual Reality Enhanced Interactive Teaching Environment? (VR-ENITE). Specifically, we focus on the sorting algorithms such as selection sort, bubble sort, insertions sort, and merge sort which are relatively hard to be understood by the BS students at first glance. For the evaluation of VR-ENITE, students were divided into two groups: a group which uses VR-ENITE in addition to the traditional teaching material and the control group which utilizes from only the traditional material. In order to evaluate the performance of these two groups having 36 students in total, a multiple choice exam was delivered to all of them. According to the test results, students who used the VR-ENITE system got 12% more successful results in average than the students who are in the control group. This study experimentally shows that VR-ENITE which is based on virtual reality technology is effective for teaching software engineering courses and it has assistive capabilities for traditional teaching approaches.

AB  - Abstract Many health studies focus on multifaceted outcomes that are not easily measured with a single variable; examples include studies on quality of life (QOL) and general health. To fully explore such an outcome, researchers typically collect information on multiple endpoints. The resulting measurements constitute multidimensional outcome data. An object of great interest is the overall?or global?effect of a covariate, such as a treatment intervention, on the multidimensional outcome. Quantifying such an effect can be difficult because multiple clinical outcomes are usually measured on different scales; the problem is enhanced by the fact that multiple measurements on a given subject are typically correlated. We present a regression modeling scheme permitting estimation of global treatment effects when multiple continuous endpoints are examined in concert either once or for several times. The global effect is conceptualized as a change in the distribution functions of the outcome variables. It may thus be interpreted as a connection between outcome distribution quantiles for the treatment and control groups. This concept allows the presentation of a global effect as a scalar quantity applicable to all outcomes simultaneously, easing interpretation of results. Model estimation proceeds directly from existing methods for multivariate survival analysis. The assumption that the treatment effect is homogenous across different outcomes is testable. To illustrate the application, we present data analytic results from a motivating example, an analysis of patients' QOL during recovery from lower limb trauma. We also explore the performance properties of global effects estimation through simulation. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The objective of Aquarius project was to test the applicability of a food chain analysis on Atlantic salmon farmed in Norway to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and drivers of change for the identification of emerging risks. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was conducted complemented with expert views collected by on-line questionnaires and in-depth interviews. This review provided an overview of the various stages in the supply chain from farm to consumer and the identification of i) existing and emerging human and animal health hazards, ii) vulnerabilities, iii) control measures, iv) drivers of change, and v) related indicators. Next step in the study was to i) complement the list of vulnerabilities followed by a prioritisation using focus group discussions and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method and ii) link drivers of change acting upon the (prioritised) vulnerabilities and identification of associated indicators and data sources by means of a Delphi method. Based on the experiences obtained with the different methodologies during this project, the Aquarius team considers literature review, and a direct face-to-face interaction with experts (in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and FMEA in a workshop setting) as being most effective regarding output and effort. The comprehensive information collected formed the basis for the methodology to baseline key indicators of the selected vulnerabilities. The methodology proposed comprised a Bayesian Network (BN) that links data sources for indicators and drivers of change to the prioritised vulnerabilities and was demonstrated for salmon health. A Decision Support System (DSS) with such BN integrated was designed. The current BN and DSS could flag an increased exposure of known hazards that may occur due to changes in indicators but new hazards are not identified. The proposed methodology could be used instead to show trends in vulnerabilities, indicators, increased exposure of known hazards and for scenario studies.

AB  - Background: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disease characterized by acantholysis in the epithelium. PV is often difficult to diagnose in the early stages, since the oral lesions are relatively nonspecific. We report on a case with a favorable outcome due to early diagnosis and effective treatment of oral lesions. Methods: A 53-year-old Japanese woman presented with a month-long history of painful gingiva. PV was diagnosed using clinical, histopathological, and direct immunofluorescence criteria 1 month after the first visit. Evaluation of the circulating autoantibody titers to desmoglein (Dsg)1 and Dsg3 was conducted by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Occlusive steroid therapy (OST) using a topical corticosteroid (0.1% triamcinolone acetonide) was provided for 8 weeks. After OST was completed, a buccal frenectomy was performed to eliminate localized toothbrushing trauma. Results: There were no adverse effects on wound healing after the procedure. No oral PV lesions were detectable at the 9-month reevaluation, and the patient remains in complete remission. The Dsg1 ELISA was negative while the Dsg3 ELISA was indeterminate at the first visit. The Dsg1 ELISA was also negative at reevaluation, but Dsg3 ELISA reactivity had increased 9 months after completion of treatment. Conclusion: Large scale clinical trials will be required to validate the clinical benefits of the OST treatment regimen, and further research is necessary to determine the importance of ELISA antibody examination in long-term management of oral PV.

AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the human response to various internal and external stimuli, which can modify homeostasis, and exerts a tight control on essential functions such as circulation, respiration, thermoregulation and hormonal secretion. ANS dysfunction may complicate the perioperative course in the surgical patient undergoing anesthesia, increasing morbidity and mortality, and, therefore, it should be considered as an additional risk factor during pre-operative evaluation. Furthermore, ANS dysfunction may complicate the clinical course of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units, in the case of trauma, sepsis, neurologic disorders and cardiovascular diseases, and its occurrence adversely affects the outcome. In the care of these patients, the assessment of autonomic function may provide useful information concerning pathophysiology, risk stratification, early prognosis prediction and treatment strategies. Given the role of ANS in the maintenance of systemic homeostasis, anesthesiologists and intensivists should recognize as critical the evaluation of ANS function. Measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) is an easily accessible window into autonomic activity. It is a low-cost, non-invasive and simple to perform method reflecting the balance of the ANS regulation of the heart rate and offers the opportunity to detect the presence of autonomic neuropathy complicating several illnesses. The present review provides anesthesiologists and intensivists with a comprehensive summary of the possible clinical implications of HRV measurements, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction testing could potentially represent a diagnostic and prognostic tool in the care of patients both in the perioperative setting as well as in the critical care arena.

AB  - Abstract Minimally invasive techniques enable diagnostics and surgery to be performed through a small incision. This greatly reduces the damage to healthy tissue leading to faster recovery times for the patient. However, the surgeon is deprived of the sensory feedback available with normal surgical techniques. Miniaturised sensors can provide this information about location, diagnostics and the treatment. This application severely limits the size of the device, with some catheters being less than 1 mm in diameter. Catheters are usually defined in multiples of 1/3 mm or 1 french. Further important issues are bio-compatibility, safety and the ability of the sensor to withstand the working environment. Sensors able to meet these demands are improving the efficiency of operations and are opening new opportunities for minimally invasive techniques.

AB  - Aim.? This paper reports a study assessing the usefulness of a mantram repetition programme. Background.? Complementary/alternative therapies are becoming commonplace, but more research is needed to assess their benefits. A 5-week programme teaching a ?mind?body?spiritual? technique of silently repeating a mantram ? a word or phrase with spiritual meaning ? to manage stress was developed. A mantram was chosen by individuals, who were taught to repeat it silently throughout the day or night to interrupt unwanted thoughts and elicit the relaxation response. Methods.? Participants who attended a 5-week course were invited to participate in the study. Of those who consented, a randomly selected subset (n?=?66) was contacted approximately 3?months after the course for a telephone interview using the critical incident interviewing technique. Participants were asked whether the intervention was helpful or not, and if helpful, to identify situations where it was applied. Interviews were transcribed and incidents were identified and categorized to create a taxonomy of uses. The data were collected in 2001?2002. Results.? Participants included 30 veterans, mostly males (97%), and 36 hospital employees, mostly females (86%). Mean age was 56?years (sd?=?12·94). Fifty-five participants (83·3%) practiced the technique and reported 147 incidents where the programme was helpful. Outcomes were organized into a taxonomy of incidents using four major categories that included managing: (a) emotions other than stress (51%); (b) stress (23·8%); (c) insomnia (12·9%); and (d) unwanted thoughts (12·3%). A group of raters reviewed the categories for inter-rater reliability. Conclusions.? The majority of participants from two distinct samples reported that the mantram programme was helpful in a variety of situations. The critical incident interviewing method was found to be practical, efficient, and thorough in collecting and analyzing data. Such qualitative methods contribute to understanding the benefits of mind?body complementary therapies.

AB  - SUMMARY As a resource, allogeneic blood has never been more in demand than it is today. Escalating elective surgery, an aging population, periodic shortages arising from a fall in supply, old and emerging threat of transfusion-transmissible infections and spiraling costs because of various safety introductions have all conspired to ensure that allogeneic blood remains very much a vital but limited asset to the National Health Service. However, there are increasing demands for alternatives/complementary strategies to allogeneic blood transfusion. Autologous transfusion, predeposit autologous donation, acute normovolemic hemodilution and perioperative cell salvage is reliable, cost-effective, safe, does not involve type and screen, not associated with isoimmunization to foreign proteins, is indicated in patients with rare blood groups or complex red cell antibodies, comes handy for some religious sect like the Jehovah's Witnesses as well as being suitable in a significant number of patients undergoing elective surgeries. Autologous transfusion improves postoperative microcirculation, tissue perfusion and reduces the risk of thromboembolism. Benchmarking transfusion activity, ensuring that it is clinically indicated and justified, will help eliminate inappropriate use of blood products and help conserve our allogeneic blood stock. Erythropoietin (EPO) has drastically and significantly altered red cell transfusion practices. There might be many patients groups who would benefit from the use of EPO analogues and thus help conserve the allogeneic blood stock for patients in whom EPO is contraindicated. There is need to formulate policies on ways to seriously and innovatively attract and retain new donors. The National Blood Service and indeed the Department for Health can do well by promoting the use of autologous blood and other alternatives therapies to complement the UK allogeneic blood transfusion program in a bid to solving the periodic and envisage future shortages in allogeneic blood particularly with an aging UK population and increasing concerns about safety arising from old and emerging transfusion-transmissible infections. This will maximize the use of the limited allogeneic blood resource particularly for patients in whom autologous blood transfusion is contraindicated.

AB  - ABSTRACT Due to disparity regarding the age at which skeletal maturation of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis occurs in forensic and biological literature, this study provides recalibrated multislice computed tomography (MSCT) age standards for the Australian (Queensland) population, using a Bayesian statistical approach. The sample comprises retrospective cranial/cervical MSCT scans obtained from 448 males and 416 females aged birth to 20 years from the Skeletal Biology and Forensic Anthropology Research Osteological Database. Fusion status of the synchondrosis was scored using a modified six-stage scoring tier on an MSCT platform, with negligible observer error (??=?0.911?±?0.04, intraclass correlation coefficient?=?0.994). Bayesian transition analysis indicates that females are most likely to transition to complete fusion at 13.1 years and males at 15.6 years. Posterior densities were derived for each morphological stage, with complete fusion of the synchondrosis attained in all Queensland males over 16.3 years of age and females aged 13.8 years and older. The results demonstrate significant sexual dimorphism in synchondrosis fusion and are suggestive of intrapopulation variation between major geographic regions in Australia. This study contributes to the growing repository of contemporary anthropological standards calibrated for the Queensland milieu to improve the efficacy of the coronial process for medicolegal death investigation. As a stand-alone age indicator, the basicranial synchondrosis may be consulted as an exclusion criterion when determining the age of majority that constitutes 17 years in Queensland forensic practice.
