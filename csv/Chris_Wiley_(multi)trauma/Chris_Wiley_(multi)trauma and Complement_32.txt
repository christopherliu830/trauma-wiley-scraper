AB  - Abstract Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the most common cause of anatomic failure in retinal detachment surgery. To understand the molecular mechanisms, vitreous proteomes of patients with PVR were investigated by two-dimensional-nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Vitreous samples of moderate PVR (grade B), and severe PVR (grade C or D) were aspirated during pars plana vitrectomy before infusion. In the current study, 129, 97 and 137 proteins were identified in vitreous of normal control, moderate and severe PVR, respectively. In PVR vitreous samples, complement components, serine proteinase inhibitors, and extracellular proteins were up-regulated or appeared, while normal cytoskeleton and metabolism proteins were down-regulated or disappeared. It was noteworthy that the proteins involved in transcription and translation regulation increased in vitreous with PVR. Among 102 PVR-specific proteins, kininogen 1 was specifically detected in both vitreous and the corresponding serum. Therefore, it can be concluded that PVR is a complicated pathology process with great amount of proteins involved in metabolism dysfunction, immune reactions, and cytoskeleton remolding. Kininogen 1 may be a candidate biomarker of PVR. Further investigations of these special proteins will provide additional targets for treatment or prevention of ocular proliferative diseases.

AB  - Diffusion MRI is extensively used to study brain microarchitecture and pathologies, and water diffusion appears highly anisotropic in the white matter (WM) of the spinal cord (SC). Despite these facts, the use of diffusion MRI to study the SC, which has increased in recent years, is much less common than that in the brain. In the present review, after a brief outline of early studies of diffusion MRI (DWI) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the SC, we provide a short survey on DTI and on diffusion MRI methods beyond the tensor that have been used to study SC microstructure and pathologies. After introducing the porous view of WM and describing the q-space approach and q-space diffusion MRI (QSI), we describe other methodologies that can be applied to study the SC. Selected applications of the use of DTI, QSI, and other more advanced diffusion MRI methods to study SC microstructure and pathologies are presented, with some emphasis on the use of less conventional diffusion methodologies. Because of length constraints, we concentrate on structural studies and on a few selected pathologies. Examples of the use of diffusion MRI to study dysmyelination, demyelination as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic SC injury are presented. We conclude with a brief summary and a discussion of challenges and future directions for diffusion MRI of the SC. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We have previously described complement-independent killing of human B lymphocytes by two IgM MoAbs derived from the VH4-34 (VH4.21) gene. Analysis of 17 independently derived VH4-34-encoded MoAbs shows that B cell toxicity is not limited to the two described MoAbs, but is a general property shared by a subset of MoAbs derived from the VH4-34 gene. As observed by two independent microscopy techniques, giant membrane pores were formed on target B cells within 10?15 min of exposure to cytotoxic VH4-34-derived MoAbs. Toxicity by individual MoAb correlated directly to its B cell binding intensity measured by FACS, i.e. stronger the binding greater the killing. Sequence analysis showed that VH region in germ-line or in near germ-line configuration was necessary but not sufficient for B cell binding. In addition, a particular sequence motif enriched in basic amino acids in the CDR3 may be required to supplement the reactivity mediated by the VH region of the MoAb molecule. VH4-34-encoded antibodies that fulfil the above sequence requirements have cold agglutinin activity towards the i antigen of cord erythrocytes. In vivo, such anti-i/anti-B cell antibodies are rarely detected in healthy adults, but serum levels are dramatically elevated in selective pathological conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and infectious mononucleosis. This strict regulation may be related to the novel and rapid mechanism of human B cell toxicity demonstrated by antibodies encoded by a single human VH gene.

AB  - Abstract Objective The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper. Methods Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition, depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and gel electrophoresis. Results ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference in TNF-α and IL-1? levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment. After treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? were significantly decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes. Conclusion ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical symptoms and the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - The clinical challenge in acute injury as in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is to halt the delayed neuronal loss that occurs hours and days after the insult. Here we report that the activation of CREB-dependent transcription in reactive astrocytes prevents secondary injury in cerebral cortex after experimental TBI. The study was performed in a novel bitransgenic mouse in which a constitutively active CREB, VP16-CREB, was targeted to astrocytes with the Tet-Off system. Using histochemistry, qPCR, and gene profiling we found less neuronal death and damage, reduced macrophage infiltration, preserved mitochondria, and rescued expression of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism in bitransgenic mice as compared to wild type littermates. Finally, with meta-analyses using publicly available databases we identified a core set of VP16-CREB candidate target genes that may account for the neuroprotective effect. Enhancing CREB activity in astrocytes thus emerges as a novel avenue in acute brain post-injury therapeutics. GLIA 2016;64:853?874

AB  - Microglia are rapidly activated in the central nervous system (CNS) in response to a variety of injuries, including inflammation, trauma, and stroke. In addition to modulation of the innate immune response, a key function of microglia is the phagocytosis of dying cells and cellular debris, which can facilitate recovery. Despite emerging evidence that axonal debris can pose a barrier to regeneration of new axons in the CNS, little is known of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie clearance of degenerating CNS axons. We utilize a custom micropatterned microfluidic system that enables robust microglial-axon co-culture to explore the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in microglial phagocytosis of degenerating axons. We find that pharmacologic and genetic disruption of TLR4 blocks induction of the Type-1 interferon response and inhibits phagocytosis of axon debris in vitro. Moreover, TLR4-dependent microglial clearance of unmyelinated axon debris facilitates axon outgrowth. In vivo, microglial phagocytosis of CNS axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration in a dorsal root axotomy model is impaired in adult mice in which TLR4 has been deleted. Since purinergic receptors can influence TLR4-mediated signaling, we also explored a role for the microglia P2 receptors and found that the P2X7R contributes to microglial clearance of degenerating axons. Overall, we identify TLR4 as a key player in axonal debris clearance by microglia, thus creating a more permissive environment for axonal outgrowth. Our findings have significant implications for the development of protective and regenerative strategies for the many inflammatory, traumatic, and neurodegenerative conditions characterized by CNS axon degeneration.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the dermatological consequences of bed bug bites along with the immunological basis for the reaction in humans. With the recent rise in bed bug infestations, there has also been an increase in the number of patients presenting with allergic responses, and systemic reactions that have beentreated with an immunosuppressant. The signs and symptoms developing from the bite are due to the host's response to the trauma, the subsequent inflammatory response, and immune system reaction to antigens present in the saliva. When a patient is bitten by large numbers of bed bugs, multiple separate lesions can coalesce to mimic generalized maculopapular exanthema. The lesions may be further modified by excoriations and lichenification from persistent scratching, complicating the differential diagnoses. The first step is bed bug eradication from the patient's living environment and prevention of reinfestation. Eradication can be challenging and in most cases requires a licensed and trained pest management professional (PMP).

AB  - Summary At least 1 in 10 deaths in the older population are caused by infectious disease. The commonest infections are urinary tract infection, pneumonia and cellulitis. Susceptibility to infection increases due to changes in the immune system, exposure to pathogens in hospitals and care institutions, frailty and decreased physiological reserve. Infection often presents with a change in mental and functional status rather than typical signs of localised infection. Antibiotic stewardship is important in the older adult due to the risks of drug side effects and interactions, antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Particular features of this chapter include: Recognising atypical presentations of infection and sepsis in older people Investigations in the older person with a suspected urinary tract infection Differential diagnoses of cellulitis Indications to consider escalation of care

AB  - Summary Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is a frequent cause of severe skin infections. The ability to control the infection is largely dependent on the rapid recruitment of neutrophils (PMN). To gain more insight into the dynamics of PMN migration and host?pathogen interactions in vivo, we used intravital two-photon (2-P) microscopy to visualize S.?aureus skin infections in the mouse. Reporter S.?aureus strains expressing fluorescent proteins were developed, which allowed for detection of the bacteria in vivo. By employing LysM-EGFP mice to visualize PMN, we observed the rapid appearance of PMN in the extravascular space of the dermis and their directed movement towards the focus of infection, which led to the delineation of an abscess within 1 day. Moreover, tracking of transferred labelled bone-marrow neutrophils showed that PMN localization to the site of infection is dependent on the presence of G-protein-coupled receptors on the PMN, whereas Interleukin-1 receptor was required on host cells other than PMN. Furthermore, the S.?aureus complement inhibitor Ecb could block PMN accumulation at thesite of infection. Our results establish that 2-P microscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the orchestration of the immune cells, S.?aureus location and gene expression in vivo on a single cell level.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - Major changes in health care delivery and the increased number of clerkship sites used for teaching by many medical schools has resulted in significant implications for medical education. Methods have become necessary to achieve and maintain a comparable clinical experience and a uniform assessment process at each teaching site. Following a review of existing practices, a new core curriculum, a problem-based approach and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) were introduced into this department. Over 1200 students have passed through this revised surgical clerkship over the past 8 years. The introduction of the OSCE has helped to direct student learning, provide an objective assessment to complement the ward grade, and enabled an audit of teaching and learning to be carried out. In one group of 103 students no significant correlation was found between the OSCE and ward grades. Performance at different hospitals was similar and those carrying out their clerkship later in the academic year benefited from their previous other attachments. The OSCE has enabled immediate feedback to be given to learners as well as providing teachers with an opportunity to see for themselves the outcome of their tuition. A clinical performance record card has now been introduced to improve the monitoring of students' clinical experience.
