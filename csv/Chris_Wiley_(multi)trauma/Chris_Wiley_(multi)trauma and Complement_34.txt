AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.

AB  - Human perinatal tissues have been used for over a century as allogeneic biomaterials. Due to their advantageous properties including angiogenecity, anti-inflammation, anti-microbial, and immune privilege, these tissues are being utilized for novel applications across wide-ranging medical disciplines. Given continued clinical success, increased adoption of perinatal tissues as a disruptive technology platform has allowed for significant penetration into the multi-billion dollar biologics market. Here, we review current progress and future applications of perinatal biomaterials, as well as associated regulatory issues.

AB  - Abstract Aim: To investigate bone-to-implant bonding for some novel surface modifications with a hierarchic structure and to correlate the in vivo results with surface roughness parameters. Materials and methods: Newly developed implants surfaces were tested in rabbits and compared with the commercially available OsseoSpeed? (OS) implant. The blasted test samples were subjected to treatment in oxalic acid (AT-II), followed by subsequent etching in hydrofluoric acid (AT-I). Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the surface topography and chemical composition of the implants. Biomechanical testing after 6 weeks of healing was complemented with the quantification of fluorochromes and the results were subjected to a multivariate statistical analysis. Results: The results show, both with biomechanical- and with histomorphometrical tests, that the AT-I implants with different surface roughness at the micro (blasting), submicro (shallow cavities) and nanolevels (precipitates) have a greater bone tissue integration compared with the AT-II- and OS implants. The 2D bone-to-implant contact (BIC) data were in accordance with the 3D removal torque (RTQ) results even if the former were deduced from implants located in spongeous-type bone and the latter in cortical bone. The increase in RTQ values for the test samples AT-I and AT-II compared with the reference complies with the slightly higher Sa values for these surfaces. Conclusions: Using a combination of conventional methods with novel quantification of florochrome and multivariate analysis, the influence of surface roughness on different levels could be discriminated. The RTQ and BIC values show that the most hierarchical structure with submicro cavities and nanoscale precipitates possesses the most favourable osseointegration properties.

AB  - To effectively prevent sport traumatic brain injury (TBI), means of protection need to be designed and tested in relation to the reality of head impact. This study quantifies head impacts during a typical snowboarding accident to evaluate helmet standards. A snowboarder numerical model was proposed, validated against experimental data, and used to quantify the influence of accident conditions (speed, snow stiffness, morphology, and position) on head impacts (locations, velocities, and accelerations) and injury risk during snowboarding backward falls. Three hundred twenty-four scenarios were simulated: 70% presented a high risk of mild TBI (head peak acceleration >80 g) and 15% presented a high risk of severe TBI (head injury criterion >1000). Snow stiffness, speed, and snowboarder morphology were the main factors influencing head impact metrics. Mean normal head impact speed (28 ± 6 km/h) was higher than equivalent impact speed used in American standard helmet test (ASTM F2040), and mean tangential impact speed, not included in standard tests, was 13.8 (±7 km/h). In 97% of simulated impacts, the peak head acceleration was below 300 g, which is the pass/fail criteria used in standard tests. Results suggest that initial speed, impacted surface, and pass/fail criteria used in helmet standard performance tests do not fully reflect magnitude and variability of snowboarding backward-fall impacts.

AB  - Summary Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects 1% pregnancies and is multi-factorial in origin. The role of the acquired thrombophilia antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a common and potentially treatable cause of RPL is well established but this is less so for inherited thrombophilia. In obstetric APS the combination of aspirin and heparin has improved outcomes. By analogy, the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become commonplace in women with inherited thrombophilia and also those with unexplained miscarriage to help safeguard the pregnancy. This review will examine the pathophysiological role of thrombophilia in pregnancy loss, and the evidence for anticoagulant-based intervention. The limited data supporting the use of heparin for women with RPL and inherited thrombophilia suggests adoption of a more cautious and judicious approach in this setting.

AB  - Summary: Purpose: In epilepsy, patient-based assessments are increasingly used as outcome measures in clinical trials of novel therapies alongside the traditional clinical measures of efficacy. The objective of this study was to validate psychometrically a quality of life (QOL) measure developed for use with recently diagnosed epilepsy patients. Methods: The NEWQOL (Quality of Life in Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Instrument) is a 93-item self-administered battery designed to assess QOL in patients with new-onset epilepsy. NEWQOL consists of eight multi-item scales (13 subscales) measuring several health parameters: Anxiety, Depression, Social Activities, Symptoms, Locus of Control/Mastery, Neuropsychological Problems (includes the following subscales: Fatigue, Memory, Concentration, Motor Skills, and Reading), Social Stigma, Worry, Work Limitations, and several single-item measures (General Health, Number of Seizures, Social Limitations, Social Support, Self Concept, Ambition Limitations, Health Transition, and General Limitations). The NEWQOL was collected at baseline and 1 week post-baseline from 108 patients in the U.K. and U.S. Results: All of the multi-item scales had high item discriminant validity, good test-retest reliability, and acceptable levels of internal consistency reliability; all but the Reading and Stigma subscales had negligible floor and ceiling effects. General linear models were used to examine the known groups validity of NEWQOL. Significant differences were observed in the Worry, Symptoms, Summary Neuropsychological Scales, and all Neuropsychological subscales (Memory, Fatigue, Concentration, Motor Skills, and Reading), indicating poorer functioning in the more frequent or severe seizure groups. Conclusions: Results from this study offer supportive evidence that NEWQOL has good validity and reliability and can discriminate between patient groups, particularly in relation to symptoms and psychological problems. We conclude that NEWQOL represents a useful measure for future studies in this patient population.

AB  - There is a recognized challenge in analyzing traditional Chinese medicine formulas because of their complex chemical compositions. The application of modern analytical techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry has improved the characterization of various compounds from traditional Chinese medicine formulas significantly. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis to recognize the overall trend of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry approaches in the analysis of traditional Chinese medicine formulas, its significance and possible underlying interactions between individual herbs in these formulas. Electronic databases were searched systematically, and the identified studies were collected and analyzed using Microsoft Access 2010, Graph Pad 5.0 software and Ucinet software package. 338 publications between 1997 and 2015 were identified, and analyzed in terms of annual growth and accumulated publications, top journals, forms of traditional Chinese medicine preparations and highly studied formulas and single herbs, as well as social network analysis of single herbs. There is a significant increase trend in using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry related techniques in analysis of commonly used forms of traditional Chinese medicine formulas in the last 3 years. Stringent quality control is of great significance for the modernization and globalization of traditional Chinese medicine, and this bibliometric analysis provided the first and comprehensive summary within this field.

AB  - Abstract The belief that the spinal cord is hardwired is no longer tenable. Like the rest of the CNS, the spinal cord changes during growth and ageing, when new motor behaviours are acquired, and in response to trauma and disease. This paper describes a new model of spinal cord function that reconciles its recently appreciated plasticity with its long-recognized reliability as the final common pathway for behaviour. According to this model, the substrate of each motor behaviour comprises brain and spinal plasticity: the plasticity in the brain induces and maintains the plasticity in the spinal cord. Each time a behaviour occurs, the spinal cord provides the brain with performance information that guides changes in the substrate of the behaviour. All the behaviours in the repertoire undergo this process concurrently; each repeatedly induces plasticity to preserve its key features despite the plasticity induced by other behaviours. The aggregate process is a negotiation among the behaviours: they negotiate the properties of the spinal neurons and synapses that they all use. The ongoing negotiation maintains the spinal cord in an equilibrium ? a negotiated equilibrium ? that serves all the behaviours. This new model of spinal cord function is supported by laboratory and clinical data, makes predictions borne out by experiment, and underlies a new approach to restoring function to people with neuromuscular disorders. Further studies are needed to test its generality, to determine whether it may apply to other CNS areas such as the cerebral cortex, and to develop its therapeutic implications.

AB  - This paper explores user-driven organizational change in the National Health Service (NHS). The NHS Plan (Department of Health, 2000) created Patient Advice and Liaison Services (PALS) to provide information, solve problems and drive user-led change. Evidence is drawn from a study of PALS in London acute, primary care, mental health and specialist trusts, drawing on discussion forums, interviews with PALS officers and documentation. From context and role profiles, two conclusions are evident. First, organizational instability, boundary disputes, variable management support, resource limitations, financial insecurity and multi-site working characterize the context in which PALS operate, and the officer role is characterized by problem diversity, overlap with complaints systems, monitoring problems, relationship building and ?serial users?. Second, these context and role attributes restrict PALS to ?repair and maintenance?, ensuring that established systems work correctly. While PALS sit on the bottom rung of a ?participation ladder?, their contribution is more than tokenistic. However, a processual perspective demonstrates how a fluid, networked, and diversified context isolates PALS structures from management decision-making, constraining their power base, and inhibiting the promotion of substantive change agendas.

AB  - Background and purpose Susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) is determined by environmental and genetic factors, but the cause remains unknown. Changes to the proteome prior to first symptom onset may reflect the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Methods This preliminary study utilized pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic serum from a sample of 100 incident population-based US military veterans with MS along with 100 matched healthy controls. All samples were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Multidimensional protein identification technology tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed on tryptic peptides of lectin-captured glycosylated serum proteins following albumin/immunoglobulin G depletion. Identified proteins were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program. Results The mean intervals between first symptom onset and the collection of pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic sera were ?6.0 and +1.1 years, respectively. Pre-symptomatic proteins from the MS group were differentially regulated compared with both control groups indicating that proteomic changes are detected prior to symptom onset. Pathway analysis showed that proteins involved in the complement and coagulation pathways and lipid transport are significantly altered in the serum of subjects with MS compared with healthy donors. Conclusions Compared with healthy controls, differential proteomic changes were noted in the serum of patients with MS that preceded the onset of symptomatic disease. Further work is in progress to confirm or refute these findings.

AB  - Summary Our study examines how personality and coping influence soldiers' psychological health among 648 US Army personnel who were at that time deployed in Iraq at the height of an insurgency. Conscientiousness, neuroticism, and extraversion were associated with different coping behaviors, and these were in turn related to psychological distress. Conscientiousness was positively associated with problem-focused coping and negatively with avoidance coping, whereas neuroticism was most positively associated with avoidance coping. Extraversion was positively related to both seeking social support and avoidance coping. As expected, avoidance coping was positively associated with psychological distress. Coping style explained more variance in the relationship between personality and distress among soldiers who perceived higher levels of threat, thus supporting a moderated mediation hypothesis. We discuss implications for facilitating the stress coping of workers who face acute and potentially traumatic stress exposures. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the foundations, methods and contributions of neuropsychology and neurophysiology to clinical and biological psychiatry. Clinical neuropsychology is undergirded by the equally important assumption that reliable and valid inferences about cognitive/psychological and brain function and dysfunction can be derived from performance on psychometrically sound tests and measures that index clearly defined behavioral or cognitive domains. In many clinical cases the neuropsychological assessment can contribute useful information about a person's capacity for self-care, ability to follow and adhere to a medication or other treatment regimen, ability to manage financial affairs or drive, and capacity for decision-making. Two vignettes are provided to illustrate the various applications of clinical neuropsychology to individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders. Neurophysiological assessment can complement neuropsychological testing by allowing a more direct measure of brain functioning, by providing real-time measures of information processing, and by measuring cognition at a more elemental level.

AB  - The placement of endosseous dental implants is largely considered a safe surgical procedure. However, upper airway obstruction secondary to severe bleeding in the floor of the mouth has been occasionally reported as a rare but potentially fatal complication of implant surgery. This review presents critical hemorrhagic episodes, related to dental implantation in the anterior segments of the mandible, published to date. Massive internal bleeding in the highly vascularized region of the floor of the mouth is the result of an arterial trauma induced by instrumentation, usually through a perforation of the lingual cortical plate. Depending on the clinical situation, hemorrhage may commence immediately or with some delay after the vascular insult. The progressively expanding lingual, sublingual, submandibular, and submental hematomas have the tendency of displacing the tongue and floor of the mouth to obstruct the airway. Because the course of airway deterioration to complete occlusion may be rapid, ensuring a patent airway is of highest priority. Even though upper airway obstruction is potentially life-threatening, a secure airway was successfully established in all patients without fatal consequences. In most cases, resolution of hemorrhage required a surgical intervention for ligation of the bleeding vessels and hematoma evacuation. To reduce the probability of such a grave complication, preventive and precautionary measures to be taken before, during, and after implant placement in the anterior mandible are presented. Issues related to the level of surgical experience, fine regional arterial anatomy, radiographic and clinical evaluation of the osseous morphology, angulation and length of implants, and timing of hemorrhage onset are discussed. In addition, airway and bleeding management strategies are provided. J Periodontol 2004;75:631-645.

AB  - Abstract The influence of temperature on the stability of human serum albumin (HSA) pharmaceutical preparations has been studied by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography with multi-angle laser-light-scattering detection and by particle-size analysis. The behaviour of HSA in two pharmaceutical preparations stored at different temperatures (40, 55 and 70°C) followed the same pattern?an increase in the relative percentage of dimer (MW 132 000 Da) and aggregate (MW > 200 000 Da), and then a decrease in the concentration of all species and, finally, sudden protein coagulation. These results suggest a time- and temperature-dependent process. At 70°C, monomer only was detected for both preparations; the amount remaining was 83 and 72% for formulations A and B, respectively. Analysis of size-distribution curves also seems to confirm these results. Initially, three distributions were observed with length-volume mean diameters (dl,v)of 1.67, 10.6 and 57 ?m. After 80 days at 55°C, only two distributions were observed, with dl,v of 3.07 and 76 ?m. An additional study using pure HSA at different concentrations (0.3, 2.5, 5 and 10% w/v) and storage at 75°C was performed to determine the influence of the concentration of auxiliary substances and of the HSA. Only when the HSA concentration was 0.3% w/v did the remaining fraction of HSA fit a Prout-Thompkins nucleation model. Initially three distributions with mean sizes of 2, 20 and 40 ?m were observed whereas at the end of the assay only one distribution, mean size 129 ?m, was seen. The methodology used enabled us to separate the HSA degradation products and to determine the absolute molecular weight of albumin monomer and dimer. It is possible to conclude that the degradation mechanism for the formulations studied is complex, and that it is possible to fit the degradation data to Prout-Thompkins kinetics only when the concentration of HSA is low enough (0.3% w/v).

AB  - Abstract Aims To investigate socio-economic disparities in smoking in pregnancy (SIP) by the mother's education, occupational class and current economic conditions. Design Cross-sectional analysis with linked survey and register data. Setting South-western Finland. Participants A total of 2667 pregnant women [70% of the original sample (n = 3808)] from FinnBrain, a prospective pregnancy cohort study. Measurements The outcome was smoking during the first pregnancy trimester, measured from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Education and occupational class were linked from population registers. Income support recipiency and subjective economic wellbeing were questionnaire-based measures of current economic conditions. These were adjusted for age, partnership status, residential area type, parental separation, parity, childhood socio-economic background, childhood adversities (the Trauma and Distressing Events During Childhood scale) and antenatal stress (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). Logistic regressions and attributable fractions (AF) were estimated. Findings Mother's education was the strongest socio-economic predictor of SIP. Compared with university education, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of SIP were: 2.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2?3.9; P = 0.011] for tertiary vocational education, 4.4 (95% CI = 2.1?9.0; P < 0.001) for combined general and vocational secondary education, 2.9 (95% CI = 1.4?6.1; P = 0.006) for general secondary education, 9.5 (95% CI 5.0?18.2; P < 0.001) for vocational secondary education and 14.4 (95% CI = 6.3?33.0; P < 0.001) for compulsory schooling. The total AF of education was 0.5. Adjusted for the other variables, occupational class and subjective economic wellbeing did not predict SIP. Income support recipiency was associated positively with SIP (aOR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1?3.1; P = 0.022). Antenatal stress predicted SIP (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.4?2.8; P < 0.001), but did not attenuate its socio-economic disparities. Conclusions In Finland, socio-economic disparities in smoking in pregnancy are attributable primarily to differences in the mother's educational level (low versus high) and orientation (vocational versus general).

AB  - Summary The prevalence of underlying renal disease in pregnancy is estimated to be as high as 3%. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal death are increased. Although data are limited, current evidence indicates that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy serum creatinine is the best predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes are progressively worse with higher stages of chronic kidney disease. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize the well-being of both patients: the mother and her fetus. Pregnancies complicated by dialysis and renal transplant warrant special considerations. Effective contraception and evidence-based preconception counseling are important.
