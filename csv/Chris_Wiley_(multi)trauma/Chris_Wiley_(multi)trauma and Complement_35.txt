AB  - Comparison of the University of California (Los Angeles) shoulder scale and the simple shulder test with shoulder pain and disability index: Single-administration reliability and validity. (Texas Woman's University, Houston, TX) Phys Ther. 2000;80:759?768. This study compared 2 shoulder measures?the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale and the Simple Shoulder Test (SST)?with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). One hundred ninety-two patients with shoulder disorders were recruited from one physician's office to complete the self-report sections of the 3 scales. Cronbach alpha values and standard errors of measurements (SEM) were calculated for each of the multi-item subscales. Validity was examined through calculation of correlation coefficients among the 3 scales. Factor analysis was completed to assess the underlying constructs of the SPADI and SST. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. The SEM values for the multi-item scales ranged from 4.75 to 11.65. Evidence for validity to reflect function was indicated by the correlation between the SST and the SPADI disability subscale. The factor analysis of the SPADI revealed loading on 1 factor, whereas the SST loaded on 2 factors. Conclude that all scales demonstrated good internal consistency, suggesting that all items for each scale measure the same constract. However, SEMS for all scales were high. Factor loading was consistent, suggesting that patients may not distinguish between pain and function. Comment by Philip S. Sizer Jr., MED, PT. Clinical practitioners are leaning toward evaluating functional status versus a pure-impairment-based approach to appraising shoulder limitations. Several scales have been developed for the evaluation of shoulder function, including the University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Scale (UCLA), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Investigations demonstrating the psychometric properties of these scales are limited in number. These investigators attempted to assess those properties, including internal consistency, reliability, and validity for all 3 scales. The analyses demonstrated internal consistency and construct homogeneity for the SPADI. However, all 3 scales demonstrated rather large standard errors of measure, which questions the reliability of the scales for measurement of an individual's progress. Regarding construct validity, the SPADI does not appear to distinguish between pain and dysfunction, disqualifying its use as a gold standard for comparison with other scales. While the SST purports to measure a single construct, the data suggests that it appears to measure 2 different constructs namely function and comfort. Additionally, the analyses appear to demonstrate that, while the scales may attempt to measure the same constructs, they apparently do not. Finally, the authors suggest that the precision of the UCLA scale is inferior to the other 2 scales and insufficient for following the progress of individual patients in the clinical setting.

AB  - Summary The prevalence of underlying renal disease in pregnancy is estimated to be as high as 3%. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal death are increased. Although data are limited, current evidence indicates that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy serum creatinine is the best predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes are progressively worse with higher stages of chronic kidney disease. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize the well-being of both patients: the mother and her fetus. Pregnancies complicated by dialysis and renal transplant warrant special considerations. Effective contraception and evidence-based preconception counseling are important.

AB  - Summary Psychotherapy in children with cancer begins with a review of the factors that make this a unique group and how they impact the therapy, therapist and therapeutic relationship. The process begins with a thorough evaluation, including an assessment of the characteristics of the patient, the psychopathology and the nature and history of the medical illness. Additionally, developmental stages and abilities must be evaluated and taken into consideration throughout the process. The evaluation drives the process of designing a therapeutic intervention. Interventions may include all modalities and durations of time and often change as the needs and issues in this population evolves through the course of treatment and even in to the post treatment period. Given the variability of diagnosis and developmental issues within the paediatric cohort consideration should be given to a multi-disciplinary approach to intervention when possible. Finally it is important to recognise the impact of working with this population on the therapist. It not only puts the therapist at risk for burnout and vicarious traumatisation but it may also contribute to counter-transference in the therapy.

AB  - Abstract Radiation-induced skin reactions are an unavoidable side effect of external beam radiation therapy, particularly in areas prone to friction and excess moisture such as the axilla, head and neck region, perineum and skin folds. Clinical studies investigating interventions for preventing or managing these reactions have largely focussed on formulations with moisturising, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and wound healing properties. However, none of these interventions has emerged as a consistent candidate for best practice. Much less emphasis has been placed on evaluating ways to protect the radiation-damaged skin from friction and excess moisture. This mini review analyses the clinical evidence for barrier products that form a protective layer by adhering very closely to the skin folds and do not cause further trauma to the radiation-damaged skin upon removal. A database search identified only two types of barrier products that fitted these criteria and these were tested in two case series and six controlled clinical trials. Friction protection was most effective when the interventions were used from the start of treatment and continued for several weeks after completion of treatment. Soft silicone dressings (Mepilex Lite and Mepitel Film) and Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film, but not Cavilon Moisturizing Barrier Cream, decreased skin reaction severity, most likely due to differences in formulation and skin build-up properties. It seems that prophylactic use of friction protection of areas at risk could be a worthwhile addition to routine care of radiation-damaged skin.

AB  - Summary The choice of oxygen carrier particles is a key parameter for the process development of chemical looping combustion (CLC) to allow for minimization of cost. This chapter discusses in depth the oxygen carrier structure as affected by thermal and chemical stresses encountered in chemical looping systems. It focuses on hematite and hematite-based oxygen carriers, understanding how thermal and chemical stresses affect the structure of the oxygen carriers, and its importance to activity and mechanical stability in chemical looping processes. Among various reasons why attrition is undesirable in a CLC system, the greatest is the cost required to replace the attrited oxygen carrier. To complement the attrition modeling approaches, experimental techniques to quantitatively and qualitatively compare materials are needed. Most experimental test rigs for attrition are intended to isolate either abrasion- or impact-based attrition mechanisms.

AB  - Purpose? To review the experience with laparoscopic splenectomy, to determine it?s efficacy for treating immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP) and to highlight key technical issues with the operation. Methodology? All splenectomies performed between 1992 and 2005 were identified from the Otago Surgical Audit and the clinical notes reviewed, including the laboratory records for follow-up data related to the haematologic cases. Results? There were 289 splenectomies performed over the 13 year period. The indications were trauma (111, 38%), haematologic disease (93, 32%), incidental (40, 14%) splenic malignancy (39, 13%), and other (8, 3%). Of the 68 patients with ITP, 49 (72%) had a lateral laparoscopic splenectomy (LLS) with no conversions, a 5% complication rate and one mortality. Based on platelet counts and the requirement for maintenance steroids there was a complete response in 44 (68%) patients at >6 months, a partial response in 16 (24%) and no response in 5 (8%) patients. A short video presentation will highlight the key steps for the safe and efficient performance of the LLS, including patient and port positioning, the use of ultrasonic dissection, splenic pedicle stapling, and morcellation. The indications for hand-port assisted laparoscopic and open splenectomy will be discussed. Conclusions? The LLS is the preferred approach to splenectomy for all but massive splenomegaly and can be performed safely with careful attention to key technical issues.

AB  - Summary.? An obstetric hemorrhage may occur before or after delivery, but more than 80% of cases occur postpartum. Worldwide, a massive obstetric hemorrhage, resulting from the failure of normal obstetrical, surgical and/or systemic hemostasis, is responsible for 25% of the estimated 358?000 maternal deaths each year. Most women will not have identifiable risk factors. Nonetheless, primary prevention of a postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) begins with an assessment of identifiable risk factors. Women identified as being at high risk of a PPH should be delivered in a center with access to adequately trained staff and an onsite blood bank. A critical feature of a massive hemorrhage in obstetrics is the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which, in contrast to DIC that develops with hemorrhage from surgery or trauma, is frequently an early feature. Data from clinical trials to guide management of transfusion in PPH are lacking. There are likely to be similarities in the management of transfusion in severe PPH to that of major bleeding in other clinical situations, but the pathophysiological processes that contribute to a massive PPH may necessitate different transfusion strategies such as the ratio of red blood cells to plasma components, in particular fibrinogen. Caution should be exercised when considering the appropriate place for recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in the management of a major PPH. An early hysterectomy is recommended for severe bleeding as a result of placenta accreta or uterine rupture. However, in women with uterine atony who have ongoing bleeding in spite of an adequate transfusion, it may be reasonable to consider a trial of rFVIIa before a hysterectomy.

AB  - Summary The term epidermolysis bullosa (EB) includes a group of rare genodermatoses characterized by mutational impairment of the structural and functional integrity of intraepidermal adhesion and dermoepidermal anchorage. Clinically, these disorders are marked by increased skin fragility as well as characteristic mechanically inducible blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. Extracutaneous manifestations and their complications in other epithelialized organs render EB a multi-system disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cornerstones of a dynamically changing healthcare structure include precise and early diagnosis; coordinated, multidisciplinary, individually adjusted patient care at specialized centers; optimized symptomatic therapies; and access to research-based, potentially curative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) proenzyme circulates in plasma as a heterotetramer composed of two each of A and B subunits. Upon activation, the B subunits dissociate from the A subunit dimer, which gains transglutaminase activity to cross-link preformed fibrin clots increasing mechanical strength and resistance to degradation. The B subunits are thought to possess a carrier/protective function before FXIII activation. Mutations in either A or B subunits are associated with pathological patient phenotypes characterized by mild to severe bleeding. In vitro expression of FXIII B subunit (FXIIIB) missense variants in HEK293T cells revealed impaired secretion for all seven variants studied. To investigate the likely molecular environments of the missense residues, we created molecular models of individual FXIIIB Sushi domains using phylogenetically similar complement factor H Sushi domain structural templates. Assessment of the local molecular environments for the models suggested surface or buried positions for each mutant residue and possible pathological mechanisms. The in vitro expression system and in silico analytical methods and models we developed can be used to further investigate the molecular basis of FXIIIB mutation pathologies.

An integrative practice model is proposed where contextual approaches like systemic and narrative therapy complement and enrich individual problem-focused models such as biological psychiatry and cognitive therapy. This is based on an ethic of hospitality towards all therapy discourses and the following best practice guideline: ?To make optimum space for a systemic and narrative understanding contributes to evidence-based practice in a contemporary mental health service.? After discussing some dilemmas of integrative practice, I illustrate the therapeutic process by a detailed example of integrative family therapy with a depressed suicidal adolescent.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012; 42 (3): 290?302 Abstract Background and aims? Studies suggest clinical benefits of parenteral fish oil (FO), rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), over soyabean oil (SO), rich in n-6 PUFAs, in patients with pro-inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Because the mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear, the present study explored the effects of intravenous infusion of FO and SO on fatty acid incorporation, immune functions and (anti)oxidant balance in healthy human volunteers. Methods? Saline, a SO emulsion and a FO emulsion were administered for one hour on three consecutive days at a rate of 0·2?g/kg?BW/h to eight subjects in a randomized cross-over design with a 3-week interval between treatments. Plasma phospholipid and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fatty acid compositions, and leucocyte counts and functions were assessed prior to the first infusion (T?=?0, baseline) and 1?day (T?=?4, early effects) and 8?days (T?=?11, late effects) after the third infusion. Results? Fish oil infusion significantly increased n-3 PUFA proportions and decreased n-6 PUFA proportions in plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. There were no differences in immune functions or (anti)oxidant balance between treatments at any time. Conclusions? The present lipid infusion protocol appears to be safe and well tolerated and provides significant incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. In the absence of overt inflammation, no direct effects of FO were observed on immune function or (anti)oxidant balance. This model may be useful to evaluate effects of parenteral lipids in other settings, for example in individuals displaying an inflammatory state.

AB  - Abstract? Despite the best efforts of influenza scientists, companies and health officials to prepare for the next pandemic, most of the world?s people will not have access to affordable supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. They will have to rely on 19th century public health ?technologies? to see them through. In the 21st century, science ought to be able to provide something better. Influenza scientists study the molecular characteristics of influenza viruses and their signaling effects in cell culture and animal models of infection. While these studies have been enormously informative, they have been unable to explain the system-wide effects of influenza on the host, the increased mortality of younger adults in the 1918 influenza pandemic and the much lower mortality rates in children who were more commonly infected with the 1918 virus. Experiments by non-influenza scientists have defined common cell signaling pathways for acute lung injury caused by different agents, including inactivated H5N1 influenza virus. These pathways include several molecular targets that are up-regulated in acute lung injury and down-regulated by anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents, including statins, fibrates, and glitazones. These agents also help reverse the mitochondrial dysfunction that accompanies multi-organ failure, something often seen in fatal Influenza. Observational studies suggest that statins are beneficial in treating patients with pneumonia (there are no such studies for fibrates and glitazones). Other studies suggest that these agents might be able to ?roll back? the self-damaging host response of young adults to the less damaging response of children and thus save lives. Research is urgently needed to determine whether these and other agents that modify the host response might be useful in managing H5N1 influenza and the next pandemic.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the objectives and process of the rapidly growing Circles of Support and Accountability (COSA) program now implemented in Canada, some US states, England, Wales, Scotland, the Netherlands and a few other European countries. The chapter explores the connections of principle and purpose between COSA and the broader approach of restorative justice, as rehabilitative rather than retributive, and ?community-owned.? It also analyzes the ethical questions and theoretical principles, effectiveness and scope for future developments. Driving the development of COSA is an over-riding intention to prevent further sexual re-offending and the ongoing hurt and trauma that can stay for so long with those abused in childhood or their teenage years. It is the dependency upon volunteers, ordinary members of the community, to provide the transformational experience for someone with sexual convictions, from being the demonized social outcast to a safely functioning, albeit wary member of society.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and other cognitive functions in the elderly. The social and financial impacts of AD are overwhelming and are escalating exponentially as a result of population aging. Therefore, identifying AD-related risk factors and the development of more efficacious therapeutic approaches are critical to cure this neurological disorder. Current epidemiological evidence indicates that life experiences, including chronic stress, are a risk for AD. However, it is unknown if short-term stress, lasting for hours, influences the onset or progression of AD. Here, we determined the effect of short-term, multi-modal ?modern life-like? stress on AD pathogenesis and synaptic plasticity in mice bearing three AD mutations (the 3xTg-AD mouse model). We found that combined emotional and physical stress lasting 5 h severely impaired memory in wild-type mice and tended to impact it in already low-performing 3xTg-AD mice. This stress reduced the number of synapse-bearing dendritic spines in 3xTg-AD mice and increased A? levels by augmenting A?PP processing. Thus, short-term stress simulating modern-life conditions may exacerbate cognitive deficits in preclinical AD by accelerating amyloid pathology and reducing synapse numbers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High concentrations of lactate approx. 10?mM are characteristic of wound healing. We have previously shown that lactate instigates release of VEGF from macrophages and endothelial cells. Our present study uses an in vivo murine Matrigel model to study how lactate enhances vascular development and repair. METHODS: Matrigel is a reconstituted basement membrane complex, a liquid at 4 degree C. When injected subcutaneously, it reconstitutes as a gel. 30?mgs of finely divided polylactate polymer (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was mixed with 1cc of Matrigel, and 2 injections were made into the dorsum of each of 60 (average 7/group), 6-month-old Swiss Webster mice. The gel implants were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 11 and 16 days post injection, and were fixed in buffered formalin or frozen. Cell migration and vascular development were assessed using H&E, anti-CD31 and anti-MAC3 antibody stainings for leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Cells and vessels were quantified microscopically. RESULTS: Control implants (without polylactate) developed little or no inflammation or angiogenesis. Polylactated implants developed highly significant number of endothelial cells and recognizable vessels at 6 and 9 days. At 11 and 16 days, sizeable vessels with surrounding connective tissue were found. Though a moderate inflammation occurred in the lactate groups, no foreign body reaction was seen. Larger implants of high molecular weight instigated little inflammation and few vessels. CONCLUSION: Slowly released lactate leads to the formation of new vessels. Our results provide support for further clinical applications of lactate polymer in wounds. NIH/NIGMS Trauma Training Grant

AB  - Summary Background All health care professionals in the UK are expected to have the medical leadership and management (MLM) skills necessary for improving patient care, as stipulated by the UK General Medical Council (GMC). Context Newly graduated doctors reported insufficient knowledge about leadership and quality improvement skills, despite all UK medical schools reporting that MLM is taught within their curriculum. Innovation A medical student society organised a series of extracurricular educational events focusing on leadership topics. The society recognised that the events needed to be useful and interesting to attract audiences. Therefore, clinical leaders in exciting fields were invited to talk about their experiences and case studies of personal leadership challenges. The emphasis on personal stories, from respected leaders, was a deliberate strategy to attract students and enhance learning. Evaluation data were collected from the audiences to improve the quality of the events and to support a business case for an intercalated degree in MLM. Implications When leadership and management concepts are taught through personal stories, students find it interesting and are prepared to give up their leisure time to engage with the subject. Students appear to recognise the importance of MLM knowledge to their future careers, and are able to organise their own, and their peers?, learning and development. Organising these events and collecting feedback can provide students with opportunities to practise leadership, management and quality improvement skills. These extracurricular events, delivered through a student society, allow for subjects to be discussed in more depth and can complement an already crowded undergraduate curriculum. Newly graduated doctors reported insufficient knowledge about leadership and quality improvement skills

AB  - A fourteen-year-old female presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Biopsies of the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, characterized by para-cortical fibrinous necrosis with karyorrhectic debris and histiocytic palisading, and paucity of the polymorphic neutrophils. She also developed concurrent skin lesions with scattered small non-itching vesicles and blisters over her back and lower legs. A punch biopsy revealed vacuolar interface changes, sub-epidermal blister formation, mild superficial perivascular infiltration, and follicle necrosis. Karyorrhectic debris and CD68-positive cells are noted around the follicle. A direct immunofluorescent study was negative for complement or immunoglobulin depositions. The patient was diagnosed as Kikuchi-Fujimoto?s disease, or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, a benign self-limited lymph node disorder most commonly occurred in young females. Patients with Kikuchi?s disease are typically presented with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying fever. Multiple lymph node involvement, splenomegaly and/or cutaneous lesions are rare occurrences. The present patient experienced a severe inflammatory response syndrome manifested by respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She recovered completely after two weeks of intensive medical treatment. She has had no respiratory symptoms, residual lymphadenopathies or documented skin lesions in her follow-up three months after discharge.
