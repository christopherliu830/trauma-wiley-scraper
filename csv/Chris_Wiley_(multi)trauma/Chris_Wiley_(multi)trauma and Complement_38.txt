AB  - Aims The use of incretin-based therapy, rather than or complementary to, insulin therapy is an active area of research in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We determined the glycaemic efficacy and safety of linagliptin compared to a basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalized surgical patients with T2D. Materials and Methods This prospective open-label multicentre study randomized T2D patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with admission blood glucose (BG) of 7.8 to 22.2 mmol/L who were under treatment with diet, oral agents or total insulin dose (TDD) ≤ 0.5 units/kg/day to either linagliptin (n = 128) daily or basal-bolus (n = 122) with glargine once daily and rapid-acting insulin before meals. Both groups received supplemental insulin for BG > 7.8 mmol/L. The primary endpoint was difference in mean daily BG between groups. Results Mean daily BG was higher in the linagliptin group compared to the basal-bolus group (9.5 ± 2.6 vs 8.8 ± 2.3 mmol/L/dL, P = 0.03) with a mean daily BG difference of 0.6 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.04, 1.2). In patients with randomization BG < 11.1 mmol/L (63% of cohort), mean daily BG was similar in the linagliptin and basal-bolus groups (8.9 ± 2.3 vs 8.7 ± 2.3 mmol/L, P = 0.43); however, patients with BG ≥ 11.1 mmol/L who were treated with linagliptin had higher BG compared to the basal-bolus group (10.9 ± 2.6 vs 9.2 ± 2.2 mmol/L, P < 0.001). Linagliptin resulted in fewer hypoglycaemic events (1.6% vs 11%, P = 0.001; 86% relative risk reduction), with similar supplemental insulin and fewer daily insulin injections (2.0 ± 3.3 vs 3.1 ± 3.3, P < 0.001) compared to the basal-bolus group. Conclusions For patients with T2D undergoing non-cardiac surgery who presented with mild to moderate hyperglycaemia (BG < 11.1 mmol/L), daily linagliptin is a safe and effective alternative to multi-dose insulin therapy, resulting in similar glucose control with lower hypoglycaemia.

AB  - Positive and negative expectancies drive behavioral and neurobiological placebo and nocebo effects, which in turn can have profound effects on patient improvement or worsening. However, expectations of events and outcomes are often not met in daily life and clinical practice. It is currently unknown how this affects placebo and nocebo effects. We have demonstrated that the violation of expectancies, such as when there is a discrepancy between what is expected and what is actually presented, reduces both placebo and nocebo effects while causing an extinction of placebo effects. The reduction of placebo and nocebo effects was paralleled by an activation of the left inferior parietal cortex, a brain region that redirects attention when discrepancies between sensory and cognitive events occur. Our findings highlight the importance of expectancy violation in shaping placebo and nocebo effects and open up new avenues for managing positive and negative expectations in clinical trials and practices.

AB  - Abstract Background: Several studies have been published on the effects of psychotherapy in routine practice. Complementing traditional views summarised as ?dose-effect models?, Stiles et al. put forward data consistent with the responsive regulation model underlining the importance of the client's active participant role in defining length of treatment. One may ask what level of change reached by a patient is considered to be the ?good enough level? (GEL) and if it is related to the duration of psychotherapy. Aims: The main objective of the present feasibility trial was to monitor the patient's session-by-session evolution using a self-report questionnaire in order to define the GEL, i.e. the number of sessions necessary for the patient to reach significant change. Method: A total of N=13 patients undergoing psychotherapy in routine practice participated in the study, completing the Outcome Questionnaire ? 45.2 (OQ-45), which assesses the symptom level, interpersonal relationships and social role after every psychotherapy session. The data was analysed using multi-level analyses (HLMs). Results: High feasibility of fine-grained assessment of effects of psychotherapy in routine practice in Switzerland was shown; response rates being acceptable; however, detailed analysis of the GEL was not feasible within the short study time-frame. Conclusions: Reflections on the political context of monitoring in the specific case of routine psychiatric practice in Switzerland are discussed.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted to heart transplant recipients by donor organs. Mid-term results were reported using HCV-positive donors in patients at risk of imminent death (group I, n?=?10), or in patients who otherwise would not have been offered heart transplantation (group II, n?=?10) because of age (9/10) or associated medical risk (1/10). Medical records pertaining to patients receiving HCV-positive allografts between July 1994 and December 1999 were reviewed. The recipients consisted of 19 males and one female, with a median age of 54?years for group I and 66 for group II. The HCV RNA level, seroconversion of anti-HCV antibody, biochemical liver dysfunction, and causes of death were examined. Older recipients received reduced immunosuppression. Two patients in group II were HCV positive and were also retransplants. The hospital mortality rate was 10% in group I and 20% in group II; both hepatitis C-positive recipients died postoperatively prior to discharge. All predischarge deaths were related to multi-system organ failure (MSOF). All 17 survivors were HCV negative prior to transplant. Of these, 4/17 seroconverted. HCV RNA was detected in two of them. At a median follow-up of 26.4?months, 2/11 current survivors continue to test anti-HCV positive and are RNA negative. Three-year actual survival was 40% for group I and 70% in group II. Transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD) accounted for one postoperative death in group I. Current data show that four out of 11 survivors had developed TCAD at 3-year follow-up, yielding an actual freedom from TCAD rate of 12/17 (70%) at 3-year follow-up. Hepatitis C transmission using a donor heart as the reservoir is moderate (25%). Limited use of such donors is justified in selected patients. The risk for hepatic disease may be reduced by tailoring immunosuppression specifically for such recipients, particularly if they are at low risk of rejection. Further studies are necessary to define a possible association between HCV and TCAD.

AB  - This Annotation highlights recent research on the role of peer group and friendship factors in the development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. Several processes are considered, including peer rejection (e.g., exclusion and victimization), social withdrawal and avoidance of peer interaction, and the socialization of deviant behavior and internalizing problems. The mediating influences of several proximal components are examined, including cognitive-perceptual factors and emotion regulation. In addition, the moderating ifluences of close friendship, age, gender, ethnicity, and group norms are considered. Several promising avenues for future directions in research are highlighted, including the examination of heterogeneity in developmental processes, further investigation of gender-based norms, and the application of multi-level modeling techniques and gene-environment process models.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? To review the literature and identify opportunities for nutritional practice improvement in the critically ill and opportunities to improve nurses? knowledge relating to enteral feeding. Background.? The literature reports varying nutritional practices in intensive care. Design.? Systematic review. Methods.? A systematic search, selection, analysis and review of nursing, medical and dietetic primary research articles was undertaken. Fifteen studies met the selection criteria. Results.? Delivery of nutrition to the critically ill varied widely. Patients were frequently underfed and less frequently, overfed. Both under- and overfeeding have been linked with unacceptable consequences including infections, extended weaning from mechanical ventilation, increased length of stay and increased mortality. Underfeeding was related to slow initiation and advancement of nutrition support and avoidable feed interruptions. The most common reasons for interrupting feeds were gastrointestinal intolerance and fasting for procedures. Certain nursing practices contributed to underfeeding such as the management of gastric residual volumes. Conclusions.? Consistent and reliable nutrition support in intensive care units is hampered by a lack of evidence leading to varying nutrition practices. Factors impeding delivery of enteral nutrition were considered avoidable. A new concept of a therapeutic range of energy delivery in the critically ill has emerged implying the need for re-evaluation of energy recommendations and improved delivery of enteral nutrition. Relevance to clinical practice.? This review supports the multi-disciplinary development and implementation of an evidence-based enteral feeding protocol in intensive care units as a strategy to improve adequacy of nutritional intake. Critical care nurses are well placed to improve this process.

AB  - Development of inhibitors against factor VIII (FVIII), the major complication of haemophilia A treatment today, is influenced by multiple factors. Genetic (F8 mutation, family history, ethnicity, polymorphisms in immune modulating genes) and non-genetic (intensive exposure to FVIII, presence of pro-inflammatory signals as might occur with large bleeds, infections, surgery, or other immune stimulants [e.g. vaccines]) risk factors as well as their complex inter-relationships contribute to the inhibitor risk profile of haemophilia patients, particularly in the previously untreated patient (PUP) population. Studies in PUPs have been fundamental to furthering the understanding of FVIII inhibitor development, as well as discovering previously unappreciated risk factors. The multi-factorial nature of inhibitor development makes it difficult to ascertain the contribution of FVIII products in inhibitor development through individual PUP studies. Sufficiently powered studies of large cohorts may overcome these limitations but interpretations should be conducted cautiously. Proper design and implementation of PUP safety studies will become even more important with the introduction of new molecules, such as extended half-life or human cell-line derived FVIII that propose reduced immunogenicity. Despite these difficulties, carefully performed clinical studies in PUPs may provide important insights into the natural history of the immune response to FVIII and may suggest targets for intervention to reduce immunogenicity.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) has been used to study tumor response to treatment for many years. In this study, the modified full width at half-maximum (mFWHM), calculated from the wash-in slope histogram, is proposed as a parameter for the evaluation of changes in tumor heterogeneity which respond to radiotherapy. Twenty-five patients with brain tumors were evaluated and divided into the nonresponder group (n?=?11) and the responder group (n?=?14) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All selected tumors were evaluated by mFWHM ratios of post- to pre-therapy (the ratio was defined as the therapeutic mFWHM ratio, TMR). The changes in kurtosis of the histograms and the averaged Ktrans within a tumor were also calculated for comparison. The receiver operating characteristic analysis and Kaplan?Meier curves were used to examine the diagnosis ability. The TMR values were significantly higher in nonresponders than in responders (p?<?0.001). When compared with the other two parameters, the proposed method also demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity. When adopting the TMR for the estimation of prognosis after therapy, there was a significant difference between the population survival curves. In conclusion, the derived mFWHM reflects tumor heterogeneity, and the ability to depict patient survival probability from TMR corresponds well with that from RECIST. The results reveal that, in brain tumors, progression may be exhibited not only by tumor size, but also by tumor heterogeneity. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper, through spatial-analysis techniques, examines the accessibility of emergency shelters for vulnerable populations, and outlines the benefits of an extended and permanently established shelter network in central Mozambique. The raster-based modelling approach considers data on land cover, locations of accommodation centres in 2000, settlements and infrastructure. The shelter analysis is a two-step process determining access for vulnerable communities first, followed by a suitability analysis for additional emergency shelter sites. The results indicate the need for both retrofitting existing infrastructure (schools, health posts) to function as shelters during an emergency, and constructing new facilities ? at best multi-purpose facilities that can serve as social infrastructure and shelter. Besides assessing the current situation in terms of availability and accessibility of emergency shelters, this paper provides an example of evaluating the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance without conventional mechanisms like food tonnage and number of beneficiaries.

AB  - Summary Many neurological diseases share pathological processes that require an understanding of genetics or immunity. This chapter considers these from the perspective of the molecular lesion rather than the clinical manifestation. It examines abnormalities of ion channels, which can be affected by either inherited mutations or autoantibodies. The chapter then deals with genetic disorders and neuro-immunology. Genetic diseases can be divided into five main categories: Abnormalities in the structure or complement of chromosomes (chromosomal disorders), Mutations or other defects affecting a gene; Nucleotide repeat expansions; Mendelian disorders that are likely to be caused by digenic or epistatic inheritance; and Conditions in which genetic and environmental factors interact.The immune system distinguishes the self from non-self organisms and acts to delete, disable or inactivate foreign invaders. Neurological channelopathies potentially identify signalling pathways and circuits involved in diseases that account for a large fraction of neurological practice.

AB  - Abstract Acute limb ischaemia poses a threat to both the limb and life of a patient. Until recently, attempted revascularization by thrombo-embolectomy or vascular reconstruction held the best chance of limb salvage. Thrombolytic techniques afford an alternative method of management for this condition and are effective in selected patients. Low-dose intra-arterial streptokinase is the most established method of thrombolysis, although the recently developed tissue plasminogen activator offers a promising alternative. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is not an easy option, being labour intensive and requiring close co-operation between surgeon and radiologist. Thrombolytic and surgical techniques are not mutually exclusive but are best used to complement each other. Ideally patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by surgeons with knowledge of, and access to, optimal current surgical and non-surgical techniques.

AB  - Abstract The goal of the 2019 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Consensus Conference was to explore the current cultural and systemic issues in Emergency Medicine that impact the individual well-being of every emergency physician, and to make recommendations for future study. Burnout is epidemic in emergency medicine. Physician wellness is required to enhance patient clinical outcomes as well as to ensure professional satisfaction and longevity. For conference preparation, a consensus steering committee was created, and a decision was made to use the groundbreaking model of the National Academy of Medicine's ?Factors Affecting Clinician Well-Being and Resilience? to further identify areas of needed study. On May 14, 2019, the Wellness Consensus Conference was attended by over 50 faculty physicians from across the US. These attendees discussed key concepts and prior research presented by content experts. Groups of participants engaged in crowdsourcing techniques to consolidate ideas derived from those discussions. These consensus concepts were recorded and are presented within this article. A repetitive theme noted at the conference was the overwhelming effect of the system and organization factors on individual physician well-being. The concept of ongoing assessment of professional fulfillment over the lifespan of the emergency physician was felt to be crucial in guiding wellness and resilience interventions in a timely manner. Examining ways to enable physicians to flourish rather than experience burnout are strong future directions for study.

AB  - Introduction:? Electric fields of the magnitude likely to occur in electrical injury can result in skeletal muscle electroporation. It has been reported that Poloxamer 188 (P188) is able to seal damaged cell membranes. Using a previously described rat hind limb model of electrical injury, in this study we employ MRI to demonstrate that intravenously administered P188 arrests muscle tissue edema caused by electrical shock. Methods:? Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat hindlimbs were subjected to 12 electrical shock pulses of 2?kV and ?2A amplitude with duration of 4?ms. There was a 10-second separation period between shocks to allow thermal relaxation. Animals received either P188 or Lactated Ringer?s Injection (control) intravenously at 60 minutes after shock. Proton MRI were recorded using a 4.7-Tesla Bruker scanner (200?MHz). A Multi-Slice Multi-Echo (MSME) spin echo sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted images. Ten slices over the entire midthigh region were taken. For each slice, images from 10 echos in the TE range of 10?ms?100?ms and TR?=?2000?ms were collected. Imaging began at 60 minutes and continued until 3 hours postshock. The signal intensities at different TE times were used to fit an exponential decay and measure the T2 value in each voxel. Voxels with T2 values?>?80?ms were considered injured. Results:? There were noticeable increases of injured area with time for electrically injured limbs due to development of edema. Control-treated rats averaged a 58.0%(±6.59% SD) increase in total area of injury. The total area of injury for P188-treated rats increased by 46.6%(±2.96% SD) In nonelectroporation limbs, no change in T2 occurred. Discussion:? Disruption of the plasma membrane due to electrical current leads to edema. We treated the injured muscles with P188 and observed that it helped to arrest edema. MRI proved effective not only in characterizing the degree of injury resulting from electrical shock but also in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Occupations characterized by a static low load and by repetitive actions show a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in the neck?shoulder region. Moreover, muscle fatigue and discomfort are reported to play a relevant initiating role in WMSD. Aims: To investigate relationships between altered sensory information, i.e. localized muscle fatigue, discomfort and pain and their associations to changes in motor control patterns. Materials & Methods:? In total 101 subjects participated. Questionnaires, subjective assessments of perceived exertion and pain intensity as well as surface electromyography (SEMG), mechanomyography (MMG), force and kinematics recordings were performed. Results:? Multi-channel SEMG and MMG revealed that the degree of heterogeneity of the trapezius muscle activation increased with fatigue. Further, the spatial organization of trapezius muscle activity changed in a dynamic manner during sustained contraction with acute experimental pain. A graduation of the motor changes in relation to the pain stage (acute, subchronic and chronic) and work experience were also found. The duration of the work task was shorter in presence of acute and chronic pain. Acute pain resulted in decreased activity of the painful muscle while in subchronic and chronic pain, a more static muscle activation was found. Posture and movement changed in the presence of neck?shoulder pain. Larger and smaller sizes of arm and trunk movement variability were respectively found in acute pain and subchronic/chronic pain. The size and structure of kinematics variability decreased also in the region of discomfort. Motor variability was higher in workers with high experience. Moreover, the pattern of activation of the upper trapezius muscle changed when receiving SEMG/MMG biofeedback during computer work. Discussion:? SEMG and MMG changes underlie functional mechanisms for the maintenance of force during fatiguing contraction and acute pain that may lead to the widespread pain seen in WMSD. A lack of harmonious muscle recruitment/derecruitment may play a role in pain transition. Motor behavior changed in shoulder pain conditions underlining that motor variability may play a role in the WMSD development as corroborated by the changes in kinematics variability seen with discomfort. This prognostic hypothesis was further, supported by the increased motor variability among workers with high experience. Conclusion:? Quantitative assessments of the functional motor adaptations can be a way to benchmark the pain status and help to indentify signs indicating WMSD development. Motor variability is an important characteristic in ergonomic situations. Future studies will investigate the potential benefit of inducing motor variability in occupational settings.
