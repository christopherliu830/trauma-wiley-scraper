AB  - Reasons for performing study Interpretation of clinical diagnostic imaging of the equine musculoskeletal system requires accurate reference anatomical materials. In the case of MRI, this includes images acquired from low and high field systems. Using ultra-high field MRI, higher resolution images with small slice thickness and gap suitable for reconstruction in any anatomical plane can be produced. Objectives To describe the normal equine metacarpophalangeal joint using ultra-high field MRI and compare ultra-high and high field MR images. Study design Limbs (n?=?14) from horses (n?=?5) with no history of orthopaedic disease were frozen at -20°C until imaging. Fetlock joints were scanned using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI unit. T1 (280 slices, thickness?=?0.356?mm) and T2 (140 slices, thickness?=?0.713?mm) weighted sequences were acquired. Limbs were scanned using a 1.5T MRI unit in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes using T1 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) and T2 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) sequences. Images were analysed using OsiriX software. Results Ultra-high field MR images visualised the fine detail of trabecular and subchondral bone, the articular cartilage surface of P1 and McIII, the short, oblique, straight and oblique sesamoidean ligaments including origins and insertions, the fasicular structure of superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon and ligaments and the regional neurovascular structures. Whilst T1 high field images visualised the majority of tissues, structural detail was reduced compared to ultra-high field imaging, margins were less well defined in some instances, e.g. articular cartilage, and a number of smaller structures were indistinct, e.g. short and cruciate sesamoidean ligaments. Conclusions 7T MRI produced images of the fetlock with excellent anatomical detail. Future publication of open-source ultra-high field MRI files could aid the interpretation of 0.3T and 1.5T field MR images, especially with the capacity to reconstruct image slices orientated exactly to match those of interest.

AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little is reported about the successes and challenges experienced by veterinary surgeons while managing cases of laminitis. Such information could enhance the effectiveness of communication of management and preventive health strategies for laminitis. Objectives To explore veterinary surgeons? experiences of dealing with laminitis and examine how veterinary?client communication influences the treatment and management of cases. Study design Focus group discussions conducted among first-opinion equine veterinary surgeons. Methods First-opinion ambulatory veterinary practices from Cheshire (n?=?15), Lancashire (n?=?14) and the Rutland region (n?=?14) were identified. Letters of invitation were sent and all practices were telephoned to invite veterinary surgeons to participate in the study. Key questions relating to laminitis were explored within semi-structured focus group discussions: veterinary perceptions of laminitis information, reasons for horse-owners? seeking veterinary advice, veterinary perceptions of horse-owners? knowledge, attitudes and practices, situations where the advice of other professionals may be sought. All discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Results Three focus group discussions were held with veterinary surgeons with a range of experience; 2 in the North West (9 vets) and one in Rutland (4 vets). Emerging themes relating to veterinary surgeons? experience of dealing with laminitis included; veterinary?client communication, challenges faced by vets, managing clients perceptions and expectations, client recognition and management of laminitis, feeding and obesity management, issues of compliance, causes of laminitis, strategies to prevent laminitis, diagnosing, treating and prognosticating in laminitis cases, sources of veterinary information and collaboration with other professionals. Conclusions The findings illustrate key features of the veterinary?client relationship in supporting owners through the variable course of this disease. This study demonstrates the complexity of issues that veterinary surgeons may encounter when managing cases of laminitis and communicating healthcare messages to the client.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine general anaesthesia carries a higher risk of perioperative fatality compared with humans and companion animals. Multiple studies have examined the risk factors associated with general anaesthesia, most notably the ongoing confidential enquiry into perioperative equine fatalities (CEPEF) studies initially published by Johnston et?al. [1]. Desflurane is a modern inhalational anaesthetic with low solubility and potentially beneficial reduced cardiorespiratory effects, but its use in a large number of horses has not been investigated. Objectives To evaluate the perioperative mortality rates of horses undergoing general anaesthesia maintained using desflurane. Study design Retrospective analysis. Methods Anaesthetic records of all horses undergoing general anaesthesia over a 4-year period at a single hospital were retrospectively examined. Horses were excluded if general anaesthesia was not maintained using inhaled desflurane. Outcome variables of dead (anaesthetic related), alive or euthanased (for other reasons) were recorded consistent with previous CEPEF studies. Results 427 horses met the inclusion criteria, of which 406 (95.1%) were alive at 7 days post operatively, 16 (3.7%) were euthanased and 5 (1.2%) died. Four of the perioperative fatalities suffered cardiac arrest, one suffered a catastrophic fracture. Mean age was 7.6 years (range 1 month?26 years), mean weight was 503.3?kg (range 60?828?kg). Mean duration of anaesthesia was 63.0?min (range 15?200?min). Mean recovery time to standing was 28.3?min (range 5?70?min) with mean recovery score 1.4/5 (range 1?4). Conclusions Use of desflurane led to comparable mortality rates to other inhalational anaesthetics in this small number of horses at a single hospital. Further multicentre studies with larger numbers are warranted to examine any potential benefits.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of equine lameness frequently requires a period of rest and restricted exercise. The financial impact of restricted exercise should be considered when making investigation and treatment decisions. Objectives To describe and quantify the cost and time commitment associated with horse maintenance in the UK and to quantify the incidence of lameness and number of days of exercise lost. Study design Online survey of UK horse owners. Methods An online survey was performed between June and November 2013. The questionnaire contained 35 open and closed questions related to 1) owner age, gender, geographical location; and 2) type and use of horse, purchase price, location, travel, healthcare and maintenance costs; and 3) lameness episodes within the last 12 months. Results 560 respondents fully completed the questionnaire, 98.2% were female aged between 16 and 54 years old. Horses (62.5% geldings, 37.1% mares, 0.8% stallions) were of mixed breed with a median age of 13 years. Horses were predominantly used for general purpose riding. Most horses were kept on or within 5 miles of the owner's residence (77.4%) and 65% of owners spent >10?h per week on horse maintenance. Median basic maintenance cost was £2660 per year or £7.29 per day including routine healthcare, dentistry, farriery, feed, housing, and insurance fees. Most horses (71.3%) experienced an episode of lameness within the previous 12 months. The median duration of restricted exercise (days wasted) was 70 (range 0?880) days. Conclusions This unique dataset quantifies the financial and time outlay required with horse ownership. Determining the number of wasted days and basic average cost per day has allowed us to quantify the cost of inactivity. Considerable cost is associated with a period of inactivity following an episode of lameness, which should be taken into account when considering investigation and treatment options.

AB  - Mastectomy, body image and therapeutic massage: a qualitative study of women's experience Despite the wealth of literature concerning the impact of breast loss on a woman's body image, sexual and psychological adjustment, there have been few studies within the medical and nursing literature directly quoting a woman's private perspective; how in her words she experiences her changed body. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence-based interventions for addressing the problem of altered body image (ABI); healthcare professionals often feel at a loss in knowing how to help women cope ( Hopwood  a second phase piloted a massage intervention as a means of helping them adjust to living with their changed body image. Listening to their experience, in combination with the therapeutic massage, allowed deep access and insight into the nature of the women's trauma. The experiences of the three women in this study suggest there may be a group of women whose needs are overlooked and who, despite their prosthesis and reassurances that they are disease-free, opt to conceal the problems they have in living with a changed image. The availability of a body-centred therapy might help with certain aspects of adjustment as revealed by this study.

AB  - This review summarises the current understanding of immune response and T cell subsets in the context of development of autoimmunity in the dog. Mode of action and rational usage in immune-mediated disease in the dog are discussed for the following drugs: glucocorticoids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, human intravenous immunoglobulin, vincristine, danazol, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil and liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Disease mechanisms are discussed and published evidence for drug efficacy is scrutinised for five important immune-mediated diseases: immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, myasthenia gravis, glomerulonephritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Future strategies for more refined manipulation of adverse immune responses are presented.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Combinations of α2-adrenoceptor and opioid agonists are commonly used in equines, but there is little scientific information on this topic in donkeys. Objectives To compare the sedative and hypoalgesic effects of 4 dosages of butorphanol in xylazine-premedicated donkeys. Study design In vivo experiment. Methods Six donkeys received intravenous treatments: saline and saline (S-S); xylazine (0.5?mg/kg bwt) and saline (X-S); xylazine and butorphanol 10??g/kg bwt (X-B10); xylazine and butorphanol 20??g/kg bwt (X-B20); xylazine and butorphanol 30??g/kg bwt (X-B30); and xylazine and butorphanol 40??g/kg bwt (X-B40). Sedation score (0?3), head height above ground (HHAG), and mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNT) of the left metacarpus were assessed before and for 120?min after treatment. Areas under the curve (AUC) for 0?30, 30?60 and 60?120?min post treatment were computed for sedation scores (SS-AUC), HHAG (HHAG-AUC) and MNT (MNT-AUC). Differences between treatments were analysed using the Friedman test followed by Dunn's test and repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results All treatments except S-S induced sedation. Butorphanol treatments induced significantly greater SS-AUC0?30 values than those for S-S (P<0.05), but S-S and X-S SS-AUC0?30 values were not significantly different. The HHAG-AUC0?30 values for all treatments were smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.001). For HHAG-AUC30-60, only X-B40 values were significantly smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.05). Compared to S-S, all treatments increased MNT and yielded significantly higher MNT-AUC0?30 values (P<0.001). Treatment X-S yielded significantly lower MNT-AUC0?30 values than those for X-B30 and X-B40 (P<0.05). Only MNT-AUC30?60 values for X-B30 and X-B40 were higher than those for S-S and X-S (P<0.05). Conclusions Xylazine induced sedation and mechanical hypoalgesia that were enhanced by adding butorphanol at 40??g/kg bwt. This drug combination may be suitable for chemical restraint of donkeys undergoing clinical procedures.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine cervical osteoarthritis is a common disease known to contribute to both neck pain and cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy. There are no published studies demonstrating the usefulness of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical osteoarthritis. Objectives To determine the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical articular process joint osteoarthritis. Study design Prospective cadaver study. Methods Latero-oblique radiographs and CT images were collected, and post mortem examinations performed, on 27 cadaver necks from Thoroughbred-type horses of various ages and sexes. Two equine clinicians independently reviewed each set of images for the presence of osteoarthritis. The authors, under the guidance of a veterinary pathologist, reviewed all articular process joints for bony changes indicative of osteoarthritis. Results The prevalence of osteoarthritis identified on CT images was 57.9% (Assessor A) and 23% (Assessor B). The prevalence of lesions identified on post mortem examination was 25.6%. Latero-oblique radiography showed a low sensitivity for identifying osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging (6.3?16.1%) and post mortem examination (2.2?4.4%). However, it showed a high specificity when compared to both CT imaging (92.1?97.8%) and post mortem examination (87.2?95.0%). The positive predictive value for identifying osteoarthritis was moderate (40.9?80.0%) when compared to CT imaging and poor (4.2?18.2%) when compared to post mortem examination. The negative predictive value was moderate when compared to both CT imaging (42.9?76.3%) and post mortem examination (78.0?79.8%). Conclusions Latero-oblique radiography has low sensitivity, but high specificity for the detection of cervical osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging and post mortem examination. Further investigation comparing the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography vs. laterolateral radiography would determine whether taking latero-oblique radiographs, which can be more difficult to obtain and interpret, is necessary for the diagnosis of cervical osteoarthritis in practice.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Cervical spine lesions are often suspected in horses with neurological signs, abnormal head/neck position and obscure forelimb lameness. Computed tomography (CT) has the potential to image the cervical spine in 3 dimensions in superior anatomical detail; e.g. lesions that cause compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, small fragments, and osteoarthritis of the articular process joints may be more easily detected. Objectives To investigate if CT and CT myelography of the entire cervical spine is possible in horses, describe the technique used, the type of horses and distribution of cervical lesions detected. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Horses undergoing cervical CT and CT myelography from June 2013 to February 2014 were reviewed. The horses were anaesthetised in left lateral recumbency using continuous intravenous anaesthesia. A Philips Brilliance Big Bore 16 slice scanner and a custom made equine CT table (Solving, Finland) were used. Results Cervical CT was performed on 16 horses, 11 of which also had CT myelography: 12 Warmblood, 2 ponies, 1 Standardbred and 1 Paint Horse. Horses ranged in age from 1 to 21 years, and in weight from 406 to 670?kg. Presenting complaints were: neurological symptoms (n?=?8), abnormal head/neck position (n?=?5), forelimb lameness (n?=?4), Horners syndrome (n?=?1). In all cases (n?=?16) the cervical spine from the skull to C7 could be imaged, in 3 cases T1 was imaged and in one case T3. Significant lesions were detected in 14 horses. The sites of the most significant lesions were: C4?C5 (n?=?3), C5?C6 (n?=?2), C6?C7 (n?=?5) and C7?T1 (n?=?2), cervical stenosis C5?T2 (n?=?1) and muscle injury (n?=?1). Length of anaesthesia ranged from 35 to 70?min (median 60?min), with one complicated recovery. Conclusions Cervical CT and CT myelography can be performed in large adult horses. CT may be the future gold standard to evaluate equine cervical lesions. Further studies are needed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recommendations for prophylactic vaccination against tetanus in horses vary greatly between countries and have scarce scientific support in the peer-reviewed literature. In human medicine, recommended booster vaccination intervals are also very variable, but are considerably longer than for horses. Objectives To investigate if the duration of antibody titres previously determined to be protective against tetanus are likely to be longer than indicated by several recommended vaccination intervals for horses. Study design Prospective clinical trial. Methods Thirty-four horses were enrolled for basic immunisation with an ISCOM Matrix-combination vaccine (Equilis? Prequenza TE). Horses received the first vaccination at 5?11 months of age, and the second dose 4 weeks later. A third vaccine dose was given 15?17 months after the second dose. Serum tetanus antibody titres were analysed by ToBi ELISA 2 weeks as well as 14?16 months after the second dose. After the third vaccine dose, titres were checked once yearly for 3 years. Results Two weeks after the second dose all horses (34/34) had antibody levels that exceeded 0.03?iu/ml. After 16 months the levels were below 0.03?iu/ml in 5/33 horses. After the third vaccine dose antibody levels remained above 0.03?iu/ml in 25/26 horses for 1 year, 17/17 horses for 2 years, and 9/9 horses for 3 years. Conclusions Horses that undergo basic immunisation with 3 doses of vaccine after the age of 6 months are likely to have serum antibody titres consistent with protection against tetanus for more than 3 years.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Embryo transfer (ET) is an increasingly common component of commercial sport-horse breeding. While many variables affect the success of ET, optimal selection of recipient mares is essential. Ideally, adequate corpus luteum (CL) function would be evaluated by measuring plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations (≥2.0?ng/ml). In practice however, P4 is rarely measured because it would increase costs, and there is a delay to obtaining a result. Colour-flow Doppler sonography (CF) has been described as a rapid means of assessing CL function because luteal blood flow correlates with circulating P4 concentrations. Objectives To use CF to assess luteal blood flow at the time of ET in recipient mares, and assess its relationship to P4 concentrations and pregnancy outcome. Study design Cohort study. Methods Fifty-eight Day 8 horse embryos were transferred as part of a commercial programme. B-mode and CF sonographic examinations were performed immediately prior to ET (ET+0), and blood was collected to measure plasma P4. Measurements were repeated at 4, 11, 18 and 25 days after ET in pregnant mares. Mares scanned not pregnant at Day 4 were re-checked 2 days later. The CF image of each CL was frozen at peak total area of flow, and repeated 3 times. The cross-sectional area (corrected for presence of lacunae) and the total area of colour pixels within the CL were analysed using ImageJ software. Results Plasma P4 correlated positively (P<0.05) with area of colour pixels (range r?=?0.40?0.55) and total CL area (range r?=?0.41?0.51) at all time-points. None of plasma P4, CL area, or CF pixel area were predictive of pregnancy outcome. Conclusions CL blood flow is not predictive of pregnancy outcome but should help identify mares with an inadequate CL and not therefore suitable for receiving an embryo.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Horseshoe studs are commonly used to increase traction between the foot and the ground in competition horses. Here we investigate the question of how hindlimb studs alter limb function by quantifying upper body kinematics during circular motion (lungeing). Objectives This study quantified the effects of studs placed in the hind shoes on head and pelvic movement symmetry parameters commonly used for objective assessment of lameness. Study design Prospective longitudinal interventional study. Methods 15 horses were trotted on the straight and lunged on left and right circles on turf with/without a pair of studs in both hind shoes. Movement symmetry was assessed using inertial sensors mounted on poll, os sacrum and left and right tuber coxae. To eliminate the influence of the number of left/right asymmetrical horses in the sample, symmetry values were standardised to show left fore and/or right hind asymmetry on the straight. Differences in standardised head and pelvic symmetry index (SI) with and without studs were calculated and paired t tests were used to compare SI values with and without studs on the straight and on both reins. Results Use of studs resulted in a significant difference (P?=?0.02) in pelvic SI on the right lunge only but no difference for straight line and left lunge (both P>0.05). No significant difference was found for head movement symmetry (all P>0.05). Conclusions Pelvic movement was altered with the ?weaker? right hindlimb (based on the calculation of standardised SI values) on the inside of the circle creating an increased ?hip hike?. In general, horses show increased limb angles and lower peak vertical force with the inside limb; our kinematic results show that this effect is exacerbated with studs. Future studies should investigate whether this ?intervention? is of diagnostic potential in sub-clinically hindlimb lame horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Anthelmintic resistance is a global problem and constitutes a major threat to the welfare of equids worldwide. The cyathostomins are the most numerous and pathogenic gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) of equids in the developed world. Cyathostomins show widespread resistance to 2 out of 3 of the major classes of anthelmintic and recently there are reports of reduced efficacy to the potent macrocyclic lactones (MLs). None of the 3 novel classes of anthelmintic that have emerged in the last decade are licensed for use in equids. The cysteine proteases (CPs) are plant proteins that have shown potent activity against GINs?in vivo in sheep and pigs. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic effect of the CP papain on cyathostomins in vitro using the egg hatch assay (EHA) and larval migration inhibition test (LMIT). Methods Samples of cyathostomin eggs and third stage larvae were collected and cultured from a population of equids that have recently shown reduced ML efficacy in vivo. The EHA and LMIT were performed on repeated samples with increasing concentrations of papain. Dose?response curves were plotted and PROBIT analysis performed on the data to give EC-50 values (concentration that gives 50% of the maximal response). Results Papain caused a dose dependent inhibition of both egg hatch and larval migration. The EC-50 values were 2??mol/l and 100??mol/l in the EHA and LMIT respectively, indicating a more potent effect on egg hatch. Conclusions The CP papain shows potent anthelmintic activity against cyathostomins in vitro. Good evidence of anthelmintic effect against GINs in other host species is supportive of its potential use in equids. Further work is indicated to evaluate safety and in vivo efficacy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Topical administration of atropine is an important part of the treatment of equine uveitis. However, very high doses of topically administered atropine have been associated with decreased gut motility and colic in horses. Objectives To evaluate systemic effects of topical atropine in doses used clinically in horses, with emphasis on gut motility and ability to induce colic. Study design Randomised, blinded, controlled crossover study. Methods Four horses received placebo eye drops (saline) and 2 different protocols of topical atropine administration during 120?h with 35 days washout periods in between different treatments. One drop of 1% atropine solution was administered unilaterally at 3-h intervals for 48?h and at 12-h intervals for another 72?h (high dose), whereas the low dose group was given alternating treatment with atropine and saline according to the same protocol. In the placebo group, saline was administered at 3-h intervals for 48?h and at 12-h intervals for another 72?h. All horses were walked for 10?min 3 times a day. Pupillary light reflexes, heart rate, respiratory rate, gut sounds and clinical signs of abdominal pain were monitored every 3?h and faecal output once daily. Results None of the horses showed any signs of abdominal pain. Gut sounds were present at every auscultation in all horses. Gut sound scores were significantly lower during the high dose regime (P?=?0.0007) compared to placebo, but not during the low dose regime (P?=?0.17). Conclusions Topically administered atropine in clinically relevant doses temporarily reduced gut motility, but did not cause ileus or colic in healthy horses receiving a small amount of daily exercise. However, this effect may be additive to other factors that reduce gut motility in horses with uveitis, such as pain and stress in relation to hospitalisation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Standing magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is commonly used to evaluate the distal aspect of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of lame horses. There is paucity of information comparing interobserver agreement of this imaging modality. Objectives To determine the interobserver agreement for assessment of the DDFT on sMRI using a newly developed grading system. It was hypothesised that different lesion types would be more frequently observed at different anatomical locations of the DDFT, and that interobserver agreement would be better for the presence of a lesion compared to lesion grading. Study design A retrospective study assessing interobserver agreement. Methods sMRI studies of 40 equine front feet were retrospectively graded by 2 observer teams using a newly developed grading system based on previous studies. Individual DDFT parameters and an overall DDFT grade were scored. A Pearson's Chi-square test quantified the association between anatomical location and lesion type and interobserver agreement was quantified by calculating weighted-kappa statistic. Results Observer team B found a statistically significant association between anatomical location and lesion type but observer team A did not. Interobserver agreement was fair to moderate for the majority of individual DDFT parameters. For most parameters, better interobserver agreement was found for presence of a lesion than for lesion grading. Interobserver agreement was fair for the overall DDFT grade. Conclusions Interobserver agreement was acceptable for overall DDFT grade and was better for the presence of an overall grade. Interobserver agreement was also acceptable for most DDFT parameters and was better for assessing whether a lesion was present compared to the grading of lesions. This study highlights the value of a standardised grading system for assessing the DDFT on sMRI, and provides a method to improve the repeatibilty and reliability of future studies using sMRI.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There have been no detailed descriptions of the radiological appearance of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament in horses with and without distal hock joint pain. Objectives 1) To describe the normal radiological appearance of the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament; 2) to determine the frequency of occurrence of mineralisation or ossification of the interosseous ligament and to describe radiological abnormalities surrounding the interosseous space; 3) to describe concurrent radiological abnormalities in the tarsus. It was hypothesised that ossification of the interosseous ligament will be associated with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint. Study design Systematic radiological analysis using a predefined grading system, after a repeatability study, and descriptive statistics. Methods Case records and radiographs of all horses which underwent radiographic examination of one or both tarsi over 7 years were reviewed. Results There were 700 horses, including 470 examined bilaterally. The normal interosseous space was an oval-shaped radiolucent area surrounded by subchondral bone of uniform opacity and thickness. Changes in the region of the interosseous ligament of the centrodistal joint were evident in 190/1170 (16.2%) tarsi, including 50 horses examined bilaterally. In 33/190 (17.4%) tarsi there was complete loss of the oval-shaped radiolucent area, together with increased thickness of the adjacent subchondral bone, endosteal irregularity and increased opacity of the adjacent trabecular bone. In addition 157/190 tarsi had patchy increased opacity within the interosseous space and alterations of the adjacent subchondral and trabecular bone. There was radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint in 27/33 (81.8%) of tarsi with complete ossification of the centrodistal interosseous ligament, 17 of which (51.5%) had distal tarsal pain, and in 29/157 (18.5%) tarsi with other abnormalities of the centrodistal interosseous ligament. Conclusions When evaluating the tarsus radiologically the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament should be assessed. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Animal Health Trust and there was informed owner consent. Sources of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are no reports of proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) and concurrent injuries of the proximal aspect of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (ALDDFT). Objectives To describe clinical features, response to local analgesia and ultrasonographic features. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Review of case records, January 2009?2014. Results There were 8 horses with forelimb lameness, 4 unilateral and 4 bilateral (2 with bilateral injuries of the suspensory ligament [SL] and ALDDFT and 2 with PSD and injury of the ALDDFT in one limb and injury of the ALDDFT alone in the other). One horse had pain on palpation of the proximal aspect of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by palmar metacarpal (subcarpal) nerve blocks in 10/12 limbs; in 2 limbs an ulnar nerve block was required to abolish lameness. There were 5 horses with bilateral hindlimb lameness; concurrent desmopathy of the ALDDFT and PSD was identified in one horse. In the other 4 horses there was a history of bilateral PSD which had undergone treatment. Recurrent lameness was associated with unilateral (n?=?3) or bilateral (n?=?1) PSD and desmopathy of the ALDDFT. In 2 horses there was soft tissue swelling in the proximomedial aspect of the metatarsus in the region of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by local infiltration of mepivacaine in the proximoplantar aspect of the metatarsus in 3 limbs; in one limb a tibial nerve block was required to eliminate lameness. In all horses lesions were characterised ultrasonographically by enlargement of both the ALDDFT and the proximal aspect of the SL and a diffuse decrease in echogenicity. There was echogenic material between the SL and ALDDFT in 5 limbs. Conclusions All soft tissue structures in the proximal aspect of the metacarpus/metatarsus should be evaluated ultrasonographically if pain is localised to this area.
