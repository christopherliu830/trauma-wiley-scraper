AB  - Reasons for performing study There have been no detailed descriptions of the radiological appearance of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament in horses with and without distal hock joint pain. Objectives 1) To describe the normal radiological appearance of the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament; 2) to determine the frequency of occurrence of mineralisation or ossification of the interosseous ligament and to describe radiological abnormalities surrounding the interosseous space; 3) to describe concurrent radiological abnormalities in the tarsus. It was hypothesised that ossification of the interosseous ligament will be associated with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint. Study design Systematic radiological analysis using a predefined grading system, after a repeatability study, and descriptive statistics. Methods Case records and radiographs of all horses which underwent radiographic examination of one or both tarsi over 7 years were reviewed. Results There were 700 horses, including 470 examined bilaterally. The normal interosseous space was an oval-shaped radiolucent area surrounded by subchondral bone of uniform opacity and thickness. Changes in the region of the interosseous ligament of the centrodistal joint were evident in 190/1170 (16.2%) tarsi, including 50 horses examined bilaterally. In 33/190 (17.4%) tarsi there was complete loss of the oval-shaped radiolucent area, together with increased thickness of the adjacent subchondral bone, endosteal irregularity and increased opacity of the adjacent trabecular bone. In addition 157/190 tarsi had patchy increased opacity within the interosseous space and alterations of the adjacent subchondral and trabecular bone. There was radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint in 27/33 (81.8%) of tarsi with complete ossification of the centrodistal interosseous ligament, 17 of which (51.5%) had distal tarsal pain, and in 29/157 (18.5%) tarsi with other abnormalities of the centrodistal interosseous ligament. Conclusions When evaluating the tarsus radiologically the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament should be assessed. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Animal Health Trust and there was informed owner consent. Sources of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are no reports of proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) and concurrent injuries of the proximal aspect of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (ALDDFT). Objectives To describe clinical features, response to local analgesia and ultrasonographic features. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Review of case records, January 2009?2014. Results There were 8 horses with forelimb lameness, 4 unilateral and 4 bilateral (2 with bilateral injuries of the suspensory ligament [SL] and ALDDFT and 2 with PSD and injury of the ALDDFT in one limb and injury of the ALDDFT alone in the other). One horse had pain on palpation of the proximal aspect of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by palmar metacarpal (subcarpal) nerve blocks in 10/12 limbs; in 2 limbs an ulnar nerve block was required to abolish lameness. There were 5 horses with bilateral hindlimb lameness; concurrent desmopathy of the ALDDFT and PSD was identified in one horse. In the other 4 horses there was a history of bilateral PSD which had undergone treatment. Recurrent lameness was associated with unilateral (n?=?3) or bilateral (n?=?1) PSD and desmopathy of the ALDDFT. In 2 horses there was soft tissue swelling in the proximomedial aspect of the metatarsus in the region of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by local infiltration of mepivacaine in the proximoplantar aspect of the metatarsus in 3 limbs; in one limb a tibial nerve block was required to eliminate lameness. In all horses lesions were characterised ultrasonographically by enlargement of both the ALDDFT and the proximal aspect of the SL and a diffuse decrease in echogenicity. There was echogenic material between the SL and ALDDFT in 5 limbs. Conclusions All soft tissue structures in the proximal aspect of the metacarpus/metatarsus should be evaluated ultrasonographically if pain is localised to this area.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinical differences and variable response to therapy had been suspected between sport horses with predominantly eosinophils and/or mast cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and horses with predominantly neutrophilia in the BALF. Objectives To examine possible differences in performance, response to treatment and prognosis between both groups. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods A total of 174 client-owned sport horses that were presented to the Wolvega Equine Clinic for respiratory problems between 2008 and 2013 were included. A questionnaire was used for follow-up at least 3 months after diagnosis. Cytological BALF counts were considered increased when: neutrophils >5%; eosinophils >1% and mast cells >2%. Data were analysed using SPSS software and Chi square tests. Results Cough and highest mucus scores were significantly more associated with neutrophilic IAD (P?=?0.009 and P?=?0.007). The neutrophilia group was also significantly more responsive to therapy, often including corticosteroid inhalation, and management optimisation (P?=?0.001) and had better long-term prognosis when compared to horses from the eosinophilic or mast cell groups (P<0.001). Lowest tracheal mucus scores were reported for the eosinophilic group, followed by the mast cell group. Haemosiderophage scores were significantly higher in the eosinophilic and mast cell groups (P<0.001). Poor performance was reported significantly more frequently in horses with eosinophils and mast cells as the main inflammatory cell population in their BALF (P?=?0.001). Conclusions Inflammatory airway disease with predominantly mast cells or eosinophils is associated with low endoscopic tracheal mucus scores. These horses are more predisposed to EIPH, poor performance and responded unfavourably to therapy when compared to horses with neutrophilic IAD.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Adipose tissue deposited along the crest of the neck has been associated with altered metabolic states and with an increased risk of laminitis in equids. Thickness of the neck is a phenotipic characteristic in Andalusians; however, there are no studies evaluating this condition in this breed. Objectives To evaluate morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements in the neck area for assessment of neck adiposity and its associations with adiposity scores and biochemical variables. Study design A sample of 115 Andalusian horses (46 barren mares and 69 stallions, 2?15 years old) was evaluated in a cross-sectional study. Methods Cresty neck score (CNS) was determined. Two groups were created: cresty neck (CNS?≥?3) and noncresty neck (CNS<3) horses. Neck circumference (NC) (cm) and ultrasonography (US) of subcutaneous fat (mm) at 25% (NC0.25?US0.25), 50% (NC0.50?US0.50) and 75% (NC0.75?US0.75) of neck length were measured. Middle neck circumference (NC), neck length and height at the withers were taken to calculate neck ratios (NC0.50:height, NC0.50:neck length). Plasma was analysed for insulin and leptin. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as insulin ≥20??iu/ml. Correlations using Pearson and Spearman coefficients were evaluated. Mean comparisons were carried out with Student's t or Mann-Whitney tests. Results Cresty neck condition was present in 73.9% (n?=?85) of the horses and 2.6% (n?=?3) were hyperinsulinaemic. Cresty neck horses had significantly higher plasma leptin, morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements. NC0.50:height was the most correlated parameter with CNS. Insulin was correlated with leptin levels and all morphometric measurements. Insulin and leptin were correlated only with US0.75. Conclusions Andalusian horses? neck score, despite their thick necks in the majority of individuals, does not have a good correlation with plasma insulin and leptin levels. Since in Andalusian horses, neck scores may be overestimating obesity, further studies on ultrasonographic fat measurements are needed. Ethical animal research:?The university committee for the ethical use of animals approved all procedures. Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Advanced imaging modalities enable assessment of the equine skull and brain. Horses are susceptible to neurological dysfunction of the cranial nerves; however, our understanding of these structures? imaging anatomy is limited. Hypothesis Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be superior to computed tomography (CT) for the identification of cranial nerves, but optimal assessment may depend on both modalities. Objectives Identify cranial nerves and compare and contrast the utility of MRI and CT images of cadaver and clinical material. Interpret images from both modalities and determine the cranial nerve imaging anatomy. Study design Prospective cadaver anatomical study combined with retrospective clinical case study. Methods The head of a neurologically normal 9-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was scanned immediately following euthanasia (performed for reasons unrelated to this study). High resolution MRI (1.5 Tesla) and CT examinations were conducted over a 12?h interval following euthanasia. Images obtained were compared with selected clinical cases which were scanned during anaesthesia (MRI; approximately 30?60?min) or standing sedation (CT; approximately 30?s). Results On a high resolution MRI scan of a cadaver equine skull, each of the 12 cranial nerves and their topographic location was readily appreciated. Cranial nerves 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more easily identified in clinically relevant MRI scans. CT allowed visualisation of the stylomastoid foramen, the inner and middle ear and cranial nerves 2, 3, 5 and 7. Conclusions High field MRI allows for excellent visualisation of equine cranial nerves. CT allows for detailed visualisation of the osseous canals and foramina. This study advances anatomical knowledge of the normal equine cranial nerves to aid interpretation in horses that display neurological dysfunction localising to the brain and brainstem.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine the prevalence of EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5 in respiratory samples from a large number of horses using quantitative PCR methods. Samples from horses with, and without mild signs of respiratory disease provided an opportunity to examine associations with single or multiple herpesviral infections. Objectives To determine any correlation between quantitative detection of these equine herpesviruses and mild clinical respiratory disease in horses. Methods Nasal swabs were taken from horses with, and without, clinical respiratory disease. Nucleic acid was extracted from all swabs prior to PCR testing for EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5. Clinical signs of respiratory disease included coughing, fever (temperature >38.5°C) or nasal discharge. Results Of the 409 horses, 250 (61%) were clinically normal, 121 (30%) presented with clinical signs consistent with mild respiratory disease and 38 (9%) horses had no traceable clinical history. One-fifth (83/409) of horses sampled were infected with EHV-2 and almost two-thirds 249/409 (60.9%) with EHV-5. Infection with EHV-5 was significantly associated with mild respiratory disease (85/121; 70.2%) compared to nondiseased horses (137/249; 55%) P?=?0.005. The proportion of EHV-2 infected horses, however, did not differ significantly between those in the diseased (18/121) and nondiseased (61/250) groups. Too few horses were detected with alphaherpesviruses to determine any association with clinical signs of disease. Mean nasal shedding loads of herpesviruses were not significantly different between diseased and nondiseased horses. Conclusions There was a significant association between horses displaying clinical signs of mild respiratory disease and infection with EHV-5, however, no such association was evident for neither horses with EHV-2 nor the alphaherpesviruses EHV-1 and -4. The clinical significance of respiratory gammaherpesvirus infections in horses remains yet to be determined; however, these findings add to the mounting body of evidence incriminating EHV-5 in association with equine respiratory disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Despite ongoing advances in diagnostic imaging, ?wind-testing? remains the most common screening test for upper respiratory tract obstructions and is an important condition of sale at Thoroughbred public auctions in UK/Europe. Correlations between abnormal respiratory noise and resting laryngeal function have been incompletely investigated to date. Objectives To determine whether associations exist between respiratory noise at lunge and subsequent diagnosis of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Study design Retrospective analysis of records for all post sale wind-testing undertaken by a single veterinary practice at Tattersalls Newmarket yearling, breeze-up and horse-in-training sales between 2009 and 2013. Methods Descriptions of abnormal respiratory noise were categorised as ?inspiratory whistle?, ?inspiratory harsh? or ?pan-respiratory harsh?, and included lunge direction during which noise was evident. Concurrent examination by 2 veterinary surgeons was a criterion for inclusion of cases. All horses making abnormal respiratory noises underwent resting endoscopy with a consensus score (Lane scale) given for laryngeal function. Results 2972 horses underwent post sale wind-testing and 418 horses (14.1%) underwent resting endoscopic examination due to abnormal respiratory noise. Likelihood of making an abnormal respiratory noise differed significantly between groups (yearlings 10.8%, ?breeze-up? 2-year-olds 20.6%, horses-in-training 30.1%). Yearlings were significantly more likely (P<0.0001, Chi-squared/Bonferroni test) to make a ?harsh? respiratory noise than horses-in-training. Type of noise (whistle) was significantly associated with resting endoscopic evidence of RLN in yearlings (P?=?0.009); specificity of ?whistle? for RLN in this group was 38.6%. There was no association between lunge direction noise (left, right or both) and RLN. Conclusions These results support the widespread belief that harsh respiratory noise when lunged of presumed ?palatal/pharyngeal? origin is more likely in yearlings than horses-in-training, possibly due to upper respiratory inflammation or immaturity. Inspiratory whistle in both lunge directions is no stronger an indicator of RLN than unidirectional whistle.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry in the equine hindlimb are poorly defined. Little research has been carried out into the potential interactions between these variables despite the commonality of hindlimb lameness in sports and leisure horses. Objectives To determine hind foot placement and describe the relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry. Study design Observational study. Methods Overall foot placement of 43 horses was determined from simultaneous orthogonal filming at walk and trot, foot conformation was measured from digital photographs and motion symmetry data was collected using horse mounted inertial sensors. Results Left and right hind foot conformation differed significantly (P?=?0.001?0.036). Foot placement was not significantly different between left and right feet, despite these conformational differences. Foot placement was significantly different between walk and trot (P<0.001). Lateral heel landing was the most common landing pattern observed at walk (55.81%) and trot (43.12%). Lateral and lateral toe landings were more common at trot, though relatively uncommon at both gaits. Foot conformation was significantly associated with motion symmetry (P<0.001?0.007) and with placement at trot (P?=?0.002?0.005) but not walk. Conclusions Hind feet land preferentially laterally and heel first at both the walk and trot. Foot conformation appeared to be associated with landing patterns at the trot but not walk. Foot conformation was also associated with motion symmetry, although it is difficult to say whether conformation affects symmetry or vice versa. Multiple factors contribute to equine locomotion, foot conformation, landing patterns and the maintenance of orthopaedic health.

AB  - Please cite this paper as: The biology of burn injury. Experimental Dermatology 2010; 19: 777?783. Abstract:? Burn injury is a complex traumatic event with various local and systemic effects, affecting several organ systems beyond the skin. The pathophysiology of the burn patient shows the full spectrum of the complexity of inflammatory response reactions. In the acute phase, inflammation mechanism may have negative effects because of capillary leak, the propagation of inhalation injury and the development of multiple organ failure. Attempts to mediate these processes remain a central subject of burn care research. Conversely, inflammation is a necessary prologue and component in the later-stage processes of wound healing. In this review, we are attempting to present the current science of burn wound pathophysiology and wound healing. We also describe the evolution of innovative strategies for burn management.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Some ponies are predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis, but the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Adipose tissue is a highly metabolically active tissue that secretes mediators which affect vascular function, insulin signalling and inflammation, all of which are potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of laminitis. Objectives To determine whether the gene expression of adipose tissue from previously laminitic ponies (LP) differs from nonlaminitic ponies (NL). Study design Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected by biopsy from the neck region of healthy LP and NL (n?=?6 each group) in the summer and winter. Methods Gene expression was determined using a 44?K equine expression microarray. Data were analysed using GeneSpring and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genes with >2-fold difference, P<0.01 were considered significant using a t test to analyse group and/or season. Results The most significant differences in global gene expression in adipose tissue were observed between summer and winter in both groups, with 244 (NL) and 174 (LP) genes differentially expressed. There was a significant difference between LP and NL groups in the summer (141 genes differentially expressed), whereas the 2 groups were more similar in the winter (40 genes differentially expressed). Eight of the top 10 upregulated genes and 3 of the top 5 canonical pathways that differed between LP and NL in the summer were associated with inflammation and/or immunity. Conclusions Laminitic ponies appear to have a different adipose tissue gene expression profile to NL, particularly in the summer. Inflammatory genes and pathways were significantly upregulated in the LP group suggesting higher levels of inflammation or priming of inflammatory pathways which may contribute to a predisposition to laminitis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) can be troublesome, but early recognition and knowledge of risk factors are primordial for prevention and control. Objectives 1) Improvement of early clinical recognition, and 2) identification of factors potentially of importance for spread. Study design Retrospective descriptive study of EHM cases and statistical comparison to acutely neurologically affected horses negative for EHM. Methods Files from a French epidemiosurveillance programme for equine infectious neurological diseases (2008?2011) were reviewed. Cases were considered EHM (n?=?26) based on presence of acute neurological signs and laboratory confirmation. Cases were considered control cases (n?=?29) when reported to be suffering from acute neurological diseases, but negative for EHM. A subgroup of controls was created that excluded cases with peripheral neuromuscular diseases (n?=?21). Univariate and multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree analysis between groups were performed to identify diagnostic markers and risk factors. Results EHM had a fatality rate of 46% and occurred often in isolated cases. They frequently showed ataxia, paresis and cauda equina affection, but the clinical picture was variable. Univariate analysis identified the following variables as more associated to EHM than to control groups: new horse introduced in herd, vaccination, cauda equina affection, larger herd size, and saddle horses. In the multivariate analysis, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection could be retained. CART analyses identified herd size, month of occurrence, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection as main predictors for EHM. Conclusions Isolated EHM cases occur frequently, accentuating the diagnostic difficulty. History and clinical examination of acutely neurologically affected horses can potentially improve early recognition of EHM. Risk factors were in accordance with other studies, although in a different geographic location and study setup, and therefore strengthen their importance for spread of EHM.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Since 2010, the OIE expert surveillance panel (ESP) recommends that EI vaccines contain representative equine influenza virus (EIV) strains from the Florida clade 1 and 2 sub-lineages for optimal protection against EIV currently circulating worldwide. To date, no EI vaccine commercially available in the EU meets this recommendation. Objectives This report summarises the development process of a fully updated recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, including clinical efficacy results against EIV strain A/eq/Richmond/1/07. Study design The EI vaccine ProteqFlu containing 2 recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin of EIV strains was updated by replacing the A/eq/Newmarket/2/93 strain with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 isolate (Florida clade 2 sub-lineage) and keeping A/eq/Ohio/03 (Florida clade 1 sub-lineage), to meet the last OIE recommendations. The updated EI vaccine was tested for efficacy in the Welsh mountain pony model. Methods The mode of action, production steps and efficacy of the updated EI vaccine will be presented. Efficacy was tested in a group of 7 ponies vaccinated twice, 5 weeks apart. Protective antibody response were measured and challenged by experimental infection with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 EIV strain. Clinical signs of disease and virus shedding were compared with control unvaccinated ponies (n?=?7). Results Significant protection was measured in vaccinated ponies, which supports the vaccine registration. Conclusions The recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine was already the first EI vaccine to meet the 2004 OIE ESP recommendations and was successfully used in Australia during the 2007 EI outbreak. This new version will be the first fully updated EI vaccine available in the EU, which will help to minimise the increasing risk of vaccine breakdown due to constant EIV evolution through antigenic drift. EI vaccination remains one of the most effective tools to prevent or limit the impact of EI, as clearly illustrated by the limited frequency and scale of EI outbreaks.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinicopathological and laboratory investigation of horses showing severe neurological signs during the 2010 WNV-lineage 2 human epidemic in Central Macedonia (Northern Greece). Implementation of preventive measures was also addressed. Objectives To describe the clinical signs, supportive treatment and outcome in WNV cases and report the use of an inactivated WNV vaccine used for the protection of horses during the following epidemic periods. Study design Clinical study. Methods Laboratory testing included serology, real-time RT-PCR and histopathology. All affected animals received supportive treatment (furosemide, dexamethasone, B-complex vitamins and NSAIDs). The Equip WNV vaccine was used for immunisation of horses. Results WNV-specific IgM antibodies were detected in 17 horses with neurological signs. The specificity of the detected antibodies was confirmed by seroneutralisation tests. The maximum duration of IgM was determined to be 60 days. Clinical signs included weakness of hindlimbs, ataxia and tremors (17/17), altered mental state (10/17), hypersensitivity (7/17), inability to swallow (3/17), recumbency (3/17) and convulsions (3/17). Supportive treatment was successful in 14/17 horses. The 3 recumbent horses died as a result of the infection, or were subjected to euthanasia. Histopathological findings observed in the CNS were mild perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, axonal swelling, glial nodules, microhaemorrhages and neuronal necrosis. None of the vaccinated horses showed clinical signs. Three unvaccinated horses showed clinical signs and developed WNV-specific IgM antibodies. Conclusions The Nea Santa-Greece-lineage 2 strain responsible for the massive human epidemic of 2010 was also highly pathogenic for horses. Timely administration of supportive treatment is important to the prognosis of the cases. WNV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of horses with encephalitis in Greece. Vaccinations can effectively protect horses, especially in areas of Greece where the virus seems to have become endemic.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early pregnancy loss (EPL) between Days 15 and 65 of pregnancy occurs in 7?10% of Thoroughbred pregnancies causing substantial financial losses. Despite this, very little is known about risk factors associated with the condition. Objectives To determine the current incidence of EPL in Thoroughbred mares and to investigate risk factors associated with the condition. Study design A prospective cohort study was carried out on a population of 927 Thoroughbred mares in the Newmarket area during the 2013 breeding season. Methods Questionnaires were completed by clinicians from 2 veterinary hospitals and stud secretaries from 23 stud farms. Univariable risk factor analyses were conducted using Chi-squared and t tests. Results The incidence of pregnancy loss was 6.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3?8.6%) between Days 15?42 and 2% (95% CI 1.2?3.0%) between Days 43?65. Mares aged 11 years or over were 2.4 times more likely to suffer EPL than younger mares (95% CI 1.5?3.9): the risk of loss increased as mare age increased. Foaling, rested or barren mares had a 4.3 times increased risk of loss compared to maiden mares (95% CI 1.5?12.0). Mares receiving the preovulatory hormones deslorelin or hCG were shown to have a significantly reduced risk of EPL (P?=?0.03) compared with mares who had not received any preovulatory treatments. Pregnancies undergoing loss had a significantly smaller vesicle size (mean 1.7?cm, s.d. 0.51) at the initial (Day 14?17) pregnancy scan compared to pregnancies which were maintained throughout the study period (mean 2.0?cm, s.d. 0.49, P?=?0.01). Conclusions The incidence of EPL in 2013 was similar to that previously reported in the Newmarket area. Further multivariable risk factor analyses and investigations to discover novel causes of EPL are required to reduce the incidence of this condition.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The maxillary first premolar (wolf tooth) is present in a significant proportion (13?40%) of horses and is frequently extracted. The size of these teeth has been reported to vary but the authors are not aware of published descriptions of the dimensions of these teeth. Objectives To measure the dimensions of a sample of equine first premolar teeth and to seek correlations between dimensions of the crown and the root. Study design A retrospective descriptive study. Methods Calipers were used to measure total length, root length, crown height, and crown width of 65 first premolar teeth extracted in their entirety from 2 populations of horses (UK population: n?=?30, USA population: n?=?35). Most of the variables were not normally distributed so nonparametric statistics (Spearman correlation coefficients) were used to describe tooth size and seek correlations between different measurements. Results Dimensions expressed as median (range) were total length: 21 (12?34) mm; root length: 13.2 (0?19.6) mm; crown height 7 (2?20) mm; and crown width 7 (2.6?16) mm. Root length was longer than crown height in 61/65 teeth. Total length was poorly correlated with crown height (r?=?0.443) but had a good correlation with root length (r?=?0.799). Crown height and crown width were poorly correlated with root length (r?=?-0.093 and r?=?0.463), respectively. Conclusions The dimensions of 65 first premolar teeth indicate that the root is usually longer than the crown but that the dimensions of the clinical crown of the tooth do not provide a good estimate of the length of the root.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of colic can be expensive and may exceed the owners? financial limitations. This may result in premature euthanasia prior to treatment on rectifiable financial grounds rather than for welfare reasons. It is therefore important to ensure appropriate business model auditing to identify where costs may limit expected treatment options. Objectives This study investigated how the costs of treatment for equine colic at a single university referral hospital have changed over a 10-year period between 2003 and 2013. The aim was to analyse which costs have changed excessively or disproportionately between different treating services, consumables and professional fees, which may render treatment of colic financially prohibitive. Study design Retrospective study. Methods All charges billed against cases undergoing treatment for colic between 2003 and 2013 were accessed from hospital records. Horses were identified as having surgery or purely medical management. Charges were categorised by service (medicine, surgery, anaesthesia), type (consumable, livery, professional fee), and consumable type (e.g. NSAID, opiate, antibiotic, fluid therapy, lab fee, surgery consumables). Results There was a significant association between year and the frequency of medically and surgically treated colic (Chi-square test, P<0.001). Between 2003 and 2012, median total treatment costs increased in both medically (42%) and surgically treated (46%) cases. Costs attributable to consumables increased (surgical cases 28%, medical cases 14%), while those attributable to livery (surgical -19%, medical -21%) and professional fees decreased (surgical -22%, medical -8%). The greatest increase in consumable cost was attributable to fluids (surgical 94%, medical 182%). Conclusions This study demonstrates areas where the cost of colic treatment are disproportionately changing and thus highlights potential targets where business models may be optimised in the interest of patient survival. The substantial increase in costs attributable to fluids correlates with increasing emphasis on fluid therapy in the management of colic.

AB  - Inconsistencies and inadequacies in both the approach to post-mortem examination of the heart and the subsequent reporting of findings have been blamed for a lack of progression of understanding about great ape cardiovascular disease. In order to minimize and confront these issues in the United States, Association of Zoos and Aquariums-member zoos have necropsy data collated by the Great Ape Heart Project using a protocol developed by their pathology advisors. In Europe, however, there does not appear to be in existence any standardization or process for consistent cardiac post-mortem examination, data collection and/or relevant research. This article provides those readers working within/for European collections with a suggested protocol for the initial post-mortem inspection and sampling of the hearts of great apes. This article also outlines the detailed macroscopic and histopathologic examination that is currently carried out at The University of Nottingham, UK, as part of an ongoing prospective, multi-centre study into great ape cardiovascular disease aetiopathogenesis. Finally, readers are offered guidance on the reporting and description specifically of idiopathic myocardial fibrosis (also referred to elsewhere as fibrosing cardiomyopathy). The standardized post-mortem examination of the great ape heart across European zoological collections will ensure a more uniform sampling procedure resulting in the availability of consistent good-quality data. It is hoped that this will, in turn, inform diagnostic pathology and research in this area, and enhance understanding about the aetiopathogenesis of great ape cardiovascular lesions.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) with multi-potential differentiational capacity can undergo odontoblastic differentiation when stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines. However, factors linking proinflammatory stimuli and their odontoblastic differentiation have, as yet, not been completely understood. As an apoptotic transcription factor, DDIT3 plays a crucial role in the inflammatory reaction and in osteogenic differentiation. Thus, we hypothesized that DDIT3 may participate in odontoblastic differentiation of HDPCs. Materials and methods Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect expression of DDIT3 in HDPCs and effects of TNFα, on its nuclear accumulation. HDPCs that overexpressed DDIT3 were developed and their proliferation and odontoblastic differentiation abilities were examined. qRT-PCR was employed to detect mineralization-related genes, including ALP, runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), osterix (OSX), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) and osteocalcin (OCN). Western blot analysis was performed to detect expression of DSPP protein. Results DDIT3 was expressed in HDPCs. TNFα treatment enhanced mRNA expression as well as nuclear accumulation of DDIT3 (slightly). DDIT3 overexpression reduced HDPC proliferation, however, it increased their calcium nodule formation and expression of OSX, DSPP, DMP1 and OCN. Conclusions DDIT3 may be a factor that links proinflammatory stimuli and differentiation of HDPCs.

AB  - ABSTRACT Predecessor research suggests that anything from 37% to 53% of hospitalized service users are readmitted within 12?months of discharge. This cycle of frequent admissions represents a serious challenge to clinicians and service users alike. Critically, much of the research in this field has relied exclusively on professional attributions for readmission with little acknowledgement of service user or patient viewpoints. This paper reports on a phenomenological study which used multiple data collection approaches to explore service user and clinician attributions for frequent hospitalization to an identified psychiatric unit over a 24-month index period. Methods included a retrospective review of multi-professional case notes, clinician and service user semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. Service users cited ?situational circumstances?, rather than medically accepted relapse indicators such as ?non-adherence with prescribed medication? as the main reasons for readmission. Notable disagreement existed between clinician and service user data sources. Hospitalization is a complex, individually determined experience. Clinicians and service users have differing perspectives on the causal risk factors and this presents complications for those developing relapse prevention strategies. However, a shared appreciation of the multiple realities paves the way for the development of a conceptual risk-factor identification model which may serve as a guide to practitioners in relapse prevention.

AB  - Abstract Crushing or transecting the chorda tympani nerve of the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) caused ipsilateral degeneration of taste buds in the fungiform papillae. In less than two weeks some taste fibers regenerated into the tongue and formed new taste buds and receptor cells. The recovery process was evaluated electrophysiologically in 53 gerbils by acute recording proximal to the nerve injury site. Initially the chorda tympani was electrically silent. In gerbils tested at later times spontaneous activity appeared. This was followed by responses to pressure on the tongue. Taste responses returned as early as dasy 11. The receptive field of regenerated taste fibers was limited to a small number of fungiform papillae. Taste responses were always associasted with the presence of one or more taste buds in the receptive field. Taste buds identified as responsive to chemicals contained some fusiform cells. We found thast the taste responses of single fiber, few-fiber and multi-unit preparations reflected the diversity of responses found in normal taste axons as determined by recording from 26 normal single fibers and 27 normal whole nerves. The early emergence of a variety of fiber types and responses to many chemicals in regeneration is inconsistent with the proposition that the relative chemical responsiveness of a receptor cell is strictly a function of its age; the response of a given young taste receptor is not necessarily limited to a few of the standard taste stimulants.
