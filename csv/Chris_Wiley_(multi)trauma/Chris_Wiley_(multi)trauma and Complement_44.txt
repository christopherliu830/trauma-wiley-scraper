AB  - Summary Early studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed key neurological features including the deposition of aggregates of insoluble ?-amyloid (A?) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and signs of chronic inflammation. The initial forms of these pathological hallmarks of the disease, including small oligomers of A? peptides and the hyperphosphorylated tau which aggregates into NFT, have been assumed to be part of ?the cause of AD? and have been specifically targeted to develop an effective monotherapy, but with limited success. In the absence of effective neuroprotective drugs, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have remained as the drug class that is most used to treat AD, yet they cannot and do not slow the progression of the disease. Imaging studies have confirmed what has long been suspected ? that there is a very long pre-clinical phase, when pathology gradually builds up, possibly starting with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated metabolism. Emerging therapies are targeted more towards these changes, sometimes as well as the A? and NFT pathologies in multi-targeted approaches, to interfere with the pathological cascades in AD. The aim is to prevent, stop, or at least slow the neurodegeneration before debilitating symptoms appear. This chapter summarises inflammatory and oxidative stress-related changes that occur in AD, and discusses some emerging therapies and supplements, particularly those directed at inflammation, that may slow pathogenesis of this complex neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Abstract Research on disaster resilience has increasingly focused on the role of social capital and online social networks in disaster recovery. This study complements this field of research by investigating three under addressed issues. First, we analyzed how a social messaging application, WeChat, helped individuals access and mobilize bonding, bridging and linking social capital during Hurricane Harvey. Second, we quantitatively analyzed and identified how individuals' WeChat group usage and social capital influenced their post-disaster well-being. Lastly, our research demonstrated how a minority and immigrant community overcame disadvantages commonly observed in other disaster research by utilizing social media. Results of this study contribute to governmental and community efforts in fostering resilience during natural and man-made hazards. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.

AB  - Background: Serous effusions in chronic pancreatitis are infrequent but persistent. These occur usually as a consequence of internal pancreatic fistulae and commonly involve the pleural cavity or peritoneum. Methods: To assess strategies in operative management, the records of 12 patients who underwent surgery for internal pancreatic fistula with underlying chronic pancreatitis were reviewed retrospectively. Seven patients had pancreatic ductal calculi. Three cases underwent external drainage. Three cases with leaking pseudocysts underwent cystojejunostomy-en-Y. Three cases with ductal dilatation or calculi underwent lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and three patients had caudal pancreatectomy for distal disease. Results: Eight patients were completely controlled of all symptoms, with no sequelae. One case each had recurrent pancreatitis and ascites but did not require re-operation. There were two deaths: one with massive haematemesis and one with pre-existent multi-organ failure and sepsis. Conclusions: Pancreatic duct stones may be causally associated with internal pancreatic fistulae. Delineation of ductal anatomy and pathological aberrations of the pancreas, including determination of the leak site, was of paramount importance in planning surgery. Peroperative ductography proved the most useful in this regard.

AB  - AbstractThe effectiveness of a community-based advocacy and learning intervention for Hmong refugees was assessed using a comprehensive, multi-method strategy, which included a within-group longitudinal design with four data collection points and in-depth qualitative recruitment and post-intervention interviews. The intervention's impact on five aspects of refugee well-being was examined: Participants' psychological well-being, quality of life, access to resources, English proficiency, and knowledge for the U.S. citizenship exam. Twenty-eight Hmong adults and 27 undergraduate students participated together in the intervention, which had two major components: (1) Learning Circles, which involved cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities for Hmong adults, and (2) an advocacy component that involved undergraduates advocating for and transferring advocacy skills to Hmong families to increase their access to resources in their communities. Undergraduate paraprofessionals and Hmong participants worked together for 6?8 hr per week for 6 months. Growth trajectory analysis revealed promising quantitative findings. Participants' quality of life, satisfaction with resources, English proficiency, and knowledge for the U.S. citizenship test increased and their levels of distress decreased over the course of the intervention. Mediating analyses suggested that participants' increased quality of life could be explained by their improved satisfaction with resources. Qualitative data helped to support and explain the quantitative data, as well as providing insight into other outcomes and processes of the intervention. Policy, practice, and research implications are discussed.

AB  - We propose that residents and medical students are likely to gain more from a simulation experience or procedure workshop if they are given educational materials conveying key concepts to review beforehand. Several multimedia formats are available to accomplish this task. Digital video and Powerpoint presentations can be converted to podcasts with or without audio tracks using programs like Profcast, GarageBand, Camtasia, and Keynote. There are also procedure videos available from sources like the New England Journal of Medicine. Participants are provided these instructional materials via a secure web server or email attachment several days prior to the educational session. These presentations are kept short in length (no greater than 10-15?minutes) to optimize compliance while delivering information efficiently. They can be reviewed at the learner's convenience on a personal computer or on an iPod with video capability. This method can significantly reduce the time required for didactic teaching in a procedure workshop; for example, when medical students review a video on basic suturing before attending a suturing workshop, they are prepared to begin practicing with minimal initial instruction. Furthermore, conveying the same information repeatedly through different instructional methods can help learners consolidate knowledge, as in the case of a presentation provided to residents before a simulation session containing the basic clinical teaching points of the case. Participant feedback regarding these resources has been favorable.

AB  - Traditional graduate medical education approaches to improving clinical performance based upon the latest research have included Journal Club and didactic lectures. Unfortunately, these educational interventions have rarely been demonstrated to change practice behavior or improve patient-important outcomes. Using a structured approach to identifying a gap between best-evidence knowledge and clinical practice, an illustrative one-year residency-wide translational research project was developed in a four year emergency medicine training program. Step one (assigned to the second year residents): identify and quantitatively justify a Knowledge Translation (KT) deficit within our institution. They identified steroids in adult bacterial meningitis as an unequivocal therapeutic option. Based upon a structured one-year chart review, they next demonstrated that only 7% of meningitis patients received pre-antimicrobial steroids. The next step (assigned to the first year residents): identify and quantify the physician ?leaks? within the pipeline of information from publication to bedside utilization via an online survey. The third year residents hypothesized plugs for these information leaks, including examples of other specialties or institutions which have successfully navigated this specific clinical scenario. Finally, at an end-of-year Journal Club, the fourth year residents formulated a protocol for the appropriate use of steroids in suspected adult meningitis and brought together individuals from within the institution contributing to the best-practice leak. Knowledge Translation involves multiple stages beyond simple evidence awareness and usually involves continuation beyond the emergency department. The Washington University KT project offers a structured, multidisciplinary example of moving beyond contemplation to implementation of an unequivocal therapy.

Through their narrative, one is confronted by the trauma of one's own language being declared an illegitimate child, hence becoming a ?deceptive fluency? in the ?eyes of power? thanks to race and post-coloniality. They are fully consciousness of this situation and their ?linguistic return?, thus gazing back at the eyes of power and declaring themselves ?subjects? capable of love and desire. I briefly address questions of hospitality and language ownership and conclude by addressing the need to re-think the connection between race, power and language.

AB  - Glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in hemiplegic patients. (Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1999; 81:944?946. This is a case-controlled study of the relationship between glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) in hemiplegic patients set in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Thirty-five hemiplegic patients with RSD (RSD group) and 35 hemiplegic patients without RSD (non-RSD group) were included in this study. Patients with rotator cuff rupture, brachial plexus injury, or spasticity greater than stage 2 on the Ashworth scale were excluded. Both the RSD and non-RSD groups were assessed for presence and grade of subluxation from radiographs using a 5-point categorization. The degree of shoulder pain of the non-RSD group was assessed by a visual analogue scale of 10 points. Glenohumeral subluxation was found in 74.3% of the RSD group and 40% of the non-RSD group (P = 0.004). In the non-RSD group, 78.6% of the patients with subluxation and 38.1% of the patients without subluxation reported shoulder pain (P = 0.019). No correlation was found between the degree of shoulder pain and grade of subluxation in the non-RSD group (P = 0.152). Conclude that the findings suggest that shoulder subluxation may be a causative factor for RSD. Therefore, prevention and appropriate treatment of glenohumeral joint subluxation should be included in rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. Comment by Miles Day, MD. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shoulder subluxation in hemiplegic patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. They also examined if subluxation is associated with shoulder pain and the grade of subluxation in patients with subluxation and no reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Patients with injuries to the rotator cuff of the brachial plexus, marked spasticity, and major trauma to joint structures were excluded as these can be precipitating factors for RSD. The study noted a significantly higher presence of shoulder subluxation within the RSD group and the presence of pain was significantly high in patients with shoulder subluxation in the non-RSD group. The take home message of this article is that any measure or treatment that can be applied to the glenohumeral joint should be performed to eliminate the possibility of the patient developing RSD and subsequently hindering further rehabilitation in these patients.

AB  - Objective To develop and describe a laparoscopic retroperitoneal access technique, investigate working space establishment, and describe the surgical anatomy in the retroperitoneal space as an initial step for clinical application of retroperitoneal laparoscopy in dogs. Study Design Cadaveric and experimental study. Animals Cadaveric (n=8) and healthy (n=6) adult dogs. Methods The retroperitoneal access technique was developed in 3 cadavers based on the human technique and transperitoneal observation. Its application and working space establishment with carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation alone was evaluated in 5 cadavers by observing with a transperitoneal telescope and in 6 live dogs by repeated computed tomography (CT) scans at pressure of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg. Recordings of retroperitoneoscopy as well as working space volume and linear dimensions measured on CT images were analyzed. Results Retroperitoneal access and working space establishment with CO2 insufflation alone were successfully performed in all 6 live dogs. The only complication observed was in 1 dog that developed subclinical pneumomediastinum. As pressure increased, working space was established from the ipsilateral to the contralateral side, and peritoneal tearing eventually developed. Working space volume increased significantly from 5 mmHg and linear dimensions increased significantly from 0 to 10 mmHg. With pneumo-retroperitoneum above 5 mmHg, retroperitoneal organs, including kidneys and adrenal glands, were easily visualized. Conclusion The retroperitoneal access technique and working space establishment with CO2 insufflation starting with 5 mmHg and increasing to 10 mmHg provided adequate working space and visualization of retroperitoneal organs, which may allow direct access for retroperitoneal laparoscopy in dogs.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

This is a qualitative study of interviews with 19 paramedics, 15 nurses and 16 doctors (n?=?50) from ambulance services and ED in two states of Australia. Results:? Three main themes emerged that were evident at both sites and in the three professional groups. These were: difficulties in creating a shared cognitive picture, tensions between ?doing? and ?listening? and fragmenting communication. Conclusion:? Recommendations arising from the present study as to how handover could be improved are the need for a common language between paramedics and staff in the ED, for shared experiences and understanding between the members of the team and for the development of a standardized approach to handover from paramedics to ED receiving staff.

AB  - Abstract The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) is a multi-site naturalistic cohort study to: (1) describe the long-term course and consequences of depressive and anxiety disorders, and (2) to integrate biological and psychosocial research paradigms within an epidemiological approach in order to examine (interaction between) predictors of the long-term course and consequences. Its design is an eight-year longitudinal cohort study among 2981 participants aged 18 through 65 years. The sample consists of 1701 persons with a current (six-month recency) diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorder, 907 persons with life-time diagnoses or at risk because of a family history or subthreshold depressive or anxiety symptoms, and 373 healthy controls. Recruitment took place in the general population, in general practices (through a three-stage screening procedure), and in mental health organizations in order to recruit persons reflecting various settings and developmental stages of psychopathology. During a four-hour baseline assessment including written questionnaires, interviews, a medical examination, a cognitive computer task and collection of blood and saliva samples, extensive information was gathered about key (mental) health outcomes and demographic, psychosocial, clinical, biological and genetic determinants. Detailed assessments will be repeated after one, two, four and eight years of follow-up. The findings of NESDA are expected to provide more detailed insight into (predictors of) the long-term course of depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. Besides its scientific relevance, this may contribute to more effective prevention and treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim Meta-analyses indicate positive effects of both antipsychotic and cognitive-behavioural interventions in subjects clinically at high risk (CHR) for psychosis in terms of a delay or prevention of psychotic disorders. However, these effects have been limited regarding social functioning and the relative efficacy of both types of interventions remains unclear. Furthermore, neuroprotective substances seem to be a promising alternative agent in psychosis-prevention as they are associated with few and weak side-effects. Methods In this multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT), we investigate the effects of two interventions on transition to psychosis and social functioning: (a) an integrated preventive psychological intervention (IPPI) including stress-/symptom-management and social-cognitive remediation; (b) N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) as a pharmacological intervention with glutamatergic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory capabilities. Results This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT with regard to NAC and a single-blind RCT with regard to IPPI using a 2 ? 2-factorial design to investigate the individual and combined preventive effects of both interventions. To this aim, a total of 200 CHR subjects will be randomized stratified by site to one of four conditions: (a) IPPI and NAC; (b) IPPI and Placebo; (c) NAC and psychological stress management; (d) Placebo and psychological stress management. Interventions are delivered over 26?weeks with a follow-up period of 12?months. Conclusion This paper reports on the rationale and protocol of an indicated prevention trial to detect the most effective and tolerable interventions with regard to transition to psychosis as well as improvements in social functioning, and to evaluate the synergistic effects of these interventions.

AB  - Objectives To identify CT features of canine hepatic masses that could be used to determine their divisional or lobar origin. Materials and Methods Preoperative, postcontrast CT images of 57 surgically resected hepatic masses were reviewed with respect to their size, position relative to the midline, gallbladder and portal vein, nearest recognisable hepatic lobar vein or portal vein and point of contact with the diaphragm and displacement of adjacent organs. Results The most prevalent histological diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma (n=26; 46%) and adenoma (n=10; 18%). Based on surgical assessment, it was observed that masses originated in the left hepatic division in 30 (53%) instances, central division in seven (12%) and right division in 20 (35%). All masses to the left of midline were left divisional, but only 18/30 (60%) masses to the right of midline were right divisional. Most (26/31; 84%) masses to the left of the gallbladder were left divisional and 84% (16/19) masses to the right of the gallbladder were right divisional. Half (10/20; 50%) of the right-divisional masses were medial, lateral or dorsal to the portal vein, but all other hepatic masses were ventral to the portal vein. A hepatic lobar vein or portal vein branch adjacent to the mass was observed in 53 (93%) instances; this feature correlated with surgical assessment of the affected division in 53 (93%) hepatic masses and the affected lobe in 32 (56%). Clinical Significance Combining CT features of hepatic masses appears to be an accurate method for determining their divisional or lobar origin.

AB  - Abstract Seven days after the injection of different concentrations of thrombin into the nigrostriatal pathway, a strong macrophage/microglial reaction was observed in the substantia nigra (SN), indicated by immunostaining, using OX-42 and OX-6 antibodies, and by the induction of iNOS, IL-1α, Il-1? and TNF-α. Moreover, selective damage to dopaminergic neurones was produced after thrombin injection, evidenced by loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA-expressing cell bodies, and the unaltered transcription of glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA in the SN and striatum. These thrombin effects could be produced by its ability to induce the activation of microglia described in in vitro studies, and are in agreement with the effects described for other proinflammatory compounds. Thrombin effects are produced by its biological activity since they almost disappeared when thrombin was heat-inactivated or injected along with its inhibitor α-NAPAP. Thrombin is a multi-functional serine protease rapidly produced from prothrombin at the sites of tissue injury, and also upon breakdown of the blood?brain barrier, which strongly suggests it could easily enter into the CNS. These results could have special importance in some degenerative processes of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Summary Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the single most important genetic cause of childhood mortality globally. Tanzania has one of the highest annual births of SCD individuals in the world, estimated to reach 11 000 births a year. Without intervention, 50?90% of children will die in childhood. However, cost-effective interventions have the potential to reduce childhood mortality by up to 70%. The effects of SCD are multi-dimensional, ranging from causing high morbidity and mortality, and reducing the quality of life, to imposing a high socio-economic burden on individuals, families and health systems. In the past 12 years, the SCD programme in Tanzania has developed, with local and global partnerships, a systematic framework for comprehensive research that is integrated into providing healthcare, training and advocacy in SCD. This report outlines the approach and achievements of collective initiatives for management and control of SCD in Tanzania.
