AB  - The human brain consists of billions of neurons clustered into many different regions, each of which work together to give rise to complex human behaviour. But understanding how these regions are networked together ? and the effect trauma and disease might have on network functions ? requires greater statistical input. Sean L. Simpson, Jonathan H. Burdette and Paul J. Laurienti discuss neuroscience past and present, and how statistics can help its future

AB  - Abstract The aim of this essay is to provide an overview of recent scholarship on specific kinds of sleep and dream-states in 19th-century literature and science and to note areas where there is an apparent dearth in order to encourage further research. The categories surveyed here are general studies of sleep and dream-states, mesmerism and related trance-like states (such as hypnotism and animal magnetism), déjà vu, and nightmares or Incubus (more recently termed ?sleep paralysis?). Given the plurality and fluidity of historical approaches to understanding ?dreamy? mental states, this survey will expand the contemporary literary corpus on dream-states by including historical, scientific, anthropological, and other studies alongside literary criticism in order to suggest possible points of comparison across disciplines that have not been fully explored. As this survey will demonstrate, Victorian discussions of dream-states were highly interdisciplinary in nature, and so reading different contemporary methodological approaches to these topics can illuminate ideas, questions, and points of interest that are not necessarily apparent from a single theoretical or disciplinary perspective. This multi-discipline approach allows for a more pluralistic account of scholarship on Victorian dream-states and will encourage greater cross-talk among scholars and journals about Victorian dream-states and their continuing relevance in contemporary literature, culture, and science.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - When caregivers conflict, systemic alliances shift and healthy parent-child roles can be corrupted. The present paper describes three forms of role corruption which can occur within the enmeshed dyad and as the common complement of alienation and estrangement. These include the child who is prematurely promoted to serve as a parent's ally and partner, the child who is inducted into service as the parent's caregiver, and the child whose development is inhibited by a parent who needs to be needed. These dynamics?adultification, parentification and infantilization, respectively?are each illustrated with brief case material. Family law professionals and clinicians alike are encouraged to conceptualize these dynamics as they occur within an imbalanced family system and thereby to craft interventions which intend to re-establish healthy roles. Some such interventions are reviewed and presented as one part of the constellation of services necessary for the triangulated child.

AB  - Summary Genetic testing for cancer is leading the way to revolutionary cancer prevention and treatment options. Identifying those at increased risk for the disease may help individuals prepare both medically and psychologically. However, significant emotional reactions can occur as a result of genetic information that affects quality of life. The identification and management of these emotional impacts is best addressed through an integrated psychological approach which supports and augments the care of genetic health care providers. A number of promising approaches, both individual and group focused are available, that can ultimately enhance the well-being of individuals and families at the forefront of this new technology. This chapter provides background on the genetic testing process, the potential emotional reactions for individuals and families and identifies a variety of supportive and psychotherapeutic approaches. A case example illustrates a multi-modal approach to facilitating the adaptation to cancer risk information.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - Fourth-year medical students in emergency medicine (EM) clerkships are evaluated by various methods. Multiple choice examinations are frequently used to supplement clinical evaluations. These are limited in their ability to evaluate students? clinical reasoning skills. The Script Concordance Test (SCT) is an innovative assessment method developed to evaluate clinical reasoning. The SCT consists of a series of clinical vignettes, each followed by a series of specific questions that present an additional piece of data (a lab result, a physical finding, etc.) to the student. The students then indicate how the additional data affect their thinking regarding a possible diagnosis, an investigational strategy, or a therapeutic intervention, using a 5 point Likert scale (-2,-1,0,+1,+2). SCT questions have no single correct answer; instead, students receive credit based upon the level of agreement between their answers and those of a panel of 10 to 20 expert physicians who take the test to derive the answer key. The SCT is easily administered. In other disciplines, the SCT has demonstrated the ability to differentiate between the clinical reasoning skills of experienced and novice clinicians. The clerkship directors developed an EM SCT using an expert panel of 10 EM attending physicians. For the 07-08 academic year, SCT questions have been incorporated into the EM clerkship end-of-rotation written examination. The EM SCT shows promise as a measure of a student's clinical reasoning ability. Future studies will assess in greater detail the performance and statistical properties of the SCT in the setting of the EM clerkship.

AB  - Abstract Childhood maltreatment is associated with alterations in neural architecture that potentially put these children at increased risk for psychopathology. Alterations in white matter (WM) tracts have been reported, however no study to date has investigated WM connectivity in brain networks in maltreated children to quantify global and local abnormalities through graph theoretical analyses of DTI data. We aimed for a multilevel investigation examining the DTI-based structural connectome and its associations with basal cortisol levels of 25 children with documented maltreatment experiences before age 3, and 24 matched controls (age: 10.6?±?1.75 years). On the global and lobar level, maltreated children showed significant reductions in global connectivity strength, local connectivity and increased path length, suggesting deviations from the small-world network architecture previously associated with psychopathology. Reductions in global connectivity were associated with placement instability, attenuated cortisol secretion and higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviours. Regional measures revealed lower connectivity strength especially in regions within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in maltreated children. These findings show that childhood maltreatment is associated with systemic global neurodevelopmental alterations in WM networks next to regional alterations in areas involved in the regulation of affect. These alterations in WM organization could underlie global functional deficits and multi-symptom patterns frequently observed in children with maltreatment experiences.

AB  - ABSTRACT One hundred dogs bearing malignancies of the oropharyngeal region were examined over a three-year period and prospectively staged using the World Health Organisation TNM Classification of Tumours of Domestic Animals. Primary tumours were characterized by their large size or local infiltration (71 per cent, T3 status) and invasion into adjacent bone (60 per cent, Tb status). Regional lymph node metastasis was less common (17 per cent, N1b, N2b or N3 status) and distant metastasis was an unusual presenting feature (5 per cent, M1 status). The early Stage I and II tumours together accounted for 8 per cent of the total series whilst the more advanced Stage III group were by far the most frequent, representing 84 per cent. The remaining 8 per cent being classified as Stage IV because of extensive regional or distance metastatic deposits. Prognoses by stage showed actuarial survival rates at 12 months of 100 per cent for Stage I, 71 per cent for Stage II, 31 per cent for Stage III with no survivors in the Stage IV group. Survival rates for the major histological types were 44 per cent for the non-tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, 22 per cent for the tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma and fibrosarcomas, 17 per cent for mastocytomas whilst none of the malignant melanomata survived 12 months.

AB  - Abstract Male infertility is a multi-factorial disorder, and identification of its etiology in an individual is critical for treatment. Systematically elucidating the underlying genetic causes (chromosomal and Yq microdeletion) and factors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), which contribute to sperm DNA damage, may help to reduce the number of men with idiopathic infertility and provide them with the most suitable therapeutics and counseling. This study was done to comprehensively investigate genetic and oxidative stress factors that might be the etiology of a large percentage of men with idiopathic infertility. One hundred twelve infertile men and 76 fertile controls were screened for chromosomal aberrations and Yq microdeletions. ROS, TAC, and sperm DNA damage were assessed in cytogenetically normal, non-azoospermic men with intact Y chromosome (n?=?93). ROS was assessed in neat and washed semen by chemiluminescence; seminal TAC with a commercially available kit; and sperm DNA damage by the comet assay. Two men had cytogenetic abnormalities and seven men harbored Yq microdeletions. ROS levels in neat and washed semen of infertile men were significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Infertile men had significantly lower (P?<?0.01) TAC levels (1.79?mM), whereas sperm DNA fragmentation in infertile men was significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Genetic factors and oxidative stress cumulatively account for large number of idiopathic infertile cases. Unlike, genetic causes, which cannot be cured, timely identification and management of oxidative stress may help to reverse/reduce the effects on induced DNA damage, and improve the outcomes for infertile males.

AB  - Pathological pain is a hyperexcitability disorder. Since the excitability of a neuron is set and controlled by a complement of ion channels it expresses, in order to understand and treat pain, we need to develop a mechanistic insight into the key ion channels controlling excitability within the mammalian pain pathways and how these ion channels are regulated and modulated in various physiological and pathophysiological settings. In this review, we will discuss the emerging data on the expression in pain pathways, functional role and modulation of a family of voltage-gated K+ channels called ?M channels? (KCNQ, Kv7). M channels are increasingly recognized as important players in controlling pain signalling, especially within the peripheral somatosensory system. We will also discuss the therapeutic potential of M channels as analgesic drug targets.

AB  - Abstract Microglia have diverse actions, ranging from synapse pruning in development to cytotoxic effects in disease. Brain energy metabolism and substrate availability vary under normal and disease states, but how these variations influence microglial function is relatively unknown. Microglia, like most other cell types, express the full complement of gene products required for both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism. Evidence suggests that microglia increase aerobic glycolysis and decrease respiration when activated by various stimuli. Mitochondrial function, glucose availability, and glycolytic rate influence pro-inflammatory gene expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. These effects are mediated through CtBP, an NADH?sensitive transcriptional co-repressor; through effects on NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation; through formation of advanced glycation end-products; and by less well-defined mechanisms. In addition to these transcriptional effects, microglial glucose metabolism is also required for superoxide production by NADPH oxidase, as glucose is the obligate substrate for regenerating NADPH in the hexose monophosphate shunt. Microglia also metabolize acetoacetate and ?-hydroxybutyrate, which are generated during fasting or ketogenic diet, and respond to these ketones as metabolic signals. ?-Hydroxybutyrate inhibits histone de-acetylases and activates microglial GRP109A receptors. These actions suppress microglia activation after brain injury and promote neuroprotective microglia phenotypes. As our understanding of microglial activation matures, additional links between energy metabolism and microglial function are likely to be identified.

AB  - Mammalian skeletal muscle is notable for both its highly ordered biophysical structure and its regenerative capacity following trauma. Critical to both of these features is the specialized muscle extracellular matrix, comprising both the multiple concentric sheaths of connective tissue surrounding structural units from single myofibers to whole muscles and the dense interstitial matrix that occupies the space between them. Extracellular matrix-dependent interactions affect all activities of the resident muscle stem cell population (the satellite cells), from maintenance of quiescence and stem cell potential to the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on the role of the extracellular matrix in muscle regeneration, with a particular emphasis on regulation of satellite-cell activity.

AB  - Summary Advanced functionality and programmability of the modern pacemaker systems allow specific options to manage cardiac arrhythmias. Increasing complexity of both the mechanical (as in dual- and multi-chamber devices) and software features (such as complex algorithms and pacemaker behaviors) create a potential for increased component or software malfunction and appearance of unusual device behavior (pseudo-malfunction) that may challenge the providers. Over the last two decades, while challenges continue, technological advances also have improved the reliability and diagnostic capabilities of cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter?defibrillators (ICDs). Understanding the principles of cardiac pacing and developing skills to troubleshoot device behavior in the current era is as important as ever. This chapter discusses the commonly encountered problems relating to pacing in ICDs and pacemakers.

AB  - Abstract The ability of Homo sapiens to kill prey at a distance is arguably one of the catalysts for our current ecological dominance. Many researchers have suggested its origins lie in the African Middle Stone Age or the European Middle Palaeolithic (?300-30 thousand years ago), but the perishable components of armatures rarely preserve. Most research on this subject therefore emphasises analysis of armature tip size, shape, and diagnostic impacts or residues. Other lines of evidence have included human skeletal anatomy or analyses of the species composition of faunal assemblages. Projectile Impact Marks (PIMs) on archaeofaunal remains offer an ideal complement to this work, but their potential has been restricted mainly to the later Eurasian zooarchaeological record. A review of current evidence and approaches shows that systematic PIM research could add much to our understanding of early projectile technology, especially in Africa.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFα degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.
