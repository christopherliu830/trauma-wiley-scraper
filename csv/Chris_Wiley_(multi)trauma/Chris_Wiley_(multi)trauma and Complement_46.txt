AB  - Abstract The exocrine pancreas is not a common target organ for toxic drugs and chemicals. It is however the fifth most common human cancer in the western world, and acute and chronic pancreatitis, through various identifiable and unidentified causes, is a common disease in both the developed and developing countries of the world. Both inflammatory disease and cancer of the pancreas is correlated to lifestyle with poor diet and habits, such as moderate to high alcohol intake and smoking, having positive correlations to developing the disease. The chapter describes the functional anatomy of the organ together with its biochemistry that determines toxicity, in particular the role of oxidant damage in the development of cell and tissue damage is thought to be important. The consequences of toxic damage to the acinar cells are severe and primarily result from the auto-activation and hence autodigestion of the tissue by the digestive enzymes normally contained within the exocrine cells, a cascade of apoptosis/necrosis and fibrosis with the ultimate collapse of the organ, subsequent shock, multi-organ collapse and death. The organ has complex molecular mechanisms to prevent premature activation of the digestive enzymes and also has defence mechanisms present to neutralise any premature enzyme activation but these can be rendered ineffectual by factors such as alcohol abuse and a poor diet. Chemical exposure, through both occupational and consumer product usage, has been associated with the development of both pancreatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease but the relationship between exposure and disease has never developed further than a simple association and it is likely that the development of pancreatic disease is a multi-faceted combination of inter-related events, none of which in isolation can induce disease. The pancreas has its own array of phase 1 and 2 metabolic enzyme systems and the role of pancreatic drug and chemical activation and detoxification in inducing toxicity is discussed together with the possible secondary effects of hepatic drug/chemical activation and detoxification. Finally the role of animal models of pancreatic disease is discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding the aetiology of the human conditions and the possible use of therapeutic intervention in treating the disease.

AB  - Abstract Aims The study examines the Neighborhood Story Project, a facilitated three-month action research project that engages residents in community change. In particular, this paper identifies design and facilitation elements that facilitated participant growth within the project. Methods This constructivist multi-case study examines three Neighborhood Story Projects, all located in Nashville, TN. The analysis draws on observational, focus group and interview data. Results Findings suggest that the intentional cocreation of a learning, caring, and empowering environment propelled member gains. The paper identifies specific design elements that fostered these conditions, suggesting a group-work practice model for intervening in gentrifying neighborhoods. Conclusion This study contributes to theory and practice related to group-level interventions in neighborhoods undergoing rapid demographic changes. Findings can be leveraged to better understand processes and strategies for fostering place attachments, social ties, and civic action.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: No large scale equine microarray is available commercially to allow genomic and transcriptional profiling of the majority of genes that would define the genetic basis of equine disease. Objectives: To generate a whole transcript target labelled GeneChip to interrogate the equine transcriptome and validate chip performance using RNA samples derived from organs, articular cells and normal cartilage. Methods: Equine mRNA and selected equine gene sequences derived from perfect cross-hybridisation of equine RNA on human microarray GeneChips, were used to design a custom equine gene microarray. Sequence data were used as a template for generation of a glass-slide based 5?-3? multiexon-encompassing gene chip. The microarray was characterised using RNA derived from organs including spleen, liver, brain and kidney, and RNA from cultured chondrocytes, cartilage, synovial tissue and stem cells, employing a whole transcript target labelling assay to sample mRNA across the 5?-3? spectrum. Results: The custom microarray simultaneously interrogated over 12,300 equine specific genes. Probing the chip with mixtures of total RNA derived from parenchymatous organs and articular tissues resulted in 61.7 and 62.8% present calls, respectively. This gene chip provided expression information on up to 90% of the key molecules in important signalling, metabolic and development pathways. Cartilage specific matrix genes were abundantly expressed in normal articular cartilage, but surprisingly high levels of collagen types I, III, V and XI, reflected expression from the epiphyseal layers of maturing articular epiphyseal cartilage. Conclusion: An oligonucleotide microarray with over 12,300 probe sets was generated by uniquely combining a labelling strategy incorporating expressed sequence tags from the entire transcriptome and supplementing selected human sequences that cross-hybridised with the horse. Validation showed robust performance of the microarray. Potential relevance: This array may be a useful tool to elucidate the pathogenesis of equine diseases.

AB  - Abstract Pathological gambling (PG) is a behavioral addiction characterized by an inability to stop gambling despite the negative consequences, which may be mediated by cognitive flexibility deficits. Indeed, impaired cognitive flexibility has previously been linked to PG and also to reduced integrity of white matter connections between the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex. It remains unclear, however, how white matter integrity problems relate to cognitive inflexibility seen in PG. We used a cognitive switch paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging in pathological gamblers (PGs; n?=?26) and healthy controls (HCs; n?=?26). Cognitive flexibility performance was measured behaviorally by accuracy and reaction time on the switch task, while brain activity was measured in terms of blood oxygen level-dependent responses. We also used diffusion tensor imaging on a subset of data (PGs?=?21; HCs?=?21) in combination with tract-based spatial statistics and probabilistic fiber tracking to assess white matter integrity between the basal ganglia and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Although there were no significant group differences in either task performance, related neural activity or tract-based spatial statistics, PGs did show decreased white matter integrity between the left basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex. Our results complement and expand similar findings from a previous study in alcohol-dependent patients. Although we found no association between white matter integrity and task performance here, decreased white matter connections may contribute to a diminished ability to recruit prefrontal networks needed for regulating behavior in PG. Hence, our findings could resonate an underlying risk factor for PG, and we speculate that these findings may extend to addiction in general.

AB  - The neurocybernetic prosthesis system (NCP) is an implantable, multiprogrammable pulse generator that delivers constant current electrical signals to the vagus nerve for the purpose of reducing the frequency and severity of epileptic seizures. The signals are delivered on a predetermined schedule, or may be initiated by the patient with an external magnet. The device is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the chest just below the clavicle, similar to pacemaker placement. The stimulation signal is transmitted from the prosthesis to the vagus nerve through a lead connected to an electrode which is a multi-turn silicone helix, with a platinum band on the inner turn of one helix. The prosthesis can be programmed with any IBM- compatible personal computer using NCP software and a programming wand.

AB  - Abstract? The objective of this paper is to review recent research and developments with respect to the atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) approach and to outline future areas of research and development. Areas identified as requiring further investigation include the evaluation of: ART restorations for longer than 3 years duration using recognised evaluation criteria, multi-surface ART restorations, ART restorations in primary teeth and ART sealants. In addition, the possibility and potential dangers of caries remaining after cavity cleaning with hand instruments must be investigated and the findings balanced against the known damage to sound tooth tissue caused by more routine cavity preparation techniques. New bioactive restorative materials which offer the possibility of healing dentinal caries lesions should be developed and evaluated. Finally, behavioural and educational aspects of the ART approach should be investigated.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score has been extensively used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation and determine their prognosis, but with limited predictive value. Autonomic dysfunction may correlate with increased mortality after liver transplant. In this study, two autonomic biomarkers, complexity and deceleration capacity, were added to the predicting model for 1-year mortality after liver transplantation. Methods In all, 30 patients with end-stage liver diseases awaiting liver transplantation were included. Complexity and deceleration capacity were calculated by multi-scale entropy and phase-rectified signal averaging, respectively. Different combinations of autonomic factors and MELD score were used to predict mortality rate of liver transplant after 1-year follow-up. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to determine clinical predictability. Area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve represents the overall accuracy. Results The 1-year mortality rate was 16.7% (5/30). The overall accuracy of MELD score used for predicting mortality after liver transplantation was 0.752. By adding complexity and deceleration capacity into the predicting model, the accuracy increased to 0.912. Notably, the accuracy of the prediction using complexity and deceleration capacity alone was 0.912. Conclusion Complexity and deceleration capacity, which represent different dynamical properties of a human autonomic system, are critical factors for predicting mortality rate of liver transplantation. We recommend that these pre-operative autonomic factors may be helpful as critical adjuncts to predicting model of mortality rate in prioritizing organ allocation.

AB  - Abstract Aim. Sphincter motor units (MUs) are continuously firing during relaxation. The quantification of this activity is a potentially useful electromyographic (EMG) parameter related to the number of MUs innervating the muscle and the level of motor neuron excitation. The aim of the present study was to develop a reliable, quantitative measure of continuous sphincter muscle activity during relaxation. Methods. EMG activity was analyzed during relaxation, 1 minute after insertion of the concentric needle electrode into four sites in the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle. In 10 control subjects, 8 interference pattern samples were obtained by ?turn/amplitude? analysis. In 35 control subjects, a multi-MUP count of continuously firing motor unit potentials (MUPs) was used, quadruplets with scores of 0?6 obtained, and the lower reference limits (95th percentile) calculated. This approach was then evaluated in 57 patients (182 muscles) with cauda equina or conus medullaris lesion (CECML) and 7 patients (13 muscles) with ?idiopathic fecal incontinence.? Results. The lower reference (?outlier?) limits for MUP count were 0 0 6 6 and 0 1 2 2 for the subcutaneous, and 0 0 0 6 and 0 0 1 1 for the deeper EAS muscles. Both patient groups had a significantly diminished number of continuously firing MUPs, which was below the reference range in 43% of the EAS muscles from CECM patients and in 85% of muscles from patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence. In patients with CECML, the decrease in MUP count correlated with the severity of the lesion, as defined by the sensory deficit. Conclusions. MUP count in sphincter muscles during relaxation is technically feasible, and it is a promising tool, particularly in patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence. Neurourol.

Study Design In vitro study. Sample Population Synoviocytes from dogs (n?=?8) with naturally occurring cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods Synoviocytes were cultured in monolayer and synthesized into tensioned synoviocyte bioscaffolds (TSB) suspended in media containing TGF-?3, or FGF-2, TGF-?1, and IGF-I. The 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and toluidine blue stain assessed glycosaminoglycan content; hydroxyproline assay, and collagen I and II immunohistochemistry assessed collagen content. Biomechanical properties were determined by materials testing/force?deformation curves. Results All tissue cultures formed tensioned fibrous tissue-like constructs. Mean tissue cellularity and cellular viability was significantly greater in the triple growth factor-treated TSB by 0.09% and 44%, respectively. Percentage collagen content, and relative gene expression for collagen I, II, and aggrecan was not significantly different between groups. Median percentage of GAG content was significantly greater in triple growth factor-treated TSB by 1.6%. Biomechanical properties were not different in compression. Triple growth factor-treated TSB were significantly stronger in toughness, peak load to failure, and stiffness in tension. Conclusions TGF-?3 cultured bioscaffolds failed to outperform triple growth factor-treated TSB. Architectural extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cellularity likely explained the differences between groups. TGF-?3 alone cannot be recommended at this time for in vitro formation of autologous fibrocartilage bioscaffolds for meniscal deficiency.

Study Design Retrospective clinical case-control and ex vivo study. Sample Population Labrador Retriever elbows (n?=?54) and normal cadaveric Greyhound elbows (11) undergoing elbow CT. Materials and Methods Labrador Retriever elbows were divided into 2 groups: (1) clinically unaffected and (2) MCPD-affected elbows. This 2nd group was subdivided based on the presence of a displaced FCP. UBD was measured linearly, in Hounsfield units (HU) across the widest part of the ulna incorporating the MCP. The radial head was divided into 6 zones, with mean RRBD (HU) calculated for each group. Results MCPD-affected Labrador Retriever elbows had significantly lower UBD within the MCP with a higher UBD in the cranial ulnar medulla. Lower RRBD was also seen in the radial head adjacent to the MCP in MCPD-affected Labrador Retriever elbows with FCP compared with Labrador Retriever elbows without FCP. Greyhounds had consistently lower RRBD and UBD at the apex of the MCP compared with clinically unaffected Labrador Retriever elbows. Conclusions Our results suggest a caudolateral load-transfer shift through the ulna in MCPD-affected elbow joints, unloading the MCP. Changes in regional radial head bone density suggest that the radial head is involved in the pathogenesis of MCPD.

AB  - Abstract In 2015, it can be said that the diabetic foot is no longer the Cinderella of diabetic complications. Thirty years ago there was little evidence-based research taking place on the diabetic foot, and there were no international meetings addressing this topic. Since then, the biennial Malvern Diabetic Foot meetings started in 1986, the American Diabetes Association founded their Foot Council in 1987, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes established a Foot Study Group in 1998. The first International Symposium on the Diabetic Foot in The Netherlands was convened in 1991, and this was soon followed by the establishment of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot that has produced useful guidelines in several areas of investigation and the management of diabetic foot problems. There has been an exponential rise in publications on diabetic foot problems in high impact factor journals, and a comprehensive evidence-base now exists for many areas of treatment. Despite the extensive evidence available, it, unfortunately, remains difficult to demonstrate that most types of education are efficient in reducing the incidence of foot ulcers. However, there is evidence that education as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to diabetic foot ulceration plays a pivotal role in incidence reduction. With respect to treatment, strong evidence exists that offloading is the best modality for healing plantar neuropathic foot ulcers, and there is also evidence from two randomized controlled trials to support the use of negative-pressure wound therapy in complex post-surgical diabetic foot wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy exhibits the same evidence level and strength of recommendation. International guidelines exist on the management of infection in the diabetic foot. Many randomized trials have been performed, and these have shown that the agents studied generally produced comparable results, with the exception of one study in which tigecycline was shown to be clinically inferior to ertapenem?±?vancomycin. Similarly, there are numerous types of wound dressings that might be used in treatment and which have shown efficacy, but no single type (or brand) has shown superiority over others. Peripheral artery disease is another major contributory factor in the development of ulceration, and its presence is a strong predictor of non-healing and amputation. Despite the proliferation of endovascular procedures in addition to open revascularization, many patients continue to suffer from severely impaired perfusion and exhaust all treatment options. Finally, the question of the true aetiopathogenesis of Charcot neuroarthropathy remains enigmatic, although much work is currently being undertaken in this area. In this area, it is most important to remember that a clinically uninfected, warm, insensate foot in a diabetic patient should be considered as a Charcot foot until proven otherwise, and, as such, treated with offloading, preferably in a cast.

AB  - The study focuses on Infant Mental Health data from an outpatient psychiatric clinic using the ?Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood? (DC 0-3) and parental questionnaires, CBCL and ITSC. In total, 138 infants (aged 0?3) went through the diagnostic procedure. Sixty-eight per cent were diagnosed within Axis I, with regulatory disorder, disorder of affect and traumatic stress disorder being the most frequent diagnoses. In addition, 48% were classified as having a relationship disorder according to Axis II, with an additional 40% being considered to be at risk of developing a relationship disorder. The mothers? and fathers? ratings of their children's externalized and sensitivity problems were in agreement with the clinicians, but the ratings of internalized problems as well as relationship problems presented a more complex pattern.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Summary: The pattern of severe acute renal failure has changed considerably over the past 2 decades. Severe acute renal failure is now most commonly seen in the intensive care unit and is just one of the manifestations of the multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. the pathogenesis of severe acute renal failure is complex involving decreased renal perfusion, humorally mediated renal vasoconstriction and local migration and activiation of inflammatory cells. the initial final common pathway to renal injury seems to be outer medullary ischaemia. Protection from renal dysfunction in critically ill patients must therefore be directed toward sufficient haemodynamic resucitation to avoid inadequate medullary perfusion. Such perfusion is highly dependent on the maintenance of optimal intravascular filling, adequate cardiac output and, importantly, adequate renal perfusion pressure. In these patients, such renal perfusion pressure can often only be maintained if vasopressor agents are used and titrated to keep the mean arterial pressure at the highest effective and safe level (mean arterial pressure of approximately 80?85 mmHg in most septic patients). If severe acute renal failure develops despite full medical support, renal replacement therapy becomes necesary. There is now a growing worldwide trend toward the use of continuous haemofiltration techniques as the preferred mode of renal replacement therapy. Such techniques provide important practical advantages and, in many cases, are the only form of renal replacement therapy that the patient is able to tolerate. Continous haemofiltration also appears to provide not only outstanding haemodynamic stability but also some membrane adsorption and removal of the humoral mediators of sepsis. This makes continuous haemofiltration a particularly attractive approach to renal support and is responsible for this treatment now being the leading form of acute renal replacement therapy in Australia. After a relatively static period, the area of acute renal failure management is rapidly evolving and offering some promise of a level of support able to match the illness severity associated with it.
