AB  - This article reports the findings of four separately commissioned evaluations of alternative provision (AP) undertaken in three local authorities in the UK. The evaluations were specifically predicated on the principles of children's rights and used a combination of qualitative research methods and documentary analysis to elicit the experiences of young people in conjunction with the viewpoints of key stakeholders. Data from each evaluation was gathered over a total period of 6 years. The sites and time scales for each evaluation varied from 6-month authority-wide strategic reviews to a 3-year evaluation of an AP free school and an evaluation of pupil referrals in a large school partnership. The evaluations involved 200 participant children and young people, 30 managers and stakeholders, 8 parents of non-attending pupils and local authority officers and school governors. The evaluations report the complexity of needs amongst children and young people; the continuing problem of unsuccessful transitions between key phases/stages of education and the profound consequences of this for young people; assumptions around mainstream reintegration and managed moves; and the curriculum challenges of vocationalism and academic emphasis. While the research data confirms the positive value of multi-agency approaches in AP, it also shows a more recent troubling increase in the number of young people now being referred to AP as a consequence of their exposure to performative school cultures.

AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Harmful algae (HA) and their toxins present increasing obstacles to routine protein production in aquatic systems. Preventing, controlling, or mitigating harmful algal blooms (HAB) and cyanobacterial HAB (cyanoHAB) have become major foci for many geographic areas and systems of the world, from freshwater ponds to openocean fish cages, problems potentially exacerbated with continued anthropogenic loading and a changing climate selecting for some bloom-forming taxa. Worldwide, aquaculture production of aquatic food in inland waters exceeds that of marine waters, but use of the sea for fish and shellfish mariculture is rapidly increasing in many coastal oceans. Multi-step linear food webs have also been used, with fish, shellfish, phytoplankton, macroalgae, and abalone. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can test fish tissue for toxin content, generally in response to reported human illnesses or to identify whether newly identified toxins or other compounds might pose health risks to consumers.

AB  - Abstract Aim Adolescence and early adulthood is marked by physical, emotional and psychological changes, and is the peak onset of mental disorders. Internationally, one-fifth of children and adolescents have serious mental health problems, yet services catering to them are scarce. Locally, traditional mental health services are associated with much stigma. In 2009, the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT), a youth-focused outreach and assessment service, was set up to address service gaps and care barriers. Methods CHAT's key offering is a free and confidential mental health assessment service to facilitate help-seeking individuals between the ages of 16 and 30 gain access to early treatment. Young persons' profile and assessment outcomes were collected and entered into a database. Results Between May 2009 and March 2013, CHAT received 601 referrals: 40.1% (241/601) from young persons themselves and 40.9% (246/601) from school or community counsellors. 79.2% (313/395) of those assessed had mental health issues. 61.5% (243/395) were referred to specialist clinics and 28.6% (113/395) to school or community counsellors. Conclusion There is a steady increase in our referrals; majority are self-referred or referred from school and community counsellors. This attests to the success of our general outreach and targeted capacity-building efforts. Cognizant of young persons' distress, CHAT continues to work with downstream services for continuity of care, which also presents opportunities to consolidate and expand our network of specialist and community partners. Future directions seek to address current challenges: having a mobile platform to complement our face-to-face assessments, and building collaborations to provide holistic services for young persons.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To describe the development of a facial expression tool differentiating pain-free cats from those in acute pain. METHODS Observers shown facial images from painful and pain-free cats were asked to identify if they were in pain or not. From facial images, anatomical landmarks were identified and distances between these were mapped. Selected distances underwent statistical analysis to identify features discriminating pain-free and painful cats. Additionally, thumbnail photographs were reviewed by two experts to identify discriminating facial features between the groups. RESULTS Observers (n = 68) had difficulty in identifying pain-free from painful cats, with only 13% of observers being able to discriminate more than 80% of painful cats. Analysis of 78 facial landmarks and 80 distances identified six significant factors differentiating pain-free and painful faces including ear position and areas around the mouth/muzzle. Standardised mouth and ear distances when combined showed excellent discrimination properties, correctly differentiating pain-free and painful cats in 98% of cases. Expert review supported these findings and a cartoon-type picture scale was developed from thumbnail images. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Initial investigation into facial features of painful and pain-free cats suggests potentially good discrimination properties of facial images. Further testing is required for development of a clinical tool.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine now widely recognized to contribute to the molecular events that follow CNS injury. Little is known, however, about its action on axonal sprouting and regeneration in the brain. We addressed this issue using the model of transection of Schaffer collaterals in mice organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Transection of slice cultures was associated with a marked release of IL-6 that could be neutralized by an IL-6 blocking antibody. We monitored functional recovery across the lesion by recording synaptic responses using a multi-electrode array. We found that application of IL-6 antibodies to the cultures after lesioning significantly reduced functional recovery across the lesion. Furthermore, the level of expression of the 43-kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43) was lower in slices treated with the IL-6 neutralizing antibody than in those treated with a control IgG. Conversely, addition of exogenous IL-6 to the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of functional recovery across the lesion and a higher level of expression of GAP-43. Co-culture of CA3 hemi-slices from thy1-YFP mice with CA1 hemi-slices from wild-type animals confirmed that IL-6-treated co-cultures exhibited an increased number of growing fluorescent fibres across the lesion site. Taken together these data indicate that IL-6 plays an important role in CNS repair mechanisms by promoting regrowth and axon regeneration.

AB  - Summary In 2013, Screen Australia introduced a new fund to develop global high-end television drama. Responding to feeble domestic film consumption, the popularity of quality television and the rise of multi-platform distribution, this initiative has transformed the development of transnational Australian media. Central here is the convergence of film and television production. This chapter identifies these transformations by critically examining Serangoon Road (2013-2014), an Australian-Singapore television series co-production. It reviews how media convergent policies in Singapore have re-calibrated the assumed boundedness of the national through strategies of renationalisation. The chapter contextualises the history of policy developments in Australia and Singapore that have resulted in the current culture of film-television convergence. It examines minor transnationalism by focusing on denationalisation as a new critical approach to transnational Australian screen studies in particular, and Australia's engagement with Asia in general.

AB  - Summary: The practice of epileptology at a molecular level, where gene products are identified by gene mapping, will soon be possible for a growing number of epilepsies. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is the first of such epilepsies to be mapped to a chromosome, namely chromosome 6p21.3. Family studies of 68 JME probands from California revealed 50% of all families reported seizures in first- or second-degree relatives. Twelve percent of all family members other than the proband had epileptic seizures. Eighty percent of symptomatic siblings and 6% of asymptomatic siblings had diffuse 4- to 6-Hz multi-spike-wave complexes. Twelve percent of asymptomatic parents had diffuse, nonspecific slow waves mixed with spikes or sharp waves. JME is tightly linked to the Bf-HLA loci in chromosome 6. No matter what mode of inheritance is assumed, linkage to the clinical manifestations of JME and its associated EEG traits is indicated by lod scores over 3.0, as long as ?EEG affected? but clinically asymptomatic family members are counted as affected during LIPED analysis. Studies are now being done to further localize the JME site. At the same time, further linkage studies should decide if JME is heterogeneous within itself and whether the same JME site in 6p21.3 underlies absence and grand mal epilepsies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? To measure the impact of a structured opioid renewal program for chronic pain run by a nurse practitioner (NP) and clinical pharmacist in a primary care setting. Patients and Setting.? Patients with chronic noncancer pain managed with opioid therapy in a primary care clinic staffed by 19 providers serving 50,000 patients at an urban academic Veterans hospital. Design.? Naturalistic prospective outcome study. Intervention.? Based on published opioid prescribing guidelines and focus groups with primary care providers (PCPs), a structured program, the Opioid Renewal Clinic (ORC), was designed to support PCPs managing patients with chronic noncancer pain requiring opioids. After training in the use of opioid treatment agreements (OTAs) and random urine drug testing (UDT), PCPs worked with a pharmacist-run prescription management clinic supported by an onsite pain NP who was backed by a multi-specialty Pain Team. After 2?years, the program was evaluated for its impact on PCP practice and satisfaction, patient adherence, and pharmacy cost. Results.? A total of 335 patients were referred to the ORC. Of the 171 (51%) with documented aberrant behaviors, 77 (45%) adhered to the OTA and resolved their aberrant behaviors, 65 (38%) self-discharged, 22 (13%) were referred for addiction treatment, and seven (4%) with consistently negative UDT were weaned from opioids. The 164 (49%) who were referred for complexity including history of substance abuse or need for opioid rotation or titration, with no documented aberrant drug-related behaviors, continued to adhere to the OTA. Use of UDT and OTAs by PCPs increased. Significant pharmacy cost savings were demonstrated. Conclusion.? An NP/clinical pharmacist-run clinic, supported by a multi-specialty team, can successfully support a primary care practice in managing opioids in complex chronic pain patients.

AB  - The reputation of the Irish Catholic Church has been damaged, maybe irrevocably, by the extensive evidence of child abuse in its midst. This paper summarises the evidence for that crisis and goes on to offer a multi-factorial and non-reductionist account of the abuse in a wider context. By adopting a systemic approach, this account aims to discern those factors which are peculiar to the Irish case and those that have more general significance for child protection. The Irish case demonstrates a complex set of conditions of possibility for child abuse. Some of these were only relevant to Ireland and the Catholic Church but some were not. In particular, varieties of systemic isolation and the a priori social marginalisation of victims are important to consider as salient risk factors. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The Irish case demonstrates a complex set of conditions of possibility for child abuse Key Practitioner Messages Religious settings are sites of vulnerability for children. The Catholic Church has been under particular scrutiny internationally about child abuse in its midst. The Irish Church warrants additional scrutiny because of the enmeshment of State and Church. However, child abuse can be found in other countries, in other denominations and in secular organisations. These general and particular features are best understood using a systemic framework to avoid reductionist accounts of abuse. ?Best understood using a systemic framework to avoid reductionist accounts of abuse?

AB  - The addition of hydrosurgery into our surgical armamentarium will aim to revolutionize surgical wound debridement. Hydrosurgery (Versajet1) utilizes a high pressure fine saline jet delivered via a compact hand-piece to debride, irrigate and remove debri simultaneously. The hydrosurgery system is minimally invasive enabling debridement at the bedside, with minimal haemorrhage and analgesic requirements2. Its applications range from debridement of traumatic and non-traumatic wounds (acute and chronic), wound lavage, debridement of variable thickness burns, wound bed preparation prior to skin grafting, and flap recontouring. Complex infected wounds (necrotising fasciitis) may also be debrided with potential maximal preservation of adjacent neurovasculature and viable tissues. We present five cases involving the use of the Versajet for the debridement of three diabetic foot wounds, one venous ulcer, and one traumatic chest wound. All hydro-debridements were performed at the bedside with an average procedure time of 23 minutes (15?40 minutes), an average analgesic requirement of 10?mg morphine (5?15?mg), and with minimal encountered blood losses (including two patients on Coumarin). Only a single ward debridement procedure was required to achieve a healthy wound bed in all five patients. The Versajet enables debridement and wound bed preparation that is efficient, minimally invasive, and cost effective with reductions in hospital stay.

AB  - Abstract Background? Among therapeutic modalities of acne scars, subcision is a simple, safe procedure with a different and basic mechanism for correcting atrophic and depressed scars. Subcision releases scar surfaces from underlying attachments and induces connective tissue formation beneath the scar directly, without injury to the skin surface. Therefore, subcision is a valuable method, but due to high recurrence rate, its efficacy is mild to moderate. Objectives? To increase the efficacy of subcision, a new complementary treatment of repeated suction sessions was added at the recurrence period of subcised scars. Methods? In this before and after trail, 58 patients with mild to severe acne scars of various types (rolling, superficial and deep boxcar, pitted), chicken pox, traumatic and surgical depressed scars were treated by superficial dermal undermining, with mainly 23-guage needles. The protocol for suctioning was: start of suction on third day after subcision for flat and depressing subcised scars and its continuation at least every other day for 2 weeks. Results? Forty-six patients followed the protocol completely, had 60?90% improvement in depth and size of scars (significant improvement) with mean: 71.73%. 28.2% of them had ?80% improvement or more? (excellent improvement). Twelve patients started suction late and/or had long interval suction-sessions, had 30?60% improvement (moderate improvement) with mean: 43.75%. Conclusion? Frequent suctioning at the recurrence period of subcision increases subcision efficacy remarkably and causes significant and persistent improvement in short time, without considerable complication, in depressed scars of the face. Therefore, subcision-suction method is introduced as a new effective treatment.

AB  - In the cultivated cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), reproductive stems produce 1?3 fruit even though they usually have 5?7 flowers in the spring. We undertook experiments to test the hypothesis that this was an adaptive life history strategy associated with reproductive effort rather than simply the result of insufficient pollination. We compared fruit production on naturally pollinated plants with those that were either manually pollinated or that were caged to exclude insects. Clearly, insects are necessary for the effective pollination of cranberry plants, but hand pollination of all flowers did not result in an increase in fruit number. Most of the upper flowers, which had significantly fewer ovules than did the lower flowers, aborted naturally soon after pollination. However, when the lower flower buds were removed, the upper flowers produced fruit. This suggests that the upper flowers may serve as a backup if the earlier blooming lower ones are lost early in the season. Furthermore, the late-blooming flowers may still contribute to the plant's reproductive success as visiting pollinators remove the pollen, which could serve to sire fruit on other plants. These results are discussed in the context of their possible evolutionary and proximate causes.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine the mortality rates associated with equine anaesthesia for elective and emergency (colic and non-colic) cases in one equine, university teaching hospital and to investigate the effect of several horse- and anaesthetic-related variables on anaesthetic recovery quality. Study design Retrospective data analysis. Animals or animal population In total, 1416 horses undergoing anaesthesia between May 2010 and December 2013. Methods Patient information and details of the anaesthetic, recovery period and immediate complications were extracted from an archiving database. Statistical evaluation of factors affecting mortality included chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression. Factors affecting recovery quality were investigated using univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Anaesthesia/recovery-related mortality was 1.1% for all cases, 0.9% for elective cases, 1.6% for colics and 0% for non-colic emergencies. Fractures and dislocations accounted for the majority (71.4%) of deaths. No intra-operative deaths occurred during the study period. Risk factors for mortality included increasing age and American Society of Anesthesiologist's (ASA) status but these and other factors were confounded by ?colic?. Non-fatal complications in the immediate recovery period included postanaesthetic myopathy/neuropathy and postanaesthetic respiratory obstruction. Recovery quality was associated with body mass (p = 0.016), ASA status 3 and 4 (p = 0.020 and 0.002, respectively), duration of anaesthesia (p < 0.001) and out-of-hours anaesthesia (p = 0.013). Although recovery quality was also influenced by age and breed-type, these factors were removed from the final model as age was highly associated with both ASA status (p < 0.001) and colic surgery (p < 0.001), and breed-type was a determinant of body mass. Conclusion and clinical relevance Anaesthetic/recovery-associated mortality was comparable to previously reported figures except intra-operative deaths were not reported. Fractures remained responsible for the largest proportion of recovery-associated deaths. Improvements to the recovery process that can reduce fracture occurrence are still required.

AB  - ABSTRACT A weapons system has been configured specifically to counter (or preempt) the long-range standoff missile threat. Rationale for this system starts with a discussion of cost and weight, and shows why modern multi-mission systems have become intolerably expensive. Questions are raised regarding the advantages and disadvantages of building future naval aviation forces solely around the Aircraft Carrier Battle Group. The application of a few small modern ships, forming a future Battle Force, holds promise for large economies. Likewise, some accepted views regarding CTOL (Conventional Take Off & Laundry) and V/STOL (Vertical Short Take Off & Launding) aircraft are revisted in terms of their relative costs. A weapons system is proposed which, at one-fourth the weight of an Aircraft Carrier Battle Group, may be produced and operated for one-third the cost.

AB  - Abstract Community health worker programs have emerged as one of the most effective strategies to address human resources for health shortages while improving access to and quality of primary healthcare. Many developing countries have succeeded in deploying community health worker programs in recognition of the potential of community health workers to identify, refer, and in many cases treat illnesses at the household level. However, challenges in program design and sustainability are expanded when such programs are expanded at scale, particularly with regard to systems management and integration with primary health facilities. Several nongovernmental organizations provide cases of innovation on management of community health worker programs that could support a sustainable system that is capable of being expanded without being stressed in its functionality nor effectiveness?therefore, providing for stronger scalability. This paper explores community health worker programs that have been deployed at national scale, as well as scalable innovations found in successful nongovernmental organization?run community health worker programs. In exploration of strategies to ensure sustainable community health worker programs at scale, we reconcile scaling constraints and scalable innovations by mapping strengths of nongovernmental organizations' community health worker programs to the challenges faced by programs currently deployed at national scale.

AB  - Abstract The present study addresses antecedents and consequences of attitudes towards collaboration in the context of World War II (WWII) in Belgium. A survey conducted on 922 Belgian French- and Dutch- speaking participants shows that, on overall, Dutch-speakers perceive collaboration as more moral and support amnesty of the former collaborators at a higher level than their Francophone counterparts. In addition, we show that these attitudes are predicted by the generational belonging, linguistic and national identification of the participants. Finally, we find that attitudes towards WWII collaboration are linked to specific political prospects for the future of the country only among Dutch-speakers. These findings suggest that, 75 years after its end, the issue of collaboration during WWII still divides the Belgian society. Furthermore, they underline the added value of a multi-level approach in the understanding of social psychological phenomena.

AB  - This paper explores the provision of disaster-related behavioural and mental health (DBH) services as a problem of institutional collective action in the United States. This study reviews the challenges that providers have in surmounting multi-organizational disconnects, unstable professional legitimacy, ambiguous information, and shifting disaster needs in developing a system for delivering DBH services. Based on the adaptive governance framework, it argues that existing protocols such as the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS) may be helpful in advancing collective action, but that real progress will depend on a recognition of norms, expectations, and credentials across many spheres?in other words, on the ability of responders to continuously adjust their procedures and administrative boundaries for behavioural health institutions.
