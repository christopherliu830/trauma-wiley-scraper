AB  - Basic stimulation (BS) is a multimodal approach used in the intensive care unit (ICU) to help patients to perceive, move, communicate and learn. The concept was developed in Germany in the 1970s to help multi-handicapped children. It was adapted to nursing in the 1980s, and to critical care nursing in the 1990s. Little is known about the use of BS outside of Germany although it has been gaining momentum in German-speaking countries as well as Scandinavia. The aim of the present study is to describe the extent and application of BS at Danish ICUs in 2006. The study had a prospective, descriptive, qualitative, multicentre design. Data were generated from key-informant telephone interviews (n?=?10). This study has shown that BS is dependent upon the personal interest of individual nurses. At most units the concept is rarely used, or used by only few practitioners, for only few patients, or only few of the elements of the technique are applied. The tenets of BS are similar to those of conventional nursing, and in some cases to health care in general. The concept shows promising potential for critical care nursing. It has, however, been introduced unsystematically at Danish ICUs and needs more management support, systematic implementation and clinical research.

AB  - Summary Orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is more common than previously perceived, as it may appear to cause no symptoms, or may result in complications from hypotension, such as falls, often being erroneously attributed to other causes. OH may be an initial sign of sympathetic failure, as commonly occurs in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and diffuse Lewy body disease. The usual method of detecting OH, with lying and standing blood pressure measurements performed after being upright for at least 3 min, may not detect OH in PD as the fall in blood pressure when upright may take longer. Furthermore, various stimuli in daily life such as food intake and anti-parkinsonian drugs may unmask or exacerbate an orthostatic fall in blood pressure. Symptoms indicative of OH are numerous and do not necessarily include loss of consciousness and syncope. Recognition of OH is important in diagnosis (as it may be an initial sign in MSA), in reducing potential trauma due to falls, and in enabling the use of increased dosage of, or additional, anti-parkinsonian drugs, when OH is a limiting factor. Of clinical importance is that OH can be effectively treated, using a combination of non-pharmacological and drug measures, which reduce morbidity and can substantially improve quality-of-life in patients with PD.

AB  - Sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death in patients in noncoronary intensive care units. Currently, there are no specific treatments that reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and MODS. We report three patients who received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for sepsis with MODS who completely recovered. The first patient, a 3-year-old male presented with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated respiratory, renal, coagulation, hepatic, and neurologic dysfunction. After 5 TPEs, the patient fully recovered. The second patient was a 36-year-old pregnant female who developed MODS at 22 weeks of gestation. She had developed respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation dysfunction following pneumonia and concurrent urinary tract infection resulting in an intrauterine fetal demise. After 8 TPEs, the patient was discharged home with only mild residual hepatic dysfunction. The third patient, a 50-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, was found unresponsive in over 100°F heat and diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus-associated MODS. Her respiratory, coagulation, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems were affected. The patient underwent 6 TPEs after which she had marked improvement. In conclusion, TPE may be an effective adjunct therapy in MODS by possibly removing toxic mediators and replacing deficient factors using donor plasma. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract One of the central considerations in the validity argument for the TOEFL iBT is the relationship between the language on the exam and the language required for university courses. Corpus linguistics has recently been shown to be an effective way to explore this relationship, which can also be considered as an aspect of authenticity. Applying Multi-Dimensional Analysis, our study is the first to directly compare the lexico-grammatical characteristics of texts produced by second language writers on a high-stakes standardized exam (the TOEFL iBT) to the characteristics of texts produced by the same writers for disciplinary writing tasks required as part of their academic career (e.g., lab reports, argumentative essays). Our findings show that the language of TOEFL iBT tasks have patterns of both similarity and difference from disciplinary tasks with respect to four linguistic dimensions of language use: (a) Compressed Procedural Information versus Stance toward the Work of Others, (b) Personal Stance, (c) Possible versus Completed Events, and (d) Information Density. Integrated iBT tasks show similarities to certain kinds of disciplinary tasks, while independent iBT tasks differ linguistically from almost all disciplinary writing tasks. These general patterns hold regardless of the score levels of test takers. We discuss the implications of these findings for language teaching and assessment.

AB  - Corporate strategist C.K. Prahalad begins by observing that the efficiency achieved by U.S. companies in recent years, brought about in part by EVA and EVA-like systems, is a necessary condition for wealth creation in the new competitive environment. For this reason, the EVA movement is now spreading to Europe and Asia. But, as Prahalad goes to argue, efficiency is not a sufficient condition for wealth creation; equally important is the quest for profitable growth opportunities. And this raises a potential objection to EVA and indeed all divisional performance measurement systems: They could end up reducing long-term growth and value by discouraging managers from capturing synergies among business units and leveraging core competencies to the fullest extent possible. Following Prahalad's discussion of the problem of capturing synergies and leveraging cross-unit capabilities in large, multi-business companies, moderator David Glassman explores potential solutions with top executives from a number of U.S. and Canadian companies. Among the most promising suggestions are significant managerial stock ownership (as exemplified by a plan used at Baxter International), a cross-unit auction system for evaluating large infrastructure investments pioneered by Stern Stewart, and, probably indispensable, strong encouragement of business unit collaboration by an active and accessible CEO.

AB  - Abstract Advances in biomanufacturing techniques have opened the doors to recapitulate human sensory organs such as the nose and ear in vitro with adequate levels of functionality. Such advancements have enabled simultaneous targeting of two challenges in engineered sensory organs, especially the nose: i) mechanically robust reconstruction of the nasal cartilage with high precision and ii) replication of the nose functionality: odor perception. Hybrid nasal organs can be equipped with remarkable capabilities such as augmented olfactory perception. Herein, a proof-of-concept for an odor-perceptive nose-like hybrid, which is composed of a mechanically robust cartilage-like construct and a biocompatible biosensing platform, is proposed. Specifically, 3D cartilage-like tissue constructs are created by multi-material 3D bioprinting using mechanically tunable chondrocyte-laden bioinks. In addition, by optimizing the composition of stiff and soft bioinks in macro-scale printed constructs, the competence of this system in providing improved viability and recapitulation of chondrocyte cell behavior in mechanically robust 3D constructs is demonstrated. Furthermore, the engineered cartilage-like tissue construct is integrated with an electrochemical biosensing system to bring functional olfactory sensations toward multiple specific airway disease biomarkers, explosives, and toxins under biocompatible conditions. Proposed hybrid constructs can lay the groundwork for functional bionic interfaces and humanoid cyborgs.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Transfusion is a corner stone treatment of sickle cell disease complications. However one of the serious complications of transfusions is represented by the delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) with a significant mortality. It is due to a massive intravascular haemolysis of both transfused and autologous red blood cells. It occurs between 5 to 20 days after a transfusion and is accompanied by a vaso-occlusive crisis and haemoglobinuria in almost all cases. The evolution can be life-threatening because of the appearance of a severe acute chest syndrome or a multi organ failure. About half patients are transferred in Intensive Care Unit. The biological diagnosis of DHTR is made by the rapid decline, or disappearance, of Hb A in sickle cell patients who were previously transfused. This event is associated with a significant increase of lactico-dehydrogenase (LDH) and worsening of anemia due to haemolysis. Allo antibodies are not found in 30%. DHTR is under diagnosed because of the delay between the transfusion and the symptoms, which mimic sickle cell vaso occlusive crises. This can lead to further transfusions that worsen the evolution and are ineffective. Because of the severity of this manifestation many treatment have been tried to improve the outcome as steroids, immunoglobulins, rituximab or eculizumab, without consensual guidelines. Early diagnosis of DHTR should help to decide the appropriate treatment, and avoid reiteration of transfusions. Transfusion indications should be maximally restricted in patients with previous post-transfusion haemolysis.

AB  - The author takes a renewed look at the constitutive aspects of experience, looking at it as process rather than contents. Recently more psychoanalytic voices are discernible that argue for the complexity and multi-leveled nature of inner experience. Yet the predominant and preeminent psychoanalytic voice has traditionally emphasized the linearity and single-factored nature of experience and all that is based on it: development, object relations, psychopathology, and treatment. The author offers an understanding of experience as stemming from the operation of two contiguous, ongoing modalities of processing internal and external input, and reflecting two polarities of the subject-object experience: of separateness and instrumentality, and of oneness and ongoing being. Such a conceptual reframing of experience harbors multiple implications for understanding subjectivity and inter-subjectivity, inter-relatedness as well as single-person psychology, and the all-important role of an experiential ?goodness-of-fit? in the analytic situation and elsewhere.

This review focuses on bark defenses, a front line against organisms trying to reach the nutrient-rich phloem. A major breach of the bark can lead to tree death, as evidenced by the millions of trees killed every year by specialized bark-invading insects. Different defense strategies have arisen in conifer lineages, but the general strategy is one of overlapping constitutive mechanical and chemical defenses overlaid with the capacity to up-regulate additional defenses. The defense strategy incorporates a graded response from ?repel?, through ?defend? and ?kill?, to ?compartmentalize?, depending upon the advance of the invading organism. Using a combination of toxic and polymer chemistry, anatomical structures and their placement, and inducible defenses, conifers have evolved bark defense mechanisms that work against a variety of pests. However, these can be overcome by strategies including aggregation pheromones of bark beetles and introduction of virulent phytopathogens. The defense structures and chemicals in conifer bark are reviewed and questions about their coevolution with bark beetles are discussed.

AB  - Over the last 50 years, the significance of the immune system in the development and control of cancer has been much debated. However, recent discoveries provide evidence for a role of immunological mechanisms in the detection and destruction of cancer cells. Forty years ago veterinary oncologists were already investigating the feasibility of treating neoplasia by enhancing anticancer immunity. Unfortunately, this research was hindered by lack of a detailed understanding of cancer immunology, this limited the specificity and success of these early approaches. The great forward strides made in our understanding of onco-immunology in recent years have provided the impetus for a resurgence of interest in anticancer immunotherapy for canine patients. In this article both these initial trials and the exciting novel immunotherapeutics currently in development are reviewed.

Randomized ?blinded? prospective clinical study. Animals? Thirty calves (mean 4.7?±?SD 2.5?weeks old) undergoing umbilical surgery. Methods? After premedication with xylazine (0.1?mg?kg?1, IM), anaesthesia was induced with ketamine (4?mg?kg?1, IV) and maintained with isoflurane in O2 administered through a circle breathing system. The calves were assigned randomly to receive a bolus of 2?mg?kg?1 lidocaine IV after induction of anaesthesia, followed by CRI of 50??g?kg?1?minute?1 (group L, n?=?15) or a bolus and CRI of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl, group S, n?=?15). End-tidal isoflurane was adjusted to achieve adequate depth of anaesthesia. Heart rate, direct arterial blood pressure and body temperature were measured intraoperatively. Groups were compared by t- tests, anova or Mann?Whitney rank sum test as appropriate. Results? The end-tidal concentration of isoflurane (median, IQR) was significantly lower in group L [1.0% (0.94?1.1)] compared to group S [1.2% (1.1?1.5)], indicating a 16.7% reduction in anaesthetic requirement during lidocaine CRI. Cardiopulmonary parameters and recovery times did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Lidocaine CRI may be used as a supplement to inhalation anaesthesia during umbilical surgery in calves in countries where such a protocol would be within the legal requirements for veterinary use in food animals. This study did not show any measurable benefit to the calves other than a reduction in isoflurane requirement.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine the behavioural impact of chemotherapy in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with chemotherapy only and to identify treatment-related or sociodemography-related factors that might be associated with behavioural outcome. Methods We examined 57 survivors of childhood ALL, who were off treatment for at least 2 years and were in remission, aged 4?18 years, and 221 unrelated healthy controls. The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) parent report was used either in English or in Bahasa Malaysia (the national language of Malaysia) to assess the behavioural outcome. Results Childhood ALL survivors had significantly higher scores on externalising behaviour on the CBCL parent report than did controls. Higher problem scores were found in ALL survivors with single parents on ?total problems? (P = 0.03) and subscales ?withdrawn? (P = 0.03), ?social problems? (P < 0.01) and ?delinquent behaviour? (P = 0.03) than in survivors with married parents. Significant associations were seen between a lower education level of the father and the variables representing internalising (withdrawn, anxious/depressed) and externalising (aggressive behaviour). We observed trends on higher scores in all scales in ALL survivors with single parents than in controls with single parents or with fathers with low education level, especially primary education only. Conclusions Malaysian childhood ALL survivors had a significantly increased risk for externalising behavioural problems, and there was a trend towards increased risk of problems in many other behavioural scales. Understanding the sociocultural dimension of patients? health is important to be able to design the most appropriate remedy for problem behaviours detected in this multi-ethnic population.

AB  - AbstractThis paper considers community-based adaptation (CBA) to climate change and its relationship to the theory and practice of participatory development. It is argued that CBA needs to recognise the considered experience of participatory development to date, particularly in relation to local involvement in project planning and implementation, as well as acknowledging the specific challenges raised by climate change. Without attention to risks and uncertainty, political structures and institutions, the necessarily multi-level nature of adaptation policy and programming, and the links between mitigation and adaptation politics and practice, outcomes of CBA interventions are unlikely to support pro-poor development.

AB  - Abstract This study utilises multi-isotopic analysis to reconstruct diet and source-water consumption from human remains collected at Carrizales, in the Zaña Valley of northern coastal Peru. Carrizales is a multicomponent site that encompasses the remains of (a) Early Intermediate Period (200?800 CE) cemeteries (Conjuntos 126 and 127), (b) Late Sicán/Lambayeque period (ca. 1100?1350 CE) domestic occupations (Conjuntos 125, 128, and 131), and (c) a planned town (reducción) into which indigenous people were resettled under Spanish rule, ca. 1572 CE (Conjunto 123). Faunal and botanical assemblages at the site differ significantly between the Late Sicán/Lambayeque and early colonial phases, suggesting a distinct shift in local subsistence regimes following Spanish colonisation and resettlement. Human remains were collected from Carrizales for the characterisation of dietary isotopes and further examination of the impacts of Spanish colonialism on native foodways. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope values were characterised in the enamel carbonate, bone carbonate, and bone collagen of individuals associated with Early Intermediate Period contexts (N = 4) and the late 16th century chapel within the site's reducción (N = 21). Over half of the study sample failed to produce viable bone collagen, an issue that is common in bioarchaeological samples from the north coast of Peru. However, among those with viable bone collagen and carbonate, there were minimal differences in δ13C, δ18O, and δ15N values between the two phases. This extends to values in enamel carbonate, which is highly resistant to diagenesis. Therefore, patterns in isotope values do not mirror the significant differences manifest in food remains from Carrizales. We suggest that (a) the diets of Early Intermediate Period individuals and Early Colonial period individuals buried at the site were quite similar, contrasting with the patterns indicated by Late Intermediate Period food remains, and (b) both populations obtained water from similar sources?a pattern that reinforces the characterisation of reducción in the Zaña Valley as a relatively local phenomenon in which nearby populations were concentrated into planned towns, rather than drawn from distant valleys.

AB  - Abstract In 2012, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) introduced the Next Accreditation System (NAS) for residency program accreditation. With implementation of the NAS, residents are assessed according to a series of new emergency medicine (EM)-specific performance milestones, and the frequency of assessment reporting is increased. These changes are driving the development of new assessment tools for the NAS that can be feasibly implemented by EM residency programs and that produce valid and reliable assessment data. This article summarizes the recommendations of the writing group on assessment of observable learner performance at the 2012 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference on education research in EM that took place on May 9, 2012, in Chicago, Illinois. The authors define an agenda for future assessment tool research and development that was arrived at by consensus during the conference.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Changes in health care delivery and graduate medical education have important consequences for the workforce in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM). This study compared career preparation and potential attrition of the PEM workforce with the prior assessment from 1998. Methods An e-mail survey was sent to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on EM and to non-AAP members board certified in PEM. Information on demographics, practice characteristics and professional activities, career preparation, future plans, and burnout (using two validated screening questions) was analyzed using standard descriptive statistics. Results Of 2,120 surveys mailed, 895 responses were received (40.8% response). Over half (53.7%) of respondents were female, compared with 44% in 1998. The majority (62.9%) practiced in the emergency department (ED) of a free-standing children's hospital. The distribution of professional activities was similar to that reported in 1998, with the majority of time (60%) spent in direct patient care. Half indicated involvement in research, and almost half had dedicated time for other activities, including emergency medical services (7.3%), disaster (6.9%), child abuse (5.0%), transport (3.6%), toxicology (2.3% of respondents), and other (13.6%); additionally, 21.3% had dedicated time for quality/safety. Respondents were highly satisfied (95.6%) with fellowship preparation for clinical care, but less satisfied with preparation for research (49.2%) and administration (38.7%). However, satisfaction with nonclinical training was higher for those within 10 years of medical school graduation. Forty-six percent plan to change clinical activity in the next 5 years, including reducing hours, changing shifts, or retiring. Overall, 11.9% of all respondents, including 20.1% of women and 2.6% of men (p < 0.001), report currently working part time. Large majorities endorsed feeling burned out at work (88.5%) or more callous toward people as a result of work (67.5%) at least monthly, with one in five reporting such feelings at least weekly. Conclusions While satisfaction with fellowship preparation for professional activities in PEM is improving, gaps remain in training in nonclinical skills. Symptoms of burnout are prevalent, and there is likely to be substantial attrition of PEM providers in the near future.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this paper was to develop a pro forma which classifies the components of service delivery and organization which may impact on the outcomes of elderly peoples? community and intermediate care services. The resulting analytic template provides a basis for comparison between services and may help guide service commissioning and development. A qualitative approach was used in which key evaluations and reports were selected on the basis that they described elderly peoples? community and intermediate care services. These were analysed systematically using a qualitative (template) approach to draw out the key themes used to describe services. Themes were then structured hierarchically into an analytic template. Seventeen key documents were analysed. The initial coding framework classified 334 themes describing intermediate care services. These items were then clustered into 78 categories, which were reduced to 17 subcategories, then six overall groupings to describe the services, namely; (1) context; (2) reason for the service; (3) service-users; (4) access to the service; (5) service structure; and (6) the organization of care. The resulting analytic template has been developed into a ?service pro forma? which can be used as a basis to describe and compare a range of services. We propose that all service evaluations should describe, in detail, their context in a comparable way, so that other services can learn from and/or apply the findings from these studies.
