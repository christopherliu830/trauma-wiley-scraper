AB  - meyer r.m. & o?brien-pallas l.l. (2010)?Nursing services delivery theory: an open system approach. Journal of Advanced Nursing?66(12), 2828?2838. Abstract Aim.? This paper is a discussion of the derivation of the Nursing Services Delivery Theory from the application of open system theory to large-scale organizations. Background.? The underlying mechanisms by which staffing indicators influence outcomes remain under-theorized and unmeasured, resulting in a ?black box? that masks the nature and organization of nursing work. Theory linking nursing work, staffing, work environments, and outcomes in different settings is urgently needed to inform management decisions about the allocation of nurse staffing resources in organizations. Data sources.? A search of CINAHL and Business Source Premier for the years 1980?2008 was conducted using the following terms: theory, models, organization, organizational structure, management, administration, nursing units, and nursing. Seminal works were included. Discussion.? The healthcare organization is conceptualized as an open system characterized by energy transformation, a dynamic steady state, negative entropy, event cycles, negative feedback, differentiation, integration and coordination, and equifinality. The Nursing Services Delivery Theory proposes that input, throughput, and output factors interact dynamically to influence the global work demands placed on nursing work groups at the point of care in production subsystems. Implications for nursing.? The Nursing Services Delivery Theory can be applied to varied settings, cultures, and countries and supports the study of multi-level phenomena and cross-level effects. Conclusion.? The Nursing Services Delivery Theory gives a relational structure for reconciling disparate streams of research related to nursing work, staffing, and work environments. The theory can guide future research and the management of nursing services in large-scale healthcare organizations.

AB  - Abstract Body awareness and reactivity dysfunction are characteristic of a range of psychiatric disorders. Although the neural pathways communicating between the body and brain that contribute to these experiences involve the autonomic nervous system, few research tools for studying subjective bodily experiences have been informed by these neural circuits. This paper describes the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the Body Awareness and Autonomic Reactivity subscales of the Body Perception Questionnaire-Short Form (BPQ-SF). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to data from three samples collected via the internet in Spain and the US and a college population in the US (combined n = 1320). Body awareness was described by a single factor. Autonomic reactivity reflected unique factors for organs above and below the diaphragm. Subscales showed strong reliability; converged with validation measures; and differed by age, sex, medication use, and self-reported psychiatric disorder. Post hoc analyses were used to create the 12-item Body Awareness Very Short Form. Results are discussed in relation to the distinct functions of supra- and sub-diaphragmatic autonomic pathways as proposed by the Polyvagal Theory and their potential dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Aim These international clinical practice recommendations (CPR) for developmental coordination disorder (DCD), initiated by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD), aim to address key questions on the definition, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and psychosocial aspects of DCD relevant for clinical practice. Method Key questions in five areas were considered through literature reviews and formal expert consensus. For recommendations based on evidence, literature searches on ?mechanisms?, ?assessment?, and ?intervention? were updated since the last recommendations in 2012. New searches were conducted for ?psychosocial issues? and ?adolescents/adults?. Evidence was rated according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (level of evidence [LOE] 1?4) and transferred into recommendations. For recommendations based on formal consensus, two meetings of an international, multidisciplinary expert panel were conducted with a further five Delphi rounds to develop good clinical practice (GCP) recommendations. Results Thirty-five recommendations were made. Eight were based on the evidence from literature reviews (three on ?assessment?, five on ?intervention?). Twenty-two were updated from the 2012 recommendations. New recommendations relate to diagnosis and assessment (two GCPs) and psychosocial issues (three GCPs). Additionally, one new recommendation (LOE) reflects active video games as adjuncts to more traditional activity-oriented and participation-oriented interventions, and two new recommendations (one GCP, one LOE) were made for adolescents and adults with DCD. Interpretation The CPR?DCD is a comprehensive overview of DCD and current understanding based on research evidence and expert consensus. It reflects the state of the art for clinicians and scientists of varied disciplines. The international CPR?DCD may serve as a basis for national guidelines. What this paper adds Updated international clinical practice guidelines on developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Refined and extended recommendations on clinical assessment and intervention for DCD. A critical synopsis of current research on mechanisms of DCD. A critical synopsis of psychosocial issues in DCD, with implications for clinical practice. The first international recommendations to consider adolescents and adults with DCD.

AB  - Titanium-based orthopedic implants are increasingly being fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as selective laser melting (SLM), direct laser deposition (DLD), and electron beam melting (EBM). These techniques have the potential to not only produce implants with properties comparable to conventionally manufactured implants, but also improve on standard implant models. These models can be customized for individual patients using medical data, and design features, such as latticing, hierarchical scaffolds, or features to complement patient anatomy, can be added using AM to produce highly functional patient-anatomy-specific implants. Alloying prospects made possible through AM allow for the production of Ti-based parts with compositions designed to reduce modulus and stress shielding while improving bone fixation and formation. The design-to-process lead time can be drastically shortened using AM and associated post-processing, making possible the production of tailored implants for individual patients. This review examines the process and product characteristics of the three major metallic AM techniques and assesses the potential for these in the increased global uptake of AM in orthopedic implant fabrication.

AB  - The recent clinical availability of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) opens the door for potential therapeutic repurposing for non-oncological indications. Considering (a) the preclinical efficacy data with PARP inhibitors in non-oncological diseases and (b) the risk?benefit ratio of treating patients with a compound that inhibits an enzyme that has physiological roles in the regulation of DNA repair, we have selected indications, where (a) the severity of the disease is high, (b) the available therapeutic options are limited, and (c) the duration of PARP inhibitor administration could be short, to provide first-line options for therapeutic repurposing. These indications are as follows: acute ischaemic stroke; traumatic brain injury; septic shock; acute pancreatitis; and severe asthma and severe acute lung injury. In addition, chronic, devastating diseases, where alternative therapeutic options cannot halt disease development (e.g. Parkinson's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis or severe fibrotic diseases), should also be considered. We present a preclinical and clinical action plan for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors.

AB  - A multimethod, multi-informant design was used to examine links among sociodemographic risk, family adversity, parenting quality, and child adjustment in families experiencing homelessness. Participants were 245 homeless parents (Mage = 31.0, 63.6% African American) and their 4- to 6-year-old children (48.6% male). Path analyses revealed unique associations by risk domain: Higher sociodemographic risk predicted more externalizing behavior and poorer teacher?child relationships, whereas higher family adversity predicted more internalizing behavior. Parenting quality was positively associated with peer acceptance and buffered effects of family adversity on internalizing symptoms, consistent with a protective effect. Parenting quality was associated with lower externalizing behavior only when sociodemographic risk was below the sample mean. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - We describe a series of groups run for mothers who were separated and who had initially presented with concerns about their children or their parenting. We discuss our systemic approach to groupwork and examine the process of change, using transcripts from the group sessions and feedback from the women. Using a systemic framework in groupwork makes it possible to broaden the context and focus of discussion to include relationships, premises and cultural beliefs. A group provides a context in which multi-perspectives can be elicited and affirmed, and group members can act as ?reflecting teams?for each other. Systemic groups can offer women in the process of separation emotional support, a sense of commonality of issues to be faced, and new and more enabling perspectives on their situations.

AB  - Development during the past 5?years increased significantly the quality of ultrasound mammography. After trying to receive better image quality by using higher and higher frequencies up to 20 Mhz the todays breakthrough was reached by better scan converter and transducer technology. Broadband tranducers, harmonic imaging, Siescape, Angio-powerdoppler, SonoCT, 3-D imaging and the use of contrast agent improved not only image but diagnostic quality of the method. The better scin, nipple, ductal an microcalcification visualization in combination with better mass delineation allowed a diagnostic accuracy equally or better than X-ray mammography. Ultrasound mammography is the logical examination following breast palpation, can complement mammography in all patients, substitute too frequent mammography controls and save unnecessary MRIs. Unfortunately the method suffers from lack of qualified education & training, qualified users and qualified payment. Gynecologists, radiologists and surgeons should struggle together to establish the method in a appropriate way ? in the interest of all women.

AB  - Cognitive decline is increasingly described as a co-morbidity of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment are not fully understood despite examining clinical factors, such as seizure frequency, and cellular mechanisms of excitotoxicity. We review the neuropsychometry evidence for progressive cognitive decline and examine the pathology and neuroimaging evidence supporting a neurodegenerative process in hippocampal sclerosis (HS)-related TLE. Accelerated cognitive decline is described in groups of adult HS-related TLE patients. Large childhood studies show early onset of seizures result in poor development of verbal memory and a hindrance in achieving cognitive potential. We discuss HS classification according to different patterns of neuronal loss and correlation to post-temporal lobectomy cognitive outcomes in refractory TLE patients. Factors such as lateralization of HS pathology, neuronal density and subtype have correlated to cognitive outcomes with varying significance between different studies. Furthermore, alterations in neuronal maturity, regenerative capacity and aberrant connectivity appear to affect cognitive performance post-operatively suggesting a complex multifactorial process. More recent studies have identified tau pathology being present in HS-related TLE and correlated to post-operative cognitive decline in some patients. A traumatic head injury-related or novel tauopathy has been hypothesized as an underlying process. We discuss the value of prospective and cross-sectional imaging in assessing cognition and review volumetric magnetic resonance studies with progressive ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy identified to correlate with seizure frequency. Finally, we consider the use of positron emission tomography biomarkers, such as tau tracers, and connectivity studies that may examine in vivo pathways and further explore cognitive decline in TLE.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the immune response to injectable anesthetics and sedatives and to compare the immunomodulatory properties between inhalation and injectable anesthetic protocols. Study design Review. Methods and databases Multiple literature searches were performed using PubMed and Google Scholar from March 2012 through November 2013. Relevant anesthetic and immune terms were used to search databases without year published or species constraints. The online database for Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia and the Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care were searched by issue starting in 2000 for relevant articles. Conclusion Sedatives, injectable anesthetics, opioids, and local anesthetics have immunomodulatory effects that may have positive or negative consequences on disease processes such as endotoxemia, generalized sepsis, tumor growth and metastasis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, anesthetists should consider the immunomodulatory effects of anesthetic drugs when designing anesthetic protocols for their patients.

AB  - Cecropia species, ranging from Mexico to northern Argentina and the West Indies, are pioneer trees that colonize cleared areas with high light. To determine their ages to help pinpoint the date of the area's disturbance, we need to understand their developmental and architectural changes over time. The simple architecture of Cecropia conforms to the model of Rauh; that is, it has orthotropic axes with lateral flowering and rhythmic branching. The axes are made of a succession of nodes and internodes whose length and associated lateral productions remain measurable for years. Thus, by describing the tree trunk node by node, we can depict the sequence of events involved in tree development. For 25 trees of C. sciadophylla, from two stations in French Guiana and Colombia, we recorded internode length and any presence of branches, and flowers for each node. Using autocorrelation coefficients, we found a high periodicity in flowering and branching, with inflorescences at every 25 nodes, stages of branches spaced by a multiple of 25 nodes, and alternation of long and short nodes every 25 nodes. Considering that flowering is annual for many Cecropia species, the main conclusion of this work is that C. sciadophylla has strong annual growth, branching, and flowering rhythms. In addition, the age of the tree can be estimated retrospectively by observing its adult morphology.

AB  - Abstract This study contrasts the ontogeny of the iliac crest apophysis using conventional radiography and multislice computed tomography (MSCT), providing probabilistic information for age estimation of modern Australian subadults. Retrospective abdominopelvic MSCT data acquired from 524 Australian individuals aged 7?25 and surveillance radiographs of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients included in the Paediatric Spine Research Group Progression Study (n = 531) were assessed. Ossification scoring of pseudo-radiographs and three-dimensional (3D) volume-rendered reconstructions using Risser (1958) quantitative descriptors indicate discrepancies in age estimates, stage allocation, and conflicting morphological progression. To mitigate visualization limitations associated with two-dimensional radiographs, we provide and validate a modified 3D-MSCT scoring tier of ossification, demonstrating complete fusion between 17.3?19.2 and 17.1?20.1 years in males and females. Legal demarcation for doli incapax presumption and age of majority (18 years) can be achieved using probability estimates from a fitted cumulative probit model for apophyseal fusion using the recalibrated standards.

AB  - Cartilage is one of the most essential tissues for healthy joint function and is compromised in degenerative and traumatic joint diseases. There have been tremendous advances during the past decade using quantitative MRI techniques as a noninvasive tool for evaluating cartilage, with a focus on assessing cartilage degeneration during osteoarthritis (OA). In this review, after a brief overview of cartilage composition and degeneration, we discuss techniques that grade and quantify morphologic changes as well as the techniques that quantify changes in the extracellular matrix. The basic principles, in vivo applications, advantages, and challenges for each technique are discussed. Recent studies using the OA Initiative (OAI) data are also summarized. Quantitative MRI provides noninvasive measures of cartilage degeneration at the earliest stages of joint degeneration, which is essential for efforts toward prevention and early intervention in OA.

AB  - The incidence and impact of crises, disasters and other extreme events appears to be increasing, thus heightening the significance of crisis research. The nature of such events ? sudden, inconceivable, damaging, sensitive, unique ? has encouraged unconventional methodological perspectives and practices. A review of these developments is timely. This article presents a bounded, temporally bracketed overview of the literatures exploring extreme events, structured around an ?ideal type? event sequence with six phases: incubation period, incident, crisis management, investigation, organizational learning and implementation of ?lessons learned?. While not a traditional review, this approach serves to overcome problems associated with phenomena resistant to precise definition, and maps the structure of a field characterized by fragmentation, insular traditions and epistemological pluralism, generating a template against which crises can be explored. Crisis research appears to have overcome the problems associated with relying on retrospective research designs, accessing sensitive data, addressing novel ethical concerns, developing multi-level explanations and using single case studies to develop generalizable theory. The wider adoption of these approaches in ?mainstream? organization and management studies may prompt innovation and fresh insights in other areas, particularly where the temporal structure of events, the role of slow-moving causes, and conjunctural reasoning, play significant roles.

AB  - Abstract This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the applications of microelectrodes to detect and monitor targeted analytes in bioelectrochemical processes. Notably, these processes are electrochemically driven reactions that involve the detection of targets from the biological realm. Wide-ranging applications of electrochemical sensors have been reported in the last few decades in various research fields, owing to favorable attributes such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid analysis, simplicity, easy fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Accordingly, in this Minireview, we explore recent advances in bioelectrochemistry based on small detection probes or structures modified for a variety of analytes, exploiting multi-approach advantages of enhanced electrochemical detection surface or targeted analyte pursuit. The target analytes included in this Minireview are neurotransmitters and disease biomarkers detected using enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrode modifications.
