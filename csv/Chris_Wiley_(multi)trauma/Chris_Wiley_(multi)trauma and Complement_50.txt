AB  - Abstract This article looks at the political economy of employer coordination of collective bargaining in the clothing or apparel manufacturing industry in Canada over three phases of globalisation: from the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 1974 to the impact of the entry of China in the WTO. Although prevailing accounts emphasise the force of exogenous change and the likely decentralisation of bargaining structures and demise of bargaining coordination by employers, this case highlights how unions and employers sought to preserve their institutional model. We find that actor strategies and their interrelations are a central part of the explanation of this apparent institutional stability, despite the real force of economic, organisational and public policy factors. However, it is a dynamic stability in which change processes, reflecting shifting power relations, are leading to important shifts in the nature of employer coordination.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: F2-isoprostanes have been used extensively to quantify lipid peroxidation in association with risk factors in various diseases. Horses with colic may have intestinal ischaemia and/or inflammation characterised by oxidative stress and increased production of isoprostanes. Objectives: To gather preliminary data regarding the feasibility of using urine F2-isoprostanes and isoprostane metabolites as early screening tools for the presence of gastrointestinal disease requiring surgical intervention in horses and ultimately develop a stall-side test capable of identifying these horses as early as possible for timely referral. Methods: Concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were determined by mass spectroscopy and normalised to urine creatinine (Cr) concentrations in urine samples from 42 healthy control horses and 43 horses with gastrointestinal pain or colic. Results: Horses with colic were treated medically (n = 21) or surgically (n = 22). Mean ± s.d. concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were significantly higher in horses with colic (2.94 ± 1.69 and 0.31 ± 0.22?ng/mg Cr, respectively), compared to control horses (1.89 ± 1.39 and 0.22 ± 0.08?ng/mg Cr, respectively). Mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations were significantly higher in horses undergoing surgery (0.38 ± 0.28?ng/mg Cr) compared to controls and medical colics (0.26 ± 0.11?ng/mg Cr). Nonsurvivors had significantly higher mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations (0.47 ± 0.39?ng/mg Cr) than control or surviving colic horses (0.29 ± 0.24?ng/mg Cr). Conclusions: Measurement of urine isoprostane metabolite concentration may be a useful prognostic indicator in equine colic. Potential relevance: Urine isoprostane metabolites may aid in early recognition of surgical colic. Isoprostanes are a potential therapeutic target to prevent further systemic and gastrointestinal tissue injury in horses with colic.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the sonomorphologic changes of the female pelvic floor after childbirth. Furthermore the timing of the appearance of these defects labor are examined. Methods We examined three groups of patients. 104 primiparae after vaginal delivery, 26 primiparae after elective cesarean section and 77 primiparae after secondary cesarean section within 3?7?days after delivery. To assess the morphology of the pelvic floor we used to examine the anal morphology, whereas the transrectal route was used to assess the paraurethral fixation of the lateral vaginal edges. Paravaginal defect was defined as descent of the lateral vaginal edges below the suburethral portion of the vagina and defects of the internal anal sphincter is defined by anterior vs. posterior thickness-ratio below 0.5. Clinical symptoms were documented using a standardized questionnaire. Results Primiparae after elective cesarean section served as control group. After vaginal delivery 7.3% of women showed urinary and 17.7% anal incontinence. Mode of delivery is significantly associated with anal and urinary incontinence. Paraurethral defect is predictive for urinary incontinence. Morphological defects of the pelvic floor could be documented after dilatation of the cervix to more than 7?cm. Conclusions Volume sonography after childbirth allows to document trauma to the pelvic floor due to vaginal delivery. Defects of the anterior compartment are predictive for the development of urinary incontinence. To study the timing of the appearance of pelvic floor defects during the course of vaginal delivery may be helpful for obstetrical decision making.

AB  - Background and objectives Guidelines for blood transfusions can help to ensure that blood is used appropriately, to avoid wastage and minimize risks, and are particularly important in sub-Saharan Africa because chronic blood shortages are widespread. This study explored transfusion practices and guideline compliance among clinicians at a tertiary hospital in the Volta region of Ghana. Materials and methods Participants in this 3-month study were clinicians from several hospital departments. The mixed methods study used a questionnaire to assess clinicians? knowledge of transfusion. Retrospective data from hospital records were used to assess whether each transfusion given during the study period complied with recommendations in the national transfusion guidelines. Results Although 44/50 clinicians self-rated their knowledge of transfusion in the questionnaire as good, only two were aware of the national transfusion guidelines, 48% listed incorrect indications for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and there was considerable variation in haemoglobin thresholds they used to guide transfusion decisions. Of the 313 transfusions of whole blood/packed cells and FFP given during the study, 49% were not in accordance with the guidelines. For the 31 FFP transfusions, under-dosing was common (87%) and 52% were not in accordance with the guidelines. 46/220 (21%) patients had no cause for anaemia documented during their admission. Conclusion There is a need to improve awareness of, and compliance with, national guidelines. A multi-faceted approach including education, guideline dissemination, transfusion audits and oversight from a hospital transfusion committee could contribute to much more effective use of blood components.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention by researchers worldwide in recent years for their small dimensions and unique architecture, and for having immense potential in nanomedicine as biocompatible and supportive substrates, as a novel tool for the delivery of therapeutic molecules including peptides, RNA and DNA, and also as sensors, actuators and composites. Key findings? CNTs have been employed in the development of molecular electronic, composite materials and others due to their unique atomic structure, high surface area-to-volume ratio and excellent electronic, mechanical and thermal properties. Recently they have been exploited as novel nanocarriers in drug delivery systems and biomedical applications. Their larger inner volume as compared with the dimensions of the tube and easy immobilization of their outer surface with biocompatible materials make CNTs a superior nanomaterial for drug delivery. Literature reveals that CNTs are versatile carriers for controlled and targeted drug delivery, especially for cancer cells, because of their cell membrane penetrability. Summary? This review enlightens the biomedical application of CNTs with special emphasis on utilization in controlled and targeted drug delivery, as a diagnostics tool and other possible uses in therapeutic systems. The review also focuses on the toxicity aspects of CNTs, and revealed that genotoxic potential, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of different types of CNTs must be explored and overcome by formulating safe biomaterial for drug delivery. The review also describes the regulatory aspects and clinical and market status of CNTs.

AB  - Mitral regurgitation (MR) related to chronic degenerative valvular disease is the most important cause of heart failure in dogs. Ultrasound examination of the heart can identify valve lesions, confirm the presence of valvular regurgitation, document cardiac remodeling, estimate intracardiac pressures, and quantify systolic ventricular function. These findings can influence prognosis or selection of medical therapy. Reductions in ventricular systolic function may be detected on serial echocardiographic examinations in some dogs with MR. However the changes in ventricular loading that accompany MR often complicate these measurements. For example, shortening and ejection fractions are often increased in severe MR, even in the setting of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography with Doppler is also used to assess ventricular diastolic function and filling pressures. This information helps predict the risk of congestive heart failure. However these findings are often rendered ambiguous by age-related impairment of ventricular relaxation, elevations in left atrial pressure due to MR, and effects of volume overload on myocardial tissue velocities. These factors limit the usefulness of ventricular filling and tissue velocities, as well as derived ratios such as the E/E' ratio, for predicting congestive heart failure in MR. More advanced Doppler and tissue echocardiographic methods, as well as prospective clinical studies, are needed to reduce the ambiguity involved with assessment of ventricular function and filling pressures in the setting of MR.

AB  - Abstract Clinical neurophysiologic examination of the pelvic floor is performed worldwide, but there is no consensus on the choice of tests, nor on technical details of individual methods. Standardized methods are, however, necessary to obtain their valid application in different laboratories for the purpose of collection of normative data, comparison of patient data and organization of multi-center studies. It is proposed that in patients with suspected ?lower motor neuron? type lesions concentric needle electromyography (CNEMG) is the most informative test to detect pelvic floor denervation/reinnervation, and the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle is the most appropriate muscle to be examined (either in isolation?when a selective lesion is suspected?or in addition to examination of other muscles). An algorithm consisting of standardized tests including a standardized approach to CNEMG examination of the EAS is presented. The proposed electrophysiologic assessment consists of a computer-assisted analysis of denervation and reinnervation features of the CNEMG signal, a qualitative assessment of reflex and voluntary activation of EAS motor units, and of electrical (or mechanical) elicitation of the bulbocavernosus reflex in those patients in whom manual anogenital stimulation failed to elicit a robust response in the EAS. The proposed protocol could serve as a basis for further studies on validity, sensitivity and specificity of electrophysiologic assessment in patients with different types of ?lower motor neuron? involvement of pelvic floor muscles and sacral dysfunction.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to report serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations in the progeny of a pair of English setters. These dogs had a history of producing puppies with a high prevalence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) secondary to either congenital deficiency or early onset juvenile atrophy of pancreatic acinar cells. Serum TLI concentrations in the clinically healthy parents of the puppies with EPI were normal, as were serum TLI concentrations in the unaffected puppies. However, serum TLI concentrations were extremely low (less than 1 ?g/litre) in three puppies at eight to 12 weeks of age when clinical signs of EPI were present. In addition, one of the three puppies, with low TLI concentrations at eight weeks of age, had serum TLI concentrations of 0.7 ?g/litre at two weeks of age even though no clinical signs were evident at that time. These results suggest that serum TLI assay may be a useful diagnostic aid in identifying puppies at a very early age with this unusual form of EPI.

AB  - Abstract Current systems for investigating child deaths in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have come under intense scrutiny in recent years and questions have been raised about the accuracy of child death investigations and resulting statistics. Research has highlighted the ways in which multidisciplinary input can contribute to investigative and review processes, a perspective which is further supported by recent UK policy developments. The experience of creating multidisciplinary child death review teams (CDRTs) in America highlights the potential benefits the introduction of a similar system might have. These benefits include improved multi-agency working and communication, more effective identification of suspicious cases, a decrease in inadequate death certification and a broader and more in-depth understanding of the causes of child deaths through the systematic collection and analysis of data. While a lack of funding, regional coordination and evaluation limit the impact of American CDRTs, the positive aspects of this process make it worthwhile, and timely, to consider how such a model might fit within our own context. Current policy developments such as the Home Office review of coroner services, the Children Bill and related Department for Education and Skills (DfES) work on developing screening groups demonstrate that strides have been made in respect of introducing a multidisciplinary process. Similarly, the development of local protocols for the investigation and[sol ]or review of child deaths in England, Wales and Northern Ireland highlights an increased focus on multidisciplinary processes. However, key issues from the American experience, such as the remit of CDRTs[sol ]screening panels, the need for national coordination and the importance of rigorous evaluation, can inform the development of a similar process in the UK.

AB  - Summary Since the introduction of laparoscopy and thoracoscopy in small animal surgery, the main focus has been on the development of surgical techniques and equipment. Not until recently has veterinary medicine recognized the importance of skills development for surgeons who want to incorporate minimally invasive surgery in their clinical practice. Robust evidence has been presented to demonstrate that skills developed by simulation indeed transfer into improved operating room performance. In fact, basic laparoscopic skills are most efficiently trained by simulation training. In addition, video games can be used as innovative teaching methods to enhance laparoscopic operative surgical performance.

AB  - The rapid diversification and ecological dominance of the flowering plants beg the question ?Why are there so many angiosperm species and why are they so successful?? A number of equally plausible hypotheses have been advanced in response to this question, among which the most widely accepted highlights the mutually beneficial animal?plant relationships that are nowhere better developed nor more widespread than among angiosperm species and their biotic vectors for pollination and dispersal. Nevertheless, consensus acknowledges that there are many other attributes unique to or characteristic of the flowering plants. In addition, the remarkable coevolution of the angiosperms and pollination/dispersal animal agents could be an effect of the intrinsic adaptability of the flowering plants rather than a primary cause of their success, suggesting that the search for underlying causes should focus on an exploration of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that might facilitate adaptive evolution and speciation. Here, we explore angiosperm diversity promoting attributes in their general form and draw particular attention to those that, either individually or collectively, have been shown empirically to favor high speciation rates, low extinction rates, or broad ecological tolerances. Among these are the annual growth form, homeotic gene effects, asexual/sexual reproduction, a propensity for hybrid polyploidy, and apparent ?resistance? to extinction. Our survey of the literature suggests that no single vegetative, reproductive, or ecological feature taken in isolation can account for the evolutionary success of the angiosperms. Rather, we believe that the answer to Darwin's second ?abominable mystery? lies in a confluence of features that collectively make the angiosperms unique among the land plants.

AB  - Premise of the Study Euphyllophytes, a clade including living ferns, horsetails, and seed plants, have a rich fossil record going back to the Early Devonian. The euphyllophyte spore wall has a complex structure, the evolutionary origins of which are incompletely understood. Psilophyton is the best-characterized basal euphyllophyte genus; thus, data on this genus can inform current hypotheses on spore wall structure and development, which propose a bilayered spore wall organization of combined spore and sporangial origin for the ancestral euphyllophyte. Methods We employed cellulose acetate peel sectioning of permineralized Lower Devonian (Emsian) Psilophyton dawsonii sporangia, combined with electron microscopy, to document spore wall structure and development. Key Results The Psilophyton dawsonii spore wall is bilayered. The inner spore wall is homogeneous, probably of lamellar construction. The outer spore wall, loosely attached to the inner wall, covers distal and equatorial spore areas, and has a foveolate base layer upon which stacks of sporopollenin lumps accrete centrifugally, forming the scaffolding for the final apiculate ornamentation. Conclusions This is the most complete account on spore wall structure, allowing developmental interpretations, in a basal euphyllophyte. The bipartite organization of the Psilophyton dawsonii spore wall reflects development as a result of two processes: an inner layer laid down by the spore cell and an outer layer of tapetal origin. Providing direct evidence on the spore wall of a basal euphyllophyte, these data confirm previous hypotheses and mark an empirically supported starting point for discussions of the evolution of spore wall development in euphyllophytes.

AB  - Abstract Some nuclear-encoded proteins are imported into higher plant plastids via the endomembrane (EM) system. Compared with multi-protein Toc and Tic translocons required for most plastid protein import, the relatively uncomplicated nature of EM trafficking led to suggestions that it was the original transport mechanism for nuclear-encoded endosymbiont proteins, and critical for the early stages of plastid evolution. Its apparent simplicity disappears, however, when EM transport is considered in light of selective constraints likely encountered during the conversion of stable endosymbionts into fully integrated organelles. From this perspective it is more parsimonious to presume the early evolution of post-translational protein import via simpler, ancestral forms of modern Toc and Tic plastid translocons, with EM trafficking arising later to accommodate glycosylation and/or protein targeting to multiple cellular locations. This hypothesis is supported by both empirical and comparative data, and is consistent with the relative paucity of EM-based transport to modern primary plastids.

AB  - Abstract The medicalisation of sleep is a rich and growing area of sociological interest. Previous research suggests that medicalisation is occurring within the context of physician office visits, but the inner workings remain unclear. This study is the first to provide perspectives on the office visit interaction from both sleepless patients (n = 27) and the physicians (n = 8) who treat them. Analyses of semi-structured qualitative interviews reveal that sleep-related conversations are typically patient-initiated in routine office visits. Physicians and patients conceptualised insomnia as a symptom of another issue (depression), an everyday problem of living (stress) or the result of a natural life process (aging). Lack of sleep was not necessarily linked to daytime impairment. Even though sleep aids were routinely requested and prescribed, patients and physicians consistently expressed attitudes of reluctance toward the use of sedative hypnotics. I call this a case of ?reluctant medicalisation? and highlight the liminal space between pathology and normalcy inhabited by patients and physicians. I also build on recent work acknowledging the dynamics between macro and micro levels of medicalisation and illustrate the influence of multilevel ?engines? (consumerism, biotechnology, managed care and physicians) in patients? and physicians? accounts. A virtual abstract of this paper can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/7uLHOJPHF0I

AB  - Abstract Background Participation in a group environment is an inherently complex undertaking for people with aphasia. It involves engaging in multi-person interactions with other people who may have a range of communication strengths and strategies at their disposal. The potential challenges of community aphasia-group participation and practice has had limited attention in the research literature. Evidence from group users have primarily been drawn from the perspective of long-term members or those participating in highly specific and time-bound groups. There is a need to explore the experiences of a broader sample, including people who have left groups, to improve our understanding of structures, processes as well as leadership behaviours that may facilitate positive group participation experiences. Aim To examine the potential factors operating within the group environment that contribute to positive and negative participation experiences. Methods  (2) an open and non-hierarchical group environment; (3) communication awareness and education amongst members; (4) meaningful activity; (5) ritual and structure; (6) composition and group size; and (7) group leadership. Conclusions & Implications People with aphasia perceive community aphasia-group participation to be beneficial to their ability to live well with aphasia. However, a range of challenges to successful participation are also evident. Inputs such as peer-to-peer communication strategies, shared roles and responsibilities, and consultation with regard to group objectives and processes provide group members with the opportunity to become active contributors, demonstrate competence and have influence over the group. When inputs are poorly implemented or absent, people with aphasia are at risk of feeling disabled and marginalized by the group experience.

AB  - Abstract Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex condition with multiple factors contributing to its aetiology and pathophysiology. Aetiologically these include genetics, life-time events and environment, and physiologically, changes in motility, central processing, visceral sensitivity, immunity, epithelial permeability and gastrointestinal microflora. Such complexity means there is currently no specific reliable biomarker for IBS, and thus IBS continues to be diagnosed and classified according to symptom based criteria, the Rome Criteria. Carefully phenotyping and characterisation of a ?large? pool of IBS patients across Europe and even the world however, might help identify sub-populations with accuracy and consistency. This will not only aid future research but improve tailoring of treatment and health care of IBS patients. Purpose The aim of this position paper is to discuss the requirements necessary to standardize the process of selecting and phenotyping IBS patients and how to organise the collection and storage of patient information/samples in such a large multi-centre pan European/global study. We include information on general demographics, gastrointestinal symptom assessment, psychological factors, quality of life, physiological evaluation, genetic/epigenetic and microbiota analysis, biopsy/blood sampling, together with discussion on the organisational, ethical and language issues associated with implementing such a study. The proposed approach and documents selected to be used in such a study was the result of a thoughtful and thorough four-year dialogue amongst experts associated with the European COST action BM1106 GENIEUR (www.GENIEUR.eu).
