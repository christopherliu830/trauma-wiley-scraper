AB  - Background:? This investigation aimed at examining, through an epidemiological study, the social demographic, family and individual determinants of behaviour problems in preschool children. Method:? Six hundred and thirty-four children, age four years, and their mothers, belonging to a cohort of 5,304 children being followed from birth, took part in the study. During a home visit, the child's behaviour problems and IQ were examined, as well as the prevalence of maternal psychiatric disorder, the quality of the home environment, and other social demographic, family and individual factors. Results:? The results revealed a prevalence of children's behaviour problems of 24% (clinical and borderline groups). Regression analysis showed that maternal psychiatric disorder, education and age, number of younger siblings and quality of the home environment explained 28% of the variance of the child's behaviour problems. Conclusions:? The results point to the multi-determination of child behaviour problems.

AB  - SUMMARY Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae include pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. All these are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pneumococcus can colonize the nasopharynx, and this can be a prelude to bronchopneumonia and invasion of the vasculature space. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood?brain barrier and entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where the bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The infected host may develop septicaemia and/or meningitis secondary to bronchopneumonia. Also septicaemia is a common precursor of meningitis. The mechanisms surrounding the sequence of infection are unknown, but will be dependent on the properties of both the host and bacterium. Treatment of these diseases with antibiotics leads to clearance of the bacteria from the infected tissues, but the bacteriolytic nature of antibiotics leads to an acute release of bacterial toxins and thus after antibiotic therapy the patients can be left with organ-specific deficits. One of the main toxins released from pneumococci is the membrane pore forming toxin pneumolysin. Here we review the extensive studies on the role of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent an attractive source for regenerative medicine. However, prior to their application, fundamental questions regarding molecular characterisation, growth and differentiation of MSCs must be resolved. Objectives: To compare and better understand the behaviour of equine MSCs obtained from bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT) in culture. Methods: Five horses were included in this study. Proliferation rate was measured using MTT assay and cell viability; apoptosis, necrosis and late apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of 7 surface marker genes were quantified using RT-qPCR and CD90 was also analysed by flow cytometry. Differentiation was evaluated using specific staining, measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and analysis of the mRNA expression. Results: High interindividual differences were observed in proliferation in both cell types, particularly during the final days. Statistically significant differences in viability and early apoptosis of cultured AT- and BM-MSCs were found. The highest values of early apoptosis were observed during the first days of culture, while the highest percentage of necrosis and late apoptosis and lowest viability was observed in the last days. Surface marker expression pattern observed is in accordance to other studies in horse and other species. Osteogenic differentiation was evident after 7 days, with an increasing of ALP activity and mRNA expression of osteogenic markers. Adipogenic differentiation was achieved in BM-MSCs from 2 donors with one of the 16 media tested. Chondrogenic differentiation was also observed. Conclusions: Proliferation ability is different in AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs. Differences in viability and early apoptosis were observed between both sources and CD34 was only found in AT-MSCs. Differences in their osteogenic and adipogenic potential were detected by staining and quantification of specific tissue markers. Potential relevance: To provide data to better understand AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs behaviour in vitro.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To determine the publication status and time to publication of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were presented at the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) meetings from 1995 to 2003. The impact of positive-outcome bias, time-lag bias, and gray literature bias also was assessed. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of RCT abstracts presented at nine SAEM scientific meetings. Electronic searches identified publications from the abstracts. Results: Of 4,399 abstracts, 383 (8.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.8% to 9.5%) were identified as RCTs. One hundred ninety-four (50.7%; 95% CI = 45.7% to 55.7%) were subsequently published up to May 2004. The median time to publication was 32 months (95% CI = 23 to 41), with 59% of RCT abstracts published within five years of presentation. No evidence of positive-outcome bias or time-lag bias was identified; however, changes from abstract to manuscript were found. Manuscripts were less likely to endorse the experimental intervention than were abstracts (OR, 0.2; 95% CI = 0.0 to 0.6). Conclusions: The proportion of emergency medicine RCT abstracts published is slightly lower than that for other biomedical specialties; however, biases reported by investigators in other biomedical areas do not appear to be as problematic in emergency medicine research. Differences between conclusions from abstracts and manuscripts must be considered when employing meeting abstracts as a source of evidence for future research or for systematic reviews in emergency medicine.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-10 is one of the most crucial immunoregulatory cytokines. Its short-term effects have been analysed extensively, but little is known about its long-term effects. This is of considerable importance, as high systemic IL-10 levels are present for long periods in patients with persistent viral infections, certain cancers and in critical care patients. Our study investigated the effects of the long-term presence of IL-10 on human peripheral blood monocytes. In vitro, IL-10 treatment of these cells for 7?days induced the development of a novel cell type characterized by unique phenotypical and functional characteristics. These cells showed high HLA-DR expression and low expression of CD86 and other co-stimulatory molecules on their surface. The mRNA levels of both HLA-DR and CD86 were high, but no intracellular accumulation of CD86 protein was observed. With respect to its function, these cells showed strongly diminished tumour necrosis factor-α production following lipopolysaccharide stimulation, strongly diminished allogenic CD4+ T cell stimulatory capacity, and even induced a hyporesponsive state in CD4+ T cells. The phenotype remained stable despite the removal of IL-10. In vivo, we found monocytic cells from patients exhibiting this phenotype after long-term IL-10 exposure. These results complement our knowledge further about the biological effects of IL-10 and may provide an explanation for the sustained immunodeficiency in cases of the persistent presence of systemic IL-10.

AB  - Abstract Housing is a key social determinant of health that contributes to the well-documented relationship between socioeconomic status and health. This study explored how individuals with histories of unstable and precarious housing perceive their housing or shelter situations, and the impact of these settings on their health and well-being. Participants were recruited from the Health and Housing in Transition study (HHiT), a longitudinal, multi-city study that tracked the health and housing status of people with unstable housing histories over a 5-year period. For the current study, one-time semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of HHiT study participants (n = 64), living in three cities across Canada: Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver. The findings from an analysis of the interview transcripts suggested that for many individuals changes in housing status are not associated with significant changes in health due to the poor quality and precarious nature of the housing that was obtained. Whether housed or living in shelters, participants continued to face barriers of poverty, social marginalization, inadequate and unaffordable housing, violence, and lack of access to services to meet their personal needs.

AB  - Summary A 16-year-old mare was presented as an emergency to the Equine Hospital of the Veterinary School of Lyon, with a 1-month history of respiratory distress. On admission the mare was in poor body condition, with severe inspiratory and expiratory dyspnoea associated with severe hypoxaemia and marked tachycardia. Wheezes were auscultated. A pulmonary biopsy revealed fibrosis of about 40% of the parenchyma. Following an episode of atrial fibrillation, an echocardiogram was carried out which revealed signs of pulmonary hypertension, consistent with cor pulmonale. Despite the lack of aetiologic explanation for the primary pulmonary disease, the general condition of the mare improved with the administration of high-dosed corticoids and antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - In contrast to the critical attention given to Marcel Beyer's novels Flughunde (1995), Spione (2000), and Kaltenburg (2008), his cycle of poems Falsches Futter (1997) has received little similar comment. Based on Beyer's criticism of poetry in the service of (Nazi) ideology in Falsches Futter, and drawing from his comments on poetry in his nonfictional publications, this article investigates how the poems embrace yet also disavow communication with readers, in order to reject poetry as ethical and political orientation and engage readers in an open dialogue about Germany's past and present. By using disparate images and cryptic allusions, and by mixing his poetic voice with those of Brecht, Benn, and others, Beyer creates a multi-layered poetic discourse that oscillates between constructing and rejecting an intelligible world in its presentation of twentieth-century German history, and that both questions and affirms the functionality of poetic discourse. Thus despite his skepticism toward language, Beyer embraces a provocative poetry as playful resistance to reality, which in Falsches Futter is overshadowed by violence, disillusionment, and desolation.

AB  - Aims and objectives To analyse current evidence on the efficacy of bandage systems containing both elastic and inelastic components (mixed-component systems). Background International consensus on the efficacy of types of compression systems is difficult to achieve; however, mixed-component systems are being promoted as combining the best properties of both elastic and inelastic bandage systems and increasingly being used to treat venous leg ulcers in practice. Design A systematic literature review. Methods Search terms such as venous leg ulcer, varicose ulcer, leg ulcer, compression, bandage, elastic, inelastic, short stretch, healing rate, interface pressure, mixed component, two-layer, four-layer and multi-layer were used in database and hand searches in several combinations. Limits were set for years 2005?March 2015 and English-language publications. Results A total of 475 studies were identified at initial search, and following elimination from abstract and title, this was reduced to 7. A further study was identified on Google Scholar, bringing the final number of studies fitting inclusion criteria to 8. The following subgroups relating to outcomes of efficacy were identified: ulcer healing, maintenance of interface pressure, slippage, ease of application and patient quality of life. Conclusions Mixed-component systems were found to have comparable ulcer healing rates to alternative compression systems and be easy to apply; have similar abilities to maintain pressure as four-layer bandages and better abilities than short-stretch bandages; have less slippage than alternative systems; and to be significantly associated with several favourable quality of life outcomes. Clinician skill in bandage application was an uncontrolled variable in all eight papers included in the review, which may limit reliability of findings. Relevance to clinical practice This review synthesises existing evidence on the efficacy of mixed-component systems and encourages clinicians to regard them as an effective alternative to purely elastic or inelastic compression systems. Additionally, it highlights the importance of clinician skill in bandage application as a crucial determinant of effective compression.

AB  - Abstract Cocaine addiction is a multi-dimensional behavioral disorder characterized by a loss of control over cocaine taking despite of detrimental consequences. Structural MRI studies have revealed association between cocaine consumption and gray matter volume (GMV) in cocaine-addicted patients. However, the behavioral correlates of GMV in cocaine addiction are poorly understood. Here, we used a DSM-IV-based rat model of cocaine addiction with high face validity for structural imaging. According to three behavioral sub-dimensions of addiction, rats were separated into two groups showing either addict-like or non-addict-like behavior. These behavioral sub-dimensions were (1) the inability to refrain from drug-seeking and taking, (2) high motivation for the drug, and (3) maintained drug use despite negative consequences. In these rats, we performed structural MRI with voxel-based morphometry and analyzed the interaction of GMV with behavioral sub-dimensions in cocaine-addicted rats. Our major findings are that GMV differentially correlate with the inability to refrain from drug-seeking and taking in addict-like and non-addict-like rats within the somatosensory cortices and the amygdala. High motivation for the drug differentially correlates with GMV in addict-like and non-addict-like rats within the medial prefrontal cortex, and maintained drug use despite negative consequences differentially correlates with GMV in these two groups of rats within the periaqueductal gray. Our results demonstrate that the behavioral differences characterizing addict-like and non-addict-like rats in each behavioral sub-dimension of addiction are reflected by divergent covariance with GMV. We conclude that structural imaging provides specific neuroanatomical correlates of behavioral sub-dimensions of addiction.

AB  - Abstract.? Cancer is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease involving a succession of genetic changes (frequently caused or accompanied by exogenous trauma), and resulting in a molecular phenotype that in turn results in a malignant specification. The development of malignancy has been described as a multistep process involving self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and finally tissue invasion and metastasis. The quantitative analysis of networking molecules within the cells might be applied to understand native-state tissue signalling biology, complex drug actions and dysfunctional signalling in transformed cells, that is, in cancer cells. High-content and high-throughput single-cell analysis can lead to systems biology and cytomics. The application of cytomics in cancer research and diagnostics is very broad, ranging from the better understanding of the tumour cell biology to the identification of residual tumour cells after treatment, to drug discovery. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint in detail these processes on the molecular, cellular and tissue level. A comprehensive knowledge of these will require tissue analysis, which is multiplex and functional; thus, vast amounts of data are being collected from current genomic and proteomic platforms for integration and interpretation as well as for new varieties of updated cytomics technology. This overview will briefly highlight the most important aspects of this continuously developing field.
