AB  - Summary Haemophilia A and B are rare X-lined hemorrhagic disorders that typically affect men. Women are usually asymptomatic carriers, but may be symptomatic and, rarely, also express severe (factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) <0.01 U mL?1) or moderately severe (FVIII/FIX 0.01?0.05 U mL?1) phenotypes. However, data on clinical manifestations, genotype and the psychosocial ramifications of illness in severely affected females remain anecdotal. A national multi-centre retrospective study was conducted to collect a comprehensive data set on affected US girls and women, and to compare clinical observations to previously published information on haemophilic males of comparable severity and mildly affected haemophilic females. Twenty-two severe/moderate haemophilia A/B subjects were characterized with respect to clinical manifestations and disease complications; genetic determinants of phenotypic severity; and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Clinical data were compared as previously indicated. Female patients were older than male patients at diagnosis, but similarly experienced joint haemorrhage, disease- and treatment-related complications and access to treatment. Gynaecological and obstetrical bleeding was unexpectedly infrequent. F8 or F9 mutations, accompanied by extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern (XIP), were primary determinants of severity. HR-QoL was diminished by arthropathy and viral infection. Using systematic case verification of participants in a national surveillance registry, this study elucidated the genetics, clinical phenotype and quality of life issues in female patients with severe/moderate haemophilia. An ongoing international case-controlled study will further evaluate these observations. Novel mechanistic questions are raised about the relationship between XIP and both age and tissue-specific FVIII and FIX expression.

AB  - This paper examines the question of whether a fetus can feel pain. The question is divided into four sub questions: What is pain? What is the neurology of pain processing? What is the fetus? Are there good reasons for holding that fetuses feel pain? Pain is suggested to be a multi-dimensional phenomenon drawing on emotional and sensory processes ? a consequence of a gradual development involving a number of noxious events rather than an automatic consequence of injury or disease. The non-automaticity of pain is emphasised in the discussion of pain neurology that defies explanations based on a specialised neuronal ?pain-centre?. The development of the fetus is considered with respect to developmental neurobiology, behavioural and neurological responses to stimulation, and hormonal and neurochemical responses to noxious stimulation. While acknowledging that the development of the fetus is complex, especially after 26 weeks gestation, considerable development is still to occur, even after birth. The fetal pain literature is criticised for tending to exaggerate fetal development. Finally, the difficulty of explaining the subjectivity of pain in materialist terms is discussed. Pain is suggested to arise with development of the necessary neurological, cognitive and emotional structures. Pain experience is placed at approximately 12 months of age, though this is within the context of a continuum of awareness rather than a straight ?on-off? switch. The major moral implication of this stance is to place the burden of proof for analgesic use onto clinical measures, rather than relying upon the, so far, poorly supported assumption of pain awareness.

AB  - Abstract.? Cancer is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease involving a succession of genetic changes (frequently caused or accompanied by exogenous trauma), and resulting in a molecular phenotype that in turn results in a malignant specification. The development of malignancy has been described as a multistep process involving self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and finally tissue invasion and metastasis. The quantitative analysis of networking molecules within the cells might be applied to understand native-state tissue signalling biology, complex drug actions and dysfunctional signalling in transformed cells, that is, in cancer cells. High-content and high-throughput single-cell analysis can lead to systems biology and cytomics. The application of cytomics in cancer research and diagnostics is very broad, ranging from the better understanding of the tumour cell biology to the identification of residual tumour cells after treatment, to drug discovery. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint in detail these processes on the molecular, cellular and tissue level. A comprehensive knowledge of these will require tissue analysis, which is multiplex and functional; thus, vast amounts of data are being collected from current genomic and proteomic platforms for integration and interpretation as well as for new varieties of updated cytomics technology. This overview will briefly highlight the most important aspects of this continuously developing field.

International Journal of Older People Nursing?5, 219?226?doi: 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2010.00209.x Aim.? To describe the role of geriatric emergency management nurses as a catalyst for culture change in emergency department processes with the goal to improve care and outcomes of older people. Background.? The changing context and literature has called for a culture change within emergency department care to integrate principles of older people care into care delivery. There is a paucity of reports describing how geriatric emergency care models bring about a broader change in culture within the entire emergency department. Methods.? The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care in Canada established a programme to place geriatric emergency management nurses into emergency departments with the goal to improve delivery of care through development of unique, site-appropriate solutions. Results.? Geriatric emergency management nurses incorporate capacity building into their role to develop and strengthen the skills, instincts, abilities, process and resources of the emergency department. Care processes focus on areas of staffing, mobilization, comfort, medication, hygiene, nutrition/hydration, cognition, environment, equipment and stimulation. Multi-modal educational strategies and advocacy promote appropriate person-centred care. Improved communication among care providers at key patient transition points remains a priority system-level improvement. Conclusion.? Geriatric emergency management nurses work collaboratively with the emergency department team to facilitate change in the way that emergency department care is provided to the older person experiencing health emergencies. Implications for practice.? Known strategies that have been effective in improving outcomes for older people within the hospital and residential care setting can be generalized into emergency department care. Further research into the effectiveness of these strategies in this environment is recommended.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study looked to investigate a new quantitative metric, R2???R1? (1/T2???1/T1?), using magnetic resonance (MR) images and voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) for detecting early cartilage degeneration and explore the association with patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) in patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Sixty-four patients from three sites were bilaterally scanned on a 3T MR with a combined T1?/T2 protocol to calculate R1? (1/T1?) and R2 (1/T2) values at baseline and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Non-rigid registration was applied to align images onto a template, allowing VBR to determine VBR rate differences and explore cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between injured and uninjured knees, generating Statistical Parametric Maps (SPMs). Baseline R2???R1? differences were further correlated with change in PROMs from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) from baseline to 6 months. Cross-sectional results demonstrated low relaxation rate differences in the injured patella (baseline: 21%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 18%, p?=?0.02), lateral tibia (baseline: 25%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 24%, p?=?0.01), and weight-bearing regions of the tibia and femur. The uninjured patella showed significant longitudinal changes (17%, p?=?0.02). R2???R1? differences showed significant correlations with KOOS PROMs, particularly in the lateral tibia, patella, and trochlea. R2???R1? difference VBR analyses provide new and highly sensitive parameters for assessing early cartilage degeneration in patients after ACL injury by integrating findings from both T1? and T2, commonly used relaxation time parameters, into a single metric. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objectives Patient expectations of treatment effects could influence neuropsychological and clinical outcomes in clinical trials of behavioral and lifestyle interventions, which could potentially confound the interpretation of findings. Our aim was to examine whether patient expectancy mediated effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for improving cognitive function and clinical outcome. Methods The present study uses data from a single-blind, multi-site, randomized controlled trial comparing Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to a health education attention control in older adults with anxiety and/or depressive disorders and subjective cognitive concerns. Using the Credibility and Expectations Questionnaire (CEQ), we measured expectancy and perceived credibility of the interventions assigned to patients. Using mediational analysis, we examined the influence of expectancy and credibility on two key outcomes: memory performance and clinical global improvement. Results Neither expectancy nor perceived credibility of intervention accounted significantly for MBSR's effectiveness for memory test performance or clinical global improvement. Conclusion In this clinical trial, expectancy for improvement did not account for the effectiveness of MBSR on memory performance or clinical outcomes in depressed and anxious older adults. We advise that clinical trials of behavioral and lifestyle interventions for brain health in older adults should measure and test the role of expectancy.

AB  - This article reports a multi-professional development project that was based on an action science design. The purpose was to develop ?acknowledging communication? in a psychiatric department for young people, and the objective to study the staffs? experiences of participating in the project. The professional part of the project has its foundation in Schibbye?s treatment theory of inter-subjective understanding of relationships, and involves three main approaches from her theory: self-reflection, self-delimitation and emotional presence. The article presents the specific action design used, where reflection processes were developed in three different arenas: multidisciplinary Reflection groups, a Leader support group for the group leaders of the Reflection groups and collective Project seminars for all employees. A formal study programme designed to increase professional expertise, 15 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), was also offered. The research methods included the researcher?s process notes taken during the process, field notes from participating in the Leader support group, and qualitative interviews of eight informants participating in the various reflection arenas. The article presents and discusses the experiences evolved from the methods that were developed during the professional action science project: reflection on specific situations of interaction with patients in the form of oral/written narratives and the development of video presentations in combination with ?reflective teams?. The study showed that to facilitate change in the role of staff members, it is important to combine several reflection arenas where theoretical principles can be converted into practical action. By drawing data from only one study site, the study has a limited transferability, but should be of interest for professionals working with clinical change processes.

AB  - Abstract Since the Osler's identification of the inherited nature of hereditary angioedema, a huge array of information was collected on pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. Over the last years, information grew fast, and mutations in different genes, in addition to C1-inhibitor, were found to be causative. All types are inherited as autosomal-dominant traits with incomplete penetrance and little or no genotype-phenotype correlation. As a result, the clinical expression is characterized by a large heterogeneity. The acknowledgement of mechanisms leading to heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype is likely to provide important information not only for a better understanding of the pathogenesis but also for therapy. Regardless of which gene is mutated, similar pathways seem to play a pivotal role, triggering the up-regulation of contact activation system/kallikrein kinin system and giving rise to an unbalanced increase of bradykinin. However, notwithstanding the increase of bradykinin in bloodstream, the phenomenon is localized and no general vascular leakage and oedema is recognized. Thus, it is conceivable that there exist one or more localized factors that stimulate the production of bradykinin, which does not become a systemically event. Uncovering of these factors may shed lights on the missing part of the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema. The present review, collecting information on pathogenesis from biochemical and genetics investigations, tries to provide a comprehensive view of the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema. This can allow for a better understanding of the disease and lead to focused investigations that can further improve our knowledge.

AB  - Summary: The data presented indicate the trend in perinatal mortality rates and show not only where improvement has occurred, but also where further improvement can be anticipated. The national figures emphasize very clearly that the death rates rise rather sharply in primigravidae over the age of 35 and in multi-gravidae who have had 5 or more children. It is essential, therefore, that if the perinatal mortality associated with these 2 groups is to be further reduced, particular care must be given to these mothers during pregnancy and labour. Furthermore, it has been shown conclusively that the lower the social class of the father, the higher the foetal loss. Every effort must therefore be made to improve the living standards of this class. A study of hospital statistics indicates that the known causes of perinatal mortality can be divided into 3 main groups: (a) Prematurity: Foetal loss associated with prematurity in the past has been high, but methods of controlling infection in the newborn have saved many lives. Nevertheless, prematurity is the largest single cause of death within the first 7 days of life. It accounts for some 20% of all foetal deaths and, when those associated with toxaemia are added, the total is quite appreciable. A number of factors are involved in premature labour, so that it can rarely be prevented, but nonetheless every effort should be made. Hospitalization of those with multiple pregnancies at the 28th-30th week of gestation and the maintenance of a strict hospital régime until the 36th week reduces the incidence of premature labour in the majority of cases. Furthermore, added rest at this stage of pregnancy not only lowers the incidence of prematurity, but also diminishes that of toxaemia. (b) Congenital abnormalities: This is an important group. Our knowledge, however, of the genetic defects in the human is so scanty that it is unlikely that there will be improvement in this group in the immediate future. (c) Toxaemia: Although the data indicate that the perinatal mortality associated with toxaemia has been reduced, this condition still accounts for some 20% of foetal deaths. Prematurity is undoubtedly a factor, but this would be partially overcome if the incidence of toxaemia could be reduced. This can only be accomplished by a more intensified scheme of antenatal supervision. The importance of an autopsy in all cases of perinatal death has been emphasized. Thereby not only may much maternal distress be allayed but also prognosis for the future may be assessed. The significance of precise knowledge cannot be overstated. A considerable further reduction in perinatal mortality is of immediate concern and is a challenge to all of us.

AB  - Abstract Background? Genetic disorders occasionally provide the means to uncover potential mechanisms linking gene expression and physical or cognitive characteristics or behaviour. Prader?Willi syndrome (PWS) is one such genetic disorder in which differences between the two main genetic subtypes have been documented (e.g. higher verbal IQ in one vs. higher performance IQ in the other; slower than normal reaction time in one vs. normal in the other). In a population study of PWS, the IQ distribution of people with PWS was approximately normal. This raises the question of whether this distribution arose from a systematic effect of PWS on IQ (hypothesis 1) or whether it was the fortuitous result of random effects (hypothesis 2). Method? The correlation between PWS and sibling IQ was determined in order to discriminate between the two hypotheses. In the first case we would expect the correlation to be similar to that found in the general population (0.5); in the second case it would be zero. Results? It was found that the overall PWS?sibling IQ correlation was 0.3 but that the two main genetic subtypes of PWS differed in their familial IQ relationships. As expected, the IQs of normal siblings correlated 0.5, and this was also the case with one genetic subtype of PWS (uniparental disomy) and their siblings, while the other subtype IQ correlated ?0.07 with sibling IQ. Conclusions? This is a potentially powerful result that gives another clue to the role of genes on chromosome 15 in the determination of IQ. It is another systematic difference between the genetic subtypes of PWS, which needs an explanation in terms of the very small genetic differences between them.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Geriatric horses (aged ≥15 years) represent a substantial proportion of the equine population, yet very few studies have investigated the prevalence of diseases within the UK equine geriatric population. Objectives: To describe the provision of routine preventive health care measures, prevalence of clinical signs of disease and the prevalence of owner reported diseases. Additionally, the effect of increasing age on the provision of preventive health care and the presence or absence of clinical signs and disease was assessed. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, surveying a randomly selected sample of veterinary registered owners with horses aged ≥15 years, using a self-administered postal questionnaire. Results: As geriatric horses increased in age, there was a reduction in the provision of preventive health care measures, such as vaccination, farrier care and routine veterinary checks. Only 68.7% of horses had received a routine veterinary visit within the previous 12 months. Owners frequently observed clinical signs in their animals, with 77% reporting at least one clinical sign of disease. Increasing age was associated with increased reporting of many clinical signs of disease. Over half (58%) of horses had at least one episode of disease within the previous 12 months, yet only 31% of owners reported that their animal currently suffered from a known disease or disorder. Conclusions and potential relevance: Although owners frequently observed clinical signs in their aged horse, there may be incorrect or under recognition of many diseases and health problems. Reduced frequency of routine preventive health care measures, along with suboptimal owner recognition of health and welfare problems may lead to compromised welfare in the geriatric population.

AB  - While neurovascular diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the leading causes of disability in the world, the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained remarkably limited. There is a dire need to develop new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic options. The study of proteomics is particularly enticing for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, which most likely involve multiple gene interactions resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Currently, rapidly progressing neuroproteomic techniques have been employed in clinical and translational research to help identify biologically relevant pathways, to understand cerebrovascular pathophysiology, and to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Future integration of proteomic with genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies will add new perspectives to better understand the complexities of neurovascular injury. Here, we review cerebrovascular proteomics research in both preclinical (animal, cell culture) and clinical (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialyates, tissue) studies. We will also discuss the rewards, challenges, and future directions for the application of proteomics technology to the study of various disease phenotypes. To capture the dynamic range of cerebrovascular injury and repair with a translational targeted and discovery approach, we emphasize the importance of complementing innovative proteomic technology with existing molecular biology models in preclinical studies, and the need to advance pharmacoproteomics to directly probe clinical physiology and gauge therapeutic efficacy at the bedside.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To determine minimum clinically meaningful improvements in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and dyspnea visual analog score (VAS) in patients with acute asthma exacerbation. Methods: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma exacerbation were eligible. The PEFR and VAS were assessed at presentation and after initial asthma therapy. During reassessment, subjects were asked to describe their asthma symptoms as ?much better,??a little better,??no change,??a little worse,? or ?much worse.? Correspondence between self-reported improvement and changes in PEFR and VAS was assessed. The ?minimum clinically significant change? in either index was defined as the difference between pre- and post-treatment measures in subjects reporting their symptoms ?a little better.? Results: One hundred fifty-six subjects were included. Asthma symptoms were ?much better? in 99 (64%), ?a little better? in 41 (26%), and ?unimproved? (composed of patients describing symptoms as ?no change,??a little worse,? or ?much worse?) in 16 (10%). The mean VAS change among the ?a little better? subjects was 2.2 cm (95% CI = 1.1 to 3.4), significantly greater than the -0.4 cm (95% CI = -2.1 to 1.4) change in the ?unimproved? subjects. The mean change in percent predicted PEFR among the ?a little better? subjects was 11.9 (95% CI = 7.3 to 16.1), not statistically different from the change of 6.1 (95% CI = 1.1 to 11.3) in the ?no change? subjects. The ?much better? group showed significantly greater changes in both measures than either of the other groups. A VAS change of ≥0.5 cm reliably discriminated between subjects with and without symptom improvement. Conclusions: Improvements in VAS of 2.2 cm and in predicted PEFR of about 12 percentage points are minimal clinically significant improvements during ED asthma therapy. The dyspnea VAS is valid in assessing symptomatic changes and may detect small subjective improvements better than the PEFR.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, chromosomal alterations have been extensively investigated for their pathophysiological relevance in haematological malignancies. In particular, epigenetic modifications of intra-nuclear histones are now known as key regulators of healthy cell cycles that have also evolved into novel therapeutic targets for certain blood cancers. Thus, for most haematologists, histones are DNA-chained proteins that are buried deep within chromatin. However, the plot has deepened with recent revelations on the function of histones when unchained and released extracellularly upon cell death or from activated neutrophils as part of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Extracellular histones and NETs are increasingly recognized for profound cytotoxicity and pro-coagulant effects. This article highlights the importance of recognizing this new paradigm of extracellular histones as a key player in host defence through its damage-associated molecular patterns, which could translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in various haematological and critical disorders.
