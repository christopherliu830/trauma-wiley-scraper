AB  - ABSTRACT Cystoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of urological problems in man. Until recently its use in dogs was limited to rigid endoscopy in the bitch. With modern flexible fibre-optic instruments the majority of male dogs can also be examined without the need for surgical intervention. This paper describes the techniques used and the cystoscopic findings in a series of 38 clinical cases. In 24 of these, abnormal findings were present permitting a diagnosis to be made or confirmed. The potential for this technique as a diagnostic procedure is discussed.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal brain malignancy which involves multi-gene abnormality. Unfortunately, effective therapy against GBM remains lacking. Previously, we found that NRP-1 and its downstream NRP-1/GIPC1 pathway played an important role in GBM. In our study, we further investigated the upstream signaling of NRP-1 to understand how it is regulated. First, we identified that hsa-miR-124-3p was miRNA differentially expressed in GBM and in normal brain tissues by high-throughput sequencing. Then, by dual luciferase reporter gene, we found miR-124-3p can specially bind to the 3?UTR region of the NRP-1 thus suppresses its expression. Moreover, miR-124-3p overexpression significantly inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration and tumor angiogenesis which resulted in GBM apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, putatively via NRP-1 mediated PI3K/Akt/NF?B pathways activation in GBM cells. Meanwhile, miR-124-3p overexpression also suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor angiogenesis when targeted by NRP-1 in a PDX model. Furthermore, NRP-1 mAb exerted synergistic inhibitory effects with miR-124-3p overexpression in GBM. Thus, we discovered that miR-124-3p acts as the upstream suppressor of NRP-1 which promotes GBM cell development and growth by PI3K/Akt/NF?B pathway. The miR-124-3p/NRP-1/GIPC1 pathway as a new pathway has a vital role in GBM, and it could be considered as the potential target for malignant gliomas in future.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The aim of the study was to explore occupational therapy practices regarding decision-making capacity assessment and to examine factors that impact on engagement in this area. Methods Occupational therapists in Ireland were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online questionnaire. Results One hundred and seventy-two occupational therapists responded. 65.77% (n = 98) reported that occupational therapy plays an important role in capacity assessment in their workplace. Occupational therapists most frequently contributed to decision-making capacity assessment for independent living (79.19%, n = 118), driving (45.89%, n = 67) and financial management (44.44%, n = 64). Many participants reported that this is more difficult than other aspects of practice and that they are not satisfied with decision-making capacity assessment procedures in their workplace. A large majority (91.86%, n = 113) reported occupational therapists would benefit from additional training and practice guidelines in the area of decision-making capacity assessment. Conclusion The study confirms that occupational therapists have a role to play in the multi-disciplinary assessment of decision-making capacity. The results of the survey suggest that decision-making capacity assessment is complex and challenging. Factors such as confidence, education and training impact on engagement with this area of practice. There is a need to develop education resources and guidelines for occupational therapists.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The critical care experience is particularly stressful for patients, which can result in a number of physiological and psychological consequences, including haemodynamic instability, increased pain, agitation and delirium, leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation, length of stay and subsequent complications. Massage therapy encompasses different techniques to promote relaxation and to counter stress, therefore potentially affecting several patients' outcomes. Aims To systematically review evidence on the effects of massage on outcomes of adult critically ill patients. The outcome measures included pain, vital signs (VS), haemodynamic measurements, level of consciousness, sleep quality, muscle tension, anxiety, feelings of calm and relaxation, coping, arterial blood gases and serum biomarkers. Method This was a systematic review based on focused literature searches (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, EMBASE-Ovid databases, Google Scholar). The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Eligibility criteria included published experimental and quasi-experimental studies reporting on the physiological and psychological outcomes of critically ill patients. Results Based on the selection criteria, 12 studies were included in the review. The main findings are as follows: 8 of 12 studies used randomized control designs with high internal validity, and there was a high level of evidence of favourable effects with respect to improvements in VS and a reduction in pain and anxiety. Outcomes that need to be more rigorously pursued include quality of sleep, analgesic and sedative dosages and level of consciousness. Conclusion The results suggest that massage interventions can have positive effects on critically ill patients' outcomes. However, there are several gaps in the literature, along with methodological limitations, that require further consideration in critical care settings. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this systematic review can inform implementation of massage interventions in critical care, which can be challenging as a result of several barriers.

AB  - Summary This chapter examines how theoretical tools and qualitative research can be fruitfully engaged in the interdisciplinary field of science studies. A long standing multi-disciplinary investigation into science practices is viewed from the perspectives of two theoretical psychologists. The ethnographic research led to some uniquely psychological contributions. One author (Osbeck) brought in the notion of ?persons? as an overarching category that informs knowledge generation within science labs. The other author (Malone) brought in psychoanalytic readings to expand more sociological examinations of race, gender, and science. The content of the contributors and the agility of collaborators to engage in research across paradigms relates to an awareness of the place of theory and reflexivity about the position of researcher, both of which contributed to the overall success of the science research project.

AB  - Introduction:? The mammalian digital end organ has developed in three basic functional forms, i.e., claw, hoof and nail. Whereas detailed information on the ontogeny and phylogeny of the equine and bovine hooves, and the human nail, respectively, are on hand, such data are still not available for the canine claw. Because phylogenetically the carnivore claw is considered as a primary form of digital end organ, data on the organogenesis of the canine claw will complement current knowledge on onto- and phylogeny of the carnivore claw, and digital end organs in general. Materials and Methods:? Light and electron microscopy of 18 canine fetuses of 40?150?mm crown-rump-length and five puppies aged 1?day?4?weeks post-partum. Results:? The development of the canine claw can be divided into four periods. The first stage is initiated by the differentiation of the connective tissue layers of the claw anlage. The second stage is characterized by formation of the specific claw shape, and the third stage by further regional function-related modifications resulting in the development of the five different segments of the digital end organ. The fourth stage proceeds post-natally when the influence of increasing body weight and weight bearing leads to the final functional adaptation of the papillary body. Conclusion:? The organogenesis of the canine claw resembles that of the feline claw in many aspects, but also shows some specific deviations. In particular, the development of the dorsal ridge ? characteristic for the carnivore claw ? differs between both species. The results of our study therefore raise the question whether the current hypothesis on allocation of the different segments of the canine claw has to be reconsidered.

AB  - Abstract 1. There is now an irresistible momentum for a truly integrated and strategic approach to river basin management. As a consequence, the framework within which individual organizations can carry out their roles and responsibilities in a co-ordinated and sustainable way can be determined. 2. Extreme events such as floods and droughts have severe social and economic consequences. ?Traditional? engineered responses, which take little account of fluvial processes and ecosystem functioning, often exacerbate these problems and can have severe adverse consequences on the environment. 3. Bringing together a range of scientific, technical and engineering disciplines to address catchment management has many advantages. Identifying and implementing innovative solutions that benefit local communities and the environment is the only sustainable way forward for river management. 4. Public understanding of risk assessment and management is vital to the success of an integrated approach. So too is a strategic dimension to inform the town and country planning system and major investment decisions by major utilities and public bodies responsible for water supply, pollution control and flood management. 5. There are major challenges ahead for public utilities, agencies and professional bodies in terms of attracting, retaining and blending together skilled scientific, engineering and technical specialists. These skills need to be complemented by the ability to convey sophisticated information in readily understood language. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND There is an unmet need for behavioral health support and services among children and adolescents, which school behavioral health has the potential to address. Existing reviews and meta-analyses document the behavioral health benefits of school behavioral health programs and frameworks, but few summaries of the academic benefits of such programs exist. We provide exemplars of the academic benefits of school behavioral health programs and frameworks. METHODS A literature review identified school behavioral health-related articles and reports. Articles for inclusion were restricted to those that were school-based programs and frameworks in the United States that included an empirical evaluation of intervention academic-related outcomes. RESULTS Findings from 36 primary research, review, and meta-analysis articles from the past 17 years show the benefits of school behavioral health clinical interventions and targeted interventions on a range of academic outcomes for adolescents. CONCLUSION Our findings are consistent with reports documenting health benefits of school behavioral health frameworks and programs and can facilitate further efforts to support school behavioral health for a range of stakeholders interested in the benefits of school behavioral health programs and frameworks on academic outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background Like other types of care for disabled or elderly adults, consumer-directed personal assistance services may present multi-factorial risks for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). Methods Using survey data, we compared providers experiencing WRMSDs in the previous year to those who did not, seeking to identify functional, temporal, physical, and relationship risk factors for transient and chronic conditions. Results Longer work experience with the recipient and more frequent bending increased the risk of being in the most chronic group (≥12 painful episodes), whereas predictable work hours with rest breaks and greater social support from the recipient appeared protective. For transient conditions (one to two episodes), longer work experience with the recipient and predictable hours with rest breaks appeared protective. Conclusions We offer recommendations to improve hazard assessment as well as training and information distribution related to home care programs. With the population aging, home care jobs require increasing oversight to prevent WRMSDs. Am. J. Ind. Med. 56:454?468, 2013. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Stress is one of the most powerful experiences to influence health and disease. Through epigenetic mechanisms, stress may generate a footprint that propagates to subsequent generations. Programming by prenatal stress or adverse experience in parents, grandparents, or earlier generations may thus be a critical determinant of lifetime health trajectories. Changes in regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) by stress may enhance the vulnerability to certain pathogenic factors. This review explores the hypothesis that miRNAs represent stress-responsive elements in epigenetic regulation that are potentially heritable. Recent findings suggest that miRNAs are key players linking adverse early environments or ancestral stress with disease risk, thus they represent useful predictive disease biomarkers. Since miRNA signatures of disease are potentially heritable, big data management platforms will be vital to harness multi-generational information and capture succinct yet potent biomarkers capable of directing preventative treatments. This feature would offer a unique window of opportunity to advance personalized medicine.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training can enhance antioxidant status, but it is unknown whether selenium supplementation can further improve antioxidant defenses. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At wk 14, all horses underwent a 2-hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Blood samples and biopsies of the gluteus medius were obtained before and after training and in response to the SET. Serum Se, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in whole blood and muscle, and plasma lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) were evaluated. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures. Results Serum Se was higher (P?=?0.02) at wk 14 in trained horses receiving 0.3 than 0.1?mg?Se/kg, but was unaffected by diet in untrained horses. Muscle GPx activity was unchanged after 14-weeks of Se and training, but in response to the SET, muscle GPx was higher (P?=?0.05) in trained than untrained horses. An effect of training*time (P?=?0.008) was noted for whole blood GPx, reflecting greater (P?=?0.01) activity in trained than untrained horses immediately after the SET. Plasma LPO was not influenced by dietary Se, but increased (P<0.0001) in untrained horses immediately after the SET while remaining unchanged in trained horses. Conclusions Training appears to mitigate oxidative damage in response to prolonged exercise in young horses. Although trained horses responded to a higher level of dietary Se, it showed no clear advantage for reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction Equine training often includes running on tracks with different uphill (UP) or downhill (DOWN) slopes and examination of lame horses on a slope can be used to investigate the origin of lameness. However little is known about the kinetics of horses in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare ground reaction force, acceleration and sliding of the hoof in the forelimb of horses trotting an uphill and downhill slope. Methods The right front hoof of 5 horses was equipped with a dynamometric horseshoe and an accelerometer allowing the measurement of 3D ground reaction force and hoof acceleration and displacement. The horses were trotted in hand (3.5?m/s) on a 7% inclined asphalt area successively uphill and downhill. Data were analysed using an ANOVA, accounting for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (P<0.01). Results Speed was not significantly different between UP and DOWN. The maximal longitudinal breaking force of the hoof, maximal vertical force, vertical impulse and longitudinal sliding of the hoof at impact were significantly increased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively +97.7%, +8.4%, +16.6% and +450%). Stride frequency and longitudinal propulsive force were significantly decreased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively ?5.1% and ?48.7%). Conclusions The results of this study (increased longitudinal breaking force and maximal vertical force on a downward slope) are consistent with previous measurements of superficial digital flexor tendon loading on the same area [1]. Conversely increased propulsive force on an uphill slope needs to be taken into account during rehabilitation of horses with deep digital flexor tendon injuries. Ethical Animal Research The local Animal Care and Ethics Committee advised that no formal approval was required for this study.

AB  - Introduction Poor hoof angle and hoof pastern alignment has been linked to lameness in mature horses. External characteristics, such as the hoof pastern axis and hoof angle, are commonly used to assess dorsopalmar conformation in the same manner in foals. The hoof wall integument and distal phalanx is parallel in healthy mature horses but not in foals: this is not understood. Methods The front feet of 22 Thoroughbred foals were radiographed and measured in June and again in November. Lateromedial radiographic images were measured (Osirix) for hoof integument angle and width, and proximal, middle and distal phalanx angles. The data were tabulated in Excel and analysed in Minitab. After assessment for normality (Anderson-Darling), potential relationships were assessed for differences between June and November using paired t-tests and regression analysis. Results The dorsal hoof angle became more acute with age, R2?=?0.3326, the mean of June, 59.05?±?3.662°, was significantly different from November, 53.64?±?2.7824°, P<0.0001. The hoof pastern axes were broken forward in June, 6.1?±?2.1°, in November 2.5?±?1.6°, whereas the phalangeal axes were broken back, June,-11.0?±?7.5°, November, ?8.3?±?4.4°. There was a significant relationship between age and hoof pastern axis alignment, R2?=?0.3746; P<0.0001. The phalangeal axis did not correlate with age. The relationship between age and parallelism of the integument was significant R2?=?0.4867; P<0.0001. Conclusions The cause of the non-alignment of the hoof pastern axis and phalangeal axis in Thoroughbred foals is widening of hoof integument proximodistally and circumferential bone thickening of the distal phalanx. Assumptions of phalangeal angles based on external characteristics cannot be made in foals.

AB  - Introduction Myofascial lines are chains of interconnected anatomical structures that functionally direct the basic motion patterns of the musculoskeletal system. They have previously been dissected in humans, where they describe the overall spinal motion of flexion, extension, lateral flexion and axial rotation. They are believed to play a role in functionality, connection, and balance of the body. The aim of this study was to investigate whether similar myofascial lines could be identified in the horse. Methods Five myofascial kinetic lines were dissected in 22 horses euthanized for unrelated reasons. The lines were the Superficial Dorsal Line (SDL), Superficial Ventral Line (SVL), Lateral Line (LL), Spiral Line (SL), and Functional Line (FL). Results SDL included hind limb flexors and the errector spinae group, which extend the hip and spine. SVL included hind limb extensors, abdominal muscles, and ventral neck muscles, which are structures with antagonistic functions to SDL. LL followed myofascial tissues along the side of the abdomen and produced latero-flexion of the spine. FL and SL formed helical lines concerned with spinal axial rotation. FL connected the front limb to the contralateral hind limb by crossing over the midline at the thoraco-lumbar level dorsal and ventral on the trunk. SL connected one side of the neck with the contralateral front limb and ipsilateral hind limb by a helical course around the body crossing over at the cervico-thoracic and lumbo-sacral junctions. Conclusions The SBL, SVL and LL complete a functional anatomical ring, which balances the dorsal, ventral and lateral motion patterns of the horse. The helical FL and SL determine the spinal axial rotation. With minor exceptions all lines mirrored the human lines. Ethical Animal Research The study was performed on material collected during post-mortem examination. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Introduction Racing Quarter Horses (QH) typically compete at shorter distances and faster speeds than Thoroughbreds (Tbred). The two components of speed are stride rate and stride length. The hypothesis of this study is that racing QH have greater stride rates than Tbreds, and that stride rate decreases as distance increases, even within breed. Methods Five runnings of sprint and classic distance stakes races for both QH (Texas Twister Stakes, 100.6?m; Champion of Champions, 402.3?m) and Tbred (Breeders? Cup Sprint, 1,207.0?m; Breeders? Cup Classic, 2,011.7?m) contested from 2008 to 2012 were obtained and viewed by five individuals. Individuals watched each race three times (in slow motion when needed) and the average number of strides per second taken by the winning horse was calculated. Using the PROC Mixed Procedure of SAS, the averages from the five individuals were used to compare differences between breeds, and between distances within a breed. The stride rates were also used to determine average stride length by factoring in length of each race. Results The average stride rate was greater for QH than for Tbred (2.88 vs 2.34 strides/sec; P<0.0001). Additionally, stride rate decreased (P<0.0001) as distance increased (2.96, 2.81, 2.45, 2.23 strides/sec, respectively). Stride length was longest in the Tbred races and shortest in the 100.6?m QH race (P<0.0001). Conclusions The Tbred stride rates reported here, and associated respiratory rates, have been previously reported and are remarkable. However, QH rates are nearly 25% greater. The associated rapid acceleration and deacceleration of the lower limb and quick breathing rate may have implications for skeletal and respiratory soundness. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in this study and all information was obtained from previously conducted races for which video was publicly available.
