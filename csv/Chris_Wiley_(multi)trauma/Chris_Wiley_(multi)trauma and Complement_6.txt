AB  - SUMMARY Recently it has been demonstrated that the CD14 molecule which is expressed on monocytes and macrophages serves as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bound to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and thus mediates LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production. Here we report that CD14 is found as a soluble (s) molecule in serum. In healthy volunteers sCD14 levels (mean ± s.e.m.) were 3.7±0.05 ?g/ml (n= 30, 25?50 years of age) as determined by ELISA (detection limit 20 ?g/ml serum) using two monoclonal antibodies in a sandwich technique. In polytraumatized patients (n= 16) significantly decreased levels (1.7 ± 0.3) were detected immediately after the trauma, which increased to 4.9±0.3 ?g/ml within the first 6 days post trauma. sCD14 remained elevated during the first 14 days post trauma in patients with the most severe injuries (injury severity score > 45 points), whereas a return to normal levels was observed in patients with an injury score of < 45 points. In addition, the levels of the high-density lipoproteins that partially inactivate free endotoxin are significantly decreased post trauma. No correlation between parameters of inflammation (C3a and neopterin levels, leucocyte counts, amount of band cells), liver function and sCD14 levels was established. Comparable to polytraumatized patients, increased sCD14 serum levels were observed in five patients with burn trauma (burned area > 35%) within the second week post trauma when clinical signs of septicaemia were evident.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Abstract:? A vast literature extolling the benefits of melatonin has accumulated during the past four decades. Melatonin was previously considered of importance to seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythmicity. Currently, it appears to be a versatile anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative agent, a molecule with immunomodulatory actions and profound oncostatic activity, and also to play a role as a potent neuroprotectant. Nowadays, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement with differential availability as an over-the-counter aid in different countries. There is a widespread agreement that melatonin is nontoxic and safe considering its frequent, long-term usage by humans at both physiological and pharmacological doses with no reported side effects. Endeavors toward a designated drug status for melatonin may be enormously rewarding in clinics for treatment of several forms of neurotrauma where effective pharmacological intervention has not yet been attained. This mini review consolidates the data regarding the efficacy of melatonin as an unique neuroprotective agent in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Well-documented actions of melatonin in combating traumatic CNS damage are compiled from various clinical and experimental studies. Research on traumatic brain injury and ischemia/reperfusion are briefly outlined here as they have been recently reviewed elsewhere, whereas the studies on different animal models of the experimental spinal cord injury have been extensively covered in this mini review for the first time.

AB  - With an increasing instance of traumatic brain injury and little advancement over recent decades in the rehabilitation of brain injury survivors and their family members, focus has shifted toward the establishment of effective whole-family resilience promotion interventions. Using the Brain Injury Family Intervention as a model, clinicians constructed two curriculum-based interventions grounded in resilience theory and drawing from the interdisciplinary approaches of neuropsychology and marriage and family therapy: (a) the Resilience and Adjustment Intervention, for individual survivors of traumatic brain jury, and (b) the Therapeutic Couples Intervention, designed to increase relational satisfaction in couples following a traumatic brain injury. The present study outlines the need for the integration of resilience tenets into rehabilitation techniques, summarizes the empirical justification for the use of an interdisciplinary approach, and offers an overview with implementation specifics regarding these two newly designed interventions.

AB  - Abstract Data from Cardiac Transplant Research Database (CTRD) were analyzed from 1999 to 2006 to examine the effects of different induction strategies at the time of cardiac transplantation. A total of 2090 primary heart transplants were categorized by induction with interleukin-2 receptor blocker (IL-2RB), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or no induction (NI). Probabilities for rejection and infection were estimated with parametric time-related models. Using these models, hazard was calculated for two theoretical patient profiles, one at lower risk for rejection and higher risk of infection (Profile 1) and higher risk for rejection and lower risk of infection (Profile 2). Of the 2090 transplants, 49.8% (1095) did not receive induction, 27.3% (599) received IL-2RB, and 18.0% (396) received ATG. Profile 1 patients had lower hazard for rejection with IL-2RB compared to ATG and NI (p < 0.01), but at the cost of increased risk of infection (5.0 vs. 1.8 vs. 1.6, respectively, at four wk, p < 0.01). Profile 2 patients experienced a fivefold decreased hazard for rejection when treated with IL-2RB compared with ATG and NI (p < 0.01). In patients at high risk of infection, IL-2RB reduced risk of rejection but at the expense of increased hazard for infection.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews psychological trauma from a multilevel developmental psychopathology. This perspective holds that no single approach or discipline adequately encompasses the phenomenon of psychological trauma and how it interacts with development in terms of its impact on the individual. Rather, multiple levels are preferable, including the areas of neurobiology, psychology, psychopathology, and psychiatric diagnosis, individual, familial, societal, cultural, economic, and physical. To address all of these levels, an interdisciplinary team approach is required, with individuals who have expertise in as wide a range of fields as psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, cardiology, internal medicine, statistics, radiology, physics, computer science, psychopharmacology, child development, philosophy and literature. The implication is that no single individual or specialty will have sufficient expertise and knowledge in enough areas to provide an appropriate characterization of the effects of trauma on the individual. Additionally, all of these areas will interact with developmental epoch in different ways. Use of the multilevel developmental psychopathology approach has the promise of being more helpful to individuals affected by psychological trauma.

AB  - The world has seen a major increase in forced displacement since 2011. As a growing number of states implement restrictive refugee policies, public communication has become essential for refugee organisations. This study analysed, therefore, three international refugee organisations? discursive strategies towards the recent Syrian crisis, as well as their production and the social context. A critical discourse analysis of international press releases (N=122) and six semi-structured interviews with press and regional officers revealed that the observed actors largely dehumanise displaced people and subordinate them to the ?Western self? and state interests; displaced people hardly ever acquire their own voice. The study found that the medium characteristics of press releases and the importance of media attention result in a depersonalising humanitarian discourse. In addition, there were indications of a post-humanitarian discourse that reproduced the humanitarian sector's ?marketisation?. Finally, the examined organisations use the political realist cross-issue persuasion strategy, displaying displaced people as resettlement objects.

This paper reports on a multifaceted response to build capacity and willingness of health professionals to identify signs of family violence and engage with referral pathways to on-site legal assistance. Methods: A Realistic Evaluation analysed health professionals? knowledge and attitudes towards identification, response and referral for family violence before and after training; and use of referral pathways. Results: Of 123 health professionals participating in training, 67 completed baseline and follow-up surveys. Training improved health professionals? self-reported knowledge of, and confidence in, responding to family violence and understanding of lawyers? roles in hospitals. Belief that patients should be referred to on-site legal services increased. Training did not correspond to actual increased referrals to legal assistance. Conclusion: The program built capacity and willingness of health professionals to identify signs of, and respond to, family violence. Increase in referral rates to legal assistance was not shown. Potential improvements include better data capture and greater availability of legal services. Implications for public health: Strong hospital system supports and reliable recording of family violence referrals need to be in place before introducing such partnerships to other hospitals.

All participants in this initial CENC cohort had a history of deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), and/or their follow-on conflicts (Operation Freedom's Sentinel). All participants undergo extensive medical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments and either meet criteria for any lifetime mTBI or not. These assessments are integrated into six CENC core studies?Biorepository, Biostatistics, Data and Study Management, Neuroimaging, and Neuropathology. Methods The current study outlines the quantitative neuroimaging methods managed by the Neuroimaging Core using FreeSurfer automated software for image quantification. Results At this writing, 319 participants from the CENC observational study have completed all baseline assessments including the imaging protocol and tertiary data quality assurance procedures. Conclusions/Discussion The preliminary findings of this initial cohort are reported to describe how the Neuroimaging Core manages neuroimaging quantification for CENC studies.

AB  - Abstract As scholars of crime increasingly use narratives elicited from people found guilty of committing crime, it is critical that we reflect methodologically and theoretically on exactly how researchers collect those narratives, and what scholars do with people's stories and conceptualisations of their past, present, and future. To contribute to these reflections, we examine the utility of the Life History Calendar (LHC) and the Life as a Film (LAAF) procedure for collecting retrospective life histories from incarcerated chronic offenders. We note the respective advantages of each method, particularly for capturing the dynamic social contexts and reflected appraisals during critical periods of the life course of offenders. Most importantly, we argue that using the LHC and the LAAF together not only supplements the deficiencies of each method, but they also work together synergistically to improve the breadth and depth of data collection and our ability to understand the interplay between narratives, context, and experience.

AB  - Abstract Background We have explored the potential prefrontal hemodynamic biomarkers to characterize subjects with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) by employing the multivariate machine learning approach and introducing a novel task-related hemodynamic response detection followed by a heuristic search for optimum set of hemodynamic features. To achieve this goal, the hemodynamic response from a group of 31 healthy controls and 30 chronic TBI subjects were recorded as they performed a complexity task. Methods To determine the optimum hemodynamic features, we considered 11 features and their combinations in characterizing TBI subjects. We investigated the significance of the features by utilizing a machine learning classification algorithm to score all the possible combinations of features according to their predictive power. Results and Conclusions The identified optimum feature elements resulted in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 85%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. Classification improvement was achieved for TBI subject classification through feature combination. It signified the major advantage of the multivariate analysis over the commonly used univariate analysis suggesting that the features that are individually irrelevant in characterizing the data may become relevant when used in combination. We also conducted a spatio-temporal classification to identify regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that contribute in distinguishing between TBI and healthy subjects. As expected, Brodmann areas (BA) 10 within the PFC were isolated as the region that healthy subjects (unlike subjects with TBI), showed major hemodynamic activity in response to the High Complexity task. Overall, our results indicate that identified temporal and spatio-temporal features from PFC's hemodynamic activity are promising biomarkers in classifying subjects with TBI.

AB  - Background and Objectives There is currently intense multidisciplinary interest and a maturing body of literature regarding laser treatments for traumatic scars, but international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes have not yet caught up with current knowledge and practice in many centers. The authors intend to highlight the tremendous potential of laser techniques, offer recommendations for safe and efficacious treatment, and promote wider patient access guided by future high-quality research. Study Design/Materials and Methods An international panel of 26 dermatologists and plastic and reconstructive surgeons from 13 different countries and a variety of practice backgrounds was self-assembled to develop updated consensus recommendations for the laser treatment of traumatic scars. A three-step modified Delphi method took place between March 2018 and March 2019 consisting of two rounds of emailed questionnaires and supplementary face-to-face meetings. The panel members approved the final manuscript via email correspondence, and the threshold for consensus was at least 80% concurrence among the panel members. Results The manuscript includes extensive detailed discussion regarding a variety of laser platforms commonly used for traumatic scar management such as vascular lasers and ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers, special considerations such as coding and laser treatments in skin of color, and 25 summary consensus recommendations. Conclusions Lasers are a first-line therapy in the management of traumatic scars and contractures, and patients without access to these treatments may not be receiving the best available care after injury. Updated international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes, additional high-quality research, and patient access should reflect this status. Lasers Surg. Med. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our main aim was to assess the penetration of correct diagnostic and clinicopharmacological information into routine practice. A detailed analysis and discussion are given of data concerning reasons for hospital admission (therapeutic adjustment accounting for 27.3%; diagnostic ascertainment, 53.8%); characteristics of the disease, in terms of duration, clinical manifestations, and pattern of seizures; associated disorders; prevalence and criteria for the use of instrumental diagnostic procedures (EEG, brain scan, computed tomography, etc.); pattern of prescriptions of anticonvulsant drugs at admission and at discharge, with particular emphasis on specific drug choices by specialty; prevalence of single-drug therapy (41% at admission and 47.0% at discharge) versus polytherapy; degree of correspondence between recommended and observed dosage regimens (undertreatment being a more common problem than excessive dosing); and reporting of side effects. Although some of the findings of some recent studies are confirmed, this report documents the feasibility of a regular audit program of the performance of an entire health care system in the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Translations of summary In this paper, I propose a psychoanalytic reading of some of the writings of Amelia Rosselli, a trilingual poet who, at the age of seven, lost her father Carlo, who was persecuted and murdered by Mussolini's regime. History and her history conflate into personal and collective trauma which defies human possibilities to work through and mourn. Rosselli's work testifies to such predicament of the human subject of the 20th century, his/her dislocation, alienation and internal irreconcilable divisions. In particular I examine Diary in three tongues, which is the most autobiographical of her works and a self-analytic piece, written after the conclusion of her second analysis. In the Diary, Rosselli employs textual strategies which convey the fragmentation and destructuring of language, where her traumatic experience resides as a wound inflicted to the symbolic order. I propose that her writings contain her unconscious memories in an estranged and melancholic language which becomes the crucible to express her impossible mourning, in a complex mixture of Eros and Thanatos which allowed her to survive psychically and to create a very personal experimental poetic discourse which made her a literary figure of international acclaim. My primary engagement will be with Freud's theory of mourning and melancholia and its successive elaboration by Kristeva, who maintains that the melancholic discourse finds its expression in the pre-verbal and infra-verbal aspects of language, which she calls ?semiotics?, in dialectic articulation with its symbolic components. Drawing on literary texts, significant inferences can be made on the psychoanalytic listening to the prosodic aspects of language as the carrier of inchoate forms of representation of that which exceeds language: trauma, raw affects, mnemic traces, that is, the unrepresented and/or unrepresentable.

AB  - ABSTRACT Knee injuries cause structural damage and acute inflammation that initiates the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a member of a family of enzymes that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in normal development of the musculoskeletal system, but may increase ROS production to harmful levels after joint injury. The role of ROS in both normal joint homeostasis and injury is poorly understood, but inhibition of excessive ROS production by Nox4 after joint injury could be protective to the joint, decreasing oxidative stress, and initiation of PTOA. Knee injuries were simulated using inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary human chondrocytes and a non-invasive mouse model of PTOA in C57BL/6N and Nox4 knockout mice. There is an acute decrease in Nox4 activity within 24?h after injury in both systems, followed by a subsequent sustained low-level increase, a novel finding not seen in any other system. Inhibition of Nox4 activity by GKT137831 was protective against early structural changes after non-invasive knee injury in a mouse model. Nox4 knockout mice had significant differences in structural and mechanical properties of bone, providing further evidence for the role of Nox4 in development of joint tissues and biochemical response after joint injury. Nox4 plays a significant role in the acute phase after joint injury, and targeted inhibition of inflammation caused by Nox4 may be protective against early joint changes in the pathogenesis of PTOA. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract There is growing recognition that traumatic brain injury is a highly variable and complex systemic disorder that is refractory to therapies that target individual mechanisms. It is even more complex in elderly persons, in whom frailty, previous comorbidities, altered metabolism, and a long history of medication use are likely to complicate the secondary effects of brain trauma. Progesterone, one of the few neuroprotective agents that has shown promise for the treatment of acute brain injury, is now in national and international phase 3 multicenter trials. New findings show that vitamin D hormone (VDH) and VDH deficiency in the aging process (and across the developmental spectrum) may interact with progesterone and treatment for traumatic brain injury. In this article we review the use of progesterone and VDH as biologics-based therapies along with recent studies demonstrating that the combination of progesterone and VDH may promote better functional outcomes than either treatment independently.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multi-faceted, often chronic syndrome that may develop following an exposure to a highly-traumatic event. Given the complexity, heterogeneity, and incomplete theoretical description of this disorder, computational models of PTSD are an important tool to help understand the mechanisms, and course, of symptom presentation and maintenance in PTSD. This chapter reviews several computational modeling approaches and their implications for PTSD, including models focused on fear learning and expression, changes in arousal and reactivity, avoidance, changes in cognition and mood and intrusive recollection. It also discusses the limitations of each approach, and suggests possible directions for future research that could both advance our understanding of PTSD and help move toward a comprehensive computational account of this disorder.

AB  - We assess fiscal performances in G7 and selected Latin American and Asian countries. We consider two questions: (i) Have public finances been sustainable? (ii) Do countries follow more restrictive fiscal policies when debt starts to rise? We find that: (i) the traditional unit root tests often overlook the corrective actions taken by many governments; controlling for structural breaks changes the non-stationarity results dramatically among the three groups; (ii) estimation of a reaction function for governments, expanded by incorporating structural breaks, provides further evidence for significant active anti-debt policies among G7 countries, and to a lesser extent in the other regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND Blood platelets (PLTs) are a valuable commodity. Management of their inventory has implications both for patient care and for the cost of health care delivery. There are a variety of different methods of managing PLT inventory currently in practice and multiple theoretical models aimed at improving PLT inventory metrics. In this study we evaluate the ability of a novel electronic dashboard system that monitors and displays both PLT inventory and patient data to improve transfusion metrics at a quaternary health care center. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The Capital District Health Authority is a quaternary health care center that transfuses approximately 2500 PLT units annually. To improve PLT discard rates a novel, low-overhead system that interfaces with the laboratory information system and displays real-time data between transfusion sites on PLT inventory and orders was implemented in November 2011. This study examines the transfusion quality metrics data from the 24 months before and after implementation. RESULTS A significant reduction in mean monthly PLT outdate rate was observed after the implementation of the PLT dashboard suite from 24.5% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%) to 15.1% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%; p?<?0.001). PLT age at time of transfusion was also reduced from 3.60 days (n?=?4796, SD?±?0.97 days) to 3.46 days (n?=?4881, SD?±?1.00 days; p?<?0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study describes the implementation of a novel PLT dashboard suite. This suite significantly reduced PLT outdate rates at our institution over the 48-month study period.
