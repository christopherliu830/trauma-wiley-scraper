AB  - Introduction Lungeing is an important part of lameness examination since the circular path is thought to accentuate low-grade lameness. Circle dependent, compensatory movement, and pain related asymmetries make lameness evaluation complex. Subjective evaluation, by watching the horse in motion, is standard practice but studies have shown that inter-observer variation is high when assessing lameness (straight line movement). The aim was to estimate inter- and intra-rater agreement between equine practitioners evaluating lameness from videos of sound and lame horses during lungeing. Methods Equine practitioners (n?=?86), including 43 deemed as experienced, participated in a web-based survey. Horses (n?=?23, including two horses with solar-pressure induced lameness) [defined as forelimb-, hind limb-lame or sound from objective kinematic straight line measurements] trotted on a circle in both directions on soft/hard ground surfaces (one condition/video). Of 104 recordings, 60 were selected of which 10 were repeated (numbers chosen to make compliance possible). The practitioners were asked to report which limb was most lame on each video. Kappa statistics were used to analyze the inter-rater and intra-rater agreement. The ? agreement was set to poor <0.3, acceptable 0.31?0.5, good 0.51?0.8, excellent >0.8. Results Inter-rater agreement kappa (n?=?86) was 0.31 (0.38/0.25 for experienced/less experienced). Evaluating forelimb compared to hind limb lameness agreement increased 11%. Intra-rater agreement kappa (percentiles) was (P10-50-90, 0.21, 0.57, 0.84). Conclusions Since identification of the lame limb/limbs is a prerequisite for successful diagnosis, treatment and recovery, the high inter-observer variation when evaluating lameness during lungeing may decrease the accuracy of lameness examinations.

AB  - Introduction When horses are trotted in-hand, this is predominantly performed with the handler on the horse's left side. In the context of objective gait analysis, this study investigated whether the side a horse is led from affects movement symmetry measures used to quantify lameness. We hypothesised that the side which horses were handled from would have no effect on head and pelvic movement symmetry. Methods Vertical movement of head and pelvis was quantified in 23 horses during trot in-hand with a validated inertial sensor gait analysis system. Established movement symmetry measures commonly used to quantify lameness were calculated for a minimum of 27 strides per condition. Each horse was assessed three times, twice handled from one side, once from the other side, with the initial handling side randomly assigned. Differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments led from the same side were compared to differences when led from the opposite side using a paired t-test (P<0.05) Results Which side a horse was led from had no significant effect on either head (all P>0.754) or pelvic (all P>0.514) movement symmetry. Mean differences for head (and pelvic) movement asymmetry were below 2% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for repeat assessments from the same side and below 4% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for opposite side leads. Conclusions The side from which a horse is led does not significantly affect differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments. Data analysis should be restricted to trials with consistent head carriage and a minimum of 27 strides (previously reported to give a representative estimate of stride-to-stride variability).

AB  - Introduction Rider movement may influence horse-rider interaction, yet little is known about what physical attributes affect postural stability. This study aimed to compare pelvic control and postural stability of riders on the floor and whilst riding. Methods 33 riders were assessed by a physiotherapist and subjectively graded according to ability to tilt the pelvis in isolation: 1?=?poor, 2?=?better plus compensations, which were either A?=?lumbar spine inclusion B?=?full body lean, 3?=?good. Riders wore markers on (1) greater trochanter of the femur, (2) iliac crest, (3) greater tubercle of the humerus. A marker was placed over the horse's tuber sacrale (4). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) recorded four strides of collected sitting trot in a straight line from the left side. Distance between markers was measured at midstance, maximum hindlimb protraction and retraction. Synchronisation was determined by the difference in time (secs) between the tuber sacrale of the horse and pelvis of the rider at these stride points. One-way ANOVA was used to compare synchronisation between groups. Student's independent t-test was used to compare marker distance. Results For pelvic tilt, no grade 3 riders were seen. Grade 2 riders were more synchronised with the horse during left hind diagonal suspension phase (P?=?0.011) and had smaller horizontal distances between markers 1?2, 2?3 and 1?3 respectively at all points of the stride (midstance: P<0.042; hindlimb protraction: P<0.049; hindlimb retraction: P<0.013). Comparing compensation types, grade A riders were better synchronised with the horse at midstance phase (P?=?0.014). Conclusions Results suggest that control of pelvic movement may have an impact on horse-rider synchronisation.

AB  - Introduction Lameness is the most common health problem of racehorses and may affect both welfare and performance. The aim of this study was to investigate if locomotion asymmetry in a group of young horses was related to delayed qualification for races. Methods Locomotion asymmetry was measured every 1?3 months with a wireless inertial sensor based lameness evaluation system in 16 horses fourteen times between September of the year they were 1-year olds and May of the year they were 3-year olds. As 3-year-olds they passed their qualification race and after this, two subgroups were created for the study based on whether they passed their qualification race before June 21st (early group, n?=?6) or after September 19th (late group, n?=?6). The groups were compared with respect to the differences in vertical head (forelimbs) and pelvis (hindlimbs) movement (as measured by the Lameness Locator, Equinosis) during each stride cycle at trot. The vector sums (VS) of maximum and minimum difference from each sensor were calculated and used for statistical analyses. ANOVA (Proc mixed model including individual {random}, date and group) was used to analyse differences between groups. Results The late group had higher VS for forelimbs (16.0?±?1.0) than the early group (12.6?±?1.0) (P?=?0.04) in total over the whole period. The VS for hind limbs did not differ between groups. Conclusions Front limb locomotion asymmetry in young horses in training is associated with delayed qualification for races. However, further studies are warranted to investigate causality.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies allow the assessment of variations in body position during jumping. This study evaluated changes in kinematic variables in horses during a jumping test. Methods Eight horses equipped with reflective skin markers were submitted to a jumping test consisting of 70 jumps in 4 series of 10, 15, 20 and 25 times each over a 1.10?m vertical obstacle. Six jumps per series were recorded; a heart rate of ≤ 90?bpm was the criterion to begin the next series. A 25?Hz calibrated camera was placed 10?m from the fence, and 2D images were analyzed. The variables were: overtracking at jumping; take-off and landing distances; jump length; distance between lowest point of the fore and hind limb and the fence; height of head, withers and croup in relation to the ground when passing the fence; and maximum withers height at jumping. Data were analysed with an ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test (P<0.05). Results There was a reduction in take-off distance (1.65?m to 1.46?m, P?=?0.03), landing distance (1.99?m to 1.71?m, P?=?0.001), jump length (4.51?m to 4.11?m, P?=?0.005), left forelimb distance height above the fence (9.4?cm to 5.1?cm, P?=?0.03) and maximum withers height at jumping (2.0?m to 1.95?m, P?=?0.001) from the first to the third series. Overtracking before jumping increased from 32?cm to 48?cm (P?=?0.003) and there was a reduction of right forelimb height above the fence from 7.3?cm to 2.9?cm (P?=?0.04), and of withers and croup height above the fence from 2.0?m to 1.95?m (P?=?0.001) and 1.93?m to 1.86?m (P<0.0001) respectively from the first to fourth session. Conclusions The increase in the number of jumps resulted in a decrease of take-off and landing distances, and in the distance between forelimb and fence and the withers and croup height, all indicating decreased jumping efficiency.

AB  - Introduction Lungeing is part of the standard lameness examination, however it systematically affects movement symmetry even in sound horses. We evaluated a method for objective lameness detection on the circle accounting for this asymmetry bias. Methods Twenty-six horses undergoing lameness examination were equipped with inertial sensors (Xsens) on head, sacrum and tubera coxae. Asymmetry in vertical displacement was quantified for trot on straight line and circle using multiple measures. Horses were classified lame when falling outside the directional reference range of sound horses (directional?=??normal? margins and lame limb depending on rein and sign of measure). Objective classification on the circle was compared to subjective evaluation, final diagnoses and objective classification on the straight calculating the proportion of matches. Regression analysis evaluated the association of change in asymmetry between straight line and circle and baseline asymmetry on the straight. Results The match between objective classification on the circle and the exact fore-/hindlimb(s) scored lame subjectively was 81% / 79%. The match with the diagnosed limb(s) was 71% / 85%. There was a high frequency of false positives compared to subjective evaluation. Objective evaluation on the circle added new information compared to assessment on the straight line in 70% (forelimb) / 58% (hindlimb) of instances (contralateral limb lame, bilateral lameness, lame on circle but sound on straight). Change in asymmetry was not associated with baseline lameness (P≥0.062). Conclusions Objective lameness evaluation on the circle makes a valuable contribution to patient assessment: e.g. subtle lameness falling within the margins of ?normal? on the straight or bilateral lameness could be identified. In future, the predictive value of the proposed technique should be determined. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

AB  - Introduction To facilitate interpretation of limb loading and hoof balance obtained by pressure plate analysis in lame horses, the effects of handler position and perineural anesthesia in sound horses need investigation. Methods Six sound Warmblood horses were walked and trotted over a pressure plate, with the handler at the left and subsequently the right side, and before and after a bilateral palmar digital nerve block. One week later, this procedure was repeated before and after a bilateral abaxial sesamoid nerve block. Peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI) and stance time (ST) of 5 hoof prints of both forelimbs were obtained (126?Hz). Asymmetry ratios were calculated. Toe-heel and medio-lateral hoof balance curves of the vertical force were calculated. Mixed model ANOVA was used for statistical analysis of asymmetry ratios (α?=?0.05). Hoof balance curves were assessed qualitatively. Results There were no significant effects of handler position and perineural anesthesia on PVF and VI; small but significant effects of perineural anesthesia on ST at walk were associated with variability in horses? speed between sessions at walk (P?=?0.046); no significant differences at trot. Hoof balance curves were not affected by handler position or perineural anesthesia, and were highly repeatable within each individual horse. Conclusions The lack of any effect of handler position or perineural anaesthesia on limb loading and toe-heel and medial-lateral hoof balance in sound horses makes it probable that significant aberrations found using pressure plate analysis are related to abnormalities and hence may be relevant in lameness diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction The navicular bone (NB) and the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) are common sites of lameness. Greater knowledge of foot mechanics will aid in understanding of the aetiopathogenesis and may provide new opportunities for treatment and prevention. It was hypothesised that changes in the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPj) and movement of the NB and DDFT during the stance phase will lead to changes in the moment arm of the DDFT around the DIPj. Methods Internal hoof kinematics were determined using a high-speed fluoroscopy system. Six horses were walked and trotted over a raised platform consisting of four force plates, through the field of view of the fluoroscopy system. The angles of the DIPj and the DDFT around the navicular bone and the moment arm of the DDFT were measured. Changes in these parameters during stance and differences between strides, gaits and horses were assessed using an ANOVA or paired T-test as appropriate (P<0.05). Results The range of motion (ROM, mean?±?SD) during stance of the DIPJ was 28.6?±?4.6° (walk) and 26.5?±?6.3 (trot) with significant differences between gaits, strides and horses (P<0.001). The angle change of the DDFT around the NB was 21.9?±?6.0° in walk and 26.6?±?6.5 in trot. The change in moment arm of the DDFT around the DIPj was 3.7?±?1.3?mm in walk and 4.1?±?2.2?mm in trot. There were no significant differences between the different time points during stance or between gaits. Conclusions High-speed fluoroscopy is a novel method that allows assessment of internal foot kinematics. The observed changes between gaits during stance may result in altered stress distribution in the DDFT. Further studies will evaluate the effect of farriery intervention on internal foot kinematics.

AB  - Introduction The muscle fibre type (MFT) of the deep epaxial musculature has not been determined in horses. The objective was to determine the MFT distribution in selected muscles of thoracolumbar and hindlimb region of horses. This included deep epaxial and hypaxial muscles that were hypothesised to have a postural stabilising role. A second objective was to examine differences in MFT distribution between Arabians and Quarter horses. Methods Muscle biopsy samples (114) were obtained from 5 Quarter horses, 4 Arabians, and 2 Thoroughbreds. The myosin heavy chain distribution was determined by gel electrophoresis. Mann-Whitney rank test was used to compare the proportional MFT content and differences between breeds. Results Mm. sacrocaudalis dorsalis medialis and diaphragm had the highest proportion of MFT-I, 84.1% (±18.4) and 72.4% (±12.5), respectively. The remaining deep epaxial muscles and the hypaxial m. psoas minor had approximately equal MFT-I and II proportions. Mm. psoas major, iliocostalis, longissimus dorsi and the hind limb muscles contained mostly MFT-IIX: from 50.5% (±12.8) to 67.9% (±7.3). Quarter horses had significantly more MFT-IIX in m. psoas major 60.8% (±9.1) than Arabians 41.9% (±3.2). Arabians had significantly more MFT-I fibres in m. longissimus dorsi 16.9% (±4.6) than Quarter horses 9.9% (±1.4) (P<0.05). Conclusions The MFT distribution of the deep epaxial muscles, mm. psoas minor and diaphragm, suggest a postural stabilizing role in contrast to the fibre type proportions of the hindlimb muscles. The findings can direct diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscular or neuromotor dysfunction in the thoracolumbar and hind limb area.

AB  - Introduction The ability to accurately assess equine oxygen consumption (VO2) under field conditions has been limited by the need for unrestricted gas exchange. Methods Two variations of a mask and an associated electronics control module (ECM) were designed to enable breath-by-breath measurement of airflows with two 8.0?cm diameter pneumotachometers located 7.5?cm in front of each narus and connected to differential pressure transducers mounted on the outside of the mask. The ECM was comprised of electronics for signal filtering to the flow transducers, an oxygen sensing cell, and an analog-to-digital converter all powered by a lithium-ion battery. The battery also powered a pump connected to gas sampling ports between the nares and pneumotachometers. Airflow and oxygen content of inspired and expired gases were recorded through the ECM and electronically transferred to a notebook. VO2 was determined from these recordings by an operator using a customized software analysis program. One mask encased the lower head (E). The other left the jaw free so horse could wear a bit and be ridden (R). Multiple treadmill exercise tests were undertaken by 6 horses to measure VO2max and blood gases. Each mask was worn twice and results compared to those from an open flow-through system (O) by 2-way RMANOVA (P<0.05). Utility of the system was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient of 4 independent raters. Results Blood gases and VO2max (152.0?±?4.0 (mean?±?SEM; O), 147.7?±?4.3 (E), 150.7?±?3.3 (R) ml/(kg.min) were not different between masks. VO2 measures were reproducible for each mask. Agreement between the 4 raters was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient?=?0.99). Conclusions Masks capable of measuring VO2 during field exercise were developed, tested and found accurate by multiple users. Ethical Animal Research Studies performed were approved by the Institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #3807). Sources of funding:?Institutional sources. Competing interests:?Washington State University has filed notice of its intent to apply for a patent for facemask used in this study.

AB  - Introduction The most frequently reported causes of gastric ulcers in horses are fasting, type of feed and management, and the administration of some drugs. More recently, physical exercise has also been pointed out as an important factor in the development of gastric lesions in athletic horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether treadmill exercise predisposes to the occurrence of gastric ulcers in horses. Methods Five Arabian horses were exercised on a high-speed treadmill during twelve weeks. The animals were submitted to gastroscopy before the beginning and the end of the training period. The lesions were classified according to the method proposed by Macallister [1] that assigns scores for number and severity of injuries, with modifications to give a total score for the stomach, considering not only the presence and severity of ulcers, but also other findings as gastritis, hyperkeratosis, desquamation of the mucosa. The results obtained in the two periods were compared using the Wilcoxon test, with significance at P<0.05. Results In the first gastroscopy two animals had very low scores for lesion number and severity and three horses had no injury. In contrast, in the second evaluation, all animals had higher scores. A significant difference was observed between the two periods (before and after training) considering both methods of gastric lesion classification. Conclusions We concluded that Arabian horses exercised on a treadmill may develop gastric lesions. The possible influence of these lesions on athletic performance and other parameters should be considered by researchers who study equine exercise physiology.

AB  - Introduction The evaluation of acid-base balance of horses is important because it detects alterations that affect their performance and health. There are studies relating these changes with endurance type effort, but few regarding sprint exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the fitness level of Quarter Horses performing barrel racing could be differentiated by quantitative acid-base analysis. Methods For this purpose, 10 horses were distributed into two groups: high (HF) and lower (LF) fitness as defined by the trainer. GPS and frequency meter were used for the measurements. Venous blood gas analysis was performed using a portable analyzer (I-stat) before and after exercise. Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and concentration of non-volatile buffers (Atot) were determined. Variables before and after exercise were compared within and between groups by t-test (P<0.05). Results The average track distance was 125?m. There were no differences between maximum or average velocity and heart rate, which were 30.76?±?0.53?km/h, 22.85?±?0.28?km/h, 206?bpm?±?3.91 versus 27.7?±?2.4?km/h, 21.94?±?0.3?km/h and 203?bpm?±?5.77 for the HF and LF groups, respectively. SID values before exercise were significantly lower for the LF group. Both groups showed a significant increase in Atot and AG, while pH, HCO3-, SIG and SID decreased significantly after exercise. Conclusions Metabolic acidosis was observed using both the traditional and the quantitative approach. It was not possible to differentiate the fitness level of horses in the study.

AB  - Introduction Acid-base disturbances are frequently assessed using traditional variables PCO2, pH, and bicarbonate. This study aimed to compare the changes in acid-base balance in horses performing a CEI endurance race (160?km) using traditional and quantitative methodologies. Methods Blood samples were drawn before racing, at the vet-gate (66?km), immediately after racing, and 2 and 15?h after racing from 18 participating horses. The mean velocity of the horses was 17?km/h. PCO2 and pH were measured (I-Stat). Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and total volatile buffers (Atot) were calculated using formulas from the literature. Data for finishers (F) and non-finishers (N) was compared with an unpaired test. Data collected for finishers at all time-points was compared by repeated ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results PCO2 was lower in group N at the 66?km time-point. In group F, AG had a bimodal behaviour, declining immediately after exercise and then increasing at 2 and 15 hours. There was a slight increase in pH post-exercise. After 2 hours, Atot increased while PCO2 decreased. Compared to SIG immediately after racing, SIG at 2 and 15 hours after racing was decreased. Traditional methodology suggested mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to hyperventilation of the finishers. Quantitative methodology suggested metabolic acidosis reflected by decreasing SID trend and a significant increase of Atot. Conclusions Acid-base imbalances are present in endurance racing horses and differences were found between the traditional and quantitative methods of assessment.

AB  - Introduction During anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, lactate and H+ ions accumulate in muscle fibers and pass into the bloodstream. Monocarboxylate transporter type 1 and its ancillary protein CD147 transport H+ and lactate ions from the plasma into red blood cells, thereby maintaining acid/base homeostasis and retarding systemic acidosis and fatigue. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of CD147 protein in the red blood cells of Arabian horses with different levels of athletic ability. Methods Blood samples were taken from 12 Arabian horses before exercise. The horses were divided into two groups: untrained horses (UH, n?=?6) and 160-km endurance horses (FEI, n?=?6). The amount of CD147 in the plasma membranes of their red blood cells was determined by Western blotting analysis using a human-specific anti-CD147 antibody previously validated for horses. The medians were compared by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test at 5%. Results CD147 protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45?kDa was found in the red blood cell membranes of the studied horses. The CD147 expression levels of the two groups were not different (P?=?0.065). The observed median values (min?max) were 0.50 (0.37?1.26) and 0.27 (0.09?0.69) arbitrary optical density units for the FEI and UH group respectively. Conclusions Studies must be performed with more horses to determine if a different level of CD147 expression exists in FEI horses related to their intensive training programs or to the genetic traits of each horse.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered in North America for the prophylactic treatment of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Plasma total CO2 concentration (ctCO2) provides a clinically useful screening test for the presence of metabolic acid-base disturbances, including the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents to racehorses. Some racing jurisdictions account for the metabolic alkalosis and increased plasma ctCO2 induced by furosemide administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between pre-race furosemide dose and pre-race plasma ctCO2 in Thoroughbred racehorses. Methods Jugular venous blood was collected anaerobically into 3?mL partially evacuated plastic tubes containing lithium heparin from 226 Thoroughbred horses administered a variable dose of furosemide (150?500?mg IV, n?=?217) 3?4 hours previously or not administered furosemide (n?=?9). Plasma ctCO2 was calculated from the measured values for pH and pCO2 using a blood gas and pH analyzer [Radiometer ABL 700] and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Data was analyzed using multivariable linear regression and P<0.05 was significant. Plasma ctCO2 in mmol/L increased linearly (P?=?0.0006) with furosemide dose in milligrams adjusted for sex (female, stallion, gelding), such that ctCO2?=?33.38???0.71(if female)???0.63(if stallion)?+?0.0040???(furosemide dose). Conclusions Intravenous administration of furosemide (150?500?mg) produces a linear dose-dependent increase in ctCO2 in plasma. High intravenous doses of furosemide (500?mg) have the potential to increase plasma ctCO2 to near the threshold value used to identify the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents. This finding supports an allowance of 2.0?mmol/L for furosemide administration used by some racing jurisdictions in North America.

AB  - Introduction Big respiratory cycles (BRCs) are a sporadic but normal occurrence during galloping exercise. Their relationship to performance capacity as reflected by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is unclear. Methods 7 Thoroughbreds completed multiple incremental exercise tests up to 13?m/s on a treadmill to determine their VO2max while wearing a mask that measured inspired and expired volumes (VI, VE) and VO2 on a breath-by-breath basis. Frequency and duration of BRCs were related to speed and VO2max using regression analysis. Numbers of BRCs for each test were counted and the duration, VI, VE and VO2 of each BRC determined and compared to the corresponding average values of the 5 breaths following the BRCs, and VO2max for the exercise bout. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results The frequency of BRCs was 64% when all speeds and runs were considered. The number and appearance of BRCs varied considerably between horses. BRC numbers were greatest at 6 and 13?m/s and least at 9?m/s, and significantly related by polynomial regression (r2?=?0.90). BRC duration was not related to breathing frequency when all BRCs were considered due to the existence of two distinct clusters of BRCs. The duration of those lasting <1.25?s was inversely related to speed (r2?=?0.77) as were those >1.25?s in length (r2?=?0.55). BRC VI and VE were greater than normal VI and VE and the difference increased linearly (r2?=?0.89 and 0.87, respectively) as speed increased from 6?m/s (VI: 8.0?±?0.6%; VE: 8.9?±?0.7% greater) to 13?m/s (VI: 42?±?2%; VE: 57?±?3% greater). Individual VO2max was not related to the number, length or volume of BRCs. Conclusions The frequency, duration and size of BRCs do not affect VO2max and vary considerably within a given treadmill test and between horses.

AB  - Introduction Eccentric muscle contractions (?negative? work, e.g., downhill running) affect human skeletal muscle differently than concentric contractions, increasing muscle size and strength more than concentric exercise training with reduced oxygen consumption (VO2). Better understanding of skeletal muscle and cardiopulmonary responses to downhill training may indicate a role for this in Thoroughbred training. We hypothesised that Thoroughbreds would reduce metabolic energy cost and cardiopulmonary function when they ran at equivalent speed on a declined treadmill compared with running horizontally or uphill. Methods Five well-trained Thoroughbreds ran for 2-min incremental exercise intervals on a treadmill at 1.7, 3.5, 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0?m/s on a +4% incline, 0% incline (horizontal) and ?4% decline in random order on different days. Cardiopulmonary and O2-transport variables were measured and analysed with two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Holm-?idák pairwise-comparisons. Results Horses ran at all inclines with identical stride frequency and length. At identical uphill speeds they had significantly higher (vs. horizontal) mass-specific VO2 (43% mean increase) and CO2 production (VCO2/Mb), cardiac output (Q/Mb), heart rate, arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2), and reduced arterial O2 tension and saturation; tidal volume tended to be higher (P?=?0.060). Downhill running reduced (vs. horizontal) VO2/Mb (19% mean decrease), VCO2/Mb, Q/Mb and PaCO2. Fractional energy cost increase (incline) and reduction (decline) decreased linearly with increasing speed. Conclusions Thoroughbreds run downhill with lower energy cost than on the level or uphill and the cost changes with speed. It remains to be determined if eccentric training induces skeletal muscle changes in horses.

AB  - Introduction Training related cardiac adaptation is documented in Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds, including an increased incidence of AV valve regurgitation. In Warmbloods less is known about training effects on cardiac function or subclinical valve regurgitation. Methods Fifteen adult untrained Warmbloods (aged 3.8?±?0.7 years) were compared with fifteen adult Warmblood eventers (aged 11.4?±?0.9 years) competing at CIC2* (group 1, n?=?5) and CCI2*, CIC3*, CCI3* and CCI4*levels (group 2, n?=?9) and fifteen healthy adult Warmbloods competing at advanced dressage (group 3, n?=?5), Prix Saint Georges, Intermediate or Grand Prix (group 4, n?=?10) levels (mean age 10.3?±?0.7 years). The presence of heart murmurs, valve regurgitation and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated, and training intensity was scored. A correlation was found between bodyweight and not height. Differences in cardiac morphology were compared using General Linear Models with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (SPSS version 20), using group and bodyweight as covariates. Significance was set at P<0.05. Prevalence of audible heart murmurs and valvular regurgitation was higher in eventers (0?20% and 29?79%, respectively and dressage horses (7?40% and 7?60%, respectively) than controls (0?20% and 7?20%, respectively). Interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd, left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV mean wall thickness (LVMWT) were greater in groups 2 and 4 than controls; group 4 also had a greater pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and LV posterior wall (LVPWd). Group 1 showed a greater LVMWT; group 4 a greater end point septal separation (EPSS). Training intensity influenced in both categories IVSd and MWT; in eventers also the right ventricular diameter in diastole and in dressage horses also LVPWd, LVM, EPSS and PAD. Elite eventers and dressage horses showed an increased prevalence of audible murmurs and valvular regurgitation. Cardiac adaptations resembled those associated with resistance and endurance training. Increased performance level and training intensity accompanied increased cardiac muscle thickness and volume. These effects should be considered during sales and performance evaluations.

AB  - Introduction Subchondral bone fatigue is an important cause of poor performance, morbidity and mortality in racehorses. Fatigued bone is repaired by remodelling, a process that is attenuated under high cyclical loads, yet the effects of training on remodelling activity in Thoroughbred racehorses is unknown. We hypothesised that remodelling rates are lower in training horses than those that are resting from training. Methods Sections of the palmar metacarpal condyles from Thoroughbred horses that were in race training (n?=?24) or resting from training (n?=?24) at the time of death were examined with light microscopy and back scattered electron microscopy (BSEM). Bone area fraction (B.Ar/T.Ar), and eroded bone surface (E.Pm/T.Ar) were measured within two regions of interest; (1) the lateral parasagittal groove (PS); and (2) the lateral condylar subchondral bone (LC). BSEM variables were analysed for the effect of group (independent samples t-test), region (paired t-test) and interaction with time since change in training status (general linear model). Mean?±?SE are reported. Results For both regions of interest E.Pm/T.Ar was lower in the training horses (PS: 0.39?±?0.06?mm?1, LC: 0.24?±?0.04?mm?1) than in the resting group (PS: 0.65?±?0.07?mm?1, P?= 0.010, LC: 0.85?±?0.10?mm?1, P<0.001). Lower subchondral bone porosity was observed, reflected by higher B.Ar/T.Ar in the LC of training horses (90.8?±?0.6%) than resting horses (85.3?±?1.4%, P?=?0.0010). E.Pm/T.Ar was higher with increased duration of a training period in the lateral condyle (r2?=?0.26, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Race training inhibits remodelling in the subchondral bone of highly loaded areas of the distal metacarpus. Therefore periods of less intense loading are important for allowing repair of subchondral bone fatigue in Thoroughbred racehorses.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered to Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses to reduce the incidence and severity of EIPH. The magnitude and duration of mineral loss following furosemide administration has not previously been measured in horses. Methods Six fit Thoroughbreds (age 6.8?±?1.2?y; bwt 585?±?19?kg) were used in a 3?x?3 Latin square design trial to measure the effect of furosemide on urinary and fecal mineral excretion for 24?h before (?24?h) and 24?h, 48?h and 72?h after a standardized exercise test (SET) on an inclined (3o) high speed treadmill. The treatment groups consisted of an untreated control (C) and two groups (F and FE) which received furosemide (0.5?mg/kg, IV) 4?h before the SET. C and F were fed 60?g/d NaCl and (FE) was fed 200?g/d of an electrolyte mix (14?g?K, 37.7?g?Na and 43.3?g?Cl) for 21 days before the SET. Following the SET the FE group was supplemented with an additional 10?g/d?Ca and 10?g/d?Mg. Results Urinary Ca, P, Na and Cl excretion increased 24?h post treatment in the F and FE groups (P<0.05). 72?h?Ca and Cl balance was decreased in F (P<0.05) and 72?h?Mg and Cl balance was decreased in FE (P<0.05). The digestibility of P and Mg was decreased in FE (P<0.05) and Na digestibility was increased in F and FE (P<0.05). Conclusions A single dose of furosemide negatively affected calcium balance in horses for 72?h post administration. Further research is needed to assess the effect of chronic furosemide use in racehorses on mineral balance and soundness.
