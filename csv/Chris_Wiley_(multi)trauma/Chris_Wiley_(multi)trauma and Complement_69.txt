AB  - Abstract Previous studies have shown that Schwann cell implantation offers a potential therapeutic approach to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries. In a clinically relevant paradigm, however, the implantation of autologous Schwann cells is problematic and the use of heterogenetic Schwann cells will be required. In the present study we addressed this important issue and analysed the immunogenicity and survival of allogeneic and xenogeneic Schwann cell suspension grafts in a prelesioned CNS fiber tract, the transected postcommissural fornix of the adult Wistar rat. Cultured Schwann cells from Wistar rat or human peripheral nerve were injected either immediately or after a delay into the transection site and the spatio-temporal pattern of leukocyte infiltration and of major histocompatibility antigen expression was characterized and semiquantified with immunocytochemical methods. Our main findings are that (1) invasive cerebral lesions induce the expression of MHC class I and II antigens, but only sparse infiltration of T-lymphocytes, (2) both allogeneic and xenogeneic discordant Schwann cell suspension grafts, from either neonatal or adult peripheral nerve, survive without any overt signs of rejection for up to 10 weeks after implantation; and (3) delayed implantation procedures have no effect on immune responses to allogeneic Schwann cell grafts. These results demonstrate that there is no marked ongoing immune reactions to heterogenetic Schwann cell suspension grafts and that long-term survival of cross-species Schwann cell grafts can be achieved in the absence of any immunsuppressive treatment. Thus the conditions for functional transplantation of Schwann cells across immunological barriers seem to be favourable and will have implications for future cross-species studies, and possibly also for clinical application.

AB  - Summary The last ten to fifteen years have been a time of rapid development in the psychiatry of old age. Biological research on the dementias has moved forward impressively, but significant too has been the development in many countries of local services specially designed to meet the needs of old people with mental disorders, and of those who look after them. Such services are built on the experience both of psychiatry and of geriatrics, but have also broken new ground: the UK experience is described. The facts have belied earlier misgivings about the potential of this field of work to attract and satisfy able staff in the health professions; indeed, this work has developed with style and enthusiasm, and with widespread educational programmes and growing research activity. This paper reviews briefly these developments and considers some broader issues of policy as they bear on the care of mentally ill old people. Considered also is tentative evidence that the dementias of old age may be becoming less prevalent. Finally, current studies in Nottingham which look at the social associations of old age mental disorders are briefly described and the implications are considered of the broadening of the base of ?psychogeriatrics? which such studies represent.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - Purpose. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is one of the most frequently applied methods of psychotherapy in clinical practice. However, it is the subject of controversial discussion, especially with regard to empirical evidence. In this article we aim to give an up-to-date description of the treatment and to review the available empirical evidence. Evidence is reviewed for both efficacy and mechanisms of change of short- and moderate-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. Furthermore, results of effectiveness studies of long-term psychoanalytic therapy are reviewed. Methods. With regard to efficacy, a protocol for a Cochrane review for (short-term) psychodynamic psychotherapy is available specifying inclusion criteria for efficacy studies. Results. Twenty-three randomized controlled trials of manual-guided psychodynamic psychotherapy applied in specific psychiatric disorders provided evidence that psychodynamic psychotherapy is superior to control conditions (treatment-as-usual or wait list) and, on the whole, as effective as already established treatments (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy) in specific psychiatric disorders. With regard to process research, central assumptions of psychodynamic psychotherapy were confirmed by empirical studies. Conclusions. Further research should include both efficacy studies (on specific forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy in specific mental disorders) and effectiveness studies complementing the results from experimental research settings. Future process research should address the complex interactions among interventions, patient's level of functioning, helping alliance and outcome.

AB  - Summary Phaeosphaeriaceae is a family in the order Pleosporales containing numerous plant pathogens, endophytes, lichenised fungi, and environmental saprobes. A novel genus, Tintelnotia is introduced containing two species, one of which caused an eye infection and several nail infections in humans. All species of Tintelnotia produce conidia in soft pycnidia with a wide ostiole. The generic type species is T. opuntiae causing necrotic spots on cactus plants. The isolates of the human opportunist T. destructans showed variable susceptibility pattern to a panel of common antifungal agents. The MICs of amphotericin B, voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole were 1 ?g/mL, complemented by an in vitro MEC of 16 ?g/mL against caspofungin; the MIC of terbinafine was 0.125 ?g/mL. The latter compound contributed to the successful therapy in the ocular mycosis refractory to standard antifungal therapy, the benefit of terbinafine should be highlighted as a therapeutic option especially in difficult-to-treat fungal keratitis.

AB  - SUMMARY The best-known protein components of the plant cell wall have highly repetitive, proline-rich sequences. The use of recombinant DNA approaches has enabled complete sequences of these proteins to be determined and features of the expression of the corresponding genes to be examined. These results, coupled with the use of immunological techniques, have shown that proline-rich proteins are interesting probes to study developmental and defence processes in plants. In this review, the sequence and expression of different groups of proline-rich proteins in plants are presented. These groups include hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP) or extensins, proline-rich proteins (PRP) and glycine-rich proteins (GRP). The specific features of each group and the possible functions of these proteins are discussed, as well as the data available on the mechanisms controlling the expression of their corresponding genes.

AB  - Abstract Focusing on everyday life and the dynamics of contestations between very different groups thrown together in dangerous proximity in a neighborhood of Istanbul called Tophane, this article contributes to debates on urban transformation, political aspects of gentrification and the right to the city, with a focus on how to live differentially. Amidst rising political tensions and polarization in Turkey, competing economic interests, gentrification pressures and/or ultimate clashes over norms and values have fueled these contestations, which have degenerated into violent encounters. Calling for a re-evaluation of ?the right to the city?, we argue that, unless the concept of right to the city is complemented by a commitment to live differentially?that is, by a right to difference?mediating and addressing these contestations will be difficult. Whether clashes over the right to the city and everyday encounters can lead to a new politics committed to resisting urban transformation that pushes the boundaries of urban citizenship, or whether these uncomfortable encounters will continue to escalate, with one group claiming hegemony over space until the neighborhood is finally and fully gentrified, remains very uncertain. But it will, ultimately, be the litmus test of the country's democracy and inclusive citizenship.

AB  - The ability of organisms to produce genetic variation for any trait, including resistance to pathogens, is partially determined by breeding system. I used enzyme electrophoresis, crossing experiments, and cytology to assess the breeding systems of cooccurring Arabis species that are often infected by rust fungi. The Arabis holboellii surveyed were pseudogamous apomicts with relatively high population-level ailozyme variation, and variable chromosome numbers (2n, 3n, 4n). Arabisgunnisoniana (3n) and Arabis lignifera (2n) were also pseudogamous but showed no allozyme variation either at the population level, or within progeny arrays. Arabis hirsuta may be an autogamous polyploid or it may be a pseudogamous apomict; more work is needed to clarify the breeding system of this species. Arabis drummondii and Arabis crandallii were sexual, but exhibited little genetic variability due to a predominance of self-fertilization. The use of several techniques was necessary to evaluate these breeding systems. Insect exclusion indicated when pollen was necessary for seed set, but could not differentiate between sexual reproduction and pseudogamy. Electrophoresis yielded information on the degree of selling (as evidenced by homozygosity) and apomixis (fixed heterozygosity), but could not differentiate between autogamy and apomixis in polyploids without ailozyme variation. Pseudogamy was confirmed when crosses between dissimilar genotypes yielded only the maternal genotype, and cytologically by irregular meiosis.

Methods Two quadrants of each of the 12 patients received root planing with diamond burs, whereas the other two quadrants were treated with curettes. Clinical periodontal measurements were recorded at baseline and then 1, 3 and 6 months after completion of non-surgical periodontal treatment. Subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained at baseline and 1-month control. Twenty-one hopeless teeth received root planing with diamond burs or curettes or no treatment and then extracted for microscopic evaluations. Results Clinical periodontal parameters improved similarly with both treatment modalities. Microbiological analyses revealed similar findings for the bacterial load (16S gene copy numbers) and ratio of each bacterium to the total bacterial count at baseline and 1-month control. Cytokine levels in the gingival crevicular fluid samples exhibited differences between the two treatments. Scanning electron microscopic analyses indicated that diamond burs were better in terms of calculus removal and loss of tooth substance indices but roughness index values were better for curettes. Conclusions Diamond burs provide findings comparable with curettes in root planing.

AB  - Focal cerebral ischemia induces cellular responses that may result in secondary tissue damage. We recently demonstrated multi-facetted spatial and temporal patterns of neuroinflammation by multimodal imaging. In the present study, we especially focus on the separation of vital and necrotic tissue, which enabled us to define a demarcation zone. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced via macrosphere embolization of the middle cerebral artery in Wistar rats. Subsequent cellular processes were investigated immunohistochemically from 3 to 56 days after onset of ischemia. We detected several infarct subareas: a necrotic infarct core and its margin adjacent to a nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)+ zone delineating it from a vital peri-infarct zone. Initially transition from necrotic to vital tissue was gradual; later on necrosis was precisely separated from vital tissue by a narrow NG2+ belt that was devoid of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or neurons. Within this demarcation zone NG2+ cells associate with ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) but not with GFAP, neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) or 2?, 3?-cyclic nucleotide 3?-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). During further infarct maturation NG2 seemed to be positioned in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the demarcation zone, whereas Iba1+ cells invaded the necrotic infarct core and GFAP+ cells built a gliotic containing belt between the lesion and NeuN+ unaffected tissue. Overall, our data suggested that NG2 proteoglycan expression and secretion hallmarked demarcation as a process that actively separated necrosis from vital tissue and therefore decisively impacts secondary neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Aim To describe prospective application of an implementation framework to guide and evaluate a quality improvement (QI) project to improve adherence to evidence-based postoperative diet guidelines (consistent with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, ERAS) in older surgical patients. Methods A hybrid mixed methods study guided by the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework was used. A pre-implementation audit identified gaps in nutrition-related care practices against ERAS guidelines for older surgical patients. Qualitative interviews explored barriers to practice change, informing development of the facilitated implementation strategy. Iterative facilitation interventions were identified by field notes and classified using i-PARIHS facilitator's tool-kit. Post-implementation audit measured implementation outcomes, and clinical processes and outcomes using controlled before?after comparative study. Results Implementation involved 17 discrete facilitation activities. Early postoperative diet upgrade was acceptable, well adopted (79%) and appropriate for 89% of patients. Fidelity (i.e. protocol delivered as intended) was 59%, with loss of fidelity primarily because of incorrect diet codes. Clinical processes and outcome evaluation (n?=?155) compared data pre-implementation (intervention: n?=?45, control: n?=?27; mean age 73 (SD 6) years, 60% male) and post-implementation (intervention: n?=?47, control: n?=?36; mean age 74 (SD 6) years, 57% male). Patients on the intervention ward had higher odds of receiving early nutrition post-implementation (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI]: 6.5 [1.9?22.4], P?=?0.01). Conclusions Prospective application of an implementation framework supported planning and successful implementation in this QI project. Multi-level evaluation of facilitation strategies, implementation outcomes, and clinical processes and outcomes helps to understand areas of success and continuing challenges.

AB  - Background It is now generally accepted that the response to a particular signal, such as the surgical trauma following implant placement, is not the result of a single linear signalling pathway, but rather reflects pathway integration, which can occur at multiple levels. Although it is well documented that both SLA and SLActive surfaces are able to promote bone formation and osseointegration, it is still unclear which are the key signalling pathways involved and how surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity might affect pathway integration. Objective To combine gene and protein data from in vivo studies applying titanium hydrophobic (Sandblasting, Large-grit, Acid-etching, SLA) and hydrophilic (SLActive) surfaces to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pro-osteogenic properties of these surfaces. Methods The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG?) pathway database and the Ingenuity? Pathway Analysis (IPA?) software were applied to the genomic and proteomic data of previous in vivo studies applying SLA and SLActive surfaces, with the specific aim to focus on bone formation-related signalling pathways. While gene data were derived from a human study on osseointegration, protein data originated from a preclinical study in rabbits. Data were available for the 4, 7 and 14 days of healing periods. Results Both genomic and proteomic data showed that the osteogenesis process takes place mainly at 7 and 14 days of healing on both SLA and SLActive surfaces. Surface hydrophilicity enhances bone formation at multiple levels, by directly promoting an earlier expression of pathways involved in cell proliferation and osteoblast precursor differentiation (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide-3 kinase-AKT, Wnt, Notch, transforming growth factor-?), but also by positively regulating angiogenesis, bone mineralization and bone remodelling. Conclusion This study combined, for the first time, different ?omics? outputs to get new insights on the molecular mechanisms behind the influence of surface hydrophilicity on osseointegration/bone formation. Specific signalling pathways, such as Wnt, vascular endothelial growth factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase, were identified as differentially modulated by titanium surface hydrophilicity both at a genomic and proteomic level. These findings may be used in the future to monitor/predict the bone formation/osseointegration process, or as a screening tool towards the manufacture of new pro-osteogenic implant surfaces. In order to take into account the full complexity and interplay of cell signalling during bone formation, powerful bioinformatics tools integrating different ?omics? data and predicting signalling pathways trends should be applied by future studies.

AB  - In 1998 we began to develop multi-lingual educational material for apprentice schools. This material was highly graphical, consisting of overheads with explanatory notes. The kit also included clinical slides, an introductory videotape, and handcream samples. By early 2000, 300 kits had been distributed to teachers of apprentices all over Switzerland. Teachers rapidly embraced the kit thanks to its simplicity and ease of use. Feedback was also gratifyingly high among those outside teachers per se: health professionals, safety engineers and others involved in prevention, even outside Switzerland. By 2004, however, we had made a total paradigm shift: kits were out, the Internet was in. The advantages were obvious, both in quantity and in quality. We could reach more people and we could reach them better. When we made 300 kits our budget reached its limit, but with the virtually free Internet, using only one highly developed digital course, we can now reach a potentially limitless audience. Moreover, we can refine, update and amend our material continuously. Our main course includes defining and preventing contact dermatitis, defining the special requirements of such varied users as hairdressers, bricklayers and machinists. It also shows how to avoid misuse of protective gloves. The course still involves an intense use of graphics, but they were redrawn from scratch for the Internet to maximize simplicity, immediacy and elegance. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - Key Clinical Message DOCK8 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency with high IgE level, eosinophilia, severe eczema, extensive cutaneous viral, and respiratory bacterial infections, mostly in populations with higher prevalence of consanguinity. Molecular diagnosis of this gene is a useful approach for early diagnosis and timely HSCT due to deleterious consequences.

AB  - Abstract Changes in migrants' backgrounds and societies sending and receiving migrants might increase adaptation issues and reduce retention. To enhance migrants' well-being/health and their likelihood of staying it is necessary to gain an understanding of psychological and social factors that contribute to resilience and adaptation. This paper presents findings from a qualitative study that investigated the experiences, interpretations and actions of German migrant couples to New Zealand throughout the whole migration process to identify these factors. In depth, episodic interviews were conducted with four couples who decided to stay in New Zealand and four couples who decided to return to Germany. Interview data were complemented with participant observation. This paper provides insights into how the pre-migration experiences, interpretations and actions of German migrants to New Zealand influenced their establishment, their interpretations and actions and consequently adaptation, well-being/health and the decision whether to stay in New Zealand or to return to Germany. The findings illuminate the influence of psychological and social factors on migration experiences, interpretations and actions throughout the migration process. The paper offers some solutions for addressing the identified barriers to successful migration and integration into host societies. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Supportive care plays an increasingly important role in the modern management of multiple myeloma. While modern treatments have significantly prolonged overall and progression free survival through improved disease control, the vast majority of patients remain incurable, and live with the burden of the disease itself and the cumulative side effects of treatments. Maintenance of quality of life presents challenges at all stages of the disease from diagnosis through the multiple phases of active treatment to the end of life. Written on behalf of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) and the UK Myeloma Forum (UKMF), these evidence based guidelines summarize the current national consensus for supportive and symptomatic care in multiple myeloma in the following areas; pain management, peripheral neuropathy, skeletal complications, infection, anaemia, haemostasis and thrombosis, sedation, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, constipation, diarrhoea, mucositis, bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw, complementary therapies, holistic needs assessment and end of life care. Although most aspects of supportive care can be supervised by haematology teams primarily responsible for patients with multiple myeloma, multidisciplinary collaboration involving specialists in palliative medicine, pain management, radiotherapy and surgical specialities is essential, and guidance is provided for appropriate interdisciplinary referral. These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the BCSH/UKMF Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Multiple Myeloma 2011.

AB  - A light and electron microscope investigation was conducted on phloem in the aerial stem of Epifagus virginiana (L.) Bart. Tissue was processed at field collection sites in an effort to overcome problems resulting from manipulation. At variance with earlier accounts, Epifagus phloem consists of sieve elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma cells, and primary phloem fibers. The sieve elements possess simple sieve plates and the phloem is arranged in a collateral type of vascular bundle. In addition, this constitutes the first study on phloem ultrastructure in the aerial stems of a holoparasitic dicotyledon, an entire plant which could be viewed as an ?ideal sink.? Epifagus phloem possesses unoccluded sieve plate pores in mature sieve elements and a total lack of P-protein in sieve elements at all stages of development. Mature sieve elements lack nuclei. Plastids were rarely observed in mature sieve elements. Vacuoles with intact tonoplasts were encountered in some mature sieve elements. Otherwise, the ultrastructural features of sieve elements appear to differ little from those described by investigators of non-parasitic species.
