AB  - Aim.? To synthesise the evidence regarding honey?s role in health care and to identify whether this evidence applies more specifically to cancer care. Design.? Systematic review. Methods.? The inclusion and exclusion criteria were agreed by two reviewers and a keyword strategy was developed. EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, MEDLINE, COCHRANE and PUBMED databases were screened to identify suitable articles. The citation list from each included study was also screened for potentially suitable papers. The key findings from each study were entered onto a data extraction sheet. Results.? In total, 43 studies were included in the systematic review, which included studies in relation to wounds (n?=?19), burns (n?=?11), skin (n?=?3), cancer (n?=?5) and others (n?=?5). In addition, a systematic review regarding honey use in wound care was also included. While the majority of studies noted the efficacy of honey in clinical use, five studies found honey to be equally as effective as the comparator and three found honey to be less effective than the comparator treatment. Other research did not illustrate any significant difference between standard treatment regimes vs. honey treatment. Studies were generally poor in quality because of small sample sizes, lack of randomisation and absence of blinding. Conclusions.? Honey was found to be a suitable alternative for wound healing, burns and various skin conditions and to potentially have a role within cancer care. Relevance to clinical practice.? In the cancer setting, honey may be used for radiation-induced mucositis, radiotherapy-induced skin reactions, hand and foot skin reactions in chemotherapy patients and for oral cavity and external surgical wounds.

AB  - La ?production limitée? (?lean production?) est une nouvelle approche de la production susceptible de modifier la gestion des ressources humaines, les relations industrielles et les processus de travail dans les entreprises américaines. Apparaissant après une longue période de stabilité reposant sur des règles relationelles et opérationnelles basées sur la production de masse, la transition vers la production limitée est controversée et traumatisante. Le modèle émergent suggère que la transition s'amorce avec des innovations qui mettent l'accent sur l'amélioration de la productivité et s'affirme avec le comanagement et la participation. En s'appuyant sur une revue de la littérature et sur une évaluation raisonnée des résultats disponibles, cet article propose un point de vue structuré sur la nature des changements dans le processus productif et sur leurs conséquences institutionelles. ?Lean production? as a new production concept is believed to be transforming human resource management, industrial relations, and work processes in American firms. Coming after a long period of stability under operational and relational rules supported by mass production, the transition to lean production is controversial and traumatic. The emerging pattern suggests that transition begins with workplace innovations that emphasise productivity enhancement and develops to co-management or joint governance of the enterprise. On an extensive review of the literature and by selective weighting of findings and evidence, this paper develops an integrative perspective on the nature of changes in the mode of production and its institutional correlates.

AB  - Abstract According to existing literature, the core of social entrepreneurship (SE) knowledge is evolving and, as such, it has made important contributions to theoretical definitions and essential characterizations. However, more theoretical issues need to be addressed before the SE field can be fully explained and understood. In particular, the authors observe in the literature that, within empirical or conceptual studies, almost all authors use the term ?value?, but seemingly assume the dimensions of value rather than define or analyse its connotations and components. This paper uses the value construct and its multi-faceted dimensions to deconstruct the way in which value is created in the SE context. The authors argue that an analysis based on value generation, value capture and value sharing provides important insights into the specificity of SE research and can facilitate future theorizing. Through the conceptual lens of this central concept of value emanating from value theory and business model literature, the authors abductively analyse and classify the studies, providing a practical resource. The authors discuss the phenomenon, presenting an integrative framework that facilitates a clearer understanding of the social value creation process and suggest future research areas as openings for theory development in relation to value creation, its main components and flows.

AB  - Abstract Background Liver biopsy is the gold standard to assess pathological features (eg inflammation grades) for hepatitis B virus-infected patients although it is invasive and traumatic; meanwhile, several gene profiles of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have been separately described in relatively small hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected samples. We aimed to analyse correlations among inflammation grades, gene expressions and clinical parameters (serum alanine amino transaminase, aspartate amino transaminase and HBV-DNA) in large-scale CHB samples and to predict inflammation grades by using clinical parameters and/or gene expressions. Methods We analysed gene expressions with three clinical parameters in 122 CHB samples by an improved regression model. Principal component analysis and machine-learning methods including Random Forest, K-nearest neighbour and support vector machine were used for analysis and further diagnosis models. Six normal samples were conducted to validate the predictive model. Results Significant genes related to clinical parameters were found enriching in the immune system, interferon-stimulated, regulation of cytokine production, anti-apoptosis, and etc. A panel of these genes with clinical parameters can effectively predict binary classifications of inflammation grade (area under the ROC curve [AUC]: 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.93), validated by normal samples. A panel with only clinical parameters was also valuable (AUC: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.86), indicating that liquid biopsy method for detecting the pathology of CHB is possible. Conclusions This is the first study to systematically elucidate the relationships among gene expressions, clinical parameters and pathological inflammation grades in CHB, and to build models predicting inflammation grades by gene expressions and/or clinical parameters as well.

AB  - This case study was the first of its kind, where neutron computed tomography (CT) was applied to a wrapped mummified animal. Conventional X-ray CT was also used to allow for meaningful comparison, and complementary data for a comprehensive investigation. Previous applications of both techniques are limited to metallic objects, such as bronze Buddhas. The mummy used in this study (IA.2402) is dated between the Third Intermediate Period (1069?664 bce) to Late Period (664?332 bce) according to the wrapping style, and was originally believed to contain a complete skeleton of a feline. However, precise date and provenance were unknown. Our results prove the presence of only partial juvenile feline remains, and provide a date range for artefact creation (900?804 bce ± 30) and alteration (367?204 bce ± 30). Therefore, this study implements an established imaging technique (neutron CT) in a novel way, while preserving and conserving the intrinsic value of the artefact through non-destructive investigation.

AB  - Effect of pretreatment with intrathecal excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists on the development of pain behavior caused by plantar incision. (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) Anesthesiology 2000;93:489?496. This study examined the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluRs) on the development of pain behavior after plantar incision. Rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were anesthetized with halothane. Fifteen minutes before an incision was made, drug [40 nmol MK-801; 20 nmol NBQX; or 200 nmol [(+)-MCPG] or vehicle was injected intrathecally followed by an infusion of the same drug for 75 min. Withdrawal thresholds to calibrated von Frey filaments applied adjacent to the wound and response frequencies to a blunt mechanical stimulus applied directly to the wound were measured before incision and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after incision and then once daily for 6 days. Preincision treatments with antagonists against the NMDA (MK-801) and Group I and II metabotropic receptors [(+)-MCPG] did not inhibit the development of mechanical hyperalgesia caused by incision. Preincision treatment with the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX increased withdrawal thresholds at 1 and 2 h and on postoperative day 1 compared with the vehicle group; response frequencies were reduced 1 and 2 h after incision and on postoperative day 2 (P < 0.05). In an additional group, postincision treatment with NBQX was similar to preincision treatment. Conclude spinal NMDA and MGluR antagonists may not be useful for preventing postsurgical pain. Spinal non-NMDA receptor antagonists reduced pain behaviors, but a preventive effect using preincision treatment was not apparent. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The incisional model using rats was developed by Dr. Brennan and colleagues for the study of acute surgical pain. In a previous study, they showed that blockade of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors, but not blockade of NMDA receptors nor mGluR receptors reduces postincisional pain if administered after the incision is made. This study shows the same is true if the receptor antagonists are administered before the incision is made. However, the effect is not particularly marked and; therefore, pursuit of non-MNDA excitatory amino transmitter receptor blockers for the prevention of postincisional pain would not likely be fruitful. The results of the study do require us to rethink how postincisional pain differs from other experimental pains and the phenomena of ?wind-up? attributed to activation of the NMDA receptor. Worth keeping in mind is that incisional pain does not equal surgical pain, which may involve traumatic injury to nerves and produce a neuropath pain, which strongly indicates involvement of NMDA receptors.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.

AB  - Abstract There are few studies that investigate how people personally affected by a chronic disease associated with cigarette smoking account for their illness. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition largely caused by cigarette smoking. In order to better understand how people diagnosed with COPD view the relationship between cigarette smoking and their illness we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 participants. We found a widespread scepticism among our respondents about medical attempts to link their illness with cigarette smoking, and doubts about whether their illness was in fact COPD at all. Only four participants described smoking as the principal reason why they had developed breathing problems. Most participants gave multi-causal accounts that emphasised explanatory factors such as a familial tendency to respiratory illness or workplace exposure to pollution. Our findings have relevance for the development of smoking cessation interventions for people with COPD.

AB  - In 2005?06 the Australian government announced the establishment of 65 Family Relationship Centres (FRCs) ? a ?gateway? service assisting separating couples to reach agreement about child custodial arrangements without recourse to courts. The use of a multi-round competitive contracting regime for the purpose of selecting service providers gave rise to a number of tensions amongst not-for-profit organisations (NFPOs) which, to a degree, compromised the full realisation of stated public policy aims. Reporting on fieldwork conducted with a sample of FRC operators, industry representatives and key government officials this article evaluates the extent to which the case of FRCs conforms to critiques commonly aired in the social policy literature that attribute various forms of policy failure and/or social capital depletion to the competitive contracting of human services within quasi-markets. Although the competitive selection process imposed significant costs on the NFPOs involved, the program also exhibited substantial collaborative and collegial behaviours between government and NFPOs, thus diverging from the critique usually portrayed in the literature.

AB  - Abstract We present interim findings of a cross-site case study of an initiative to expand Housing First (HF) in Canada through training and technical assistance (TTA). HF is an evidence-based practice designed to end chronic homelessness for consumers of mental health services. We draw upon concepts from implementation science and systems change theory to examine how early implementation occurs within a system. Case studies examining HF early implementation were conducted in six Canadian communities receiving HF TTA. The primary data are field notes gathered over 1.5 years and evaluations from site-specific training events (k = 5, n = 302) and regional network training events (k = 4, n = 276). We report findings related to: (a) the facilitators of and barriers to early implementation, (b) the influence of TTA on early implementation, and (c) the ?levers? used to facilitate broader systems change. Systems change theory enabled us to understand how various ?levers? created opportunities for change within the communities, including establishing system boundaries, understanding how systems components can function as causes of or solutions to a problem, and assessing and changing systems interactions. We conclude by arguing that systems theory adds value to existing implementation science frameworks and can be helpful in future research on the implementation of evidence-based practices such as HF which is a complex community intervention. Implications for community psychology are discussed.

Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.

AB  - The histologic diagnosis of desmoplastic melanoma is challenging, particularly when the overlying junctional component is absent and when the spindle cells lack melanin pigment. In these instances, the importance of immunohistochemistry cannot be overemphasized. S-100 protein, with a sensitivity approaching 90%, is the primary immunohistochemical stain used for this purpose. HMB-45, although a more specific marker for melanocytes, is often negative in these cases. A marker of schwannian differentiation, p-75 NGF-R has been shown to be a useful confirmatory marker for desmoplastic and neurotropic melanoma, with staining intensity comparable to or better than S-100 protein. We report two cases of desmoplastic melanoma which stained focally and weakly with S-100 protein in comparison with the stronger staining of p-75 NGF-R. In both cases, S-100 staining could have been missed or interpreted as non-confirmatory, thus misguiding the diagnosis. We therefore suggest that p-75 NGF-R be a complementary marker to S-100 protein in differentiating desmoplastic melanoma from other non-neural crest-derived spindle cell tumors.

Kalaria (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 94?113?Molecular genetics and pathology of hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of several monogenic conditions involving small vessels predisposing to ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and diffuse white matter disease. With emphasis on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we review the molecular pathogenesis of recently characterized disorders including cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) and the Collagen type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1)-related disorders. CADASIL remains the most common hereditary small vessel disease (SVD) caused by >190 different mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a cell-signalling receptor. Mutant NOTCH3 instigates degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles leading to recurrent lacunar infarcts. Mutations in the serine protease HTRA1 gene are associated with CARASIL. Aberrant HTRA1 activity results in increased transforming growth factor-? signalling provoking multiple actions including vascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix synthesis. The RVCL disorders characterized by profound retinopathy are associated with mutations in TREX1, which encodes an abundant 3??5? DNA-specific exonuclease. TREX1 mutations lead to detrimental gain-of-function or insufficient quantities of enzyme. The COL4A1-related disorders are highly variable comprising four major phenotypes with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including SVD with cerebral haemorrhages in children and adults. Mutant COL4A1 likely disrupts the extracellular matrix resulting in fragile vessel walls. The hereditary SVDs albeit with variable phenotypes demonstrate how effects of different defective genes converge to produce the characteristic arteriopathy and microvascular disintegration leading to vascular cognitive impairment.

AB  - Abstract The risk of post-operative bleeding is a daily concern for many general dental practitioners. A thorough medical and medication history must be taken in order to consider all risk factors, particularly drugs, that contribute to bleeding risk. While the risk from drugs such as aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel are well-known, the extent to which new anti-platelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants affect bleeding risk is less well understood. In addition, there are drugs other than anti-thrombotics, such as antidepressants and complementary medicines that also impair haemostasis. The aim of this paper is to provide dentists with an updated overview of the drugs commonly encountered in general dental practice that can contribute to a patient?s post-operative bleeding risk.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades donor and recipient characteristics and medical management of heart transplantation (HT) patients have changed markedly. We studied the impact of these changes on long-term clinical outcome. Data of all consecutive HT recipients in our center have been collected prospectively. Cohort A (n = 353) was defined as the adult pts transplanted between 1984 and 1999 and was compared with cohort B (n = 227) transplanted between 2000 and 2013. Compared with cohort A, recipients in cohort B had older donors (mean age 29 vs. 43 years, donors aged >50 year: 2% vs. 33%, respectively). Survival at 1 and 10 years in cohort A vs. B was 89% vs. 86% and 53% vs. 68%, respectively (P = 0.02). Cohort B pts were treated more often with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (77% vs. 22%; P = <0.0001) and early statins post-HT (88% vs. 18%; P = 0.0001), while renal function was better conserved at 5 and 10 years (P = 0.001 and 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed significant reduction in 10-year mortality with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (HR 0.27 and 95% CI 0.17?0.42), hypertension post-HT (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.36?0.72), and revascularization (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15?0.52). In spite of the use of much older donors, the long-term outcome after HT has improved considerably in the last decade, probably due to the introduction of newer treatment modalities.
