AB  - Summary Over the past decades donor and recipient characteristics and medical management of heart transplantation (HT) patients have changed markedly. We studied the impact of these changes on long-term clinical outcome. Data of all consecutive HT recipients in our center have been collected prospectively. Cohort A (n = 353) was defined as the adult pts transplanted between 1984 and 1999 and was compared with cohort B (n = 227) transplanted between 2000 and 2013. Compared with cohort A, recipients in cohort B had older donors (mean age 29 vs. 43 years, donors aged >50 year: 2% vs. 33%, respectively). Survival at 1 and 10 years in cohort A vs. B was 89% vs. 86% and 53% vs. 68%, respectively (P = 0.02). Cohort B pts were treated more often with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (77% vs. 22%; P = <0.0001) and early statins post-HT (88% vs. 18%; P = 0.0001), while renal function was better conserved at 5 and 10 years (P = 0.001 and 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed significant reduction in 10-year mortality with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (HR 0.27 and 95% CI 0.17?0.42), hypertension post-HT (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.36?0.72), and revascularization (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15?0.52). In spite of the use of much older donors, the long-term outcome after HT has improved considerably in the last decade, probably due to the introduction of newer treatment modalities.

AB  - The American children's ritual, Halloween, involves an emergent, active and complex process rather than unidirectional socialization of children by adults. Inversions of meaning are prominent in Halloween through: 1) adult support for inverted, anti-normative themes, and 2) a turnabout by which children gain ascendance through costumed trick-or-treating. Based on interviews with six and seven year old children and their parents, as well as participant observation at Halloween events, Halloween's inversions had different interpretations for adults compared to children. For example the degree and quality of fear associated with Halloween varied between elders and children. Following the traumatic events of September 11, 2001, adult-rendered meanings of Halloween were shown to be unfixed and subject to modification. These findings raise critical questions about simplistic notions of socialization and cultural reduplication.

AB  - ABSTRACT Memory and related cognitive functions are progressively impaired in a subgroup of individuals experiencing childhood adversity and stress. However, it is not possible to identify vulnerable individuals early, a crucial step for intervention. In this study, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-hippocampal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were employed to examine for structural signatures of cognitive adolescent vulnerabilities in a rodent model of early-life adversity. These methods were complemented by neuroanatomical and functional assessments of hippocampal network integrity during adolescence, adulthood and middle-age. The high-resolution MRI identified selective loss of dorsal hippocampal volume, and intra-hippocampal DTI uncovered disruption of dendritic structure, consistent with disrupted local connectivity, already during late adolescence in adversity-experiencing rats. Memory deteriorated over time, and stunting of hippocampal dendritic trees was apparent on neuroanatomical analyses. Thus, disrupted hippocampal neuronal structure and connectivity, associated with cognitive impairments, are detectable via non-invasive imaging modalities in rats experiencing early-life adversity. These high-resolution imaging approaches may constitute promising tools for prediction and assessment of at-risk individuals in the clinic. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose We introduce the quantitative, continuous marker cartilage cavity that quantifies cartilage lesions by the total lesion volume. The aim was to quantify small lesions as well as large, full-depth lesions. Methods We included 315 knees from the Center for Clinical and Basic Research (CCBR), 972 knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), and 791 knees from the Prevention of OA in Overweight Females (PROOF) cohorts. In a subset, we digitally inserted artificial lesions. Each knee MRI was segmented using the knee imaging quantification (KIQ) framework. We quantified cartilage mean thickness and cavity from high-resolution cartilage thickness maps. Finally, we quantified lesion volume by the gradient peak method (GPM). Results Scan?rescan precision for cartilage cavity was 7.1%/3.0%. The cartilage cavity accuracy on the artificial lesions was determined as linear correlation at 0.88 with an average 8% under-estimation of lesion volume. Cavity and degree of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) correlated for all compartments (Spearman's rho between 0.14?0.56, P?<?0.001). Cavity had modest correlations to whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) cartilage lesion scores but strong correlations with Boston-Leeds osteoarthritis knee score (BLOKS)/MRI osteoarthritis knee score (MOAKS) scores in most compartments (rho between 0.08?0.65, P?<?0.001). Cavity correlated with WOMAC pain for all tibio-femoral compartments in OAI (rho between 0.19?0.25, P?<?0.001) and most compartments in PROOF. Comparing with the GPM estimate, cavity was more precise, more accurate, and correlated stronger with ROA, lesion scores, and pain levels. Conclusion The strong correlations with ROA, radiologist lesion scores, and pain demonstrated that cavity captured OA and lesion features. Thereby, it may be appropriate for quantification of cartilage surface irregularity.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility, low bone mass, and bone deformities. The majority of cases are caused by autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that encode type I collagen, the major component of the bone matrix. The remaining cases are caused by autosomal recessively or dominantly inherited mutations in genes that are involved in the post-translational modification of type I collagen, act as type I collagen chaperones, or are members of the signaling pathways that regulate bone homeostasis. The main goals of treatment in OI are to decrease fracture incidence, relieve bone pain, and promote mobility and growth. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach, utilizing pharmacological interventions, physical therapy, orthopedic surgery, and monitoring nutrition with appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Bisphosphonate therapy, which has become the mainstay of treatment in OI, has proven beneficial in increasing bone mass, and to some extent reducing fracture risk. However, the response to treatment is not as robust as is seen in osteoporosis, and it seems less effective in certain types of OI, and in adult OI patients as compared to most pediatric cases. New pharmacological treatments are currently being developed, including anti-resorptive agents, anabolic treatment, and gene- and cell-therapy approaches. These therapies are under different stages of investigation from the bench-side, to pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this review, we will summarize the recent findings regarding the pharmacological and biological strategies for the treatment of patients with OI. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Robust resilience measurement can improve our understanding of how people and societies respond to climate risk. It also allows for the effectiveness of resilience-building interventions to be tracked over time. To date, the majority of measurement tools use objective methods of evaluation. Broadly speaking, these relate to approaches that solicit little, if any, judgment on behalf of the subject in question. More recently, subjective methods of evaluation have been proposed. These take a contrasting epistemological view, relying on people's self-assessments of their own capacity to deal with climate risk. Subjective methods offer some promise in complementing objective methods, including: factoring in people's own knowledge of resilience and what contributes to it; more nuanced contextualization; and the potential to reduce survey length and fatigue. Yet, considerable confusion exists in understanding subjectivity and objectivity. Little is also known about the merits and limitations of different approaches to measurement. Here, I clarify the conceptual and practical relationships between objective and subjective forms of measuring resilience, aiming to provide practical guidance in distinguishing between them. In reviewing existing toolkits, I propose a subjectivity?objectivity continuum that groups measurement approaches according to two core tenets: (a) how resilience is defined and (b) how resilience is evaluated. I then use the continuum to explore the strengths and weaknesses of different types of toolkits, allowing comparison across each. I also emphasize that there is no one-size fits all approach to resilience measurement. As such, evaluators should carefully consider: their epistemology of resilience; core objectives for measurement; as well as resource and data constraints, before choosing which methods to adopt.

AB  - Abstract We review the history of efforts to apply central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT/DBS) to restore consciousness in patients in a coma or vegetative state by changing the arousal state. Early experimental and clinical studies, and the results of a recent single-subject human study that demonstrated both immediate behavioral facilitation and carry-over effects of CT/DBS are reviewed. We consider possible mechanisms underlying CT/DBS effects on cognitively-mediated behaviors in conscious patients in light of the anatomical connectivity and physiological specializations of the central thalamus. Immediate and carry-over effects of CT/DBS are discussed within the context of possible effects on neuronal plasticity and gene expression. We conclude that CT/DBS should be studied as a therapeutic intervention to improve impaired cognitive function in severely brain-injured patients who, in addition to demonstrating clinical evidence of consciousness and goal-directed behavior, retain sufficient preservation of large-scale cerebral networks within the anterior forebrain. Although available data provide evidence for proof-of-concept, very significant challenges for study design and development of CT/DBS for clinical use are identified.

AB  - The pathophysiology of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) includes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis with resultant renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenting has emerged as the primary revascularization strategy in most patients with hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS. Despite the frequency with which hemodynamically significant RAS is observed and high rates of technical success of renal artery stenting, there remains considerable debate among experts regarding the role of medical therapy versus revascularization for renovascular hypertension. Modern, prospective, multicenter registries continue to demonstrate improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with excellent safety profiles in patients with RAS. Modern randomized, controlled clinical trials of optimal medical therapy versus renal stenting particularly designed to demonstrate preservation in renal function after renal artery stenting have demonstrated limited benefit. However, these trials frequently excluded patients that may benefit from renal artery stenting. This document was developed to guide physicians in the modern practical application of renal stenting, to highlight the current limitations in the peer-reviewed literature, to suggest best-practices in the performance of renal stenting and to identify opportunities to advance the field. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract There is mounting evidence that the quality of organs from cadaver donors may be influenced by events occurring around the time of brain death. Aim of this present study was to analyze the correlation of DGF with brain-dead donor variables in a single-center pediatric population and to evaluate DGF influence on patients- and grafts outcome. End-points of the study were DGF prevalence, DGF donor-related risk factors, graft function, patient- and graft survival rate, respectively, at six, 12, and 24 months FU. The univariate analysis showed that donor age above 15 yr and vascular cause of donor brain death represented risk factors for DGF. The multivariate analysis confirmed as independent risk factors for DGF donor age >15 yr. At six months FU, DGF showed a negative impact on graft function. In conclusion, among all considered brain-dead donor resuscitation parameters, just non-traumatic cause of death turned out to be of impact for DGF. Donor age >15 yr represented the only independent risk factor for prolonged DGF in our series of children. At two-yr FU, DGF showed a transient negative impact on six-month graft function.

AB  - Summary Antibiotics have been proposed as supplements in re-feeding programmes for malnourished children. A review of paediatric literature showed that growth promotion by antibiotics, when it was observed, was mostly mediated by its anti-infective properties. Despite the widespread use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal rearing, the available evidence again points to the suppression of infections as the underlying mechanism. Under controlled hygienic conditions, growth promotion was frequently not observed. Models for ?sub-inhibitory? antibiotic effects on gut bacteria have been proposed, and direct antibiotic effects on host physiology are accumulating. Human gut microbiota analyses in malnourished children (restricted to stool as convenience samples) displayed developmental immaturity of the gut microbiota and growth deficits that were only transiently ameliorated by nutritional interventions. These studies need to be complemented by microbiota analysis in the upper small intestine where bacterial overgrowth, frequently reported in people of the developing world, may directly compete with nutrient absorption by the human host. So far, however, the available medical and veterinary literature suggests that the growth promoting effect of antibiotics mostly works through prevention of infection and a concomitant decrease of the caloric burden of an inflammatory response.

AB  - Summary This European guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia was developed by a task force of the European Sleep Research Society, with the aim of providing clinical recommendations for the management of adult patients with insomnia. The guideline is based on a systematic review of relevant meta-analyses published till June 2016. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians involved in the management of insomnia, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the evidence and guide recommendations. The diagnostic procedure for insomnia, and its co-morbidities, should include a clinical interview consisting of a sleep history (sleep habits, sleep environment, work schedules, circadian factors), the use of sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, questions about somatic and mental health, a physical examination and additional measures if indicated (i.e. blood tests, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram; strong recommendation, moderate- to high-quality evidence). Polysomnography can be used to evaluate other sleep disorders if suspected (i.e. periodic limb movement disorder, sleep-related breathing disorders), in treatment-resistant insomnia, for professional at-risk populations and when substantial sleep state misperception is suspected (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not sufficiently effective or not available. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists and some antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia (≤4 weeks; weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin and phytotherapeutics are not recommended for insomnia treatment (strong to weak recommendations, low- to very-low-quality evidence). Light therapy and exercise need to be further evaluated to judge their usefulness in the treatment of insomnia (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Complementary and alternative treatments (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) are not recommended for insomnia treatment (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

AB  - Summary Sutcliffia insignis was a large stem, probably of considerable height, the surface clothed by spirally arranged leaf-bases of great size relative to the stem. The vascular system of the stem consisted of a single main stele with solid wood (protostele), from which meristeles or subsidiary steles were given off. The meristeles divided up, the branches of adjacent meristeles sometimes fusing with one another, and gave rise to the numerous leaf-trace bundles. The xylem in all parts of the vascular system was exarch, and consisted of tracheides interspersed with xylem-parenchyma. The walls of the larger tracheides bore multi-seriate bordered pits. The formation of secondary wood and bast had begun to a small extent around the stele and some of the meristeles. The phloem of the stele and meristeles consisted of strands of narrow elements (sieve-tubes) embedded in parenchyma. In the bundles of the leaf-bases and petioles numerous large phloem-elements, probably of the nature of sieve-tubes, were present. The pericycle and cortex were traversed by secretory canals. The leaf-bases and detached petioles were of similar structure, the hypoderma having radially arranged sclerotic bands as in Myeloxylon; other sclerotic strands traversed the ground-tissue. The foliar bundles, which were present in great numbers in the petiole, were in all cases of concentric structure.

AB  - Microglia in the central nervous system are usually maintained in a quiescent state. When activated, they can perform many diverse functions which may be either beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. Although microglial activation may be accompanied by changes in morphology, morphological changes cannot accurately predict the function being undertaken by a microglial cell. Studies of peripheral macrophages and in vitro and animal studies of microglia have resulted in the definition of specific activation states: M1 (classical activation) and M2 (sometimes subdivided into alternative activation and acquired deactivation). Some authors have suggested that these might be an overlapping continuum of functions rather than discrete categories. In this review, we consider translational aspects of our knowledge of microglia: specifically, we discuss the question as to what extent different activation states of microglia exist in the human central nervous system, which tools can be used to identify them and emerging evidence for such changes in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - Aims Symptoms of anxiety and depression often co-exist with cardiovascular disease, yet little is known about the prospective risk for heart failure (HF) in people with symptoms of depression and anxiety. We aimed to study these prospective associations using self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and mixed symptoms of anxiety and depression (MSAD) in a large population sample. Methods and results In the second wave of the Nord-Tr?ndelag Health Study (HUNT 2, 1995?1997), Norway, baseline data on symptoms of anxiety and depression, socio-demographic variables, health status including cardiovascular risk factors, and common chronic somatic diseases were registered for 62?567 adults, men and women, free of known HF. The cohort was followed for incident HF from baseline throughout 2008. A total of 1499 cases of HF occurred during a mean follow-up of 11.3?years (SD?=?2.9), identified either in hospital registers or by the National Cause of Death Registry. There was no excess risk for future HF associated with symptoms of anxiety or MSAD at baseline. For depression, the multi-adjusted hazard ratios for HF were 1.07 (0.87?1.30) for moderate symptoms and 1.41 (1.07?1.87) for severe symptoms (P for trend 0.026). Established cardiovascular risk factors, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prior to baseline, and adjustment for incident AMI as a time-dependent covariate during follow-up had little influence on the estimates. Conclusion Symptoms of depression, but not symptoms of anxiety or MSAD, were associated with increased risk for HF in a dose?response manner. The increased risk could not be fully explained by cardiovascular or socio-economic risk factors, or by co-morbid AMI.

AB  - Learning Objectives After completing this course, the reader will be able to: Describe the presentation, differential diagnosis, and prognosis for patients with Ewing's sarcoma. Explain the principles of multidisciplinary management of Ewing's sarcoma. Discuss the late effects of the therapy for Ewing's sarcoma. Access and take the CME test online and receive 1 AMA PRA category 1 credit at CME.TheOncologist.com Ewing's sarcoma is the second most frequent primary bone cancer, with approximately 225 new cases diagnosed each year in patients less than 20 years of age in North America. It is one of the pediatric small round blue cell tumors, characterized by strong membrane expression of CD99 in a chain-mail pattern and negativity for lymphoid (CD45), rhabdomyosarcoma (myogenin, desmin, actin) and neuroblastoma (neurofilament protein) markers. Pathognomonic translocations involving the ews gene on chromosome 22 and an ets-type gene, most commonly the fli1 gene on chromosome 11, are implicated in the great majority of cases. Clinical presentation is usually dominated by local bone pain and a mass. Imaging reveals a technetium pyrophosphate avid lesion that, on plain radiograph, is destructive, diaphyseal and classically causes layered periosteal calcification. Magnetic resonance best defines the extent of the lesion. Biopsy should be undertaken by an experienced orthopedic oncologist. Approximately three quarters of patients have initially localized disease. About two thirds survive disease-free. Management, preferably at a specialist center with a multi-disciplinary team, includes both local control?either surgery, radiation or a combination?and systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy includes cyclic combinations, incorporating vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, ifosfamide and occasionally actinomycin D. Topotecan in combination with cyclophosphamide has shown preliminary activity. Patients with initially metastatic disease fare less well, with about one quarter surviving. Studies incorporating intensive therapy followed by stem cell infusion show no clear benefit. New approaches include anti-angiogenic therapy, particularly since vascular endothelial growth factor is an apparent downstream target of the ews-fli1 oncogene.

AB  - Abstract This article provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of religion on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research at the intersection of these two topics. We delineate religion as a multidimensional construct and propose that religion affects consumer psychology and behavior through four dimensions?beliefs, rituals, values, and community. For each dimension of religion, we offer definitions and measures, integrate previous findings from research in the psychology, consumer behavior, marketing, and religion literatures, and propose testable future research directions. With this conceptual framework and research agenda, we challenge consumer researchers to ask deeper questions about why religious affiliation and level of religiosity may be driving previously established differences in consumer behavior, and to uncover the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects. This framework complements and extends previous literature and provides a new delineated framework for considering research on the effects of religion on consumer behavior.
