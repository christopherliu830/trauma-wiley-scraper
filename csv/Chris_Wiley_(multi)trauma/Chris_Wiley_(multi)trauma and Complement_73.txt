AB  - In this preliminary study, our objective was to investigate the potential of high-resolution anatomical imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and conventional/inhomogeneous magnetization transfer imaging [magnetization transfer (MT)/inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT)] at 3 T, analyzed with template-extracted regions of interest, to measure the atrophy and structural changes of white (WM) and gray (GM) matter spinal cord (SC) occurring in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Ten patients with ALS and 20 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. SC GM and WM areas were automatically segmented using dedicated templates. Atrophy indices were evaluated from T2*-weighted images at each vertebral level from cervical C1 to C6. DTI and ihMT metrics were quantified within the corticospinal tract (CST), posterior sensory tract (PST) and anterior GM (aGM) horns at the C2 and C5 levels. Clinical disabilities of patients with ALS were evaluated using the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale, upper motor neuron (UMN) and Medical Research Council scorings, and correlated with MR metrics. Compared with healthy controls, GM and WM atrophy was observed in patients with ALS, especially at lower cervical levels, where a strong correlation was also observed between GM atrophy and the UMN score (R = ?0.75, p = 0.05 at C6). Interestingly, a significant decrease in ihMT ratio was found in all regions of interest (p < 0.0008), fractional anisotropy (FA) and MT ratios decreased significantly in CST, especially at C5 (p < 0.005), and ?// (axial diffusivity) decreased significantly in CST (p = 0.0004) and PST (p = 0.003) at C2. Strong correlations between MRI metrics and clinical scores were also found (0.47 < |R| < 0.87, p < 0.05). Altogether, these preliminary results suggest that high-resolution anatomical imaging and ihMT imaging, in addition to DTI, are valuable for the characterization of SC tissue impairment in ALS. In this study, in addition to an important SC WM demyelination, we also observed, for the first time in ALS, impairments of cervical aGM.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Navigation is a fundamental and multidimensional cognitive function that individuals rely on to move around the environment. In this study, we investigated the neural basis of human spatial navigation ability. Methods A large cohort of participants (N > 200) was examined on their navigation ability behaviorally and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were then used to explore the corresponding neural basis of spatial navigation. Results The gray matter volume (GMV) of the bilateral parahippocampus (PHG), retrosplenial complex (RSC), entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (HPC), and thalamus (THAL) was correlated with the participants? self-reported navigational ability in general, and their sense of direction in particular. Further fMRI studies showed that the PHG, RSC, and EC selectively responded to visually presented scenes, whereas the HPC and THAL showed no selectivity, suggesting a functional division of labor among these regions in spatial navigation. The resting-state functional connectivity analysis further revealed a hierarchical neural network for navigation constituted by these regions, which can be further categorized into three relatively independent components (i.e., scene recognition component, cognitive map component, and the component of heading direction for locomotion, respectively). Conclusions Our study combined multi-modality imaging data to illustrate that multiple brain regions may work collaboratively to extract, integrate, store, and orientate spatial information to guide navigation behaviors.

AB  - Aim and objectives.? The aim of this review was to address: (1) How is spinal stability assessed? (2) What is the role of bracing/should braces be used? (3) When is it safe to mobilise the patient? (4) What position should the patient be nursed in? Background.? Controversy surrounds the care for patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). There is some evidence to indicate that care for patients with MSCC is based on individual clinician preference rather than evidence-based guidelines which has been shown to cause delays and discrepancies in patient treatment. Design.? A structured literature review to synthesise the available evidence about the management of MSCC. Methods.? The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network), NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and BNI (British Nursing Index). Publications were selected from the past 10?years. The search yielded a total of 1057 hits, 755 abstracts were screened, and 73 articles were retrieved and examined. Thirty-five articles were included. Results.? The findings identified a gap and evidence relating to spinal stability, bracing, patient mobilisation, and positioning is limited and may be inconclusive. It is important for patients with a poor prognosis that their preferences and quality of life are considered. Conclusion.? Currently, the evidence base to underpin care is limited, and further research in this area is necessary for patients and healthcare professionals alike. Relevance to clinical practice.? Patients who suffer from MSCC suffer numerous physical, psychological and social issues. Because of lack of consensus, the current guidelines to inform clinical decision-making of professional staff are of limited benefit.

AB  - Ethical considerations in the treatment of pain in a hospice environment. (Hospice Rozenheuvel, Rozendaal, The Netherlands) Patient Education and Counseling 2000;41:47?53. This article discussed some specific ethical problems encountered in hospice practice. Patient's autonomy with all its advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Ethical considerations with regard to risk taking and the treatment of pain are discussed. The needs of the patients are central to the discussion. Myths regarding opioids and pain therapy goals are addressed, as are approaches to treating intractable pain and dealing with patients who request assisted death. Acceptance of death may result in an active and creative attitude. Conclude that although scientific evidence of the processes taking place is still lacking, the modern hospice may be seen as a complementary, mainstream institution contributing to the development of whole medicine.

AB  - Abstract In Romania?where induced abortions were legally prohibited during communism and are now morally condemned by many?those who lose a pregnancy against their will have long been regarded with suspicion, confronted with a sense of culpability, and surrounded by silence. This ambiguity is reflected in the local terminology and the perceived etiology of loss. In this article, which is based on 15 months of fieldwork between 2012 and 2015, I illustrate the various meanings and manifestations of a silenced sense of culpability around involuntary pregnancy loss in the lives of women from Bucharest and a small town in Central Romania. I also show how many of these women attempt to break the silence around their lost fetuses and carve out a personal space of commemoration and consolation. Their informal use of forbidden religious rituals paradoxically allows them to confirm the existence of their lost little ones and to position themselves as caring, rather than culpable, mothers.

AB  - Abstract Self-harm is a major challenge to public health. Emergency department (ED) nurses treat significant proportions of patients with self-harm injuries, and positive therapeutic patient?nurse interactions are imperative to the physical and psychological outcome of this vulnerable patient group. Research, both nationally and internationally, suggests that treating those with self-harm injuries is emotionally challenging, and ambivalence, powerlessness, and ineffectiveness are commonly manifested in negative attitudes towards these patients. Following the PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review with meta-analyses examined the attitudes of ED nurses towards patients who self-harm, based on currently available evidence. The following databases were searched: CINAHL complete; Medline complete; PsycARTICLES; PsycINFO; The Allied and Complementary Medicine Database; Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition; PsycEXTRA; and Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection. Clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant reports to identify additional studies, were also searched. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The Self-Harm Antipathy Scale (SHAS) was used as an outcome in two studies appropriate for meta-analysis. The Attitudes Towards Deliberate Self-Harm Questionnaire (ADSHQ) scale was used as an outcome in three studies appropriate for meta-analysis. Results demonstrated limited empathy and negativity towards patients who self-harm, indicating a requirement for education and supervision of ED staff, where the SHAS or the ADSHQ can be used to monitor attitude change. Self-harm educational content for ED staff should include areas of knowledge building including explanations and causes of self-harm; range, forms, and functions of self-harm; staff responses to self-harm; assessment, management, and interventions; professional practice issues.

AB  - Abstract The present study was designed to provide an appropriate micro-environment for regenerating axotomized neurons and proliferating/migrating cells. Because of its intrinsic permissive properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability, we chose to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of a chitosan-based biopolymer. The biomaterial toxicity was measured through in vitro test based on fibroblast cell survival on thermogelling chitosan lactate hydrogel substrate and then polymer was implanted into a C2 hemisection of the rat spinal cord. Animals were randomized into three experimental groups (Control, Lesion and Lesion?+?Hydrogel) and functional tests (ladder walking and forelimb grip strength tests, respiratory assessment by whole-body plethysmography measurements) were used, once a week during 10 weeks, to evaluate post-traumatic recoveries. Then, electrophysiological examinations (reflexivity of the sub-lesional region, ventilatory adjustments to muscle fatigue known to elicit the muscle metaboreflex and phrenic nerve recordings during normoxia and temporary hypoxia) were performed. In vitro results indicated that the chitosan matrix is a non-toxic biomaterial that allowed fibroblast survival. Furthermore, implanted animals showed improvements of their ladder walking scores from the 4th week post-implantation. Finally, electrophysiological recordings indicated that animals receiving the chitosan matrix exhibited recovery of the H-reflex rate sensitive depression, the ventilatory response to repetitive muscle stimulation and an increase of the phrenic nerve activity to asphyxia compared to lesioned and nonimplanted animals. This study indicates that hydrogel based on chitosan constitute a promising therapeutic approach to repair damaged spinal cord or may be used as an adjuvant with other treatments to enhance functional recovery after a central nervous system damage. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Aims and objectives This study seeks to identify the factors that shape the communication networks of men who face a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer, and how these factors relate to their disclosure about their changing health status. Background Men facing a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer are in a challenging situation; the support benefits of disclosing their changing health status to others in their communication networks is set against a backdrop of the potential stigma and uncertainty of the diagnosis. Design All men on a prostate biopsy waiting list were eligible for inclusion in an exploratory and interpretive study. Methods Semi-structured interviews with 40 men explored their network structures and disclosure of health information. Thematic analysis highlighted the factors which contributed to their network structures and their disclosure about their health status. Results Four network factors shaped men's perspectives about disclosing their health status: (1) tie strength, comprising both strong and weak ties; (2) knowledgeable others, with a focus on medical professionals in the family; (3) homophily, which included other individuals with a similar medical condition; and (4) geographical proximity, with a preference for face-to-face communication. Conclusion Communication networks influence men's disclosure of their health status and in particular weak ties with medical knowledge have an important role. Men who use the potential for support in their networks may experience improved psychosocial outcomes. Relevance to clinical practice Using these four network factors-tie strength, knowledgeable others, homophily or geographical proximity-to forecast men's willingness to disclose helps identify men who lack potential support and so are at risk of poor psychosocial health. Those with few strong ties or knowledgeable others in their networks may be in the at-risk cohort. The support provided in communication networks complements formal medical care from nurses and other health professionals, and encouraging patients to use their communication networks improves the psychosocial health of the men themselves, their partners and their families.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim? To test whether addition of moderation-orientated cue exposure (CE) or CE after dysphoric mood induction (emotional CE, ECE) improved outcomes above those from cognitive-behaviour therapy alone (CBT) in people who drank when dysphoric. Design? Multi-site randomized controlled trial comparing CBT with CBT?+?CE and CBT?+?ECE. Setting? Out-patient rooms in academic treatment units in Brisbane and Sydney, Australia. Participants? People with alcohol misuse and problems controlling consumption when dysphoric (n?=?163). Those with current major depressive episode were excluded. Intervention? Eight weekly 75-minute sessions of individual treatment for alcohol problems were given to all participants, with CBT elements held constant across conditions. From session 2, CBT?+?CE participants resisted drinking while exposed to alcohol cues, with two priming doses of their preferred beverage being given in some sessions. After an initial CE session, CBT?+?ECE participants recalled negative experiences before undertaking CE, to provide exposure to emotional cues of personal relevance. Measurements? Alcohol consumption, related problems, alcohol expectancies, self-efficacy and depression. Results? Average improvements were highly significant across conditions, with acceptable maintenance of effects over 12?months. Both treatment retention and effects on alcohol consumption were progressively weaker in CBT?+?CE and CBT?+?ECE than in CBT alone. Changes in alcohol dependence and depression did not differ across conditions. Conclusions? These data do not indicate that addition of clinic-based CE to standard CBT improves outcomes. A different approach to the management of craving may be required.

AB  - Abstract In this chapter, we review the developmental science of ?Children and the Law? and our understanding of the diverse and broad array of cognitive, social, and emotional factors that developmental scientists have studied. To allow children to participate as fully as their abilities allow in legal decisions affecting their lives, it is important to understand their capabilities and strengths, as well as their cognitive and social limitations. We review the developmental science that provides an appropriate evidence base to thus improve decision-making and outcomes for children and families within many aspects of the legal system. Since the previous edition was published in 2006, research has become increasingly ?convincing? to nonpsychologists because basic laboratory research has been complemented by methods that have clear ecological validity, yielding findings that are better understood, accepted, and applied in legal contexts. This knowledge thus permits scholars to offer useful suggestions to practitioners and foster a more complete understanding of developmental processes. We first review the developmental trajectories in the principal domains of development known or likely to affect children in legal contexts?neurophysiological development, memory and suggestibility, cognitive development, language development, social and emotional development, and the development of social relationships with parents and peers. Secondly, we turn attention to the implications of normative developmental processes for children in a variety of legal contexts?investigative interviews with alleged victims, witnesses, and suspects, as well as for those children who are the focus of actions in family and dependency court. The chapter ends with an examination of the key questions to which researchers should turn their attention to further our understanding and practices concerning children and the law.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to develop the Teen Oral Health-Related Quality of Life instrument (TOQOL) and demonstrate its validity and reliability in a diverse sample of 13?18-year-old adolescents. Methods A total of 363 adolescents aged 13?18 years participated in this cross sectional study. Oral screening examinations were conducted to collect oral health status data. Adolescents completed the TOQOL and a generic measure of health-related quality of life, the PedsQL. The psychometric properties of the TOQOL were evaluated in terms of face, content, convergent, concurrent and discriminant validity in addition to internal reliability. Results The 16-item TOQOL covers five domains: Physical functioning, Role functioning, Social functioning, Oral problems, and Emotional functioning. The total scale and subscales showed satisfactory reliability with Cronbach alpha ranging from 0.75 to 0.92. TOQOL scores showed significant associations with perceived oral health status and the PedsQL (convergent validity) and discriminated well between adolescents with caries and adolescents who were caries free (discriminate validity). Conclusion The TOQOL is a valid and reliable oral health-related quality of life measurement that can be recommended for self-report in adolescents aged 13-18 years.

AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.

AB  - Abstract Background: Neuropsychological deficits are a core feature of established psychosis and have been previously linked to fronto-temporo-limbic brain alterations. Both neurocognitive and neuroanatomical abnormalities characterize clinical at-risk mental states (ARMS) for psychosis. However, structure?cognition relationships in the ARMS have not been directly explored using multivariate neuroimaging techniques. Methods: Voxel-based morphometry and partial least squares were employed to study system-level covariance patterns between whole-brain morphological data and processing speed, working memory, verbal learning/IQ, and executive functions in 40 ARMS subjects and 30 healthy controls (HC). The detected structure?cognition covariance patterns were tested for significance and reliability using non-parametric permutation and bootstrap resampling. Results: We identified ARMS-specific covariance patterns that described a generalized association of neurocognitive measures with predominantly prefronto-temporo-limbic and subcortical structures as well as the interconnecting white matter. In the conversion group, this generalized profile particularly involved working memory and verbal IQ and was positively correlated with limbic, insular and subcortical volumes as well as negatively related to prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Conversely, the neurocognitive profiles in the HC group were confined to working memory, learning and IQ, which were diffusely associated with cortical and subcortical brain regions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the ARMS and prodromal phase of psychosis are characterized by a convergent mapping from multi-domain neurocognitive measures to a set of prefronto-temporo-limbic and subcortical structures. Furthermore, a neuroanatomical separation between positive and negative brain?cognition correlations may not only point to a biological process determining the clinical risk for disease transition, but also to possible compensatory or dysmaturational neural processes.

AB  - Abstract Clinical diagnosis of autoinflammatory diseases requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and clinching molecular evidence to substantiate the diagnosis. This is more so in populations with low prevalence of these disorders. In this report, we describe the case of a young man from India with recurrent fever and persistent arthritis. The patient's forefathers were of Egyptian ancestry who practiced consanguinity. Molecular genetic analysis using whole-exome sequencing suggested the presence of variants c.443A>T:p.E148V and c.442G>C:p.E148Q in the MEFV gene, earlier independently shown to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in a compound heterozygous state. The variants were further confirmed by capillary sequencing. This report also highlights the application of whole exome sequencing to delineate the allelic differences in the variants apart from serving as a quick genetic screening approach for autoinflammatory diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a compound heterozygosity for the two well-characterized variants associated with atypical FMF in a patient.

AB  - Radiotherapy has been widely used for the clinical management of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, radioresistance remains a serious concern that prevents the efficacy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) radiotherapy. REV7, the structural subunit of eukaryotic DNA polymerase ?, has multiple functions in bypassing DNA damage and modulating mitotic arrest in human cell lines. However, the expression and molecular function of REV7 in ESCC progression remains unclear. In this study, we first examined the expression of REV7 in clinical ESCC samples, and we found higher expression of REV7 in ESCC tissues compared to matched adjacent or normal tissues. Knockdown of REV7 resulted in decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis in irradiated Eca-109 and TE-1 cells coupled with decreased tumor weight in a xenograft nude mouse model postirradiation. Conversely, overexpression of REV7 resulted in radioresistance in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, silencing of REV7 induced increased reactive oxygen species levels postirradiation. Proteomic analysis of REV7-interacting proteins revealed that REV7 interacted with peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), a well-known antioxidant protein. Existence of REV7-PRDX2 complex and its augmentation postirradiation were further validated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. REV7 knockdown significantly disrupted the presence of nuclear PRDX2 postirradiation, which resulted in oxidative stress. REV7-PRDX2 complex also assembled onto DNA double-strand breaks, whereas REV7 knockdown evidently increased double-strand breaks that were unmerged by PRDX2. Taken together, the present study sheds light on REV7-modulated radiosensitivity through interacting with PRDX2, which provides a novel target for ESCC radiotherapy.
