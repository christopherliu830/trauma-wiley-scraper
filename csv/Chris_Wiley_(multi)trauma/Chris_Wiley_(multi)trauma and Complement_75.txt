AB  - Morphological units in the Araceae are discussed and defined. The fundamental unit is the segment (an internode and its leaf or leaves), of which there are two basic types, the monopodial segment and the branching segment. Segments are assembled into chains to form articles (also called axes), which terminate in inflorescences, and are the product of the activity of a single apical meristem. Successive articles are assembled into chains which are physiognomically unbranched shoots. Shoot organization in the Araceae is discriminated into types on the basis of five characteristics: whether the shoot is renewed after flowering, whether renewal axes are proleptic or sylleptic, whether renewal axes develop from an axillary position, whether renewal axes have a variable or a constant number of leaves, and the number of leaves on renewal axes with a constant leaf number. The types of growth are described, illustrated, and organized into a hierarchical scheme, and a terminology is provided. A list of species representing each of the types is given.

AB  - Abstract Deciphering the human brain pathophysiology remains one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Neurological disorders represent a significant proportion of diseases burden; however, the complexity of the brain physiology makes it challenging to model its diseases. Simple in vitro models have been very useful for precise measurements in controled conditions. However, existing models are limited in their ability to replicate complex interactions between various cells in the brain. Studying human brain requires sophisticated models to reconstitute the tangled architecture and functions of brain cells. Recently, advances in the development of three-dimensional (3D) brain cell culture models have begun to recapitulate various aspects of the human brain physiology in vitro and replicate basic disease processes of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and microcephaly. In this review, we discuss the progress, advantages, limitations, and future directions of 3D cell culture systems for modeling the human brain development and diseases.

AB  - Catherine Hoffmann's Free Lunch with the Stench Wench is a performance of abjection and self-abjection through poverty with an apotropaic aspiration: to shed the shame through sharing, and to create opportunities for a common social subjectivity that refuses to be silent about the struggle of its own creation and maintenance. Despite its title, Free Lunch does not come with a free lunch for the audience but creates an olfactory situation, through the onstage cooking of hot chocolate and the presence of a dead rat, which complements Hoffmann's narration and stage presence into a synaesthetic portrait of poverty and its psychosocial fallout. Drawing on the psychological foundations of shame studies, sociological approaches and social-theoretical responses to austerity and social division, I propose to examine the gendered embodiment of shame and its exorcism in Hoffmann's performance, focusing on its physical codification in and beyond the visual. I explore the potential of shame to be re-weaponized against those who originally inflict it, and consider the shame that haunts every creative act, especially those with high political stakes: the failure to make a connection, the fear of being misunderstood.

AB  - SUMMARY Restrictive blood transfusion practice has modified the indications for blood transfusion. There is still a need for succinct definition of transfusion thresholds in different situations, based on physiological argument balancing the mechanisms by which blood is potentially beneficial against the deleterious effects of transfusion, whether known, speculative or unknown. The latter still need identification. The key physiological benefit is through oxygen delivery and thereby the provision of a margin of safety in tissue oxygenation. This can be achieved by a range of methods that safeguard blood volume, conserve blood or increase hemoglobin as well as by transfusion, and in many situations conservation methods can or could now preclude transfusion. There are still acute and less controlled or controllable situations where conservation methods are difficult to implement or may need to be complemented by transfusion. These are the indications that still need clarification. Difficult and confusing areas of practice include the management of patients with ischemic heart disease. This is a potential driver for transfusion to prevent ischemia, but clarity of efficacy or detriment is elusive beyond acknowledging that both too high and too low hemoglobin values are detrimental. The issue in all clinical situations, whether acute or chronic, is to continue to reevaluate the safety of current thresholds. This will help limit blood usage and ensure that blood is used when necessary but not otherwise.

AB  - Summary Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a versatile human pathogen causing diseases ranging from uncomplicated mucosal infections to life-threatening invasive disease. The development of human-relevant animal models of GAS infection and introduction of new technologies have markedly accelerated the pace of discoveries related to GAS host?pathogen interactions. For example, recently investigators have identified pili on the GAS cell surface and learned that they are key components for adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. Similarly, the recent development of a transgenic mouse expressing human plasminogen has resulted in new understanding of the molecular processes contributing to invasive infection. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GAS pharyngeal, invasive and other infections holds the promise of assisting with the development of novel preventive or therapeutic agents for this prevalent human pathogen.

AB  - Land inequality is one of the crucial underpinnings of long-run persistent wealth and asset inequality. This article assesses the colonial roots of land inequality from a comparative perspective. The evolution of land inequality is analysed in a cross-colonial multivariate regression framework complemented by an in-depth comparative case study of three former British colonies: Malaysia, Sierra Leone, and Zambia. The main conclusion is that the literature tends to overemphasize the role of geography and to underestimate the role of pre-colonial institutions in shaping the colonial political economic context in which land is (re)distributed from natives to colonial settlers.

AB  - Key points The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is a swelling-activated chloride channel that is permeable to inorganic anions and a variety of small organic molecules. VRAC is formed via heteromerization of LRRC8 proteins, among which LRRC8A is essential, while LRRC8B/C/D/E serve as exchangeable complementary partners. We used an RNAi approach and radiotracer assays to explore which LRRC8 isoforms contribute to swelling-activated release of diverse organic osmolytes in rat astrocytes. Efflux of uncharged osmolytes (myo-inositol and taurine) was suppressed by deletion of LRRC8A or LRRC8D, but not by deletion of LRRC8C+LRRC8E. Conversely, release of charged osmolytes (d-aspartate) was strongly reduced by deletion of LRRC8A or LRRC8C+LRRC8E, but largely unaffected by downregulation of LRRC8D. Our findings point to the existence of multiple heteromeric VRACs in the same cell type: LRRC8A/D-containing heteromers appear to dominate release of uncharged osmolytes, while LRRC8A/C/E, with the additional contribution of LRRC8D, creates a conduit for movement of charged molecules. Abstract The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is the ubiquitously expressed vertebrate Cl?/anion channel that is composed of proteins belonging to the LRRC8 family and activated by cell swelling. In the brain, VRAC contributes to physiological and pathological release of a variety of small organic molecules, including the amino acid neurotransmitters glutamate, aspartate and taurine. In the present work, we explored the role of all five LRRC8 family members in the release of organic osmolytes from primary rat astrocytes. Expression of LRRC8 proteins was modified using an RNAi approach, and amino acid fluxes via VRAC were quantified by radiotracer assays in cells challenged with hypoosmotic medium (30% reduction in osmolarity). Consistent with our prior work, knockdown of LRRC8A potently and equally suppressed the release of radiolabelled d-[14C]aspartate and [3H]taurine. Among other LRRC8 subunits, downregulation of LRRC8D strongly inhibited release of the uncharged osmolytes [3H]taurine and myo-[3H]inositol, without major impact on the simultaneously measured efflux of the charged d-[14C]aspartate. In contrast, the release of d-[14C]aspartate was preferentially sensitive to deletion of LRRC8C+LRRC8E, but unaffected by downregulation of LRRC8D. Finally, siRNA knockdown of LRRC8C+LRRC8D strongly inhibited the release of all osmolytes. Overall, our findings suggest the existence of at least two distinct heteromeric VRACs in astroglial cells. The LRRC8A/D-containing permeability pathway appears to dominate the release of uncharged osmolytes, while an alternative channel (or channels) is composed of LRRC8A/C/D/E and responsible for the loss of charged molecules.

AB  - Abstract The reproductive ecology of Mohave rattlesnakes Crotalus scutulatus was investigated in the western Mohave Desert using radiotelemetry from August 2001 to November 2004. This paper documents reproductive behavior across successive seasons in the context of seasonal timing, mean daily movement, home range, body temperature and relationship with abiotic factors such as time of day, temperature, precipitation, photoperiod and microhabitat. This population of C. scutulatus used a bimodal mating system, with reproductive behavior occurring in late summer/fall (21 August to 7 October), interrupted by 4?months of cold weather, and concluding in the spring (16 March to 16 May). Drought apparently curtailed courtship and copulation during the 2002 activity season, but the pregnancy rates in 2002 and 2003 were not significantly affected. Communal denning was not detected and there was no indication of seasonal migration. Autumnal and vernal movements appeared to be driven by reproductive effort, predominantly males engaged in prolonged mate searching. Sexual maturity was achieved at 2.0?years/600?mm snout?vent length (SVL) for females, and 1.5?years/400?mm SVL for males.

First, the chapter analyzes the producer?consumer interface on the web in terms of the shifting relationship between media companies, creators, and internet users. The author frames these practices within the Spanish context with an analysis of the polemical ?Sinde Law? and the competing discourses in regard to piracy, copyright laws, and media policies surrounding it. Second, the author studies the centrality of appropriation and authorship in Almodóvar's early public persona through an analysis of his appearance on a Spanish 1980s television show. The author relates the recurrent exploration of fandom and artist?fan relations in his films with the ways in which Almodóvar disseminates his authorial voice on the web and deals with amateur reinventions of his works.

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to inhibit the expression of specific genes in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing an extremely useful tool for investigating gene function. Progress in the understanding of RNAi-based mechanisms has opened up new perspectives in therapeutics for the treatment of several diseases including ocular disorders. The eye is currently considered a good target for RNAi therapy mainly because it is a confined compartment and, therefore, enables local delivery of small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by topical instillation or direct injection. However, delivery strategies that protect the siRNAs from degradation and are suitable for long-term treatment would be help to improve the efficacy of RNAi-based therapies for ocular pathologies. siRNAs targeting critical molecules involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa and neovascular eye diseases (age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and corneal neovascularization) have been tested in experimental animal models, and clinical trials have been conducted with some of them. This review provides an update on the progress of RNAi in ocular therapeutics, discussing the advantages and drawbacks of RNAi-based therapeutics compared to previous treatments.

AB  - So far, it was generally accepted that newly formed blood vessels are exclusively comprised of endothelial cells, and complemented by pericyte and myocyte recruitment during vessel maturation. Accordingly, participation of non-endothelial cells in the formation of blood vessels has rarely been suggested. Recently, evidence supporting the existence of tumour vessels lined by non-endothelial cells has emerged. Consequently, the concept of the inherent capacity of non-endothelial cells to behave like endothelial cells has been discussed for tumours, and this pathomechanism has been termed vascular mimicry. The corpus luteum is one of the most intensely vascularized tissues, and angiogenesis in the corpus luteum is more effective than in highly malignant tumours. Our results indicate active involvement of granulosa cells in luteal angiogenesis, and the aim of this study was to shed more light on this exciting prospect. The study was based on cultured granulosa cells isolated from the bovine ovary in different stages of follicle maturation. Morphology of angiogenic granulosa cells was studied by phase contrast, transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy. Expression of angiogenesis-regulating factors and their receptors was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cultured granulosa cells underwent changes reminiscent of endothelial angiogenesis, i.e., migration, proliferation, differentiation and three-dimensional organization, and expressed angiogenesis-regulating factors and their receptors. Our results suggest a tight regulatory and structural association of endothelial and granulosa cells in luteal angiogenesis, suggesting physiological vascular mimicry in the ovary.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? Using cross-sectional national survey data, we assessed young peoples' beliefs about the role of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders as well as the predictors of these beliefs. We also compared these findings with those from a similar survey carried out in 2006. Design, setting and participants ? Between January and May 2011, a national computer-assisted telephone survey was conducted on a representative sample of Australian youths aged 15?25 years. A total of 3021 young people were presented with a case vignette portraying depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, psychosis, social phobia, depression with alcohol misuse or post-traumatic stress disorder in a young person. Measurements? Respondents were asked about their beliefs regarding the role of using alcohol, tobacco and marijuana in preventing or dealing with the mental disorders described in the vignettes. Level of psychological distress was assessed by the Kessler 6 scale (K6). Findings? More than 75% of respondents agreed that the three substances were harmful for the young people in the vignettes, and that not using marijuana or drinking alcohol in excess is preventive. Males, young adults and more distressed respondents were less likely to endorse these beliefs. No significant changes were observed between surveys. Conclusions? Most young people in Australia are aware of the negative impact of substance use on mental disorders, but a few high-risk groups remain: males, young adults and those with more psychological distress. Future public health campaigns need to target these groups and focus on translating young people's substance use beliefs into behavioural change.
