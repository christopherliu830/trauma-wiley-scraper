AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on personality disorder (PD) and its relationship with offending behaviour in adults who have intellectual disabilities. Extensive work has examined the diagnostic criteria for PDs in people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and for the most part little modification in criteria are recommended especially for the two most frequent PD's found in offenders who have IDD, borderline, and antisocial PD. People who have PDs frequently present with co-morbid mental health difficulties such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Pharmacological interventions for co-morbid mental disorders, in particular depression and anxiety, should be in line with recommendations in the relevant NICE clinical guideline. Treatment options for people with IDD and PD who offend can only be based on the developing research on interventions with people who have PD in the general population, offenders with PD in the general population.

AB  - The patient?s thoughts and feelings about their transfer from intensive care to the general ward This qualitative, phenomenological study was undertaken to find out how patients felt about being transferred from the intensive care unit to the ward. The six patients who took part in the study, had been in intensive care for more than 4 days. Their transfer was planned as part of their recovery from a critical illness. Following transfer to the ward, the patients were interviewed using a semi-structured approach. The interviews were audio-taped, and transcriptions from the tapes were analysed for meaning and interpretation. Findings supported the literature that was reviewed, in that transfer from intensive care to the ward was a traumatic experience for the patient, who often found it confusing, stressful and tiring. Improvements to the transfer process can be guided using the information from the literature review and findings of the study.

AB  - Abstract The blood?brain barrier (BBB) is an important physiologic barrier that separates CNS from soluble inflammatory mediators and effector immune cells from peripheral circulation. The optimum function of the BBB is necessary for the homeostasis, maintenance, and proper neuronal function. The clinical and experimental findings have shown that BBB dysfunction is an early hallmark of various neurologic disorders ranging from inflammatory autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and traumatic diseases to neuroinvasive infections. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the regulation of BBB function under homeostatic and neuroinflammatory conditions. Several neurologic disease-modifying drugs have shown to improve the BBB function. However, they have a broad-acting immunomodulatory function and can increase the risk of life-threatening infections. The recent development of in vitro multicomponent 3-dimensional BBB models coupled with fluidics chamber as well as a cell-type specific reporter and knockout mice gave a new boost to our understanding of the dynamics of the BBB. In the review, we discuss the current understanding of BBB composition and recent findings that illustrate the critical regulatory elements of the BBB function under physiologic and inflammatory conditions, and also suggested the strategies to control BBB structure and function.

AB  - Abstract Needs assessment in the wake of disasters is most significant yet highly complex and challenging. Kessler et al. propose a comprehensive disaster mental health research model. This model has several significant advantages: (1) Pre-prepared plans and resources allow rapid deployment of skilled professionals; (2) Continuity will ensure that lessons learned from one disaster will be retained and used in subsequent disasters; (3) Standardization will provide a solid basis for evaluation and comparison across events; (4) Continuous monitoring of needs over time will enable the capture of a full range of responses including delayed effects; and (5) Will provide a valuable resource for researchers in the field. At the same time, there are a number of challenges that must be considered before the establishment and implementation of the proposed center and use of standardized measures. These challenges are associated with the observation that different disasters give rise to different problems and needs; there is considerable cultural variability; and differential power and agenda of stakeholders may result in a limiting ?tunnel vision? approach that may undermine new developments, creativity, and progress. Ways to overcome these challenges and difficulties that are involved in the implementation of such a model are suggested. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective? The aim of this study was to identify key domains of cultural competence from the perspective of ethnically and linguistically diverse patients. Design? The study involved one-time focus groups in community settings with 61 African?Americans, 45 Latinos and 55 non-Latino Whites. Participants? mean age was 48?years, 45% were women, and 47% had less than a high school education. Participants in 19 groups were asked the meaning of ?culture? and what cultural factors influenced the quality of their medical encounters. Each text unit (TU or identifiable continuous verbal utterance) of focus group transcripts was content analysed to identify key dimensions using inductive and deductive methods. The proportion of TUs was calculated for each dimension by ethnic group. Results? Definitions of culture common to all three ethnic groups included value systems (25% of TUs), customs (17%), self-identified ethnicity (15%), nationality (11%) and stereotypes (4%). Factors influencing the quality of medical encounters common to all ethnic groups included sensitivity to complementary/alternative medicine (17%), health insurance-based discrimination (12%), social class-based discrimination (9%), ethnic concordance of physician and patient (8%), and age-based discrimination (4%). Physicians? acceptance of the role of spirtuality (2%) and of family (2%), and ethnicity-based discrimination (11%) were cultural factors specific to non-Whites. Language issues (21%) and immigration status (5%) were Latino-specific factors. Conclusions? Providing quality health care to ethnically diverse patients requires cultural flexibility to elicit and respond to cultural factors in medical encounters. Interventions to reduce disparities in health and health care in the USA need to address cultural factors that affect the quality of medical encounters.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate whether simulated learning programs can be expanded to include aspects of clinical education in medical radiation science (MRS) curricula. Methods: Information about the use and perceptions of simulation in MRS education was collected from academic, clinical and accrediting stakeholders using semi-structured telephone interviews, an online survey, invited comment and face to face consultative meetings. Participants represented the MRS sub-disciplines: Diagnostic Radiography, Radiation Therapy, Nuclear Medicine and Medical Sonography. The following themes were explored with regard to simulation programs: existing, potential expansion of, effectiveness of and implementation. Results: Currently, simulation is widely implemented across Australia to deliver MRS curricula. Areas for potential expansion include: authentic replication of the clinical environment with facilities for video recording, flexible multipurpose space, video demonstrations, online computer assisted tutorials, interactive programs, authentic scenarios using role play or live actors, virtual reality environments and comprehensive digital imaging libraries. The literature revealed no firm evidence that simulation training was more effective than clinical training. Participants in our project viewed simulation as complementary to clinical placement, but not as a replacement for the complexity of situations that clinical placement presents. Stakeholders cautioned for careful curriculum planning and evaluation when implementing simulation in MRS education. Conclusion: This consultative process provided a comprehensive summary of the current use of simulation in MRS and the potential for expansion with examples from the sub-disciplines. There is a need for further research to investigate the effectiveness of simulation in clinical skills development.

AB  - Abstract The term ?catastrophic? antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is defined as an accelerated form of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) usually resulting in multiorgan failure. These patients have in common: (i) clinical evidence of multiple organ involvement developing in a very short time period; (ii) histopathological evidence of multiple small vessel occlusions (a minority also have large vessel thrombosis); and (iii) laboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), usually in high titres. Although less than 1% of patients with the APS develop this complication, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine.

AB  - Abstract Several attempts have been made to engineer a viable three-dimensional (3D) bone tissue equivalent using conventional tissue engineering strategies, but with limited clinical success. Using 3D bioprinting technology, scientists have developed functional prototypes of clinically relevant and mechanically robust bone with a functional bone marrow. Although the field is in its infancy, it has shown immense potential in the field of bone tissue engineering by re-establishing the 3D dynamic micro-environment of the native bone. Inspite of their in vitro success, maintaining the viability and differentiation potential of such cell-laden constructs overtime, and their subsequent preclinical testing in terms of stability, mechanical loading, immune responses, and osseointegrative potential still needs to be explored. Progress is slow due to several challenges such as but not limited to the choice of ink used for cell encapsulation, optimal cell source, bioprinting method suitable for replicating the heterogeneous tissues and organs, and so on. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in bioprinting of bone, their limitations, challenges, and strategies for future improvisations. The generated knowledge will provide deep insights on our current understanding of the cellular interactions with the hydrogel matrices and help to unravel new methodologies for facilitating precisely regulated stem cell behaviour.

AB  - Abstract NMR spectroscopy of biofluids provides a wealth of information on the endogenous metabolic processes in an organism. Details of the various types of biofluid and the types of NMR experiment which are useful are given. The features of biofluid NMR spectra are described and practical details of spectral acquisition are also presented. However, the spectra are very complex and many resonances have not been assigned. Therefore, in order to focus on significant differences between a set of spectra from control organisms and from abnormals (e.g., humans with diseases or animals in toxic situations), recourse is made to pattern recognition or chemometric methods. This is exemplifed using NMR spectra of a number of different biofluids such as urine, blood plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid. This approach is encapsulated in the concept of metabonomics, a subject which can be regarded as complementary to studies of the genome (genomics) and the proteins in an organism (proteomics). Metabonomics is defined as ?the quantitative measurement of the multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification.??? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.?Concepts Magn Reson 12: 289?320, 2000

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the differences between a co-produced experimental mental health centre and traditional day centres. For this purpose, we used a collaborative and mixed-method approach in two complementary studies: (i) a quantitative cross-sectional study designed to compare users' hospitalization rates and their use of psychiatric medications and (ii) a qualitative study designed to explore and document the experienced differences between co-produced and traditional services. In the quantitative cross-sectional study, surveys were administered to 37 users of one co-produced mental health service and to 40 users of traditional mental health services. A negative binomial regression analysis was performed to examine the relationships between predictors and users' hospitalization rates. After adjusting for the potential confounders, users of the co-produced centre reported a 63.2% reduced rate of hospitalizations compared with users of traditional mental health services (P = 0.002). Furthermore, 39% of users of the co-produced centre reported a reduction or even withdrawal from psychiatric medications against 22% of the comparison group (P = 0.036). In the qualitative study, six main differences emerged from a thematic analysis of a large user-led focus group. In the participants' experiences, the co-produced service focused on (i) parity and respectful relationships, (ii) people's strengths, (iii) freedom, (iv) psychological continuity, (v) social inclusion, and (vi) recovery orientation. Our research provides empirical evidence concerning the ?preventive aspect? of co-produced mental health services. Additionally, new insights into how different stakeholders, particularly users of co-produced mental health services, experience the differences between co-produced and traditional mental health services are provided.

AB  - ABSTRACT Considerable advances have been made toward understanding the molecular signaling events that underlie memory acquisition and consolidation. In contrast, less is known about memory retrieval, despite its necessity for utilizing learned information. This review focuses on neuromodulatory and intracellular signaling events that underlie memory retrieval mediated by the hippocampus, for which the most information is currently available. Among neuromodulators, adrenergic signaling is required for the retrieval of various types of hippocampus-dependent memory. Although they contribute to acquisition and/or consolidation, cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling are generally not required for retrieval. Interestingly, while not required for retrieval, serotonergic and opioid signaling may actually constrain memory retrieval. Roles for histamine and non-opioid neuropeptides are currently unclear but possible. A critical effector of adrenergic signaling in retrieval is reduction of the slow afterhyperpolarization mediated by ?1 receptors, cyclic AMP, protein kinase A, Epac, and possibly ERK. In contrast, stress and glucocorticoids impair retrieval by decreasing cyclic AMP, mediated in part by the activation of ?2-adrenergic receptors. Clinically, alterations in neuromodulatory signaling and in memory retrieval occur in Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and recent evidence has begun to link changes in neuromodulatory signaling with effects on memory retrieval. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Probe techniques for monitoring in vivo chemistry (e.g., electrochemical sensors and microdialysis sampling probes) have significantly contributed to a better understanding of neurotransmission in correlation to behaviors and neurological disorders. Microfabrication allows construction of neural probes with high reproducibility, scalability, design flexibility, and multiplexed features. This technology has translated well into fabricating miniaturized neurochemical probes for electrochemical detection and sampling. Microfabricated electrochemical probes provide a better control of spatial resolution with multisite detection on a single compact platform. This development allows the observation of heterogeneity of neurochemical activity precisely within the brain region. Microfabricated sampling probes are starting to emerge that enable chemical measurements at high spatial resolution and potential for reducing tissue damage. Recent advancement in analytical methods also facilitates neurochemical monitoring at high temporal resolution. Furthermore, a positive feature of microfabricated probes is that they can be feasibly built with other sensing and stimulating platforms including optogenetics. Such integrated probes will empower researchers to precisely elucidate brain function and develop novel treatments for neurological disorders.
