AB  - ABSTRACT Considerable advances have been made toward understanding the molecular signaling events that underlie memory acquisition and consolidation. In contrast, less is known about memory retrieval, despite its necessity for utilizing learned information. This review focuses on neuromodulatory and intracellular signaling events that underlie memory retrieval mediated by the hippocampus, for which the most information is currently available. Among neuromodulators, adrenergic signaling is required for the retrieval of various types of hippocampus-dependent memory. Although they contribute to acquisition and/or consolidation, cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling are generally not required for retrieval. Interestingly, while not required for retrieval, serotonergic and opioid signaling may actually constrain memory retrieval. Roles for histamine and non-opioid neuropeptides are currently unclear but possible. A critical effector of adrenergic signaling in retrieval is reduction of the slow afterhyperpolarization mediated by ?1 receptors, cyclic AMP, protein kinase A, Epac, and possibly ERK. In contrast, stress and glucocorticoids impair retrieval by decreasing cyclic AMP, mediated in part by the activation of ?2-adrenergic receptors. Clinically, alterations in neuromodulatory signaling and in memory retrieval occur in Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and recent evidence has begun to link changes in neuromodulatory signaling with effects on memory retrieval. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Linear-dendron (LD) hybrids are macromolecules comprising a linear polymer or oligomer conjugated at one or both termini with branched macromolecules called dendrons. Since their introduction approximately 2 decades ago, tremendous progress has been made in their synthesis, the study of their self-assembly, and toward their application in a variety of fields. This highlight is focused on aqueous assemblies of LD hybrids where function is imparted by the dendron, linear component, or both. These functions include the encapsulation and release of drug molecules, enhancement of cell uptake and targeting of specific tissues, and the stabilization of enzymes for catalysis. In addition, many stimuli-responsive LD hybrids that undergo changes in response to light, enzymes, pH, temperature, redox potential, or even multiple stimuli have been developed. LD hybrids can also be used to form networks via cross-linking reactions. Described here are the structure?property relationships underlying the functions of these materials, along with their potential applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

AB  - Abstract Background Youth health issues represent a ?wicked problem? ? they are complex and multifaceted. Furthermore, they are likely to require novel approaches to understand their complexity and develop novel solutions. Objective Given the importance of youth healthcare, and the need for novel approaches, the aim of this article was to demonstrate the innovative use of two research methods ? thematic and lexical analyses ? to better understand practitioner perspectives of youth healthcare. It clarifies the factors that shape practitioner ability to support young people and opportunities to improve practice. Design and Setting Focus groups and interviews were conducted with 37 youth health practitioners. They represented government and non-government services; hospital and community services; and metropolitan and regional services. Results Thematic analysis highlighted the complexity of participants' work and the judgements made as they negotiated relationships with young people and ancillary services. Lexical analysis revealed two hitherto neglected dimensions of the complexity of youth healthcare ? uncertainty and corporeality. Discussion In addition to affirming the complexities of youth healthcare, this study revealed how practitioners (can) negotiate these complexities. These findings were only possible because of the innovative use of the two research methods. Conclusions This study has important theoretical, methodological and practical implications. Theoretically, it is the first to view the complexities of youth healthcare through the wicked problem lens. Methodologically, it highlights the complementary value of thematic and lexical analyses. Practically, it reinforces the importance of policy support and professional development to enable practitioners to grasp the complexities of their work.

AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on flexible sensors for personal health-monitoring systems that can detect human activity and physiological vital signs. It discusses the recent work on flexible health-monitoring devices based on organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials whose structural modification and sensing mechanism depend on the method of signal transduction. The chapter also discusses noninvasive or minimally invasive design approaches to highly flexible, wearable, and body-attachable healthcare devices for different body sites in terms of enhanced functionalities that can detect and distinguish multiple bio-signals with high sensitivity. The state-of-the-art technology in multifunctional flexible sensors has the advantages of high accessibility and usability for consumers, as well as allowing more reliable self-diagnoses of diseases via complementary analysis of multiple bio-signals. The chapter considers the practical application for flexible healthcare sensors and suggests possible future health-monitoring systems. Flexible temperature sensors for wearable and body-attachable applications are widely studied in terms of thermistors, thermocouples, the thermoelectric effect, and optical approaches.

AB  - Abstract Innovating with the goal of conquering disease and injury is one of humanity's most admirable activities. With the variability of patients and diseases, medical innovation often involves complex interactions between the physicians in clinical practice and the rapid technological change from commercial firms. We apply aspects of interpretative hierarchy theory dealing with self-reflective processes, particularly observation and description, to analyse these complex and dynamic relationships that foster innovation in medical technology. This systemic approach fixes certain parameters that help reduce complexity, (i) the notion of gain to adequately describe the change of observed technological hierarchies over time, and (ii) a systems description that allows clinical innovation to emerge as narratives. Our view of innovation in medical technology as an outcome of a high and low gain system finds its empirical illustration through the emergence of diagnostic solutions in medical imaging in the past decade. Finally, our research suggests epistemological and practical contributions to support the sound technological innovation in clinical practice with emphasis on selection criteria and holism for different stakeholders including physicians, firm managers and policymakers.

AB  - Abstract Nicotine use remains highly prevalent with tobacco and e-cigarette products consumed worldwide. However, increasing evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance suggests that nicotine use may alter behavior and neurobiology in subsequent generations. We tested the effects of chronic paternal nicotine exposure in C57BL6/J mice on fear conditioning in F1 and F2 offspring, as well as conditioned fear extinction and spontaneous recovery, nicotine self-administration, hippocampal cholinergic functioning, RNA expression, and DNA methylation in F1 offspring. Paternal nicotine exposure was associated with enhanced contextual and cued fear conditioning and spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear memories. Further, nicotine reinforcement was reduced in nicotine-sired mice, as assessed in a self-administration paradigm. These behavioral phenotypes were coupled with altered response to nicotine, upregulated hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding, reduced evoked hippocampal cholinergic currents, and altered methylation and expression of hippocampal genes related to neural development and plasticity. Gene expression analysis suggests multigenerational effects on broader gene networks potentially involved in neuroplasticity and mental disorders. The changes in fear conditioning similarly suggest phenotypes analogous to anxiety disorders similar to post-traumatic stress.

AB  - Abstract The macro electromyography method was developed in the 1980s.1 Since then, technical modifications have been made, and a number of conditions have been explored.2, 3 This study is a methodological introduction and an update of findings in some nerve?muscle disorders. The spike component of a motor unit potential (MUP) recorded by a concentric or monopolar needle electromyography (EMG) electrode is generated primarily by fibers within 1?2 mm of the needle recording area. Given that a MUP's typical anatomical reach is 5?15 mm in diameter, it follows that conventional EMG is unable to record activity from the entire motor unit. Such information could promote understanding of muscle in health and disease. Macro EMG, with its large recording area, appears to provide this information by recording the activity from most of the fibers in a given motor unit. The value of combining macro EMG with single-fiber EMG and conventional EMG recordings is discussed. Muscle Nerve, 2011

AB  - Abstract Microglia are prominent immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are critical players in both neurological development and homeostasis, and in neurological diseases when dysfunctional. Our previous understanding of the phenotypes and functions of microglia has been greatly extended by a dearth of recent investigations. Distinct genetically defined subsets of microglia are now recognized to perform their own independent functions in specific conditions. The molecular profiling of single microglial cells indicates extensively heterogeneous reactions in different neurological disorders, resulting in multiple potentials for crosstalk with other kinds of CNS cells such as astrocytes and neurons. In settings of neurological diseases it could thus be prudent to establish effective cell-based therapies by targeting entire microglial networks. Notably, activated microglial depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological therapies within a suitable time window can stimulate replenishment of the CNS niche with new microglia. Additionally, enforced repopulation through provision of replacement cells also represents a potential means of exchanging dysfunctional with functional microglia. In each setting the newly repopulated microglia might have the potential to resolve ongoing neuroinflammation. In this review, we aim to summarize the most recent knowledge of microglia and to highlight microglial depletion and subsequent repopulation as a promising cell replacement therapy. Although glial cell replacement therapy is still in its infancy and future translational studies are still required, the approach is scientifically sound and provides new optimism for managing the neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective? In dermatology, the pulsed dye laser (PDL) is the therapeutic instrument of choice for treating most superficial cutaneous vascular lesions. In addition, clinical experience over the last decade allowed us to treat patients with an ever increasing number of non-vascular indications. The purpose of this report is to summarize and critically appraise the scientific evidence that support the role of PDL in treating non-vascular skin lesions. Methods? A literature-based study has been conducted, including the review of publications over the period January 1995 to December 2006, using the Medline Database. We also included our own experience in managing non-vascular lesions with the PDL. Four sets of preoperative and postoperative photos are presented. Results? For viral skin lesions, PDL proved to be an alternative to other therapy options. This applies particularly to periungual warts and mollusca contagiosa. The mechanism of PDL with inflammatory dermatoses has not yet been elucidated. The effect seems to be better if there is a vascular component to the disease. With most of these indications (such as psoriasis and acne), PDL currently plays a rather minor or complementary role. Regarding collagen remodelling (hypertrophic scars, keloids, stretch marks, and skin rejuvenation), the question of whether a therapy makes sense or not has to be decided from case to case. Conclusion? With PDL, it is possible to achieve good results with numerous, partly less well-known indications (i.e. lupus erythematosu). With other diseases, PDL has so far been considered to be a complementary therapy method or to be in an experimental state.

AB  - Summary Parenchyma is an important tissue in secondary xylem of seed plants, with functions ranging from storage to defence and with effects on the physical and mechanical properties of wood. Currently, we lack a large-scale quantitative analysis of ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) tissue fractions. Here, we use data from the literature on AP and RP fractions to investigate the potential relationships of climate and growth form with total ray and axial parenchyma fractions (RAP). We found a 29-fold variation in RAP fraction, which was more strongly related to temperature than with precipitation. Stem succulents had the highest RAP values (mean ± SD: 70.2 ± 22.0%), followed by lianas (50.1 ± 16.3%), angiosperm trees and shrubs (26.3 ± 12.4%), and conifers (7.6 ± 2.6%). Differences in RAP fraction between temperate and tropical angiosperm trees (21.1 ± 7.9% vs 36.2 ± 13.4%, respectively) are due to differences in the AP fraction, which is typically three times higher in tropical than in temperate trees, but not in RP fraction. Our results illustrate that both temperature and growth form are important drivers of RAP fractions. These findings should help pave the way to better understand the various functions of RAP in plants.

AB  - Abstract Regulatory frameworks within the European Union demand that chemical substances are investigated for their ability to induce sensitization, an adverse health effect caused by the human immune system in response to chemical exposure. A recent ban on the use of animal tests within the cosmetics industry has led to an urgent need for alternative animal-free test methods that can be used for assessment of chemical sensitizers. To date, no such alternative assay has yet completed formal validation. However, a number of assays are in development and the understanding of the biological mechanisms of chemical sensitization has greatly increased during the last decade. In this MiniReview, we aim to summarize and give our view on the recent progress of method development for alternative assessment of chemical sensitizers. We propose that integrated testing strategies should comprise complementary assays, providing measurements of a wide range of mechanistic events, to perform well-educated risk assessments based on weight of evidence.

AB  - The indications for transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited. When transfused they can have unpredictable adverse effects. The risks of transmitting infection are similar to those of other blood components unless a pathogen-reduced plasma (PRP) is used. Of particular concern are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and haemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B. FFP is not indicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation without bleeding, is only recommended as a plasma exchange medium for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (for which cryosupernatant is a possible alternative), should never be used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in the absence of severe bleeding, and has only a very limited place in prophylaxis prior to liver biopsy. When used for surgical or traumatic bleeding, FFP and cryoprecipitate doses should be guided by coagulation studies, which may include near-patient testing. FFP is not indicated to reverse vitamin K deficiency for neonates or patients in intensive care units. PRP may be used as an alternative to FFP. In the UK, PRP from countries with a low bovine spongiform encephalopathy incidence is recommended by the Departments of Health for children born after 1 January 1996. Arrangements for limited supplies of single donor PRP of non-UK origin are expected to be completed in 2004. Batched pooled commercially prepared PRP from donors in the USA (Octaplas) is licensed and available in the UK. FFP must be thawed using a technique that avoids risk of bacterial contamination. Plastic packs containing any of these plasma products are brittle in the frozen state and must be handled with care.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the literature documenting the existence of bacterial translocation in humans, the effects of enteral nutrition on bacterial translocation in humans, and the hypothesis that enteral nutrition prevents bacterial translocation in humans. Data Identification: Sources included Medline search, references from review articicles, and references from animal and human studies. Study selection: The goal was to include all animal and human studies directly addressing questions of bacterial translocation and nutritional status or nutritional support. Data Extraction: An attempt was made to briefly summarize methodology and findings of relevent studies. No general attempt was made to assess quality of individual studies. Results of Data Synthesis: Bacterial translocation is a well documented phenomenon in animal models. Starvation and malnutrition of themselves do not induce bacterial translocation, but may facilitate translocation in the presence of other systemic insults. Parenteral nutrition and many forms of enteral nutrition may induce and/or facilitate bacterial translocation. Chow and certain fiber sources seem protective. Moderate direct and several lines of indirect evidence support the existence of bacterial translocation in humans. There is no direct evidence and questionable indirect evidence suggesting that enteral nutrition prevents or modifies bacterial translocation in humans. Conclusions: The hypothesis relating enteral nutrition and bacterial translocation in critically ill patients remains attractive, but unproven.
