AB  - Purpose: To assess the literature documenting the existence of bacterial translocation in humans, the effects of enteral nutrition on bacterial translocation in humans, and the hypothesis that enteral nutrition prevents bacterial translocation in humans. Data Identification: Sources included Medline search, references from review articicles, and references from animal and human studies. Study selection: The goal was to include all animal and human studies directly addressing questions of bacterial translocation and nutritional status or nutritional support. Data Extraction: An attempt was made to briefly summarize methodology and findings of relevent studies. No general attempt was made to assess quality of individual studies. Results of Data Synthesis: Bacterial translocation is a well documented phenomenon in animal models. Starvation and malnutrition of themselves do not induce bacterial translocation, but may facilitate translocation in the presence of other systemic insults. Parenteral nutrition and many forms of enteral nutrition may induce and/or facilitate bacterial translocation. Chow and certain fiber sources seem protective. Moderate direct and several lines of indirect evidence support the existence of bacterial translocation in humans. There is no direct evidence and questionable indirect evidence suggesting that enteral nutrition prevents or modifies bacterial translocation in humans. Conclusions: The hypothesis relating enteral nutrition and bacterial translocation in critically ill patients remains attractive, but unproven.

AB  - ABSTRACT Despite the daunting challenge to hope and hoping currently confronting millions of traumatized populations throughout the world, the psychology literature has largely been silent on the proper meaning of therapeutic hope, and how hope can be resuscitated in people demoralized by extreme hardships or unpredictable life events. This anomaly perhaps arises from the fact that in spite of several and honest acknowledgements found in Western scholarship, about the relevance of hope-healing in the human conditions of captivity or tragedy, a gap still exists as regards the multidimensional conceptualization of the ontology and epistemology of hope that should enable psychologists to have a firm grip not only on the multidimensional constituents of hope and hoping but also on how it lives and dies, how it heals and how we can enhance its positive component in people (individuals or groups) beleaguered by its over-determination by the negative component of hopelessness and other devastating conditions of existence. Through a selective review of the scattered literature on hope and hoping, some of them drawn from outside of the mainline psychology field, this paper draws attention to the ontological complexity of the hope construct and to the factors and forces that combine to promote its activation, healing value and endurance. The overall aim is to move towards a more informed multidimensional re-visioning of the construct. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Qualitative research has gained greater attention in medical research, but it might seem to be unscientific because qualitative and quantitative research methods are grounded in different paradigm. In this article, we introduce three major qualitative research methods frequently used in studies of patient-doctor communications: 1) in-depth interviews; 2) focus group interviews; and, 3) semi-structured interviews. Each qualitative research method has different or common advantages and disadvantages, and which methods should be used depends on the study objectives. Qualitative research and quantitative research are complementary: while quantitative research explains the prevalence or variation of an issue, qualitative research explains the reasons or processes of that prevalence or variation. Combination of the two methods enables the gathering of more comprehensive and explanatory results.

AB  - Abstract In 1993, The West Midlands Probation Service set up a sex offender unit (SOU), the largest in England, with the aim of providing a specialist treatment service for sex offenders serving a community sentence. This article presents a brief description of the treatment programme and discusses some of the issues which have arisen during the design and implementation of the programme. Although cognitive-behavioural groupwork is widely believed to be the most effective intervention for men who sexually abuse children, it is thought that there are some groups of offenders who may not derive maximum benefit from the standard programme and for whom it might be necessary to modify existing practice by providing alternative or complementary interventions. The SOU has attempted to address some of the problems identified by adapting the existing programme for clients with learning disabilities and for men who sexually abuse adult women. In addition, a victim-to-victimiser group is run parallel to the treatment group and is offered to clients who were themselves child victims of sexual abuse. As yet, the long-term effectiveness of tailoring treatment to suit offender characteristics is not known. Nevertheless, client and staff feedback has been positive. Treatment providers elsewhere may not have the resources to run different groups for different categories of offender. However, sex offenders are not a homogeneous group and greater programme flexibility may be needed to provide effective treatment for clients and adequate protection to the public.

AB  - Psychoanalytic theory and practice tend to focus on metaphorical and symbolic mental representations in a way that often pushes aside the importance of a bodily ?presence? possessing qualities that can not and should not be subordinated to the representational structure. By introducing the ?body?container? model, this paper reintroduces the concrete physical body into the psychoanalytic discourse in a more direct way. This clinical?theoretical model links the ?body-ego? (Freud, 1923) to the container idea (Bion, 1962) aiming to creates a new integrative psyche-soma scheme. The ?body?container? experience is available as a subjective realization through a priori psycho-physical forms structured as an envelope and a central vertical axis. These forms are the outcome of our given bodily structure experienced under the ?magnetic? force of object relation. The mental envelope is already discussed in psychoanalytic theory (Anzieu, 1989, 1990; Bick, 1968) and I wish to introduce the characteristics of the vertical axis which I call ?the frontal spine?, emphasizing its constitutional reciprocity with the skin envelope. The proposed model offers new insights into the psycho-physical organization in primitive mental states and may contribute to the understanding of the complementary structural relation between embodied and represented in human experience. Two clinical examples illustrate the therapeutic work relevant to disturbances in the primal psycho-physical space organization at different developmental levels.

AB  - Abstract Oligodendroglial cell death and demyelination are hallmarks of neurotrauma and multiple sclerosis that cause axonal damage and functional impairments. Remyelination remains a challenge as the ability of endogenous precursor cells for oligodendrocyte replacement is hindered in the unfavorable milieu of demyelinating conditions. Here, in a rat model of lysolecithin lysophosphatidyl-choline (LPC)-induced focal demyelination, we report that Neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1), an important factor for oligodendrocytes and myelination, is dysregulated in demyelinating lesions and its bio-availability can promote oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. We delivered recombinant human Nrg-1?1 (rhNrg-1?1) intraspinally in the vicinity of LPC demyelinating lesion in a sustained manner using poly lactic-co-glycolic acid microcarriers. Availability of Nrg-1 promoted generation and maturation of new oligodendrocytes, and accelerated endogenous remyelination by both oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell populations in demyelinating foci. Importantly, Nrg-1 enhanced myelin thickness in newly remyelinated spinal cord axons. Our complementary in vitro studies also provided direct evidence that Nrg-1 significantly promotes maturation of new oligodendrocytes and facilitates their transition to a myelinating phenotype. Nrg-1 therapy remarkably attenuated the upregulated expression chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) specific glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix of demyelinating foci and promoted interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by immune cells. CSPGs and IL-10 are known to negatively and positively regulate remyelination, respectively. We found that Nrg-1 effects are mediated through ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptor activation. Our work provides novel evidence that dysregulated levels of Nrg-1 in demyelinating lesions of the spinal cord pose a challenge to endogenous remyelination, and appear to be an underlying cause of myelin thinning in newly remyelinated axons.

AB  - Abstract A growing body of research has documented associations between adverse childhood environments and DNA methylation, highlighting epigenetic processes as potential mechanisms through which early external contexts influence health across the life course. The present study tested a complementary hypothesis: indicators of children's early internal, biological, and behavioral responses to stressful challenges may also be linked to stable patterns of DNA methylation later in life. Children's autonomic nervous system reactivity, temperament, and mental health symptoms were prospectively assessed from infancy through early childhood, and principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to derive composites of biological and behavioral reactivity. Buccal epithelial cells were collected from participants at 15 and 18 years of age. Findings revealed an association between early life biobehavioral inhibition/disinhibition and DNA methylation across many genes. Notably, reactive, inhibited children were found to have decreased DNA methylation of the DLX5 and IGF2 genes at both time points, as compared to non-reactive, disinhibited children. Results of the present study are provisional but suggest that the gene's profile of DNA methylation may constitute a biomarker of normative or potentially pathological differences in reactivity. Overall, findings provide a foundation for future research to explore relations among epigenetic processes and differences in both individual-level biobehavioral risk and qualities of the early, external childhood environment.

AB  - Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the generation of the body's blood and immune cells. This process takes place primarily in the bone marrow in specialized 'niche' microenvironments, which provide signals responsible for maintaining a balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage specification required for life-long hematopoiesis. While our understanding of these signaling mechanisms continues to improve, our ability to engineer them in vitro for the expansion of clinically relevant HSC populations is still lacking. In this review, we focus on development of biomaterials-based culture platforms for in vitro study of interactions between HSCs and their local microenvironment. The tools and techniques used for both examining HSC-niche interactions as well as applying these findings towards controlled HSC expansion or directed differentiation in 2D and 3D platforms are discussed. These novel techniques hold the potential to push the existing boundaries of HSC cultures towards high-throughput, real-time, and single-cell level biomimetic approaches that enable a more nuanced understanding of HSC regulation and function. Their application in conjunction with innovative biomaterial platforms can pave the way for engineering artificial bone marrow niches for clinical applications as well as elucidating the pathology of blood-related cancers and disorders.

AB  - Abstract In the last decade much progress has been made in research using animal models of developmental psychopathology. The field has moved from the demonstration of long-term impacts of early adversity on behavioral and physiological development and the role of genetic risks for vulnerability, to including transgenerational transmission of stress-induced phenotypes through epigenetic modifications. Additional and critical paradigm shifts have also taken place, including increased focus on ecologically and ethologically valid animal models, research on resilience, the adolescent transition as a period of brain and behavioral reorganization, and sex differences. In this chapter we review recent literature using rodent and nonhuman primate animal models that examines the biological mechanisms through which the early environment programs neurobehavioral, cognitive, and physiological development. We discuss the evolutionary role of this plasticity on behavioral development, as it has an adaptive value in changing environments. Because of maternal care's critical role in early environment, we focus on models that study the effects of mother?infant relationship disruption and dissect the mechanisms by which maternal care regulates the development of brain circuits that control emotional and social behaviors of relevance for developmental psychopathology. Finally, we discuss developmental sensitive/critical periods as windows of opportunity for plastic adaptation of developing organisms to the environment that, if taken too far?as in the case of early traumatic experiences such as childhood maltreatment?lead to maladaptive developmental trajectories (psychopathology, pathophysiology). Animal models of early life adversity are paramount to understand the basic mechanisms and principles that translate early experience into developmental outcomes in our own species.

It reviews the data on the development of autobiographical memory, and on the complementary development of childhood amnesia. Traditional explanations of infantile or childhood amnesia suggested either that memories for early life events are formed but then later become inaccessible, or that memories are not accessible later in life because they were never formed. Although these explanations may seem incompatible, it is likely that elements of both figure in the development of autobiographical memory and thus the offset of childhood amnesia. Finally, the chapter addresses the question of why the course of development takes the form that it does.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Abstract The human blood coagulation system comprises a series of linked glycoproteins that upon activation induce the generation of downstream enzymes ultimately forming fibrin. This process is primarily important to arrest bleeding (hemostasis). Hemostasis is a typical example of a molecular machine, where the assembly of substrates, enzymes, protein cofactors and calcium ions on a phospholipid surface markedly accelerates the rate of coagulation. Excess, pathological, coagulation activity occurs in ?thrombosis?, the formation of an intravascular clot, which in the most dramatic form precipitates in the microvasculature as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Thrombosis occurs according to a biochemical machine model in the case of atherothrombosis on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, but may develop at a slower rate in venous thrombosis, illustrating that the coagulation machinery can act at different velocities. The separate coagulation enzymes are also important in other biological processes, including inflammation for which the rapid conversion of one coagulation factor by the other is not a prerequisite. The latter role of coagulation enzymes may be related to the old and probably maintained function of the coagulation machine in innate immunity.
