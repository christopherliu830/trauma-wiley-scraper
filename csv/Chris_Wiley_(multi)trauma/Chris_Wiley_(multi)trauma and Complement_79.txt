AB  - Background.? The protein s100b indicates astrocytal damage as well as dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is regarded as a marker for neuronal cell loss. Recently, s100b was shown to be a potentially useful marker for migraine in children. In this study, we investigated the levels of s100b and NSE in adult migraineurs during and after migraine attacks in order to gain some more insight into migraine pathophysiology. Methods.? Serum levels of s100b and NSE were measured in 21 migraineurs and compared with 21 healthy subjects matched by sex and age. In migraineurs, blood samples were taken during a migraine attack and following a pain-free period of 2-4 days. Results.? During migraine attacks elevated s100b levels could be observed. Maximal concentrations were detected in the pain-free period after 2-4 days. Regarding NSE, serum levels were decreased slightly during and after migraine bouts. Conclusions.? Our data suggest a prolonged disruption of BBB during and after migraine attacks. Other possible explanations concerning the detected serum levels of s100b and NSE will be discussed; however, neuronal cell death can be ruled out by the decreased serum concentrations of NSE. With regard to the results of the present study, further research is necessary to evaluate the role of s100b and NSE in migraine.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: Degradation products of metallic biomaterials including titanium may result in metal hypersensitivity reaction. Hypersensitivity to biomaterials is often described in terms of vague pain, skin rashes, fatigue and malaise and in some cases implant loss. Recently, titanium hypersensitivity has been suggested as one of the factors responsible for implant failure. Although titanium hypersensitivity is a growing concern, epidemiological data on incidence of titanium-related allergic reactions are still lacking. Materials and methods: A computer search of electronic databases primarily MEDLINE and PUBMED was performed with the following key words: ?titanium hypersensitivity?, ?titanium allergy?, ?titanium release? without any language restriction. Manual searches of the bibliographies of all the retrieved articles were also performed. In addition, a complementary hand search was also conducted to identify recent articles and case reports. Results: Most of the literature comprised case reports and prospective in vivo/in vitro trials. One hundred and twenty-seven publications were selected for full text reading. The bulk of the literature originated from the orthopaedic discipline, reporting wear debris following knee/hip arthroplasties. The rest comprised osteosynthesis (plates/screws), oral implant/dental materials, dermatology/cardiac-pacemaker, pathology/cancer, biomaterials and general reports. Conclusion: This review of the literature indicates that titanium can induce hypersensitivity in susceptible patients and could play a critical role in implant failure. Furthermore, this review supports the need for long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up of all implant patients who are sensitive to metals. At present, we know little about titanium hypersensitivity, but it cannot be excluded as a reason for implant failure. To cite this article: ?Siddiqi A, Payne AGT, De Silva RK, Duncan WJ.

AB  - Individuals identified as psychopathic using Hare's (1991) Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) are of interest to forensic psychologists because of the high risk that they will engage in antisocial behavior (Hart, 1998). Existing crime data suggest that the PCL-R is a measure with great clinical utility, but evidence concerning the etiology of the PCL-R psychopath is less consistent. We propose that one potential source of the inconsistent evidence is that psychopathy is a construct, like mental retardation, that is etiologically heterogeneous. We suggest that the development of effective clinical interventions will require psychologists to (a) question the assumption that psychopathy is an etiologically homogeneous entity, (b) identify etiologically distinct variants of psychopathy for study, and (c) specify etiological mechanisms that may suggest tangible treatment targets. We discuss two complementary strategies for identifying etiological variants of psychopathy: (a) using general personality theory to identify specific psychopathic traits for study and (b) isolating specific bio-psychological mechanisms that possess the potential to explain specific psychopathic syndromes.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - Summary Twentieth century transfusion medicine was advanced by the leadership of many physicians, scientists and technologists and repeatedly incorporated new diagnostics and new therapeutics to improve patient care. Each year, approximately 100 million blood donations are made worldwide. A safe and adequate blood supply is now an essential infrastructure requirement of any modern national healthcare system. During the final two decades of the twentieth century, intense focus on screening blood donations for infectious diseases led to substantial progress in blood safety and a significant reduction in the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases. With the advent of the twenty-first century, the landscape of transfusion risk shifted its emphasis towards non-infectious hazards. Cellular therapy is a major growth area in transfusion medicine. The ability to mobilise haematopoietic progenitor cells, then harvest them safely in bulk numbers, process, freeze and successfully reinfuse them as a stem cell tissue transplant has completely revolutionised the field of bone marrow transplantation.

AB  - SUMMARY 1 I employ cancer in a broad sense to cover all products of malignant neoplasia? carcinomas, sarcomas, leukaemias and ascites tumours?and tumour to cover all autonomous neoplasms. 2 Cancer is not a biological entity, but an assemblage of many distinct diseases (malignant tumours) which share the following symptoms: (a) replication of abnormal tissue type, but often with change towards greater malignancy; (b) non-limited proliferation; (c) some degree of histological and physiological dedifferentiation; (d) partial or often complete lack of organization; (c) invasiveness, often accompanied by metastasis. 3 Neoplasia also includes the development of benign tumours, which exhibit symptoms (a)-(d) above, and have therefore acquired autonomy. 4 Neoplasia does not involve an abnormal form of tissue differentiation, but a characteristic deviation of metabolism which may affect any type of tissue. Tumours retain the specific determination of the tissues from which they arise, though in hypoplastic manifestation. Tumorigenic metabolic deviation proceeds by a series of individual chance (mutational) events, instead of by a continuous (statistical) process affecting all cells simultaneously as in normal differentiation. 5 All autonomous neoplasms can be regarded as the equivalents of new biological species. 6 Though the tumours of lower vertebrates, invertebrates and plants often differ in various ways from those of mammals and birds, there is no reason for regarding them as irrelevant to the human cancer problem. They are autonomous and often malignant neoplasms, and have sometimes been experimentally induced. 7 Neoplastic tumours, whether spontaneous (in nature) (S), experimentally induced (E), or genetically induced (G), have been recorded in the following groups of organisms: 8 The ?cancer spectrum? may differ markedly in different groups, species and breeds. 9 High cancer-proneness exists in some animal species (e.g. dogs, mice, budgerigars, domestic fowls, poecilid and cyprinodont fish) and breeds (retrievers, grey horses, some domesticated goldfish), and low cancer-proneness in others (guinea-pigs, rabbits, pigs, primates; Pekinese, chows). 10 Thyroid tumours develop frequently in salmonids and some other fish in water of low oxygen content. Their invasiveness is usually not an effect of malignancy, but of the absence of a capsule in the fish thyroid. 11 Attention is drawn to the favourable material for cancer research provided by regions of high localized growth rate (horns, horn cores, antlers, etc.), growth gradients (crustacean appendages and abdomina, molluscan mantle edges, etc.), endocrine-dependent growth and regression (fowl-combs, larval and metamorphosing Amphibia, stick insects, etc.), nerve-dependent differentiation (Orthoptera), regenerating limbs (Amphibia, Crustacea, stick* insects, etc.), late-fertilized Amphibian eggs, graft-tolerant sites (cheek pouches of hamster), crown-gall tumours and other plant galls, and toadstools. 12 The rate of development of spontaneous and induced tumours is related to size of species. Further investigation is needed to determine (a) if this holds also for size of breed, (b) if it is related to rate of development to maturity, or to length of life. 13 Crown-gall tumours in plants are initiated by a bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which induces an irreversible alteration in the plant's tissue leading to high heteroauxin production and unorganized tumorous growth. Plant tissues cultivated for long periods on media of high auxin content acquire many properties of crown-gall tumour tissue. Desoxyribonucleic acid extracts from A. tumefaciens can transform other species of bacteria so that they induce tumours. 14 Virus tumours in plants are induced by a combination of a specific virus and traumatic injury. 15 Some tumours are determined genetically, with high or complete penetrance, either as a result of gross genetic imbalance in species crosses (Nicotiana, Platy-poecilus, Pygdera), or of chromosomal imbalance (extra B-chromosomes in Sorghum pollen-grain tumours) or of single genes or systems of genes (Drosophila larval melanotic tumours, melanomas in grey horses, human xeroderma pigmentosum, tumour incidence in monozygotic twins, some mammary cancers and leukaemias in mice). 16 The incidence (penetrance) of genetic tumours may vary markedly with diet and other environmental conditions (notably in Drosophila), with stage of development (all Drosophila tumours regress at metamorphosis), and with genetic background (notably in different inbred mouse strains, which show marked differences of proneness to various tumours). Some single genes affect cancer-proneness, e.g. yellow in mice increases the incidence of lung cancer, and the A blood-group allele in man that of gastric cancer. 17 Specific, subspecific and breed differences in cancer spectrum or particular cancer-proneness must have a genetic basis; human ?racial? differences may do so, but may be determined by environment or habits. 18 The incidence of some mammary cancers in mice depends on a combination of genetic factors with a virus transmitted in the milk. Incidence is mediated through the timing of the endocrine-dependent mammary cycle, high incidence occurring in strains where local areas of proliferation persist after the rest of the gland is in regression. 19 Histocompatibility genes determine susceptibility to tumour transplantation, but have no relation to genetic cancer-proneness. 20 The study of ascites tumours has revealed a wide genetic variance in the cell populations of tumours, due to polyploidy, aneuploidy, structural changes (notably translocations) and gene mutations. The tumour is propagated mainly through a ?germplasm? of modal'stem cells?, the remaining more extreme variants constituting its non-transmitted ?soma?. In changed conditions, selection may operate to alter the profile (idiogram) of the variance, with the establishment of a new mode and set of stem cells (e.g. hypertetraploid in place of hyperdiploid). Major physiological adaptation of the entire cell population is not operative. Immunoselection results in new aneuploid modes with loss of antigenic properties. In other conditions, selection of other mutants may result in higher proliferation rate or invasiveness. Inbred mouse strains may change their general or particular cancer-proneness, as a result of deliberate or unconscious selection. Thus, though the abnormal ploidies and structural changes often seen in tumours are certainly not the primary cause of tumorigenesis but secondary effects of it, they may provide the basis for further genetic evolution of the tumour. 21 The apparent lack of any marked ?heredity? of cancer in man and wild animal species is due to (a) the multiplicity of types of cancer, and (b) the genetic heterogeneity of natural populations. Whenever inbreeding is practised, breeds or strains with particular degrees of genetic proneness to particular cancers will be established. The high variance of human populations in genetic cancer-proneness accounts for the fact that very high incidence of known occupational, environmental or habitudi-nal cancer will only occur with very prolonged and very intense exposure to the carcinogen. Lesser degrees of exposure will result only in a moderate incidence, which yet may be causally significant, as with the increase of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking. 22 Evolutionary selection may affect the manifestation and incidence of cancers in various ways. It may operate (a) to produce a relative immunity to tumorigenesis in tissues especially subject to environmental insults, e.g. the nasal mucosa; (b) to defer the onset of reasonably common cancers, such as most carcinomas, to post-reproductive ages; this will not be possible with rare cancers such as most sarcomas, or with cancers with very early onset, such as the leukaemias of childhood, or xeroderma pigmentosum; in this latter case selection has produced an alternative mode of palliation, by imposing recessiveness on the deleterious effects of the gene responsible. Cancers are also subject to a general orthoselective pressure in favour of higher proliferation rate and greater invasiveness.

AB  - Abstract The majority of life narrative research is performed using trained human coders. In contrast, automated linguistic analysis is oft employed in the study of verbal behaviors. These two methodological approaches are directly compared to determine the utility of automated linguistic analysis for the study of life narratives. In a study of in-person interviews (N?=?158) and a second study of life stories collected online (N?=?242), redemption scores are compared to the output of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Pennebaker, Francis & Booth, 2001). Additionally, patterns of language are found using exploratory principal components analysis. In both studies, redemption scores are modestly correlated with some LIWC categories and unassociated with the components. Patterns of language do not replicate across samples, indicating that the structure of language does not extend to a broader population. Redemption scores and linguistic components are independent predictors of life satisfaction up to 3 years later. These studies converge on the finding that human-coded redemption and automated linguistic analysis are complementary and nonredundant methods of analyzing life narratives, and considerations for the study of life narratives are discussed.

AB  - Summary The precise etiology of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is unknown and likely complex. Antiresorptive agents, notably bisphosphonates and denosumab, are associated with ONJ. Other pharmacological modifiers including immunomodulators and antiangiogenic agents increase the risk of ONJ. In general, local factors that disrupt oral soft and hard tissue integrity or systemic factors that compromise healing have been shown to contribute to ONJ development, progression, and severity. Potent antiresorptive agents, such as zoledronate, alendronate, and denosumab, are risk factors for ONJ because of the potential negative impact on the underlying osseous tissue. Patient symptomatology ranges from nearly absent to mild tenderness to severe pain and discomfort. Treatment protocols range from conservative oral microbial mouthrinses to aggressive segmental resection with microvascular reconstruction. Clinical studies have provided valuable information towards understanding ONJ incidence in various patient cohorts and identifying local and systemic risk factors.
