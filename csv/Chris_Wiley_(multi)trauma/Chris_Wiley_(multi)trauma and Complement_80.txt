AB  - Abstract Background Neuroimmune interactions play a vital role in many of the most common pain conditions, such as arthritis. There have been many attempts to derive clinically predictive information from an individual's inflammatory response in order to gauge subsequent pain perception. Objectives Here, we wanted to test whether this effort could be enhanced and complemented by the use of a model system which takes into account the function of not just circulating, but also tissue-resident immune cells: ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation of the skin. Methods We conducted psychophysical and transcriptional analysis of hyperalgesia arising as a result of UVB-induced inflammation in patients before total knee arthroplasty (TKA, n = 23). Levels of acute postoperative pain were assessed and correlated with preoperative data. Results Cytokine and chemokine responses after UVB irradiation were found to be inversely correlated with the level of pain experienced after surgery (Spearman's ? = ?0.498). Conclusion It may be possible to use this simple model to study and predict the nature of neuro-immune responses at more remote, clinically relevant sites. Significance A simple model of UVB inflammation in the skin might predict the degree of a patient's neuro-immune response and the extent of their postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty.

AB  - Abstract Cachexia presents with ongoing muscle wasting, altering quality of life in cancer patients. Cachexia is a limiting prognostic factor for patient survival and health care costs. Although animal models and human trials have shown mechanisms of motorprotein proteolysis, not much is known about intrinsic changes of muscle functionality in cancer patients suffering from muscle cachexia, and deeper insights into cachexia pathology in humans are needed. To address this question, rectus abdominis muscle samples were collected from several surgical control, non-cachectic and cachectic cancer patients and processed for skinned fibre biomechanics, molecular in vitro motility assays, myosin isoform protein compositions and quantitative ubiquitin polymer protein analysis. In pre-cachectic and cachectic cancer patient samples, maximum force was significantly compromised compared with controls, but showed an unexpected increase in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity consistent with a shift from slow to fast myosin isoform expression seen in SDS-PAGE analysis and in vitro motility assays. Force deficit was specific for ?cancer?, but not linked to presence of cachexia. Interestingly, quantitative ubiquitin immunoassays revealed no major changes in static ubiquitin polymer protein profiles, whether cachexia was present or not and were shown to mirror profiles in control patients. Our study on muscle function in cachectic patients shows that abdominal wall skeletal muscle in cancer cachexia shows signs of weakness that can be partially attributed to intrinsic changes to contractile motorprotein function. On protein levels, static ubiquitin polymeric distributions were unaltered, pointing towards evenly up-regulated ubiquitin protein turnover with respect to ubiquitin conjugation, proteasome degradation and de-ubiquitination.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Abstract This article introduces a model of the internalisation of normative social harmdoing: the MINSOH. This model seeks to explain how group members internalise harmful social norms such that they personally endorse their groups' normative actions. To this aim, the MINSOH integrates two divergent yet complementary theoretical perspectives: self-determination theory and the social identity approach. These perspectives differ in their basic assumptions about the possibility for harm to become internalised, yet when integrated, they provide a powerful account of how harmdoing can become internalised. The MINSOH proposes specific conditions under which harmful normative actions become accepted by group members. This article outlines multiple self-determined motivations for harmdoing and discrete group processes that enable harmdoing to be internalised and autonomously enacted, and reviews factors that facilitate (i.e., strong/unique/comparative social identification; endorsement of ideological justifications) and block the internalisation process (presence of multiple identities/diverging norms; inclusive superordinate identity). Directions for future research are then discussed.

AB  - Abstract Aim To examine the practical applicability of the ?hard? and ?soft? constraints associated with the ?nurse rostering problem? as defined in operations management research literature and thereby investigate the objectivity of the rostering process. Background In practice, rostering nursing staff is often unrecognized, unrewarded and undervalued; yet, despite four decades of research, operations management has little to offer in terms of faster, safer, fairer or more effective rosters. This paper contrasts the theoretical perceptions of roster ?constraints? with the subjective, often political, rules governing practical rosters. Design Using both qualitative and quantitative data, this inductive study compares the practical process of rostering with that theorized in the nurse rostering problem. Methods This research spanned 4 years examining the rosters from 28 wards in 14 hospitals. Interviews with senior nursing staff regarding staff levels and with ward managers regarding rules defining the roster were complemented by analysis of actual roster data to establish the number and type of unfilled shifts and rule breakages. Interviews were analysed using thematic content analysis and roster data were evaluated using the HealthRoster? e-rostering system. Findings Often the rules governing how nursing staff are scheduled are undocumented, tacit and informal. Furthermore, the roster process can be highly politicized, leading to forms of ?information anarchy? or ?information feudalism? on the ward. Conclusions Hospital managers must understand that roster design has a major impact on ward performance and must develop clear roster policies that define staff levels, skill mix, shift patterns and the rules used in preparing the roster.

The introduction explores the relationship between the two: are art history and visual studies distinct, antagonistic, or complementary enterprises? Is visual studies a dangerous supplement that, while it can add to art history, also poses the profound threat of its displacement? Or is it simply another ?critical term? to be inserted into art history's wider field?

AB  - Infectious biofilms are problematic in many healthcare-related devices and are especially challenging and ubiquitous in urinary catheters. This report presents an on-demand fouling-release methodology to mechanically disrupt and remove biofilms, and proposes this method for the active removal of infectious biofilms from the previously inaccessible main drainage lumen of urinary catheters. Mature Proteus mirabilis crystalline biofilms detach from silicone elastomer substrates upon application of strain to the substrate, and increasing the strain rate increases biofilm detachment. The study presents a quantitative relationship between applied strain rate and biofilm debonding through an analysis of biofilm segment length and the driving force for debonding. Based on this mechanism, hydraulic and pneumatic elastomer actuation is used to achieve surface strain selectively within the lumen of prototypes of sections of a fouling-release urinary catheter. Proof-of-concept prototypes of sections of active, fouling-release catheters are constructed using techniques typical to soft robotics including 3D printing and replica molding, and those prototypes demonstrate release of mature P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms (e.g., ≈90%) from strained surfaces. These results provide a basis for the development of a new urinary catheter technology in which infectious biofilms are effectively managed through new methods that are entirely complementary to existing approaches.

AB  - Summary. Causal hypotheses for spastic cerebral palsy were sought by comparing a population based sample of 183 cases with 549 matched controls. A time-ordered multivariate analysis was used to distinguish confounders and consequences of disease from possible causes, which could be single factors or sequences of factors. Eighteen factors were identified as having an association with spasticity that did not arise by confounding with other identified factors nor as a consequence of the disease. Nearly half the cases (48.6%) but only 14.4% of controls experienced one or more of these factors, but no one factor was experienced by > 11%, and most by < 5%, of cases. Those factors identified as occurring before labour commenced affected 35% of all cases. The proportion of cases experiencing identified factors and the distribution of those factors between epochs varied with gestation of delivery and with description and severity of impairment. The possible timing of causes in cases without identified factors and the role of preterm birth and poor intrauterine growth are discussed. We conclude that there were many pathways to spastic cerebral palsy many of which could not be identified. Each contributed only a small proportion and many may have been multifactorial. Intrapartum initiation of the aetiological pathway was relatively unimportant, being likely in about 9% of cases, but the majority of pathways commenced predelivery.

AB  - Besides providing useful model systems for basic science, studies based on modification of the mammalian germ line are changing our understanding of pathogenetic principles. In this article, we review the most popular techniques for generating specific germ line mutations in vivo and discuss the impact of various transgenic models on the study of neurodegenerative diseases. The ?gain of function? approach, i.e., ectopic expression of exogenous genes in neural structures, has deepened our understanding of neurodegeneration resulting from infection with papova viruses, picorna viruses, and human retroviruses. Further, inappropriate expression of mutated cellular molecules in the nervous system of transgenic mice is proving very useful for studying conditions whose pathogenesis is controversial, such as Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron diseases. As a complementary approach, ablation of entire cell lineages by tissue-specific expression of toxins has been useful in defining the role of specific cellular compartments. Modeling of recessive genetic diseases, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, was helped by the development of techniques for targeted gene deletion (colloquially termed ?gene knock-out?). Introduction of subtle homozygous mutations in the mouse genome was made possible by the latter approach. Such ?loss of function? mutants have been used for clarifying the role of molecules thought to be involved in development and structural maintenance of the nervous system, such as the receptors for nerve growth factor and the P0 protein of peripheral myelin. In addition, these models are showing their assets also in the study of enigmatic diseases such as spongiform encephalopathies.

AB  - Michael Mann's two recent books offer a major contribution to the political sociology of mass violence. By developing and endorsing a comparative approach, the author wishes to explain the development of authoritarian regimes, above all fascist movements, as well as the phenomenon of ethnic violence. Considering the crucial and traumatic experience of the First World War as a cultural and social matrix, Mann's definition of fascism is particularly concise and enlightening. Mann's pages articulating the role of collective anxiety and even fear, prospering in a particularly unstable political, economic and international context and the security dilemma are among the highest achievements of the book. But what is disturbing in Fascists, is the deliberate choice not to take into consideration the historical and political realities of communist movements during the same period and ignoring Hanna Arendt's thesis on totalitarianism. The Dark Side of Democracy is a book more innovative and inspiring than earlier works. Contrary to mainstream genocide studies, Mann's work distances itself from the legal front. Sometime overusing the expression ?ethnic cleansing?, a perverse definition of democracy can lead according to Mann to ethnic mass murders. In modern time, he notes, ?the people? has come to mean two things: demos (the mass of the population) and ethnos (the ethnic group that shares a common culture). Consequently, when an ethnic group claims ?We, the people?, it can involve the rejection, even the eradication, of those who are perceived as aliens. But the murderous phenomena analyzed by Mann cannot be linked to the birth of modern democracy, but rather to a more general evolution, that is the formation of nation-states. What is at stake is not the dark side of democracy, but the dark side of the Nation-State in the modern democratic age. Another major contribution relies on the interpretation of mass violence based on the construction of a social imaginary. Before the massacre becomes an atrocious physical act, it is born from a mental process, from a vision of the other as a problem to be eliminated. It is crucial to distinguish more clearly than the author does two fundamental conceptions of ?social purity? that bring about two different figures of the ?enemy?.

AB  - Abstract Aim To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for pregnant women with symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety. Background Many pregnant women experience mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and could benefit from additional support. Non-pharmacological interventions have been suggested for use during pregnancy. Design A systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Data sources Randomized controlled trials published since 1990, identified from electronic databases: Medline; CINAHL; Maternity and Infant Care; PsycINFO; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; CENTRAL; EMBASE; Centre for Reviews and Dissemination; Social Sciences Citation Index; ASSIA; HTA Library; Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence-Based Practice database; Allied and Complementary Medicine. Review methods Conducted according to the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination procedure. Papers were screened (N = 5,222), assessed for eligibility (N = 57) and selected for inclusion (N = 25). The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used. Papers were assessed for clinical and statistical heterogeneity and considered for meta-analysis. Descriptive analysis of the data was conducted. Results Psychological, mind-body, educational and supportive interventions were delivered individually and to groups of pregnant women over single or multiple sessions. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was the most commonly used anxiety measure. In 60% of studies there were fewer than 40 participants. Meta-analysis of three studies indicated no observed beneficial effect in the reduction of anxiety. Conclusion There was insufficient evidence from which to draw overall conclusions regarding the benefit of interventions. Results were predominantly based on small samples. Many papers provided an inadequate description of methods which prevented a full assessment of methodological quality.

AB  - Abstract The main focus of this study is the role that organizational dominance in organizational identity change plays in shaping integration approaches in acquisitions. Using four in-depth case studies, this study categorizes the organizational identity change process into three stages: forms of resistance; conformation of new organizational identity; and integration approaches. The authors first identify two distinct roles of organizational dominance in organizational identity change after acquisition: multilevel resistance and power struggles, which are the prerequisites for developing integration approaches, according to the social identity theory. Second, they further investigate the conformation of new organizational identity with each of these two roles. They conclude that target firms completely lose their organizational identity when there is high organizational dominance after the acquisition. Conversely, target firms work with acquirers in developing integration approaches, and the power winner dominates the integration when there is low organizational dominance. Third, this study contributes to the understanding of integration approaches by connecting three specific integration approaches to the changed organizational identity. The study contributes to the literature on both organizational identity change and acquisition.
