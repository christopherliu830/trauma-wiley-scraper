AB  - Abstract The main focus of this study is the role that organizational dominance in organizational identity change plays in shaping integration approaches in acquisitions. Using four in-depth case studies, this study categorizes the organizational identity change process into three stages: forms of resistance; conformation of new organizational identity; and integration approaches. The authors first identify two distinct roles of organizational dominance in organizational identity change after acquisition: multilevel resistance and power struggles, which are the prerequisites for developing integration approaches, according to the social identity theory. Second, they further investigate the conformation of new organizational identity with each of these two roles. They conclude that target firms completely lose their organizational identity when there is high organizational dominance after the acquisition. Conversely, target firms work with acquirers in developing integration approaches, and the power winner dominates the integration when there is low organizational dominance. Third, this study contributes to the understanding of integration approaches by connecting three specific integration approaches to the changed organizational identity. The study contributes to the literature on both organizational identity change and acquisition.

AB  - Summary The discipline of psychiatric epidemiology is, at its most basic level, the study of the patterns of mental disorders. Recently, the scope of the field has greatly expanded and now includes detailed examinations of the natural history of psychiatric disorders, genetic and epigenetic risk factors, the relationships between physical and mental disorders, the psychological impact of traumatic events, and studies of the use and outcomes of mental health treatments. Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend divided the growth of psychiatric epidemiologic research into three periods, or ?generations.? This chapter discusses the key studies and prevalence rates from each of these periods. It further describes the largest third-generation studies, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study, the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCSR), and the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, a suite of surveys conducted throughout the world using comparable sampling and diagnostic instruments.

AB  - Abstract Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for more than 90% of oral epithelial malignancies and often arises from precursor lesions, whose diagnosis is based on biopsy and histopathology. In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images the vital tissues at microscopic resolution, well correlating with conventional histopathology, but it is poorly investigated in oral oncology. The present work aims to describe RCM cytoarchitectural findings in oral mucosae affected by OSCC and its precursors. Materials and Methods A series of clinically suspected oral lesions underwent RCM imaging before conventional biopsy and histopathological assessment in order to identify features suggestive of tumoral changes. Sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of RCM compared to histopathology were calculated. Results Totally, 30 sites in 20 patients were considered and clinically classified into 16 ?leukoplakia?/? traumatism?, nine erosive-ulcerative lesions, three verrucous lesions, and two healthy mucosae, as control. The histopathological ?positivity,? due to the presence of various degrees of dysplasia and/or neoplasia, was found in 11 lesions; the RCM ?positivity? was referred to nine lesions reporting the RCM detection of polymorphism, multinucleated cells, irregular cellular maturation, altered nuclear/cytoplasm ratio, and abnormal blood vessels. After excluding three verrucous lesions from the RCM analysis, due to the low laser penetration through the hyperkeratotic layers, the results well correlated with histopathology, reporting 1.000 (SE), 0.933 (SP), 0.909 (PPV), and 1.000 (NPV). Conclusion RCM can reveal dysplastic/neoplastic signs occurring in oral lesions, thus supporting their diagnostic pathway.

AB  - Abstract Healing has always been at the heart of metaphysical religious practice in the United States. This article discusses the American history of metaphysical healing from the colonial era to the present. It also examines the diverse characteristics that comprise this kind of healing, which include an emphasis on the power of the mind, the manipulation of omnipresent energy, alternative states of reality, complementary and alternative medicines, holistic health, and the re-fashioning of non-Western spiritualities. Mesmerism, spiritualism, New Thought, Christian Science, neo-shamanism, and the New Age movement are examples of metaphysical healing traditions that are analyzed with special attention to their relationships with biomedicine, science, and Christianity. The article suggests that changing racial and ethnic minority engagements with metaphysical healing in combination with ongoing debates about cultural appropriation of so-called global or universal wisdom promise to make this an increasingly complex subfield in the study of American religions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? Alcoholism is a chronic relapsing disorder with an enormous societal impact. Understanding the genetic basis of alcoholism is crucial to characterize individuals' risk and to develop efficacious prevention and treatment strategies. Methods? We examined the available scientific literature to provide an overview of different approaches that are being integrated increasingly to advance our knowledge of the genetic bases of alcoholism. Examples of genes that have been shown to influence vulnerability to alcoholism and related phenotypes are also discussed. Results? Genetic factors account for more than 50% of the variance in alcoholism liability. Susceptibility loci for alcoholism include both alcohol-specific genes acting either at the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic levels, as well as loci moderating neuronal pathways such as reward, behavioral control and stress resiliency, that are involved in several psychiatric diseases. In recent years, major progress in gene identification has occurred using intermediate phenotypes such as task-related brain activation that confer the advantage of increased power and the opportunity of exploring the neuronal mechanisms through which genetic variation is translated into behavior. Fundamental to the detection of gene effects is also the understanding of the interplay between genes as well as genes/environment interactions. Whole Genome Association studies represent a unique opportunity to identify alcohol-related loci in hypothesis-free fashion. Finally, genome-wide analyses of transcripts and chromatin remodeling promise an increase in our understanding of the genome function and of the mechanisms through which gene and environment cause diseases. Conclusions? Although the genetic bases of alcoholism remain largely unknown, there are reasons to think that more genes will be discovered in the future. Multiple and complementary approaches will be required to piece together the mosaic of causation.

AB  - Abstract: The splenic marginal zone of adult humans contains B cells, of which most express CD27, an antigen only recently identified as a marker for somatically mutated memory B cells. We investigated whether and to which extent the developing marginal zone in infants and children is populated by either memory (CD27+) or naive (CD27?) B cells. Frozen sections of 32 spleens of infants and children ranging in age from 6 days to 15 years and 6 adult spleens were investigated. The expression of CD27 in combination with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD21, IgM, IgD and ASM-1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The marginal zone was already present at 4 months after birth but CD21 expression was observed first after 2 years. CD27-positive marginal zone B cells were observed firstly 2 years after birth and increased in number to adult levels at the age of 5 years. We demonstrated that the MZ of infants and young children is populated by naive B cells, which are replaced by memory B cells in a time frame of 2 to 5 years. Before the age of 2 years, although present, memory B cells appear to be unable to colonize the marginal zone. Because of the absence of memory B cells in the marginal zone, the immune system of a child is not capable to initiate a rapid secondary humoral immune response comparable to the adult immune response.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.
