AB  - Clinical investigation of late onset Alzheimer's disease requires establishment of simple clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria as neuropathological confirmation is not possible in the ordinary victim. Explicit criteria for the selection of mildly impaired victims in a 4-month trial of treatment and the need for new, more careful methods of dementia typing are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - Aim.? Implement and evaluate an inter-disciplinary team approach to tracheostomy management in non-critical care. Background.? Trends towards early tracheostomy in intensive care units (ICU) have led to increased numbers of tracheostomy patients. Together with the push for earlier discharge from ICU, this poses challenges across disciplines and wards. Even though tracheostomy is performed across a range of patient groups, tracheostomy care is seen as the domain of specialist clinicians in critical care. It is crucial to ensure quality care regardless of the patient?s destination after ICU. Design.? A mixed method evaluation incorporating quantitative and qualitative approaches. Method.? Data collection included pre-implementation and postimplementation clinical audits and staff surveys and a postimplementation tracheostomy team focus group. Descriptive and inferential analysis was used to identify changes in clinical indicators and staff experiences. Focus group data were analysed using iterative processes of thematic analysis. Results.? Findings revealed significant reductions in mean hospital length of stay (LOS) for survivors from 50?27?days (p?<?0·0001) and an increase in the number of tracheostomy patients transferred to non-critical care wards in the postgroup (p?=?0·006). The number of wards accepting patients from ICU increased from 3?7 and there was increased staff knowledge, confidence and awareness of the team?s role. Conclusion.? The team approach has led to work practice and patient outcome improvements. Organisational acceptance of the team has led to more wards indicating willingness to accept tracheostomy patients. Improved communication has resulted in more timely referral and better patient outcomes. Relevance to clinical practice.? This study highlights the importance of inter-disciplinary teamwork in achieving effective patient outcomes and efficiencies. It offers a model of inter-disciplinary practice, supported by communication and data management that can be replicated across other patient groups.

AB  - Abstract Penetrating brain injuries (PBI) are a medical emergency, often resulting in complex damage and high mortality rates. Neuroimaging is essential to evaluate the location and extent of injuries, and to manage them accordingly. Currently, a myriad of imaging modalities are included in the diagnostic workup for adult PBI, including skull radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography, with each modality providing their own particular benefits. This literature review explores the current modalities available for investigating PBI and aims to assist in decision making for the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging when presented with an adult PBI. Based on the current literature, the authors have developed an imaging pathway for adult penetrating brain injury that functions as both a learning tool and reference guide for radiographers and other health professionals. Currently, CT is recommended as the imaging modality of choice for the initial assessment of PBI patients, while MRI is important in the sub-acute setting where it aids prognosis prediction and rehabilitation planning, Additional follow-up imaging, such as angiography, should be dependent upon clinical findings.

AB  - Summary Background Facial wrinkles are key signs of aging which affect one's quality of life and psychological well-being. Absorbable wedge-shaped polydioxanone (PDO) sutures are popular in the esthetic clinics of Korea and may be a treatment option for static wrinkles on the upper face. Objective To describe a novel technique applicable to deep static wrinkles on the upper face and to assess its safety and efficacy. Patients and Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on the static wrinkle cases which were treated with folded, wedge-shaped PDO threads. A total of 33 Korean patients with glabellar and forehead wrinkles were included. All participants underwent a single treatment session. The results were assessed objectively using serial photography and subjectively based on the patients' satisfaction scores. Complications were also recorded. Results Our patients displayed moderate (15.2%), severe (39.4%), and very severe (45.4%) static wrinkles at baseline. The majority of patients (81.8%) considered the results satisfactory. Consensus ratings by two independent dermatologists showed that the objective outcomes at 2-month follow-up were very much improved (30.3%), much improved (30.3%), and improved (24.2%). The incidence of complications was low, and the complications were minor. Conclusion Wedge-shaped PDO sutures in a folded configuration (?solid fillers?) are a promising treatment option for deep static wrinkles on the upper face. They may be applied as an adjunct, or as an alternative to conventional therapies such as botulinum toxin and soft tissue filler injection.

AB  - Abstract The triarchic model (Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009) was formulated to reconcile contrasting conceptions of psychopathy reflected in historic writings and contemporary assessment instruments, and to address persisting unresolved issues in the field. The model conceives of psychopathy as encompassing three distinct but interrelated phenotypic dispositions?disinhibition, boldness, and meanness?with biological referents. These dispositional constructs can be viewed as building blocks for alternative conceptions of psychopathy, and various existing psychopathy measures are presumed to index these constructs to differing degrees. This article summarizes the bases of the triarchic model in the conceptual and empirical literatures on psychopathy, and it describes linkages between the constructs of the model and established structural frameworks for personality and psychological disorders. Alternative methods for indexing the constructs of the model are described, and evidence regarding their interrelations and criterion-related validity is reviewed. Promising aspects of the model for ongoing research on psychopathy are discussed, along with current gaps in knowledge/methods and recommended avenues for future research.

AB  - Summary: Seventeen patients with Behcet's syndrome were evaluated clinically, immunologically and therapeutically. The variable and extensive clinical manifestations included scantyfungiform papillae in six patients, bullous skin eruption in two, non-specific skin sensitivity in six, bladder ulceration in two, and psychoneurosis. Immunological abnormalities included raised α2 globulin in 14 patients, hypogammaglobulinaemia in one, cryoproteins in three, foetal oral mucosa antibodies in three and pemphigus antibody in two. Intradermal injection of autologous plasma produced an Arthus reaction in eight out of 11 patients tested. It is suggested that some plasma component may be responsible for vasculitis in these patients. Treatment was attempted with various combinations of corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide, phenformin and ethyloestrenol. Seven patients had a satisfactory response in that all manifestations of their syndrome were well controlled.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a pathophysiological syndrome characterized by clinical manifestations of generalized bleeding together with laboratory features of severe coagulopathy. Thus, DIC is a failure of haemostatic homeostasis. In DIC there is unregulated and uncontrolled activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets resulting in blockage of the microvascular system of critical organs. In addition, there is activation of the fibrinolytic cascade generating plasmin and consequently fibrin and fibrinogen degradation, together with depletion of components of the natural anticoagulant pathway which contribute to the systemic bleeding diathesis. The diagnosis of DIC is made in the presence of a predisposing cause, the clinical manifestations of systemic bleeding and multiorgan dysfunction and from appropriate laboratory investigations. The first principle of management of DIC should be toward resuscitation of the patient to achieve adequate oxygenation, blood pressure, circulation and renal perfusion. Treatment of the underlying cause and other strategies are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Non-accidental injury (NAI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Fractures are the second most common findings of NAI, after cutaneous lesions such as bruises and contusions. Imaging in NAI remains a controversial issue with little agreement concerning how, when and what imaging modalities should be used in the investigation of suspected cases. This review addresses the radiological investigations and findings of NAI, and the differential diagnoses of these findings. Adherence to the international guidelines for skeletal survey imaging is recommended. This ensures the content and quality of the radiographic series are of an optimal standard to improve the detection of occult fractures, and ensuring the accurate reporting of images. The involvement of a paediatric radiologist is important, if not essential in the diagnosis of NAI. In the evaluation of suspected cases, the role of the radiologist includes the detection of radiological findings suggestive of NAI, and the differentiation of these findings from normal variants and underlying pathologies. The diagnosis of NAI relies not only on radiological imaging, but also a combination of clinical and social findings. It is mandatory that all physicians work in close collaboration to improve diagnostic accuracy, as failure to diagnose NAI carries significant risk for morbidity.

AB  - Although long known and the most prevalent movement disorder, pathophysiology of essential tremor (ET) remains controversial. The most accepted hypothesis is that it is caused by a dysfunction of the olivocerebellar system. Vilela Filho et al. [2001; Stereotact Funct Neurosurg 77:149?150], however, reported a patient with unilateral hand ET that was completely relieved after a stroke restricted to the contralateral posterior putamen and suggested that ET could be the clinical manifestation of posterior putamen hyperactivity. The present study was designed to evaluate this hypothesis in the most often used model of ET, harmaline-induced tremor in rats. Fifty-four male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into three groups: experimental (EG), surgical control (SCG), and pharmacological control (PCG) groups. EG animals underwent stereotactic unilateral posterior striatotomy. SCG rats underwent sham lesion at the same target. PCG served exclusively as controls for harmaline effects. All animals received, postoperatively, intraperitoneal harmaline, and the induced tremor was video-recorded for later evaluation by a blind observer. Thirteen animals were excluded from the study. Limb tremor was reduced ipsilaterally to the operation in 20 of 21 rats of EG and in two of nine of SCG, being asymmetric in one of 10 of PCG rats. Comparisons between EG ? SCG and EG ? PCG were statistically significant, but not between SCG ? PCG. Limb tremor reduction was greater in anterior than in posterior paws. Lateral lesions yielded better results than medial lesions. These results suggest that the posterior striatum is involved with harmaline-induced tremor in rats and support the hypothesis presented. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Lumbar disc protrusion is common. Its clinical manifestations and treatments are closely related to the pathological changes; however, the pathological classification of lumbar disc protrusion is controversial. This article introduces a new pathological classification comprising four types of lumbar disc protrusion according to intraoperative findings. The damage-herniation type is probably caused by injury and is characterized by soft herniation, the capsule can easily be cut and the broken disc tissue blocks overflow or is easily removed. The broken disc substances should be completely removed; satisfactory results can be achieved by minimally invasive endoscopic surgery. The degeneration-protrusion type is characterized by hard and tough protrusions and the pathological process by degeneration and proliferative reaction. The nerve should be decompressed and relaxed with minimally invasive removal of the posterior wall; the bulged or protruded disc often need not be excised. The posterior vertebral osteochondrosis with disc protrusion type is characterized by deformity of the posterior vertebral body, osteochondral nodules and intervertebral disc protrusion. The herniated and fragmented disc tissue should be removed with partially protruding osteochondral nodules. Intervertebral disc cyst is of uncertain pathogenesis and is characterized by a cyst that communicates with the disc. Resection of the cyst under microscopic or endoscopic control can achieve good results; and whether the affected disc needs to be simultaneously resected is controversial. The new pathological classification proposed here is will aid better understanding of pathological changes and pathogenesis of lumbar disc protrusion and provides a reference for diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Abstract Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but is also recognized to be a heterogeneous condition. Biomarkers that predict AD progression in MCI are of clinical significance because they can be used to better identify appropriate candidates for therapeutic intervention studies. It has been hypothesized that comparing to structural measurements, functional ones may be more sensitive to early disease abnormalities and the sensitivity could be further enhanced when combined with cognitive task, a ?brain stress test.? In this study, we investigated the value of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured by arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI (ASL MRI) during a memory-encoding task, in predicting the estimated rate of hippocampal atrophy, an established marker of AD progression. Thirty-one amnestic MCI patients (20 male and 11 female; age: 70.9?±?6.5 years, range from 56 to 83?years; mini mental status examination: 27.8?±?1.8) and 42 normal control subjects (13 male and 29 female; age: 70.6?±?8.8 years, range from 55 to 88?years; mini mental status examination: 29.1?±?1.2) were included in this study. We compared the predictive value of CBF during task to CBF during rest and structural volumetry. Both region-of-interest and voxelwise analyses showed that baseline CBF measurements during task (strongest effect in fusiform gyrus, region-of-interest analysis statistics: r?=?0.56, p?=?.003), but not resting ASL MRI or structural volumetry, were correlated with the estimated rate of hippocampal atrophy in amnestic MCI patients. Further, stepwise linear regression demonstrated that resting ASL MRI and volumetry did not provide complementary information in prediction. These results support the notion that physiologic measures during a cognitive challenge may increase the ability to detect subtle functional changes that predict progression. As such, ASL MRI could have important utility in stratifying candidates for AD treatment trials.

AB  - ABSTRACT In his masterpiece, The White Ribbon, writer and film-maker Michael Haneke creates a tale that jars the viewer with his portrayal of life in a (German) village at the threshold of World War I. But he also gratifies this psychoanalytic viewer in two ways: (1) in the historically documented realistic portrayal of harsh child rearing and its then-unrecognized potential highly destructive consequences; and (2) in the psychoanalytic cogency of his portrayal, given that established psychoanalytic and psychological theorizing compelled by evidence-based findings asserts just what Haneke tells us: that abuse (and neglect) of children generate the hostile-destructive-laden psychodynamic that underlies the formation of delinquent and criminal characterology.

AB  - ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs type 4) is a metalloprotease capable to degrade chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans leading to cartilage destruction during arthritis or to neuroplasticity during spinal cord injury (SCI). Although ADAMTS-4 is an inflammatory-regulated enzyme, its role during inflammation has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAMTS-4 in neuroinflammation. First, we evidenced an increase of ADAMTS-4 expression in the ischemic brain hemisphere of mouse and human patients suffering from ischemic stroke. Then, we described that ADAMTS-4 has predominantly an anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS. Treatment of primary microglia or astrocyte cultures with low doses of a human recombinant ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure decreased NO production and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including NOS2, CCL2, TNF-α, IL-1? and MMP-9. Accordingly, when cell cultures were transfected with silencing siRNA targeting ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure, the production of NO and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased. Finally, the feasibility of ADAMTS-4 to modulate neuroinflammation was investigated in vivo after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Although ADAMTS-4 treatment did not influence the lesion volume, it decreased astrogliosis and macrophage infiltration, and increased the number of microglia expressing arginase-1, a marker of alternatively activated cells with inflammation inhibiting functions. Additionally, ADAMTS-4 increased the production of IL-10 and IL-6 in the peri-ischemic area. By having anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative roles, ADAMTS-4 may represent an interesting target to treat acute CNS injuries, such as ischemic stroke, SCI or traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Abdominal wall hernia is a recurrent issue world-wide and requires the implantation of over 1 million meshes per year. Because permanent meshes such as polypropylene and polyester are not free of complications after implantation, many mesh modifications and new functionalities have been investigated over the last decade. Indeed, mesh optimization is the focus of intense development and the biomaterials utilized are now envisioned as being bioactive substrates that trigger various physiological processes in order to prevent complications and to promote tissue integration. In this context, it is of paramount interest to review the most relevant bio-functionalities being brought to new meshes and to open new avenues for the innovative development of the next generation of meshes with enhanced properties for functional abdominal wall hernia repair.
