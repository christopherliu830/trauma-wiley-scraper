AB  - Abstract:? Although less than 1% of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) develop the catastrophic variant, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine today. However, the rarity of this variant makes it extraordinarily difficult to study in any systematic way. In order to put together all the published case reports as well as the new diagnosed cases from all over the world, an international registry of patients with catastrophic APS (?CAPS Registry?) was created in 2000 by the European Forum on Antiphospholipid Antibodies. Currently, it documents the entire clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data of more than 300 patients whose data have been fully registered. This registry can be freely consulted at the Internet (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) and it is expected that the periodical analysis of these data will allow us to increase our knowledge of this condition.

AB  - ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs type 4) is a metalloprotease capable to degrade chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans leading to cartilage destruction during arthritis or to neuroplasticity during spinal cord injury (SCI). Although ADAMTS-4 is an inflammatory-regulated enzyme, its role during inflammation has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAMTS-4 in neuroinflammation. First, we evidenced an increase of ADAMTS-4 expression in the ischemic brain hemisphere of mouse and human patients suffering from ischemic stroke. Then, we described that ADAMTS-4 has predominantly an anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS. Treatment of primary microglia or astrocyte cultures with low doses of a human recombinant ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure decreased NO production and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including NOS2, CCL2, TNF-α, IL-1? and MMP-9. Accordingly, when cell cultures were transfected with silencing siRNA targeting ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure, the production of NO and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased. Finally, the feasibility of ADAMTS-4 to modulate neuroinflammation was investigated in vivo after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Although ADAMTS-4 treatment did not influence the lesion volume, it decreased astrogliosis and macrophage infiltration, and increased the number of microglia expressing arginase-1, a marker of alternatively activated cells with inflammation inhibiting functions. Additionally, ADAMTS-4 increased the production of IL-10 and IL-6 in the peri-ischemic area. By having anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative roles, ADAMTS-4 may represent an interesting target to treat acute CNS injuries, such as ischemic stroke, SCI or traumatic brain injury.

AB  - The treatment of acute hepatic failure has developed rapidly over the last 40 years, reducing morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. Whilst this has been partly attributed to significant improvements in the specialist medical management of these patients, advances in surgical techniques and pharmaceutical developments have led to the establishment of successful liver transplantation programmes, which have improved mortality significantly. This review will examine the clinical impact of alternative methods that have been used to provide extra-corporeal hepatic support. Non-biological, bio- logical and hybrid hepatic extra-corporeal support will be explored, offering a comprehensive historical overview and an appraisal of present and future advances.

AB  - For 7 years, the Kidney Transplantation Committee of the United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement Transplantation Network has attempted to revise the kidney allocation algorithm for adults (≥18 years) in end-stage renal disease awaiting deceased donor kidney transplants. Changes to the kidney allocation system must conform to the 1984 National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) which clearly states that allocation must take into account both efficiency (graft and person survival) and equity (fair distribution). In this article, we evaluate three allocation models: the current system, age-matching and a two-step model that we call ?Equal Opportunity Supplemented by Fair Innings (EOFI)?. We discuss the different conceptions of efficiency and equity employed by each model and evaluate whether EOFI could actually achieve the NOTA criteria of balancing equity and efficiency given current conditions of growing scarcity and donor-candidate age mismatch.

AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.

AB  - A mini-symposium series of papers presenting the results of the European Commission-supported Biomed II project is introduced. The project accomplished a cross-border scientific networking engaging 31 European residential treatment programmes. The results showed that scientific development is best served by a flexible bureaucratic approach. ?Old? science and the ?new? science ways of working were balanced. ?History? and ?social networks? are the key concepts signalling the project knowledge gains. A treatment sample (N=723) was extracted from a database of 1028 current European cases. Non-drug-specific characteristics are as important as drug-specific characteristics in distinguishing emerging dependence groups. The project networking created a process that increased the level of involvement of science and the service communities. To sustain the gains of the project, a reaching out of existing European treatment services to extended family and friendship networks with a history of dependence-related problems will be required.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on cognitive behavioral interventions with juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent by the courts and have ongoing contact with the correctional system. The cognitive-behavioral approach assesses skills deficits and factors that provoke antisocial and immature behaviors and that reinforce and maintain poor adjustment across time and contexts. Most multicomponent programs include behavioral assessment to understand an adolescent's discrete patterns and deficit areas, a skills-based program focused on cognitive and behavioral changes, as well as on emotion regulation, and use modeling, role-play, guided homework and positive reinforcement for approximations to the desired prosocial behaviors. Treatment approaches that are based on cognitive-behavioral theory and are relevant to clinical work with juvenile offenders and their empirical evidence for overall effectiveness are reviewed. Highly structured programs that address multiple risk factors across different contexts, include a strong cognitive component, and are rehabilitative and strengths-based appear to be the most effective. To ensure positive outcomes, the inclusion of a family and/or parent treatment component is critical. Establishing a good working alliance with the family and remaining flexible during implementation are key ingredients for success. Interventions are time consuming and expensive, as staff require comprehensive training, ongoing support and supervision in order to deliver treatment that is effective in achieving the prosocial, interpersonal, and self-regulatory skills needed for healthy adolescent development.

AB  - Background To apply quantitative whole-brain T1-rho (T1?) and T2 imaging to the detection and quantification of brain changes resulting from multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods Twenty-three MS patients with clinically isolated syndrome (10) and relapsing remitting MS (13) phenotypes, compared with 24 age-matched healthy controls were imaged at 3 Tesla. An axial T1?-weighted three-dimensional turbo spin echo sequence with a variable flip angle and fluid suppression was used. Spin-lock times of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 ms were used. Corresponding T2 maps were also acquired. Results Whole brain white matter (WM) T1? maps were elevated compared with controls (P = 0.002). WM lesion T1? and T2 values were highly correlated (r = 0.83), but T1? demonstrated 25% better contrast to noise ratio (P < 0.001). WM lesion T1? correlated with disease duration. Gray matter T1? was negatively correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale, r = ?0.45, P = 0.03. Normal appearing gray matter and cortical gray matter lesions were negatively correlated on T1?, but not on T2 (rT1? = ?0.63, pT1? = 0.03; rT2 = ?0.17, pT2 = 0.6). Conclusion T1? MRI demonstrates enhanced lesion contrast compared with T2, and in some cases may provide complementary information. T1? may provide a useful measure of demyelinating processes in MS. J. MAGN. RESON.

AB  - Abstract Neural regeneration devices interface with the nervous system and can provide flexibility in material choice, implantation without the need for additional surgeries, and the ability to serve as guides augmented with physical, biological (e.g., cellular), and biochemical functionalities. Given the complexity and challenges associated with neural regeneration, a 3D printing approach to the design and manufacturing of neural devices can provide next-generation opportunities for advanced neural regeneration via the production of anatomically accurate geometries, spatial distributions of cellular components, and incorporation of therapeutic biomolecules. A 3D printing-based approach offers compatibility with 3D scanning, computer modeling, choice of input material, and increasing control over hierarchical integration. Therefore, a 3D printed implantable platform can ultimately be used to prepare novel biomimetic scaffolds and model complex tissue architectures for clinical implants in order to treat neurological diseases and injuries. Further, the flexibility and specificity offered by 3D printed in vitro platforms have the potential to be a significant foundational breakthrough with broad research implications in cell signaling and drug screening for personalized healthcare. This progress report examines recent advances in 3D printing strategies for neural regeneration as well as insight into how these approaches can be improved in future studies.

AB  - Nucleic acid detection methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can often detect specific microbial pathogens, virulence markers and antimicrobial resistance genes more rapidly and with greater sensitivity and specificity than culture and conventional identification and susceptibility testing. Multiplex PCR can detect multiple genes in a single assay; this capability will be greatly extended by new techniques such as the DNA chip. However, limitations and pitfalls of nucleic detection methods remain.

AB  - Abstract Minimum intervention dentistry (MID) is the modern medical approach to the management of caries, utilizing caries risk assessment, and focusing on the early prevention and interception of disease. Moving the focus away from the restoration of teeth allows the dentist to achieve maximum intervention, with minimal invasive treatments. The four core principles of MID can be considered to be: (1) Recognition ? early identification and assessment of potential caries risk factors through lifestyle analysis, saliva testing and using plaque diagnostic tests; (2) Reduction ? to eliminate or minimize caries risk factors by altering diet and lifestyle habits and increasing the pH of the oral environment; (3) Regeneration ? to arrest and reverse incipient lesions, using appropriate topical agents including fluorides and casein phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphates (CPP-ACP); (4) Repair ? when cavitation is present and surgical intervention is required, conservative caries removal is carried out to maximize the repair potential of the tooth and retain tooth structure. Bioactive materials are used to restore the tooth and promote internal healing of the dentine. Effective implementation of MID involves integrating each of these four elements into patient assessment and treatment planning. This review paper discusses the key principles of MID as a philosophy of patient care, and the practical objectives which flow into individual patient care.
