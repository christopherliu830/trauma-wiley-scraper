AB  - Summary Solid organ transplantation is a vital therapy for end stage diseases. Decades of research have established that components of the adaptive immune system are critical for transplant rejection, but the role of the innate immune system in organ transplantation is just emerging. Accumulating evidence indicates that the innate immune system is activated at the time of organ implantation by the release of endogenous inflammatory triggers. This review discusses the nature of these triggers in organ transplantation and also potential mediators that may enhance inflammation resolution after organ implantation.

AB  - Establishing National Priorities for Australian Occupational Health and Safety Research: Derek R. Smith. WorkCover New South Wales Research Centre of Excellence, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Newcastle, Australia Objectives This study aimed to identify current and emerging issues relevant to Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) research in Australia, and to formulate strategic research directions and strategies for the future. Methods A national research forum was held which included leading OHS academics, employer and employee representative groups, as well as executives from state (New South Wales) and national (Safe Work Australia) representative bodies. A modified Delphi technique was used for collecting data in three phases. Results When ranked according to group consensus, the top three priorities for future OHS research in Australia were identified as being psychosocial and soft tissue injury hazards, work / life issues, and the impact of multiple, long-term exposures. Strategies to enhance collaboration despite limited research funding included the need to focus on complementary skills, to make the best use of Safe Work Australia's role (particularly to link with strategic and operational plans), and to foster closer engagement with research communities. Conclusions While certain research priorities appear to be similar to those of other countries, the current study did identify some unique characteristics within an Australian context. High quality investigations of these issues should now be considered, in conjunction with greater cooperation between governments, regulators, employers and employee groups for the more effective facilitation of applied OHS research in the coming years.

AB  - Abstract Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are typically used as a cell source for the reconstruction of hollow organs by conventional tissue engineering techniques. However, the necessity for and advantage of the use of tissue-specific SMCs are unknown. The present study investigated the phenotypic changes that occur following isolation and in vitro expansion of rat SMC populations isolated from three different tissues: the aorta, oesophagus and urinary bladder. rSMCs were isolated by enzymatic dispersion and expanded by conventional cell culture techniques, yielding microscopically homogeneous populations. SMC phenotypes were monitored according to their expression of marker proteins during the first two passages. Two of the three SMC populations (rSMC-a and rSMC-e) showed a marked change in their marker protein profiles during the first two passages, which resulted in a homogeneous phenotype that was neither fully contractile nor fully synthetic. SMCs from the urinary bladder did not show such a shift. Differences between the three rSMC populations were observed with regard to proliferative activity and gene expression patterns, suggesting the retention of some tissue-specific cell characteristics. In summary, phenotypic changes in SMCs occur as a result of conventional cell isolation and expansion techniques, thus questioning the necessity for a tissue-specific cell source for regenerative medicine applications.

AB  - Recently, social media has become a potentially new way for scholarly journals to disseminate and evaluate research outputs. Scholarly journals have started promoting their research articles to a wide range of audiences via social media platforms. This article aims to investigate the social media presence of scholarly journals across disciplines. We extracted journals from Web of Science and searched for the social media presence of these journals on Facebook and Twitter. Relevant metrics and content relating to the journals' social media accounts were also crawled for data analysis. From our results, the social media presence of scholarly journals lies between 7.1% and 14.2% across disciplines; and it has shown a steady increase in the last decade. The popularity of scholarly journals on social media is distinct across disciplines. Further, we investigated whether social media metrics of journals can predict the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). We found that the number of followers and disciplines have significant effects on the JIF. In addition, a word co-occurrence network analysis was also conducted to identify popular topics discussed by scholarly journals on social media platforms. Finally, we highlight challenges and issues faced in this study and discuss future research directions.

AB  - Summary: Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are critically involved in activation of the coagulation system in sepsis, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (APC) regulate the coagulation system by inhibiting thrombin generation. In addition to these anticoagulant effects, both AT and APC have been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses induced by various noxious stimuli in rats such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. AT promotes the endothelial release of prostacyclin, a potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that inhibits the monocytic production of TNF-α, by interacting with cell-surface heparin-like substances. APC directly inhibits the production of TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of both nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and activator protein-1 in monocytes stimulated with LPS. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial membranous integral protein that binds thrombin, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by generating APC. Furthermore, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, a natural anticoagulant for the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system, also attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in rats by inhibiting TNF-α production by monocytes. These findings strongly suggest that natural anticoagulants could regulate inflammatory responses as well as the coagulation system in rats by inhibiting the monocytic production of TNF-α. Such anti-inflammatory properties of natural anticoagulants are potentially important for their replacement in patients with sepsis who frequently develop DIC and organ failure as inflammatory responses.

AB  - Abstract The transport of fluid, nutrients and electrolytes to and from the intestinal lumen is a primary function of epithelial cells. Normally, the intestine absorbs approximately 9 l of fluid and 1 kg of nutrients daily, driven by epithelial transport processes that consume large amounts of cellular energy and O2. The epithelium exists at the interface of the richly vascularised mucosa, and the anoxic luminal environment and this steep O2 gradient play a key role in determining the expression pattern of proteins involved in fluid, nutrient and electrolyte transport. However, the dynamic nature of the splanchnic circulation necessitates that the epithelium can evoke co-ordinated responses to fluctuations in O2 availability, which occur either as a part of the normal digestive process or as a consequence of several pathophysiological conditions. While it is known that hypoxia-responsive signals, such as reactive oxygen species, AMP-activated kinase, hypoxia-inducible factors, and prolyl hydroxylases are all important in regulating epithelial responses to altered O2 supply, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved is still limited. Here, we aim to review the current literature regarding the role that O2 plays in regulating intestinal transport processes and to highlight areas of research that still need to be addressed.

AB  - Abstract In a longitudinal study of laid-off industrial workers, we examined the effects of individual differences and situational characteristics on individuals' use of six job loss coping strategies. In each case the predictors explained a significant portion of the variance (30?47 percent) although different predictors were significantly associated with each of the six coping strategies. The results also suggest that the use of problem-focused and symptom-focused coping strategies are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. The study's implications and directions for future research are discussed as well. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
