AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in pregnancy is most often encountered secondary to underlying obstetrical, surgical, or medical complications. The process of DIC is initiated through the activation of tissue factor (TF), which is found in subendothelial cells, amniotic fluid, and placenta. DIC is seen in severe forms of preeclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic complication in obstetrics and is associated with significant maternal mortality. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare disease associated with massive obstetric hemorrhage. It is characterized by accumulation of microvesicular fatty infiltration in the maternal hepatocytes, leading to liver failure. The diagnosis of DIC is clinical, based upon underlying etiology, blood loss, and the general condition of the patient. The basic principles of managing obstetrical DIC are multidisciplinary approach, treatment of obstetric causes, blood and blood products, and supportive care.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - Objective Little is known about how teams? non-technical performance influences clinical performance in obstetric emergencies such as postpartum haemorrhage. Design Video review ? observational study. Setting A university hospital (5000 deliveries) and a regional hospital (2000 deliveries) in Denmark. Population Obstetric teams managing real-life postpartum haemorrhage. Methods We systematically assessed 99 video recordings of obstetric teams managing real-life major postpartum haemorrhage. Exposure was the non-technical score (AOTP); outcomes were the clinical performance score (TeamOBS) and the delayed transfer to the operating theatre (defined as blood loss >1500 ml in the delivery room). Results Teams with an excellent non-technical score performed significantly better than teams with a poor non-technical score: 83.7 versus 0.3% chance of a high clinical performance score (P < 0.001), 0.2 versus 80% risk of a low clinical performance score (P < 0.001), and 3.5 versus 31.7% risk of delayed transfer to the operating theatre (P = 0.008). The results remained robust when adjusting for potential confounders such as bleeding velocity, aetiology, time of day, team size, and hospital. The specific non-technical skills associated with high clinical performance were vigilance, role assignment, problem-solving, management of disruptive behavior, and leadership. Communication with the patient and closing the loop were of minor importance. All performance assessments showed good reliability: the intraclass correlation was 0.97 (95% CI 0.96?0.98) for the non-technical score and 0.84 (95% CI 0.76?0.89) for the clinical performance score. Conclusion Video review offers a new method and new perspectives for research in obstetric teams to identify how teams become effective and safe; the skills identified in this study can be included in future obstetric training programmes. Tweetable abstract Non-technical performance is important for teams managing postpartum haemorrhage; video review of 99 obstetric teams.

AB  - Abstract There is increasing recognition that livelihood security, sustainable peace, conflict prevention and gender equality are complementary goals requiring integrated policy approaches, yet there is limited evidence on the links between these key development pillars. Motivation This article uses three case studies to illustrate how specific policy interventions can address the differentiated priorities of men and women with relation to food security, building sustainable peace processes and achieving gender equality. Purpose The article illustrates how five pathways have operated and interacted in three selected FAO interventions, and discusses data, research and policy challenges that emerged from this analysis. Approach and methods A conceptual framework grounded on five pathways is used, including changes in (a) behaviour, agency and aspirations; (b) social norms about gender roles and equality; (c) institutions and governance; (d) agriculture and employment markets; and (e) social cohesion and inclusive collective action. Findings The institutions that emerge from complex processes of interaction between state and non-state armed actors, other informal actors and different population groups shape how property rights, food distribution systems, employment programmes and social service provision support or fail to support the local populations. Policy implications More information is needed on local conflict dynamics. As such, better data collection is needed to support policy interventions.

AB  - The limitations of intravenous thrombolysis therapy have paved the way for the development of novel endovascular technologies for use in the setting of acute stroke. These technologies range from direct intraarterial thrombolysis to various thrombus disruption or retrieval devices to angioplasty and stenting. The tools in the armamentarium of the neuroendovascular interventionalist enable fast, effective revascularization to be offered to a wider population of patients that may otherwise have few therapeutic options available to them. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art in neuroendovascular intervention for acute ischemic stroke. Particular emphasis is placed on delineating the indications and outcomes for use of these various technologies.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease resulting from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, due to a poorly understood combination of genetic, environmental, and immune factors. The JDRF Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) program recovers transplantation quality pancreas from organ donors throughout the USA. In addition to recovery of donors with T1D, non-diabetic donors include those with islet autoantibodies. Donors with type 2 diabetes and other conditions are also recovered to aid investigations directed at the full spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms affecting beta cells. One central processing laboratory conducts standardized procedures for sample processing, storage, and distribution, intended for current and future cutting edge investigations. Baseline histology characterizations are performed on the pancreatic samples, with images of the staining results provided though whole-slide digital scans. Uniquely, these high-grade biospecimens are provided without expense to investigators, working worldwide, seeking methods for disease prevention and reversal strategies. Collaborative working groups are highly encouraged, bringing together multiple investigators with different expertise to foster collaborations in several areas of critical need. This mini-review will provide some key histopathological findings emanating from the nPOD collection, including the heterogeneity of beta cell loss and islet inflammation (insulitis), beta cell mass, insulin-producing beta cells in chronic T1D, and pancreas weight reductions at disease onset. Analysis of variations in histopathology observed from these organ donors could provide for mechanistic differences related to etiological agents and serve an important function in terms of identifying the heterogeneity of T1D.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is widely used in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain. However, there is controversy over its true efficacy. We aimed to determine the efficacy of LLLT in the treatment of neck pain through systematically reviewing the literature. Study Design/Materials and Methods A search of computerized bibliographic databases covering medicine, physiotherapy, allied health, complementary medicine, and biological sciences was undertaken undertaken from date of inception until February 2004 for randomized controlled trials of LLLT for neck pain. A comprehensive list of search terms was applied and explicit inclusion criteria were developed a priori. Twenty studies were identified, five of which met the inclusion criteria. Results Significant positive effects were reported in four of five trials in which infrared wavelengths (??=?780, 810?830, 904, 1,064 nm) were used. Heterogeneity in outcome measures, results reporting, doses, and laser parameters precluded formal meta-analysis. Effect sizes could be calculated for only two of the studies. Conclusions This review provides limited evidence from one RCT for the use of infrared laser for the treatment of acute neck pain (n?=?71) and chronic neck pain from four RCTs (n?=?202). Larger studies are required to confirm the positive findings and determine the most effective laser parameters, sites and modes of application. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Composite tissue allotransplantations can be indicated when autologous transfers fail to restore human appearance. We report the reproducibility, difficulties, serious adverse events and outcomes of our patients. Five patients were included in a registered clinical research protocol after thorough screenings assessed by an independent expert committee systematically discussing the alternative options. One patient suffered from plexiform neurofibromas, two from third degree burns and two from gunshot injuries. They were included on a national waiting list with a dedicated face procurement procedure. Transplants were harvested from heart beating brain-dead donors before other tissues and organs. Induction immunosuppressive therapy included antithymocyte globulins, steroids, mycophenolate mophetil and tacrolimus. Maintenance therapy included the last three ones associated with extracorporeal-photopheresis. Four patients were transplanted with 7- to 38-month follow-up. One could not due to multiple panel reactive antibodies after 18 months on waiting list. Acute cellular rejections were controlled by conventional treatment. Opportunistic infections affected all patients and lead one patient to die two month after the transplantation. Voluntary facial activity appeared from 3 to 5 month. Face transplantation has been reproducible under conventional immunosuppression. Major improvements in facial aesthetic and function allowed patients to recover social relations and improved their quality of life.

AB  - Summary The origin of neuropathic pain may be difficult to diagnose unless an obvious predisposing lesion or injury to the nervous system is easily identified, or a genetic predisposition exists. Understanding the physiology and events that occur in the nervous system, originating from poorly managed acute pain, chronic pain or from primary lesions within the nervous system is important, as individual mechanisms causing pain are targets for therapeutic consideration. Some lesions may be amenable to surgical therapy, whereas others will require specific pharmacological intervention. In the human setting, the diagnosis of neuropathic pain may be based solely on history and examination findings as judged by an experienced clinician. The chapter illustrates examples of the more common clinical conditions causing neuropathic neck and back pain in cats and dogs. Prior to, and often during, any surgical procedure, various different analgesics and analgesic modalities can be used to reduce the inciting nociceptive afferent impulse.
