AB  - Background Hereditary angiodema (HAE), also known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, causes sufferers to experience episodic subcutaneous and submucosal oedema. These episodes can be triggered by dental treatment and manifest as life-threatening oedematous swelling in the head and neck region. Case Report This case report reviews an adolescent with hereditary angiodema whose malocclusion required orthodontic intervention. Due to her complex and unpredictable reaction to dental treatment, various options were explored before determining the appropriate care pathway for this patient. Trial placement of a sectional fixed appliance tested the tissue reaction prior to comprehensive treatment including extractions and fixed orthodontic appliances. Conclusion This report demonstrates successful interdisciplinary management facilitating orthodontic care in a patient with HAE.

AB  - Summary The origin of neuropathic pain may be difficult to diagnose unless an obvious predisposing lesion or injury to the nervous system is easily identified, or a genetic predisposition exists. Understanding the physiology and events that occur in the nervous system, originating from poorly managed acute pain, chronic pain or from primary lesions within the nervous system is important, as individual mechanisms causing pain are targets for therapeutic consideration. Some lesions may be amenable to surgical therapy, whereas others will require specific pharmacological intervention. In the human setting, the diagnosis of neuropathic pain may be based solely on history and examination findings as judged by an experienced clinician. The chapter illustrates examples of the more common clinical conditions causing neuropathic neck and back pain in cats and dogs. Prior to, and often during, any surgical procedure, various different analgesics and analgesic modalities can be used to reduce the inciting nociceptive afferent impulse.

AB  - Summary Oral medicine relates to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of nonsurgical and mostly nonodontogenic problems of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region, principally including oral mucosal diseases, salivary gland disorders, and orofacial pain. These problems can be subdivided into those that are local vs. those that represent oral manifestations of systemic disease and medical therapy. All oral medicine problems fall under one or more subjective complaints and/or objective signs. Patients may present with one or more of the following nine symptoms (i.e., subjective indicators): altered mucosa, pain/altered sensation, xerostomia/dry mouth, malodor, slow healing, swelling, bleeding, altered oral function (opening, eating, speaking, swallowing, etc.), or problems with teeth. This chapter serves as a problem-oriented approach to the more common oral medicine problems, and the approach is a categorization of these problems based upon presenting signs and symptoms.

AB  - Structured Abstract Authors ?? Shi S, Bartold PM, Miura M, Seo BM, Robey PG, Gronthos S Objectives ?? Identification, characterization, and potential application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from human dental tissues. Methods ?? Dental pulp and periodontal ligament were obtained from normal human impacted third molars. The tissues were digested in collagenase/dispase to generate single cell suspensions. Cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2?mM l-glutamine, 100??M l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Magnetic and fluorescence activated cell sorting were employed to characterize the phenotype of freshly isolated and ex vivo expanded cell populations. The developmental potential of cultured cells was assessed following co-transplantation with hydroxyapetite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) particles into immunocompromised mice for 8?weeks. Results ?? MSC were identified in adult human dental pulp (dental pulp stem cells, DPSC), human primary teeth (stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, SHED), and periodontal ligament (periodontal ligament stem cells, PDLSC) by their capacity to generate clongenic cell clusters in culture. Ex vivo expanded DPSC, SHED, and PDLSC populations expressed a heterogeneous assortment of makers associated with MSC, dentin, bone, smooth muscle, neural tissue, and endothelium. PDLSC were also found to express the tendon specific marker, Scleraxis. Xenogeneic transplants containing HA/TCP with either DPSC or SHED generated donor-derived dentin-pulp-like tissues with distinct odontoblast layers lining the mineralized dentin-matrix. In parallel studies, PDLSC generated cementum-like structures associated with PDL-like connective tissue when transplanted with HA/TCP into immunocompromised mice. Conclusion ?? Collectively, these data revealed the presence of distinct MSC populations associated with dental structures with the potential of stem cells to regenerate living human dental tissues in vivo.

AB  - Abstract On the basis of my engagement with myth over the decades, the present paper seeks to present some ?prolegomena? to the study of myth today. It does so, in the first place, by a short overview of philosophical contributions and implications of the study of myth. After formulating and discussing a possible definition of myth, the argument focuses on two complementary perspectives in the scholarly approach to myth: the objectifying perspective of rupture versus the participatory and identifying perspective of fusion. After indicating the pros and cons of both, and giving an example (notably, the ?hero fights monster? mytheme) of extensive continuity in myth through space and time, the paper concludes with a summary of the main results of the author's current long-range comparative research into leopard and leopard-skin symbolism, which is informed by loosely interlocking mythical complexes extending all across the Old World and part of the New World, over a time span from the Upper Palaeolithic to the present.
