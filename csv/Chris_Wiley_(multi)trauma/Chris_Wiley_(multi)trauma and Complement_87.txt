AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2010; 16: 722?728 Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the impact on healthcare resource utilization and associated costs of bacteraemia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) vs. methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains in Spain. An observational, retrospective, cohort multicentre study was conducted during 2005. The target population comprised Spanish patients with S. aureus bacteraemia (five and ten cases per hospital for resistant and susceptible strains, respectively). The resources used were obtained from the hospital patient records. The unit costs were obtained from the participating hospitals and from Spanish databases; the costs of a bacteraemic episode were estimated from resource utilization results and expressed in euros (?). Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed. The clinical records of 366 valid patients with S. aureus bacteraemia (121 MRSA and 245 MSSA) from 27 Spanish hospitals were reviewed. Resource use per bacteraemic episode was higher for MRSA cases than for MSSA cases, with longer antibiotic treatment (3.1 additional days) and greater length of hospital stay (LOS) (2.2 additional days), more diagnostic tests, and higher rates of admission to the intensive-care unit (ICU) (7.6%). As a consequence, a higher cost per episode was incurred, with an additional ?1205 in episodes of MRSA infections (1.12-fold increase). The main drivers of the cost difference were the higher rates of ICU admission and hospital re-admission and increased LOS. The analysis confirmed that there were additional costs due to resistant strains, ranging from ?293 to ?5188. Overall, MRSA was associated with higher costs in bacteraemic patients, and this was attributable mainly to the greater rate of ICU admissions and increased LOS.

AB  - ABSTRACT Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during ?off-line? states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, ?p-ripples,? which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review. ? 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Changes in the differential blood cell count, monocyte phenotype and the cytokine plasma levels in a group of seven patients with cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and nine patients with thoracic surgery/without CPB, both receiving identical opioid-based anaesthetic technique, were assessed. A significant reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes was observed after anaesthesia and surgery. Interestingly, at the end of surgery as well as 1 day post-surgery a marked increase in the number of granulocytes was noted. General anaesthesia and surgery caused a significant reduction of HLA-DR and CD11c/CD18 molecules, starting immediately after induction of anaesthesia, and an increase of CD64 at day 1 after anaesthesia. The use of a CPB was followed by a significant reduction of CD32, CD16, CD54 and HLA-ABC antigens expression at the end of surgery. One day after surgery these parameters returned nearly to baseline values with the exception of CD54. A monocyte subpopulation, characterized by low CD14, high CD16 and HLA-DR expression (CD14+CD16+HLA-DR++) was found in both groups at each time point, and the percentage of this cell subset decreased from baseline to 24?h. The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 increased considerably during CPB. No dynamic changes of IL-1 level due to surgery or CPB were found. We conclude that anaesthesia as well as the use of CPB induced profound alterations in the number of circulating leucocytes, and in the phenotype of monocyte and cytokine production.

AB  - Abstract The short- and long-term thrombogenicity of implant materials is still unpredictable, which is a significant challenge for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. A knowledge-based approach for implementing biofunctions in materials requires a detailed understanding of the medical device in the biological system. In particular, the interplay between material and blood components/cells as well as standardized and commonly acknowledged in vitro test methods allowing a reproducible categorization of the material thrombogenicity requires further attention. Here, the status of in vitro thrombogenicity testing methods for biomaterials is reviewed, particularly taking in view the preparation of test materials and references, the selection and characterization of donors and blood samples, the prerequisites for reproducible approaches and applied test systems. Recent joint approaches in finding common standards for a reproducible testing are summarized and perspectives for a more disease oriented in vitro thrombogenicity testing are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article is in three parts. The first is an introduction to the cultural context of indigenous therapies in Australia and some traditional healers, known as Ngangkari, involved in its continuing presence. The second part comprises a discussion of the term ?psycho-therapy? in its broadest sense, followed by an outline of the methodology of the ?psychotherapy? of the Ngangkari, in which links are made between the concepts used by Ngangkari and traditional Western terms of psyche and therapeia. The third and final part leads into an extract from the speech given by the author at the 2011 Sigmund Freud Award ceremony at the World Congress for Psychotherapy held in Sydney in August 2011. The thrust of the article is to acknowledge and respect the long lineage of healing practices which have been maintained among indigenous people in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, and at the same time acknowledging the Western lineage of scientific practice. The article highlights the sustained incremental effort at collaboration between the two paradigms. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Summary Gap junctions provide pathways for direct communication between cells in almost all animal tissues. The junctional channels are freely permeable to small ions and molecules but not to macromolecules. A coupled cell population is as a consequence a partial syncytium, within which metabolites, cofactors, small control molecules and inorganic ions can all diffuse freely through the combined cytoplasmic compartment, while intracellular macromolecules remain relatively fixed in space, in the cells where they are synthesized. Little is known about the extent and distribution of these communication compartments in tissues. To further understand their significance, we have mapped the patterns of junctional communication in skin by intracellular injection of the tracer dye Lucifer Yellow. Cells in the dermal layer are widely coupled, with dye spreading through hundreds of cells in a few minutes. Dye spread in the epidermis is much more restricted, passing in the same time into only a few cells. Dermal-epidermal coupling is not normally detected but is occasionally seen in new-born mouse skin when hair follicles are starting to invaginate. Dermal cells are coupled to a band of follicular cells near the base of mature hair follicles, whereas sebaceous glands appear to be coupled units, isolated from surrounding cells.
