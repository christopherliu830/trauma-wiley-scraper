AB  - Abstract The fat embolism syndrome is an important complication of patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies because of severe morbidity and mortality. Our recent experience with three cases that survived with intensive supportive care and prompt use of transfusion stimulates this review. A high index of suspicion, prompt use of diagnostic tools, and aggressive clinical management are the keys to a successful outcome. Am. J. Hematol. 79:61?67, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Gap junctions provide pathways for direct communication between cells in almost all animal tissues. The junctional channels are freely permeable to small ions and molecules but not to macromolecules. A coupled cell population is as a consequence a partial syncytium, within which metabolites, cofactors, small control molecules and inorganic ions can all diffuse freely through the combined cytoplasmic compartment, while intracellular macromolecules remain relatively fixed in space, in the cells where they are synthesized. Little is known about the extent and distribution of these communication compartments in tissues. To further understand their significance, we have mapped the patterns of junctional communication in skin by intracellular injection of the tracer dye Lucifer Yellow. Cells in the dermal layer are widely coupled, with dye spreading through hundreds of cells in a few minutes. Dye spread in the epidermis is much more restricted, passing in the same time into only a few cells. Dermal-epidermal coupling is not normally detected but is occasionally seen in new-born mouse skin when hair follicles are starting to invaginate. Dermal cells are coupled to a band of follicular cells near the base of mature hair follicles, whereas sebaceous glands appear to be coupled units, isolated from surrounding cells.

AB  - Summary Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a serious and potentially fatal complication of transfusion of blood and blood components. TRALI is under-diagnosed and under-reported because of a lack of awareness. A number of models have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of TRALI: an antibody mediated model; a two-event biologically active mediator model; and a combined model. TRALI can occur with any type of blood product and can occur with as little as one unit. Its presentation is similar to other forms of acute lung injury and management is predominantly supportive. The main strategy in combating TRALI is prevention both through manipulation of the donor pool and through clinical strategies directed at reducing transfusion of blood products including, but not limited to, evidence-based lower transfusion thresholds. This article presents a review of TRALI and addresses the definition, pathology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention of the syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Skill-mix initiatives have provided opportunities for radiographers to develop roles and achieve their potential, thus contributing to radiographer retention rates and increased job satisfaction. This reflective article explores two radiographic roles within an interprofessional context including the implications for confidence, competence, and future sustainability. These were reporting roles which extended into two modalities, one into bone densitometry and another into ultrasound. This article discusses how successful skill mix can benefit the individual, their department, and NHS organization and that role expansion can develop a more dynamic and resourceful workforce with transferability of skills and attributes.

AB  - Abstract Angioedema is a rare adverse effect of the commonly used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and is reported to occur with a prevalence of 0.1%-0.7%. Although most ACEi-induced angioedema (ACEi-A) cases are mild, severe cases requiring intensive care and even resulting in death have been reported in the literature. The mechanisms underlying ACEi-A are not yet fully understood, but bradykinin and/or substance P accumulation resulting from inhibition of ACE is believed to play a crucial role. ACEi-A occurs at variable frequencies across different racial groups, suggesting a genetic association with the development of ACEi-A. To date, one genome-wide association study and several candidate gene studies have been published on the association of genetic variation with ACEi-A. Genetic associations reported have been attributed to several distinct mechanisms: (a) genes coding for alternative enzymes responsible for the degradation of bradykinin and/or substance P in the diminution of ACE activity (b) ACE gene function, (c) bradykinin receptor genes, (d) genes implicated in immune and inflammation regulation and (e) genes in the fibrinolytic and coagulation pathway. Despite several plausible genetic associations, there are currently no genetic variants with sufficient effect to be clinically useful. The low incidence of ACEi-A suggests that a combination of genomic approaches with the capability to detect potentially important variants might be required to shed light on the mechanism of this adverse reaction. Additionally, many non-genetic risk factors associated with ACEi-A suggest the potential contribution of epigenetic dysregulation.

AB  - Handover has major implications for patient care. The handover process between ambulance and emergency department (ED) staff has been sparsely investigated. The purpose of this paper is, based on a literature review, to identify and elaborate on the major factors influencing the ambulance to ED handover, and to bring suggestions on how to optimize this process. A literature search on handovers to EDs was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. A total of 18 papers were included. Issues regarding transfer of information are highlighted. Newer studies suggest that implementing a structured handover format holds the possibilities for improving the process. Electronic equipment could play a part in reducing problems. Cultural and organizational factors impact the process in different ways. The professions perceive the value and quality of information given differently. Giving and taking over responsibility is an important issue. The handover of patients to the ED has the potential to be improved. Cultural issues and a lack of professional recognition of handover importance need to be approached. Multidisciplinary training in combination with a structured tool may have a potential for changing the culture and improving handover.
