AB  - This article explores crisis support work in a UK local authority and identifies significant issues for management and practice. It is based upon three elements: a detailed search of relevant literature; analysis of official guidance; and fieldwork with crisis support workers, their managers and other professionals in partner agencies. The latter was based upon 44 interviews and the observation of key meetings over a 3-year period and includes a review of Crisis Support Team deployment at three major incidents between 2004 and 2007. Crisis support practice had much to commend it in terms of preparation, continuity, flexibility and proactive engagement with other agencies. Deployment to a wide range of ?minor? incidents was valuable in maintaining skills, motivation and inter-agency familiarity between major incidents. On the other hand, significant and sometimes serious issues emerged in terms of capacity, inter-agency communication and co-ordination and fragmentation of overall incident response.

AB  - Several major physio-pathological processes, including cancer, inflammatory states and thrombosis, are all strongly dependent upon the fine regulation of proteolytic enzyme activities, and dramatic are the consequences of unbalanced equilibria between enzymes and their cognate inhibitors. In this perspective, the discovery of small-molecule ligands able to modulate catalytic activities has a massive therapeutic potential and is a stimulating goal. Numerous recent experimental evidences revealed that proteolytic enzymes can be opportunely targeted, reporting on small ligands capable of binding to these biological macromolecules with drug-like potencies, and primarily with comparable (or even higher) efficiency with respect to their endogenous binding partner. In particular, natural occurring polyphenols and their derivatives recently disclosed these intriguing abilities, making them promising templates for drug design and development. In this review, we compared the inhibitory capacities of a set of monomeric polyphenols toward serine proteases activity, and finally summarized the data with an emphasis on the derivation of a pharmacophore model.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to investigate the initiation and course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early inflammatory response and to elucidate the cytokine system in relation to the adrenal response caused by stress. Seven blood samples were collected, pre- and postoperatively (0?72?h) after total hip replacement (THR) due to osteoarthritis. The following cytokines were measured using Cytometric Bead Array: interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 (B Wilcoxon test P?<?0.01) Repeated measurements were also significant (Friedman P?<?0.05). The concentration of IL-8 doubled the day of surgery but did not reach a significant level (Friedman test =0.069). None of the other cytokines showed any significant changes. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was interrupted after the surgery and there was a significant correlation between the cortisol secretion and IL-6 response. This study demonstrates an isolated elevation in IL-6 levels with only a minor elevation in IL-8 following THR. This pro-inflammatory response seemed to decline without activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), but cortisol seemed to play a complicated role in halting the acute inflammatory response.

AB  - Inflammatory and immune responses play important roles following ischaemic stroke. Inflammatory responses contribute to damage and also contribute to repair. Injury to tissue triggers an immune response. This is initiated through activation of the innate immune system. In stroke there is microglial activation. This is followed by an influx of lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain, triggered by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response contributes to further tissue injury. There is also a systemic immune response to stroke, and there is a degree of immunosuppression that may contribute to the stroke patient's risk of infection. This immunosuppressive response may also be protective, with regulatory lymphocytes producing cytokines and growth factors that are neuroprotective. The specific targets of the immune response after stroke are not known, and the details of the immune and inflammatory responses are only partly understood. The role of inflammation and immune responses after stroke is twofold. The immune system may contribute to damage after stroke, but may also contribute to repair processes. The possibility that some of the immune response after stroke may be neuroprotective is exciting and suggests that deliberate enhancement of these responses may be a therapeutic option.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.
