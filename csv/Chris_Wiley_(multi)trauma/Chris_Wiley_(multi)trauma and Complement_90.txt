AB  - Abstract Aim The study purpose is to explore adolescent and adult women's experiences, perceptions, beliefs, knowledge and behaviours related to bladder health across the life course using a socioecological perspective. Lower urinary tract symptoms affect between 20?40% of young adult to middle-aged women, with symptoms increasing in incidence and severity with aging. There is limited evidence to address bladder health promotion and prevention of dysfunction. This first study of the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium is designed to address gaps in existing qualitative research in this area. Design This focus group study will be implemented across seven geographically diverse United States research centres using a semi-structured focus group guide informed by a conceptual framework based on the socioecological model. Methods The study was approved in July 2017. A total of 44 focus groups composed of 6?8 participants representing six different age categories (ranging from 11 to over 65 years) will be completed. We aim to recruit participants with diverse demographic and personal characteristics including race, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, urban/rural residence, physical/health conditions, and urinary symptom experience. Six of the focus groups will be conducted in Spanish and translated into English. Focus group transcripts will undergo content analysis and data interpretation to identify and classify themes and articulate emerging themes. Discussion This foundational qualitative study seeks to develop an evidence base to inform future research on bladder health promotion in adolescent and adult women. Impact This study has the potential to provide new insights and understanding into adolescent and adult women's lived experience of bladder health, the experience of lower urinary symptoms and knowledge and beliefs across the life course.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous enteritis and lymphadenitis in ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberuclosis. To investigate the efficacy of assays for early diagnosis, experimental infections were performed in goat kids. Oral doses of M. a. paratuberculosis were administered to goat kids over extended periods and the resulting infection was followed for 12?24?months. Complementary experiments were performed on goat kids vaccinated against M. a. paratuberculosis. Immunological, pathological and morphological examinations were undertaken in both these experimental systems. The analysis of results from these experiment series provided novel insights into the influence of the biology of gut-associated lymphoid tissue on the progress of disease, into the character of the tissue granuloma and its dominance of the local tissue response and into the relationship between the local and systemic immune responses.

AB  - Abstract We report on two patients with de novo subtelomeric terminal deletion of chromosome 6p. Patient 1 is an 8-month-old female born with normal growth parameters, typical facial features of 6pter deletion, bilateral corectopia, and protruding tongue. She has severe developmental delay, profound bilateral neurosensory deafness, poor visual contact, and hypsarrhythmia since the age of 6 months. Patient 2 is a 5-year-old male born with normal growth parameters and unilateral hip dysplasia; he has a characteristic facial phenotype, bilateral embryotoxon, and moderate mental retardation. Further characterization of the deletion, using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH; Agilent Human Genome kit 244 K), revealed that Patient 1 has a 8.1 Mb 6pter-6p24.3 deletion associated with a contiguous 5.8 Mb 6p24.3-6p24.1 duplication and Patient 2 a 5.7 Mb 6pter-6p25.1 deletion partially overlapping with that of Patient 1. Complementary FISH and array analysis showed that the inv del dup(6) in Patient 1 originated de novo. Our results demonstrate that simple rearrangements are often more complex than defined by standard techniques. We also discuss genotype?phenotype correlations including previously reported cases of deletion 6p. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract A successful biomaterial?neural tissue interface should demonstrate biocompatibility, cytocompatibility, the ability to integrate properly within neural tissues, and the prolonged maintenance of desired electrical properties. Neural electrodes implanted in vivo often experience degradation of these properties due to implant micromotion, mechanical mismatch, an extensive foreign-body response, and the formation of glial scar tissue that interfere with signal transmission. However, recent advances in nanotechnology and nanomaterials show great promise to address these problems due to their biologically inspired surface features and enhanced electrical properties. This review will discuss how nanomaterials and nanotechnology are being used to fabricate advanced neural electrodes that demonstrate greater bio-integration properties, enhanced prolonged electrical properties, and an improved signal specificity down to the single molecule range. First, an overview of current biomaterial?neural tissue interface technology is provided, followed by an examination of conventional and newly developed micro- and nano-fabrication methodologies. Nanomaterials that have shown the most promise for neural interfacial applications are then discussed, including carbon nanomaterials, conductive polymers, and hybrid nanomaterials. The purpose of this review is to describe recent advances in nanotechnology for improved biomaterial?neural tissue interfaces, and identify their advantages and disadvantages from a researcher's perspective.

AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.

AB  - The synthesis of factors that monitor the expression of the Thy-l cell surface component by marker-negative precursor cells requires an intact left cerebral cortex, whereas the activity of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, an immunopotentiator that increases this synthesis, seems to require an intact right neocortex. These results suggest a role for the cerebral cortex in the coordinated interregulation of lymphocyte subclasses. The finding extends previous information suggesting relationships between the central nervous system and the T-cell arm of the immune system.

AB  - In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks. Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations, and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully, significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational, and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics, this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.

AB  - Abstract This review updates previous similar papers published in JFT in 2000, 2009 and 2014. It presents evidence from meta-analyses, systematic literature reviews, narrative literature reviews and controlled trials for the effectiveness of systemic interventions for families of children and adolescents with common mental health problems and other difficulties. In this context, systemic interventions include both family therapy and other family-based approaches such as parent training, or parent implemented behavioural programmes. The evidence supports the effectiveness of systemic interventions either alone or as part of multimodal programmes for sleep, feeding and attachment problems in infancy; recovery from child abuse and neglect; conduct problems, emotional problems, eating disorders, somatic problems, and first episode psychosis.
