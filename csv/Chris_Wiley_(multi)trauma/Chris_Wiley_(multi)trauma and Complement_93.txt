AB  - In adults, acute lung injury or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may complicate a wide range of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which involve direct pulmonary insult. The characteristic histological feature of ARDS is an intense inflammatory process in the lungs, which may progress to fibrosis. The earliest physiological characteristic is an increase in the protein permeability across the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lungs. This clinical syndrome is characterized by arterial hypoxaemia and bilateral radiographic infiltrates, which represent protein-rich oedema fluid. In addition there is a neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrate. ?Pulmonary endothelium is actively involved in the development of ARDS. It alters cell?cell adhesion as the initial step in leucocyte migration which, in turn, changes the permeability that allows protein-rich fluid to move into the interstitium. The quantity of this interstitial oedema may be sufficient to cause bulk flow through the epithelial barrier. There is probably independent epithelial injury. Finally, the endothelium can release and metabolize vasoactive and inflammatory substances, such as endothelins, nitric oxide and cytokines, etc. No single substance is responsible for acute lung injury, but rather a complex interplay exists between diverse pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.

AB  - Recent advances in nanotechnology have generated wide interest in applying nanomaterials for neural prostheses. An ideal neural interface should create seamless integration into the nervous system and performs reliably for long periods of time. As a result, many nanoscale materials not originally developed for neural interfaces become attractive candidates to detect neural signals and stimulate neurons. In this comprehensive review, an overview of state-of-the-art microelectrode technologies provided first, with focus on the material properties of these microdevices. The advancements in electro?active nanomaterials are then reviewed, including conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon nanowires, and hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials, for neural recording, stimulation, and growth. Finally, technical and scientific challenges are discussed regarding biocompatibility, mechanical mismatch, and electrical properties faced by these nanomaterials for the development of long-lasting functional neural interfaces.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement This article calls attention to a promising area of research and practice with great societal impact: the potential of people?plant interactions to transform individuals and communities. Overall, the article connects insights from the practice of therapeutic horticulture to broader perspectives from social theory. A better understanding of these connections can increase opportunities for meaningful human engagements with plants and encourage implementation of interventions that might contribute to the flourishing of personal, community, and ecological life. Summary This article investigates some of the important contributions that plant environments can make to the transformation of the self, and to social life more generally. While therapeutic horticulture practices demonstrate the positive impacts that plants have on human health, social theories of the self do not typically account for what can be learned from these practices. Accordingly, this article reviews theories of the self with an eye toward understanding how people?plant interactions invite new approaches to the self. This perspective demonstrates that, much like living plant ecologies, the self can be conceived as highly relational and interdependent. A spectrum of people?plant interactions is introduced to clarify the variety of possible situations that might contribute to the emergence of a more ecological self. Conclusions about how the experience of people?plant interactions contributes to the transformation of the self are offered, with relevance for future scholarly research and horticultural practice.

AB  - Background:? The task of fostering today is a complex one and foster carers need good quality support. This paper discusses a consultation service for foster carers. Method:? It draws upon our qualitative experiences to explore the important themes that have emerged during the provision of the consultation service. Results:? Foster carers are highly satisfied with the consultation service, which provides them with improved levels of access to psychological advice, a different understanding of the children, and continuing support if required. Discussion:? The reasons for this satisfaction, together with some of the difficulties we have experienced, are explored. Experimental research is needed to investigate the complex relationship between consultation, support, confidence and understanding for foster carers and to consider the long-term effects of consultation for the carer and the child.

AB  - Summary Until recently, the literature on treatment for intimate partner violence (IPV) offenders largely has focused on male partner-abusers. Few studies have been conducted on treatment effectiveness with female IPV. As a result, much of discussion in this chapter focuses on the treatments that have been developed for male partner-abusers and then adapted for females and same-sex couples. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and feminist-based psychoeducation approaches are addressed first, followed by psychodynamic and interpersonal models of treatment, and more recent integrated approaches that include motivational approaches such as motivational interviewing. Couples treatment versus group treatment is also addressed. It is important to note that treatments will vary for groups, couples, and individuals on the basis of offenders' experiences with issues such as oppression, racism, and prior victimization.

AB  - Summary A therapist is neither an artist nor a scientist. And yet the therapist's activity involves both art and science. The therapist knows how to negotiate a way between knowledge and skill, and appreciates what he or she must not try to explore. Thus, somewhat contradictorily no doubt, the therapist must know the contexts in which it is best not to intervene as well as the points where it is proper to do so. The therapist has to act locally, while, at the same time, thinking globally enough for what he or she is doing to be pertinent.
