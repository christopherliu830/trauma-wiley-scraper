AB  - Summary A therapist is neither an artist nor a scientist. And yet the therapist's activity involves both art and science. The therapist knows how to negotiate a way between knowledge and skill, and appreciates what he or she must not try to explore. Thus, somewhat contradictorily no doubt, the therapist must know the contexts in which it is best not to intervene as well as the points where it is proper to do so. The therapist has to act locally, while, at the same time, thinking globally enough for what he or she is doing to be pertinent.

AB  - Abstract Chaperone networks are dysregulated with aging, but whether compromised Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone function disturbs neuronal resilience is unknown. Stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STI1; STIP1; HOP) is a co-chaperone that simultaneously interacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90, but whose function in vivo remains poorly understood. We combined in-depth analysis of chaperone genes in human datasets, analysis of a neuronal cell line lacking STI1 and of a mouse line with a hypomorphic Stip1 allele to investigate the requirement for STI1 in aging. Our experiments revealed that dysfunctional STI1 activity compromised Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone network and neuronal resilience. The levels of a set of Hsp90 co-chaperones and client proteins were selectively affected by reduced levels of STI1, suggesting that their stability depends on functional Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery. Analysis of human databases revealed a subset of co-chaperones, including STI1, whose loss of function is incompatible with life in mammals, albeit they are not essential in yeast. Importantly, mice expressing a hypomorphic STI1 allele presented spontaneous age-dependent hippocampal neurodegeneration and reduced hippocampal volume, with consequent spatial memory deficit. We suggest that impaired STI1 function compromises Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone activity in mammals and can by itself cause age-dependent hippocampal neurodegeneration in mice.

AB  - Abstract:? We reviewed all occurrences of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in children under 17?years of age who were evaluated at Sainte-Justine Hospital, a tertiary-care pediatric center, between 1980 and 2002. The medical records and histologic features of all were reviewed. Eight patients were identified, three boys and five girls. The interval between apparent onset and diagnosis ranged from 3?months to 14?years. All lesions except one were removed by surgical excision with a margin of 1.5 to 3?cm including underlying fascia or by Mohs technique. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 15?years with median of 5?years. To date all the patients are alive and none has had a recurrence.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.

AB  - Summary Hellmut Hartert was the first person to exploit the viscoelastic properties of clotting blood to measure blood coagulation in 1948. Since then, the technology has improved, allowing these analyses to be performed as point-of-care tests with immediately-available results. The addition of several activators and inhibitors to the original assay creates a panel of tests able to quantify the different aspects of blood clotting that can rival conventional laboratory assays. However, although much progress has been made, the standardization and validation of these tests still need improvement. Viscoelastic analyses of blood coagulation are mainly used to guide haemostatic therapy in bleeding patients and have proven superior to standard clotting tests in some circumstances. There is potential to extend their use to other areas, such as drug monitoring, and diagnosis and management of congenital bleeding disorders. The forthcoming cartridge-based assays are expected to improve the reliability and usability of viscoelastic assays of blood coagulation but high quality clinical trials remain urgently needed to determine their exact place, benefit and cost effectiveness.

AB  - Background Despite calls for integration of neurobiological methods into research on youth resilience (high competence despite high adversity), we know little about structural brain correlates of resilient functioning. The aim of the current study was to test for brain regions uniquely associated with positive functioning in the context of adversity, using detailed phenotypic classification. Methods 1,870 European adolescents (Mage = 14.56 years, SDage = 0.44 years, 51.5% female) underwent MRI scanning and completed behavioral and psychological measures of stressful life events, academic competence, social competence, rule-abiding conduct, personality, and alcohol use. Results The interaction of competence and adversity identified two regions centered on the right middle and superior frontal gyri; grey matter volumes in these regions were larger in adolescents experiencing adversity who showed positive adaptation. Differences in these regions among competence/adversity subgroups were maintained after controlling for several covariates and were robust to alternative operationalization decisions for key constructs. Conclusions We demonstrate structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience, and suggest that right prefrontal structures are implicated in adaptive functioning for youth who have experienced adversity.
