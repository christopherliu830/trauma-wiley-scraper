AB  - Abstract Emerging evidence supports the involvement of autophagy in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play fundamental roles in various cellular processes, including autophagy. However, it remains largely unknown as to how autophagy is regulated by miRNAs and lncRNAs in IDD. Biological functions of miR-153-3p and long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 641 (LINC00641) were investigated. Luciferase reporter assays was done to validate miR-153-3p targets. To induce nutritional stress, nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were cultured in the normal nutritional condition and the low nutritional condition. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze miR-153-3p and LINC00641 in response to nutrient deprivation. Autophagic activity was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, western blot analysis and green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 puncta. Pull-down assay and RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization were performed to validate LINC00641 target and the location. MiR-153-3p is downregulated in NP tissues from IDD patients. Further, LINC00641 can affect collagen II and matrix metalloproteinase-3 expressions. Upregulation of LINC00641 and downregulation of miR-153-3p are detected in NP cells under nutritional stress. LINC00641 can regulate autophagic cell death by targeting miR-153-3p and autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5). MiR-153-3p inhibits autophagy and IDD by targeting ATG5. More important, LINC00641 targets miR-153-3p, and thus affects ATG5 expression, autophagic cell death and IDD. These findings uncover a novel regulatory pathway that is composed of LINC00641, miR-153-3p, and ATG5 in IDD. This mechanism may stimulate to a more understanding of IDD pathogenesis and provide new sights for the treatment of this disorder.

AB  - Abstract Out of the Armchair TIMOTHY C. BATES Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, UK tim.bates@ed.ac.uk Penke et al. (this issue) attempt to explain personality and cognition from theory rather than empirical study. This overstates the constraints on evolution, while underestimating the power of cross-species HapMap data to directly identify our evolutionary history. Independent of armchair-speculation, information benefiting human understanding, health and well-being is flowing from exactly the research the target suggests should not be pursued.

BELL2 1Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis, USA asih@ucdavis.edu 2Department of Integrative Biology, University of Illinois, Urbana, USA alisonmb@life.uiuc.edu Behavioural ecologists have recently begun emphasising behavioural syndromes, an analogue of personality. This new area offers several insights for the evolutionary genetics of human personality. In particular, it suggests that human personality research could benefit from emphasising: the evolution of reaction norms, correlational selection, indirect genetic effects (IGE), G?E correlations, social situation and partner choice and social networks.

KRUEGER Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota?Twin Cities, USA south088@umn.edu, krueg038@umn.edu We expand on the theme of transactions between persons and situations, and genes and environments. Newer models for twin data can handle genotype-environment transaction effects explicitly, and such models can be used to better articulate the origins of variation in personality.

Neurogenetic Mechanisms Underlying Cognition and Temperament ALEXANDER STROBEL Department of Psychology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt/Main, Germany alex.strobel@gmx.de This commentary discusses the target paper's sharp distinction between neurogenetic mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities and temperament. Evidence for associations of genetic polymorphisms with both temperament traits and cognitive control functions and for a shared or at least overlapping neuroanatomy and neuromodulation of cognitive control and of temperament traits may imply that we should consider the existence of cognitive reaction norms.

The Relevance of Personality Disorders for an Evolutionary Genetics of Personality ALFONSO TROISI Department of Neurosciences, University of Rome, Italy alfonso.troisi@uniroma2.it The epidemiology of personality disorders confirms the importance of the evolutionary approach to a better understanding of individual differences in personality traits and adds credibility to the evolutionary genetic model. A full appreciation of the potential of the evolutionary genetic framework requires a critical revision of current measures of personality. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The Need for Inter-disciplinary Research in Personality Studies KEES VAN OERS Department of Animal Population Biology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology, The Netherlands k.vanoers@nioo.knaw.nl The target paper demonstrates the value of evolutionary genetics for personality research. Apart from a summing-up of concepts, the authors validate their theory with evidence from studies on both human- and animal personality. In this commentary, I want to show the need for inter-disciplinary research to answer questions on personality in psychology and biology. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Blood transfusion in surgery has long been understood to carry a fair amount of clinical risk despite its obvious benefits. For this reason, blood loss conservation and other methods for minimization of transfusion have become of paramount importance for the advancement of ongoing safe care of the surgical patient. This chapter will serve as an overall guide to understanding the availability, cost, and usage of blood products in surgery. Additionally, we will discuss techniques used during procedures that play a role in minimization of transfusion. Further, the potential benefits of unnecessary blood transfusion in surgical patients will be explained with a goal of improving outcomes in the future.

AB  - Abstract The study of wildlife health greatly contributes to understanding population dynamics and detecting conservation threats. The determination of the different fractions of plasma proteins (proteinogram) is an important laboratory tool to study wildlife health. The aim of this study was to characterize protein electrophoresis in wild Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) from north-western Patagonia and to evaluate differences according to age and sex classes. Once reference values of wild, apparently healthy individuals, were established, we compared these values to those of individuals received at the Buenos Aires Zoo in Argentina for rehabilitation due to various health problems. Reference proteinograms from wild Andean condors differed only in the α 1 and ? 2-fractions between sex categories. Males showed higher concentrations of these protein fractions than females. We found clear differences between wild birds and rehabilitating individuals. Total proteins, globulins, α 1-globulins, total α-globulins, ? 2-globulins, total ?-globulins, and ?-globulins were significantly higher in rehabilitating than in wild individuals, whereas albumin, α 2, and ?1-globulins were similar between these groups. The albumin/globulin ratio, as a general indicator of health, was significantly lower in rehabilitating than in wild individuals. The results indicate the effects on different protein fractions of pathologic processes occurring in individuals undergoing rehabilitation. Our results provide useful insights, contributing to improving diagnoses and prognoses in this species. This information may also be useful to assess the health status of Andean condors in studies of wild populations and for comparisons with other bird species.

AB  - Abstract Turner syndrome is recognized now as a syndrome familiar not only to pediatricians and pediatric specialists, medical geneticists, adult endocrinologists, and cardiologists, but also increasingly to primary care providers, internal medicine specialists, obstetricians, and reproductive medicine specialists. In addition, the care of women with Turner syndrome may involve social services, and various educational and neuropsychologic therapies. This article focuses on the recognition and management of Turner syndrome from adolescents in transition, through adulthood, and into another transition as older women. It can be viewed as an interpretation of recent international guidelines, complementary to those recommendations, and in some instances, an update. An attempt was made to provide an international perspective. Finally, the women and families who live with Turner syndrome and who inspired several sections, are themselves part of the broad readership that may benefit from this review.
