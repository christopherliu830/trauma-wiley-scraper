AB  - Abstract The study of wildlife health greatly contributes to understanding population dynamics and detecting conservation threats. The determination of the different fractions of plasma proteins (proteinogram) is an important laboratory tool to study wildlife health. The aim of this study was to characterize protein electrophoresis in wild Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) from north-western Patagonia and to evaluate differences according to age and sex classes. Once reference values of wild, apparently healthy individuals, were established, we compared these values to those of individuals received at the Buenos Aires Zoo in Argentina for rehabilitation due to various health problems. Reference proteinograms from wild Andean condors differed only in the α 1 and ? 2-fractions between sex categories. Males showed higher concentrations of these protein fractions than females. We found clear differences between wild birds and rehabilitating individuals. Total proteins, globulins, α 1-globulins, total α-globulins, ? 2-globulins, total ?-globulins, and ?-globulins were significantly higher in rehabilitating than in wild individuals, whereas albumin, α 2, and ?1-globulins were similar between these groups. The albumin/globulin ratio, as a general indicator of health, was significantly lower in rehabilitating than in wild individuals. The results indicate the effects on different protein fractions of pathologic processes occurring in individuals undergoing rehabilitation. Our results provide useful insights, contributing to improving diagnoses and prognoses in this species. This information may also be useful to assess the health status of Andean condors in studies of wild populations and for comparisons with other bird species.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important causes of mortality in thalassemic patients is infectious disease. Thalassemic patients develop severe invasive infection caused by microorganisms that are rare in healthy individuals. We describe the case of a 13-year-old splenectomized boy who presented with septic shock and who died 36?h after admission, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive supportive care. Serratia marcescens was isolated from cultures of blood and tracheal aspirate. It is known that rare microorganisms will cause severe community-acquired infection in splenectomized patients with thalassemia major.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.

AB  - Summary Membrane-bound and intracellular immune receptors respond to microbial pathogens by initiating signaling cascades that result in production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial factors. These host responses need to be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage and other harmful consequences of excessive inflammation. CARD-only proteins (COPs) and Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are human- and primate-specific dominant negative inhibitors that modulate inflammatory and innate immune responses. In addition, several poxviruses encode POPs that interfere with inflammatory and host defense responses. COPs and POPs modulate inflammatory signaling at several checkpoints by sequestering key components of the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling cascades, thus hampering downstream signal transduction. Here, we review and discuss current understanding of the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms by which roles of host- and virus-encoded COPs and POPs may regulate inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, we address their (patho)physiological roles and highlight topics for further research.
