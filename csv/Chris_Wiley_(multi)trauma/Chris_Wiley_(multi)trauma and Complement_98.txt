AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.

AB  - AbstractBackground: Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) report greater stress and negative health consequences than nonabused women. Although an association between psychological stress and altered immune function has been shown, IPV studies have not investigated this relationship. Objective: This study explored the association of IPV with mental health symptoms and an immune marker to determine if posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms mediate the effect of IPV on pro-inflammatory (IFN-?) cytokine levels. Methods: A cross-sectional, comparative design was used to compare 62 women with IPV and 39 nonabused women. Results: Mean IFN-? values were higher in abused women and in women with current PTSD symptoms. There were no significant relationships with potential confounding variables that could provide an alternative explanation for the increase in production of proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: PTSD symptoms mediate the association between IPV and IFN-? levels and may partially explain the association of mental health symptoms with physical health sequelae in IPV.

AB  - Psychotherapy researchers have increasingly called for clinical practice and training to focus on empirically supported therapies tested in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). In this paper, we report data from a naturalistic study of successful treatments in clinical practice that bear on the external validity of ESTs for three disorders. Participants were 242 experienced doctoral-level clinicians who reported on their last successfully treated patient seeking treatment for clinically significant depression, panic, or anxiety without panic. Successful treatments typically take substantially longer than the 8?16 sessions characteristic of efficacy trials for these disorders, even for the briefest treatments (cognitive-behavioural). Of particular relevance for generalizability from RCTs, most patients in clinical practice present with multiple problems other than a single Axis I disorder, which clinicians of all theoretical orientations recognize and treat, and these co-occurring conditions have a substantial impact on treatment length in everyday practice. The data suggest the importance of effectiveness research in bridging research and practice. They also point to the utility of distinguishing two complementary ways in which effectiveness research can be understood and implemented: by starting with efficacy trials and then testing treatments with promising results in the laboratory using broader community samples; or by starting with everyday clinical practice, examining patterns of covariation between specific interventions and outcomes at clinically meaningful follow-up intervals with diverse and ecologically valid samples and using these data to generate prototypes of treatments that can be used to guide the next generation of experimental studies.

AB  - Objectives Rhinoplasty is commonly performed in children with congenital anomalies and resultant nasal deformity causing airway obstruction. Little is known regarding patient factors or perioperative sequelae. We define demographic characteristics and perioperative complications for children undergoing rhinoplasty within a large national cohort. Study Design Retrospective cohort study of children aged?≤?18 years undergoing rhinoplasty utilizing data from the 2012 to 2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric public use file. Methods All children who underwent rhinoplasty were identified. Postoperative complications were defined as 30-day postoperative infection, unplanned readmission and reoperation, and death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of complications. Subgroup analysis was performed based on child age (age?<?5 years vs. 5?13 years vs.?≥?14 years). Results Of 1,378 children undergoing rhinoplasty, 21(1.52%) children experienced complications, with the most common being unplanned readmission. Younger children were more likely to experience complications (3.79% aged?<?5 years vs. 0.66% aged?≥?14 years; P?=?0.001). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we observed a 61% decreased odds of complication with each age group (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.19, 0.77; P?=?0.007). Younger children were more likely to be male (56.2% male aged?<?5 years vs. 46.6% male aged?≥?14 years; P?=?0.011), have developmental delay (11.7% aged?<?5 years vs. 3.65% aged?≥?14 years; P?<?0.001), and have craniofacial abnormalities (73.2% aged?<?5 years vs. 42.1% aged?≥?14 years; P?<?0.001). Conclusion Children undergoing rhinoplasty experience few major complications, with the most common being unplanned readmission. Younger children are at greater risk and are more likely to be male with craniofacial abnormalities. Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 129:494?499, 2019

AB  - Summary Nonsmall cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and worldwide. Locally advanced lung cancer that invades adjacent organs typically has a poor prognosis. Historically, this type of lung cancer was not treated surgically. However, long-term survival of locally advanced lung cancer without surgical resection is not common. Over the past several years, improvements in imaging, surgical technique, perioperative care and advances in other complementary treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiation have led to more aggressive resections with curative intent. This chapter reviews assessment, staging, surgical strategies, and outcomes for surgical resection of lung cancer invading the chest wall, vertebral body, great vessels, and other adjacent structures.
