AB  - Aims Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy. Methods and results This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

AB  - Between january 1974 and april 1986, 440 patients underwent elective or emergency repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms at this hospital. Acute renal failure requiring dialysis following repair occurred in 32 patients (7.3%) and form the basis of this report. All were male patients of mean age 69 years; 21 (66%) gave a history of other major medical problems and 19 (59%) used medication for these medical conditions. Twelve patients (37.5%) survived to leave hospital. No differences were observed between survivors and non-survivors with regard to age, previous medical condition, drug therapy, or creatinine value on admission. Mode of presentation, duration of surgery, frequency of hypotension and number of blood transfusions were similar in both groups. Total hospital stay and duration of intensive care were distributed equally between the two groups. Those who survived seemed to require less inotropic support and a shorter duration of ventilation than the non-survivors; the continued need for these supports and persistent leucocytosis > 15000/mm3 were associated with little chance of survival.

AB  - Abstract Aims Diabetic kidney disease independently predicts cardiovascular disease and premature death. We examined the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD, defined as an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and quality of care in a cross-sectional survey of adults (age ≥ 18 years) with Type 2 diabetes across Asia. Methods The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation programme is a disease-management programme implemented using an electronic portal that systematically captures clinical characteristics of all patients enrolled. Between July 2007 and December 2012, data on 28 110 consecutively enrolled patients (China: 3415, Hong Kong: 15 196, India: 3714, Korea: 1651, Philippines: 3364, Vietnam: 692, Taiwan: 78) were analysed. Results In this survey, 15.9% of patients had CKD, 25.0% had microalbuminuria and 12.5% had macroalbuminuria. Patients with CKD were less likely to achieve HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) (36.0% vs. 42.3%) and blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg (20.8% vs. 35.3%), and were more likely to have retinopathy (26.2% vs. 8.7%), sensory neuropathy (29.0% vs. 7.7%), cardiovascular disease (26.6% vs. 8.7%) and self-reported hypoglycaemia (18.9% vs. 8.2%). Despite high frequencies of albuminuria (74.8%) and dyslipidaemia (93.0%) among CKD patients, only 49.0% were using renin?angiotensin system inhibitors and 53.6% were on statins. On logistic regression, old age, male gender, tobacco use, long disease duration, high HbA1c, blood pressure and BMI, and low LDL cholesterol were independently associated with CKD (all P < 0.05). Conclusions The poor control of risk factors, suboptimal use of organ-protective drugs and high frequencies of hypoglycaemia highlight major treatment gaps in patients with diabetic kidney disease in Asia.

AB  - Abstract? Background and Aim of the Study: Patients with low ejection farction (EF) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) usually have a higher incidence of mortality and morbidity. In this retrospective study, we sought to detect significant preoperative predictors of early mortality in these patients. Methods: Patients with an EF of ≤30% who underwent isolated CABG in Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, the Netherlands, between January 1998 and December 2008 (n = 413) were included in this study. All the preoperative patient-related risk factors were entered into a logistic regression analysis model to detect the significant predictors of early mortality. Results: Patients with an EF of ≤30% represent 4.1% of the whole CABG population. The overall early mortality in this patient group was 9.1%. Risk factors for early mortality as identified by the univariate analysis were age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prior CABG, New York Heart association (NYHA) class, emergency operation, preoperative serum creatinine (SeCr), and preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level. These factors were entered into the multivariate analysis and were all identified as independent risk factors for early mortality. Conclusions: This study confirmed the impact of some well-known preoperative risk factors on early outcome in patients with low EF undergoing CABG. In addition, we have shown the predictive value of preoperative SeCr and hemoglobin level that have not yet been described.?(J Card Surg 2011;26:9-15)

AB  - Abstract Each year since 2012, the number of lung transplants has increased, reflecting an increase in the number of donors, improved use of recovered organs, and more candidates being listed for transplant. However, the need for organs continues to outpace available donors. Despite an increase of 126 donors in 2017, 1360 candidates remained on the waiting list at the end of the year, and 326 patients died or became too sick to undergo transplant. Approximately 14,000 individuals were living with a lung transplant in 2017; 9492 were aged 50 years or older, 4075 were aged 18-49 years, and 408 were aged younger than 18 years.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess quality of life (QOL) in 119 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and 89 hemodialysis (HD) patients using the SF-36 instrument (PF?=?physical function, RP?=?role limitations physical, BP?= bodily pain, GH?=?general health perceptions, VT?=?vitality, SF?=?social function, RE?=?role limitations emotional, MH?=?mental health, MCS?=?mental summary, and PCS?= physical summary). The mean (range) s-creatinine in the CKD group was 325??mol/L (133?809??mol/L). There were no differences in SF-36 scores between CKD and HD patients (Figure). CKD/HD status did not predict MCS or PCS in multivariate analyses controlling for age (p?<?0.01 for PCS), sex, depression (p?=?0.01 for PCS), Charlson comorbidity score (p?<?0.01 for PCS), s-albumin (p?=?0.05 for PCS), hemoglobin, presence of partner, and level of education. We conclude that QOL is related to comorbid illness and decreases even before dialysis is started. Longitudinal studies of QOL in CKD patients are needed to evaluate the influence of dialysis initiation on QOL.

AB  - Abstract The effects of oil extract of garlic (Allium sativum Linn.) on different primary and secondary osteoporotic marker changes were tested in an ovariectomized rat model of osteoporosis. Experiments were performed on three different rat models: sham-operated control, ovariectomized and ovariectomized supplemented with garlic oil. In ovariectomized group, there has been a signi?cant increase in different relative organ weights compared to sham-operated control, while the uterine weight was found to be decreased. Supplementation with oil extract of garlic could effectively reverse these changes. Also low bone densities that developed in the ovariectomized group were signi?cantly recovered in the garlic oil supplemented group. In our study, the development of high rate of bone turnover and osteoporosis in the ovariectomized animals were con?rmed by signi?cant alteration of serum alkaline phosphatase activity, serum tartrate resistant acid phosphatase activity, urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, hydroxyproline and urinary calcium to creatinine ratio, when compared with the sham-operated control group. Garlic oil extract supplementation, apart from its unique in?uence in lowering blood cholesterol, could also prevent ovariectomy-induced rise in all the above-mentioned marker changes. The results of this study emphasize that oil extract of garlic possibly has a positive role in suppressing ovariectomy-induced bone resorption. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The first full year of data after implementation of the new kidney allocation system reveals an increase in deceased donor kidney transplants among black candidates and those with calculated panel-reactive antibodies 98%?100%, but a decrease among candidates aged 65 years or older. Data from 2015 also demonstrate ongoing positive trends in graft and patient survival for both deceased and living donor kidney transplants, but the challenges of a limited supply of kidneys in the setting of increasing demand remain evident. While the total number of patients on the waiting list decreased for the first time in a decade, this was due to a combination of a decrease in the number of candidates added to the list and an increase in the number of candidates removed from the list due to deteriorating medical condition, as well as an increase in total transplants. Deaths on the waiting list remained flat, but this was likely because of an increasing trend toward removing inactive candidates too sick to undergo transplant.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the background, challenges, strategic mapping, high-risk markers, high-risk predictors, investigations, smart testing, management, comprehensive management and preferential management for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The signs suggesting extensive myocardial injuries include high white blood cell count and elevated brain natriuretic peptide level (BNP). Chest pain may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, back or to the epigastric area. Many patients complain of chest tightness rather than chest pain. Some patients, especially the elderly, and women may present with acute shortness of breath, dizziness, pre-syncope, or syncope, nausea and vomiting, rather than classical angina. In the acute setting of STEMI, only the electrocardiogram (ECG), and basic blood tests of complete blood count and electrolytes (sodium, potassium), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine level, protime and prothrombin time are needed before the patient receives thrombolytic therapy or undergoes urgent coronary angiogram for possible angioplasty.

AB  - Abstract X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common monogenic disorder causing hypophosphatemia. This case-note review documents the clinical features and the complications of treatment in 59 adults (19 male, 40 female) with XLH. XLH is associated with a large number of private mutations; 37 different mutations in the PHEX gene were identified in this cohort, 14 of which have not been previously reported. Orthopaedic involvement requiring surgical intervention (osteotomy) was frequent. Joint replacement and decompressive laminectomy were observed in those older than 40 years. Dental disease (63%), nephrocalcinosis (42%), and hearing impairment (14%) were also common. The rarity of the disease and the large number of variants make it difficult to discern specific genotype-phenotype relationships. A new treatment, an anti-FGF23 antibody, that may affect the natural history of the disease is currently being investigated in clinical trials.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring. It is essential for a practitioner to understand oxygen delivery and how it can be optimized when providing adequate hemodynamic support in the critically ill patient. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume. Patients who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly and shallow. Multiple factors can affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry monitors. CO-oximetry is a four wavelength non-invasive monitoring system that allows additional measurements of blood constituents. It not only measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, as pulse oximetry does, but also dyshemoglobins. End-tidal CO2 monitoring can help identify problems immediately after intubation and before critical hypoxemia becomes manifest. Adding lactate determinations to oxygen transport monitoring provides a more complete assessment of tissue oxygenation.
