AB  - Abstract Beta-thalassaemia is characterised by progressive anaemia necessitating regular blood transfusions to sustain life. With the advent of effective chelating agents that can reduce the iron burden and extend patients' survival, renal disease, as in other ageing populations, has become more prevalent. In recent years, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become overwhelming; indeed, approximately 8% or 6 million people of the UK population has evidence of CKD. Several factors, which occur in patients with thalassaemia, account for the relative explosion of renal disease in the general population including increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and the advent of novel measures of renal function facilitating early detection of kidney disease. In addition, some patients with thalassaemia develop renal tubular dysfunction related to the disease itself, the effects of iron overload and the effects of chelator therapy, while other patients have an increased creatinine clearance leading to hyperfiltration. More recently, there is a noticeable increasing prevalence of impaired renal function and proteinuria because of several putative factors including chelators. We review current data on the potential mechanisms leading to renal abnormalities seen in patients with thalassaemia, the potential effects of iron loading within the kidney and the potential renal effects of chelator therapy. This article gives a speculative account of possible mechanisms and theories to consider providing pause for thought and direct future research in this area.

AB  - Summary? Intravenous and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in 88 patients: 34 with tumours, 10 with renal trauma, 26 with suspected renovascular hypertension, 6 with vascular impression on the renal pelvis, 8 with nephrolithiasis and 4 with sonographically abnormal kidneys. Venous and arterial DSA always gave diagnostically useful images. Intravenous DSA is valuable in patients with suspected renovascular hypertension or after vascular surgery, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and transcatheter embolisation. Arterial DSA is preferable to venous DSA in other clinical situations, particularly in the evaluation of renal tumours, and may be recommended in preference to conventional angiography.

AB  - Limited data are available for outcomes of simultaneous liver-kidney (SLK) transplantation using donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors. The outcomes of 12 DCD-SLK transplants and 54 SLK transplants using donation after brain death (DBD) donors were retrospectively compared. The baseline demographics were similar for the DCD-SLK and DBD-SLK groups except for the higher liver donor risk index for the DCD-SLK group (1.8 ± 0.4 versus 1.3 ± 0.4, P = 0.001). The rates of surgical complications and graft rejections within 1 year were comparable for the DCD-SLK and DBD-SLK groups. Delayed renal graft function was twice as common in the DCD-SLK group. At 1 year, the serum creatinine levels and the iothalamate glomerular filtration rates were similar for the groups. The patient, liver graft, and kidney graft survival rates at 1 year were comparable for the groups (83.3%, 75.0%, and 82.5% for the DCD-SLK group and 92.4%, 92.4%, and 92.6% for the DBD-SLK group, P = 0.3 for all). The DCD-SLK group had worse patient, liver graft, and kidney graft survival at 3 years (62.5%, 62.5%, and 58.9% versus 90.5%, 90.5%, and 90.6%, P = 0.03 for all) and at 5 years (62.5%, 62.5%, and 58.9% versus 87.4%, 87.4%, and 87.7%, P < 0.05 for all). An analysis of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database showed inferior 1- and 5-year patient and graft survival rates for DCD-SLK patients versus DBD-SLK patients. In conclusion, despite comparable rates of surgical and medical complications and comparable kidney function at 1 year, DCD-SLK transplantation was associated with inferior long-term survival in comparison with DBD-SLK transplantation.

AB  - The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) is an IUCN Red List Endangered species (CITES Appendix II) that has been housed in zoological collections since 1912. As wild populations continue to decline throughout the species? range, successful ex situ breeding and management, including an understanding of morbidity and mortality, are of utmost importance. This study is the first comprehensive review of mortality data from the captive population since 1982 and significantly expands on previous analyses. We solicited necropsy reports from 129/187 zoological institutions worldwide that currently or previously held pygmy hippos and received data for 404 animals (177 ?, 220 ?, 7 undermined sex), representing 43% of pygmy hippos that have died in captivity. Mortality in neonates was primarily due to perinatal causes (51.8%?stillbirth, failure to thrive, weakness, poor suckling reflex, maternal neglect) or parent-inflicted trauma (28%). Common causes of mortality in adult and geriatric animals included cardiovascular disease (16%), degenerative musculoskeletal conditions (10%), obstructive gastrointestinal disease (9%), and renal insufficiency (13%), sometimes associated with advanced polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Although not the direct cause of mortality, a number of adult and geriatric pygmy hippos were also overweight to obese. Infectious causes of mortality in included leptospirosis and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter usually presenting as acute death due to cardiovascular demise. This comprehensive overview presents a useful guide for recommendations in preventative veterinary care and for improved husbandry and management of pygmy hippos in captivity.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To determine the frequency and independent predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in addition to the prognostic implications of both AKI and periprocedural red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on 30 day and cumulative late mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Background: RBC transfusions have been reported to predict AKI following TAVI. Data on the prognostic implications of both factors, however, are lacking. Methods: 126 consecutive patients underwent TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve Revalving System. AKI was defined according to the valve academic research consortium definitions as an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg dL?1 (≥26.4 ?mol L?1) or a percentage increase ≥50% within 72 hr following TAVI. Results: Five patients on chronic haemodialysis and three intraprocedural deaths were excluded, leading to a final study population of 118 patients. AKI occurred in 19% of the patients necessitating temporary haemodialysis in 2%. Independent predictors of AKI included: previous myocardial infarction (OR: 5.72; 95% CI: 1.64?19.94), periprocedural (<24 hr) RBC transfusions (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.01?1.70), postprocedural (<72 hr) leucocyte count (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02?1.37), and logistic EuroSCORE (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01?1.14). In patients with AKI, 30-day mortality was 23% and cumulative late mortality (median: 13 months) was 55%. AKI (OR: 5.47; 95% CI: 1.23?24.21) and postprocedural leucocyte count (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03?1.38) were independent predictors of 30-day mortality while AKI (HR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.36?5.71) was the only independent predictor of late mortality. Conclusions: AKI following TAVI occurred in 19% of the patients. RBC transfusion was found to be an independent predictor of AKI, which in turn predicted both 30-day and cumulative late mortality. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of liver and spleen. In a nonoperative patient, angiographic embolization (AE) can be an adjunct in liver injuries that contains an arterio-venous fistula or have ongoing bleeding. Nonoperative management of blunt liver injuries in patients with normal hemodynamics is recommended with greater than 90% success. Hydatid disease of the liver is uncommon. It is caused by parasitic Echinococcus, which has dogs as its definitive hosts. Patients with high-grade liver injuries have an increased risk of developing post-injury biloma as a complication. The accessory spleen is a common anomaly, occurring in up to 20% of the population. However, it can occur in up to 30% of patients with a hematologic disorder. Splenic artery aneurysm is very uncommon, but it is the third most frequent abdominal artery to undergo aneurismal changes.

AB  - Summary Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis resulting in poor quality of life, high risk of development of other complications of cirrhosis, increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and poor long-term outcome. The practical management of ascites involves a proper evaluation of the patient with a thorough history and physical exam. In addition, complete laboratory, ascitic fluid, radiological, endoscopic, and in some cases histological tests should be performed. Taking proper care of patients with ascites can be challenging because they are prone to several complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatocellular carcinoma, bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. While the initial management of uncomplicated ascites with low-sodium diet and diuretic treatment is straightforward in the majority of patients, there is a group of patients that fail to respond to diuretics and become a real therapeutic challenge.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Deceased donor (DD) kidneys exhibiting severe atherosclerosis involving the renal artery (RA) may represent a contraindication to kidney transplantation (KT). Methods Eversion endarterectomy (EE) was performed as a salvage procedure to permit KT. Results We identified 17 cases (1.2% of all DD KTs during the study period) involving EE of the DD RA. Thirteen (76.5%) kidneys were imported, and mean Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) was 81%. Mean DD age was 59 years, mean RA plaque length was 1.7 cm, and mean glomerulosclerosis on biopsy was 10%. Mean recipient age was 64 years, and dialysis vintage was 32 months. With a mean follow-up of 36 months, actual patient and graft survival rates were both 76.5%. One patient died early without a technical problem. Of the remaining 16 patients, 2-year patient and graft survival rates were both 100%. There were no early or late vascular complications. The incidence of delayed graft function was 35%. Mean serum creatinine and GFR levels in patients with functioning grafts at latest follow-up were 1.8 mg/dL and 40 mL/min, respectively. Conclusions EE appears to be a safe and under-utilized procedure that may prevent discard of marginal donor kidneys and is associated with acceptable short-term outcomes.

AB  - The moisture contents of foods, fluids, and parenteral solutions taken in and of all samples excreted, the water of oxidation of fuel mixtures burned, and the evaporative water loss must be determined in order to obtain a quantitative picture of water balance. Because there is a tendency to retain water after trauma, surgery, or an acute illness, changes in the water compartment of the body may lead to changes in body weight that may be considered erroneously as changes in energy or protein stores. Measurement of water balance, in addition to calorie and nitrogen balance is one of the most accurate means of accounting for these changes in body composition. Fluid and electrolyte therapy and nutritional supplementation can be tailored to meet the patient's specific needs by utilizing this information. Application of these principles to the care of hospitalized patients outside of the research setting will be discussed.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.
