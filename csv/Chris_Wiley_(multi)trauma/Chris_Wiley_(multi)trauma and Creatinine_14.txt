AB  - Summary Burns and dog-bite wounds can be superficial or extensive, involving muscle, bone, and vital organs. Bullet wounds may penetrate deeper tissues causing injury far from the point of entry. Burns that cover a large surface area result in substantial losses of fluids and electrolytes. Medications applied topically to burns should be easy to apply and should not interfere with healing. Horses that have incurred a bullet wound may require antimicrobial therapy, due to the penetration of a viscus, or a synovial structure. The bullet injures tissues directly in its path, and concussive forces injure tissue adjacent to the bullet's path. Dog-bite wounds are heavily contaminated and characterized by the presence of crushed, necrotic tissue. Damage to tissue caused by a bullet, a bite, or a burn progresses after injury, necessitating continuous re-evaluation of the wound.

AB  - Background: Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) require huge resources because of the dysfunction of several of their vital organs. The heterogeneity and complexity of the ICU patient have generated interest in systems able to measure severity of illness as a method of predicting outcome, comparing quality-of-care and stratification for clinical trials. Methods: By searching Medline and EMBASE for publications describing scoring systems in the ICU, the most frequently used systems, defined as resulting in more than 50 references, are included in this review. Scoring systems belong to one of four classes prognostic, single-organ failure, trauma scores and organ dysfunction (OD). The different systems are described and discussed. Results: Three different prognostic scoring systems, including several versions, four single OD scores and three OD scores, were included in this review. Conclusion: Different forms of scoring systems are frequently used in the ICU. They have become a necessary tool to describe ICU populations and to explain differences in mortality. As there are several pitfalls related to the interpretation of the numbers supplied by the systems, they should not be used without knowledge on the science of severity scoring.

AB  - Postoperative liver failure is a rare complication after living donor liver resection. This is a case report of a 22-year-old healthy donor who was rescued with liver transplantation 11 days after right hemihepatectomy. Nine months later the patient is alive, and has fully recovered from his multiple organ failure. According to a review of the literature, there are four additional living liver donors, who received a liver transplant. Our own patient is the only survivor, so far. This case demonstrates that even in supposedly healthy living donors postoperative complications cannot be completely prevented. Although liver failure is rare in these patients, timely transplantation may need to be considered as the only life-saving treatment.

AB  - Some authors suggest that inflammation can be one of the reasons of erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. The purpose of the study was to follow-up some laboratory markers of inflammation in 21 dialysis patients, all treated with adequate anaemia doses EPO, divided in 2 groups: first one adequately responding to EPO treatment (with Hb higher than 9?g/L) and second one resistant to it (with Hb lower than 9?g/L). Some acute phase proteins and markers of inflammation were measured as follow: C-reactive protein (CRP), α1-AGT, α1-antitrypsine, and haptoglobine (HP), as some anti-acute phase proteins, transferrin (TF). WBC count, some enzymes: ASAT, ALAT, and substrates: urea, creatinine, albumins (Albs), lipid profile, glucose, phosphate, iron, electrolytes, and parathyroid hormone were tested as well. The study found significant higher CRP, HP, Tg, P, and Alb in the second group than in the first. TF was lower in all patients, which may be connected to the chronic inflammatory status (uremia), and there was no iron deficit or severe parathyroid hyperfunction to be convinced for EPO resistance. The study suggests that EPO resistance may be related to some inflammatory factors and treatment of the inflammation possibly will overcome the problem.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of ProcalAmine as a source of parenteral nutrition in hospitalized dogs and to report complications possibly referable to its use. Design Retrospective study. Settings Private veterinary teaching hospital. Animals Thirty-six dogs hospitalized in ICU receiving ProcalAmine between October 2010 and March 2013. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results The most common underlying disease process in this population of dogs was trauma (n = 8). Median duration of administration was 4 days and median resting energy requirement provided via ProcalAmine was 33%. ProcalAmine was administered via central catheters in 86% of cases and via peripheral catheters in 14% of cases. The overall mechanical complication rate was 19%. Metabolic complications possibly associated with ProcalAmine administration were documented in 12/36 dogs. Hyponatremia was most commonly identified (n = 6) followed by hyperglycemia (n = 4), hypochloremia (n = 2), azotemia (n = 2), metabolic alkalosis (n = 2), hyperchloremia (n = 1), and metabolic acidosis (n = 1). Conclusion ProcalAmine appears to be relatively safe and a viable option for parenteral nutrition in ill and injured dogs. Due to the potential for electrolyte derangements and other metabolic complications, daily monitoring of these parameters is advisable.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of donor race on the outcome of black patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who undergo liver transplantation. The records for deceased donor liver transplants that occurred in the United States between January 1998 and December 2007 were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing. 26,212 records contained sufficient data to be included in the analysis. Of these, 11,989 (45.7%) records were for patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 1292 (4.9%) were for patients both HCV-positive and black. Black recipients with white donors were found to have significantly worse outcomes than all other recipient-donor race combinations (P < 0.001). The crude 5-year survival rate for black recipients who had a black donor was 14% higher than the 5-year survival rate for black recipients who had a white donor. Multivariate regression analysis determined that a graft from a race-unmatched donor was an independent risk factor for graft failure (hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.79) among HCV-positive black recipients but not among HCV-negative black recipients after adjustments for donor age, recipient age, cold ischemia time, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and donor cytomegalovirus status. The observation that race-unmatched grafts are a risk factor in HCV-positive black recipients, but not in HCV-negative black recipients, suggests an alteration of the graft-host relationship by HCV. In conclusion, our results suggest that HCV-positive black recipients who undergo liver transplantation can have increased graft survival if their donors are black, with survival rates approaching those of white liver transplant recipients.

AB  - Abstract Neurologic sequelae remain a common and destructive problem in patients with acute kidney injury. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible neuroprotective effect of erythropoietin (EPO) on motor impairments following bilateral renal ischemia (BRI) in two time points after reperfusion: short term (24 h) and long term (1 week). Male Wistar rats underwent BRI or sham surgery. EPO or saline administration was performed 30 min before surgery (1000 U/kg, i.p.). Explorative behaviors and motor function of the rats were evaluated by open field, rotarod, and wire grip tests. Plasma concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) were significantly enhanced in BRI rats 24 h after reperfusion. BRI group had only an increased level of BUN but not Cr 1 week after reperfusion. Impairment of balance function by BRI was not reversed by EPO 24 h after reperfusion, but counteracted 7 days after renal ischemia. Muscle strength had no significant differences between the groups. BRI group had a decrease in locomotor activity, and EPO could not reverse this reduction in both time points of the experiment. Although EPO could not be offered as a potential neuroprotective agent in the treatment of motor dysfunctions induced by BRI, it could be effective against balance dysfunction 1 week after renal ischemia.

AB  - Background Ulinastatin can prevent the perioperative increase in proinflammatory cytokines for lung resection surgery; however, its impact on early clinical outcomes remains unknown. Methods The study enrolled 108 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were randomly allocated into two groups: ulinastatin (group U) and control (group C). Patients in group U ( n = 52) were continuously intravenously infused with ulinastatin at a rate of 20 000 U/kg/hour for the first hour after anesthesia induction, and then at a rate of 5000 U/kg/hour until the conclusion of surgery. Patients in group C ( n = 56) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome was to record the postoperative pulmonary complications that occurred during hospital stay. Other clinical courses, such as hospital mortality, blood loss, respiratory parameters, postoperative chest drainage, and duration of intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, were also observed and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups in early postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, blood loss, or other perioperative laboratory values, except for the duration of postoperative chest drainage and serum creatinine level. The frequency of pulmonary complications was lower in patients treated with ulinastatin compared with the control (38.46% in group U vs. 48.21% in group C). Conclusion Administration of high-dose ulinastatin during surgery did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, or hospital stay for patients undergoing lung radical thoracotomy. However, a protective trend of ulinastatin was observed.

AB  - Background:? Cerebral perfusion-CT (PCT) is commonly used to image patients with suspected stroke, but PCT may also be useful in detecting abnormalities following seizure. Methods:? We retrospectively identified patients who presented to our stroke center between 2000 and 2008 with acute, transient neurological deficits because of seizure and received PCT imaging within 72?h. We compared the group of seizure patients with abnormal post-ictal PCT to a group of seizure patients with normal post-ictal PCT. Patients were excluded from analysis if the seizure occurred secondary to an acute process known to alter cerebral perfusion. Results:? Of 27 patients with acute post-ictal neurological deficits, PCT was abnormal in 10 (37%) and normal in 17 (63%). The most common post-ictal perfusion abnormality, seen in eight of 10 patients, was focal hypoperfusion, with prolonged mean transit time (MTT) and decreased cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume, in a cortical ribbon pattern, multi-lobar or holo-hemispheric distribution, sparing the basal ganglia. CT Angiography (CTA) showed no corresponding large vessel pathology. Two other PCT abnormalities ? focal hyperperfusion and an isolated prolonged MTT ? were also observed in single patients. Imaging within 2?h after seizure termination was significantly associated with finding a post-ictal PCT abnormality (P?<?0.039). Conclusions:? Post-ictal cerebral PCT abnormalities are relatively common in patients early after seizure. When PCT abnormalities occur in atypical vascular distributions ? and the CTA shows no corresponding large vessel occlusions ? seizure should be considered as a diagnostic possibility prior to giving acute stroke therapy.

AB  - Abstract The close proximity of pelvic organs makes the genitourinary system susceptible to injury during major pelvic surgery. Iatrogenic injury remains the most common cause of lower urinary tract trauma. Recent modifications in surgical technique, such as sharp mesorectal incision and nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, have decreased the incidence of many of these complications. Genitourinary complications due to pelvic surgery remain common, however, and as new surgical advancements are made, new complications may present. An understanding of the prevention, recognition, and treatment of urologic complications is important for every surgeon performing major pelvic surgery. Semin. Surg.

AB  - Summary This prospective study was designed to evaluate whether early changes in actin-free Gc-globulin levels were associated with complications and outcomes and to identify factors associated with persistent low actin-free Gc-globulin levels in acute liver failure (ALF). Thirty-two consecutive ALF patients admitted from October 2011 to December 2012 were followed up until death or complete recovery. All had serum actin-free Gc-globulin estimation at admission and at day three or expiry. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed. Nonsurvivors had significantly lower median actin-free Gc-globulin levels than survivors (87.32 vs 180 mg/L; P < 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.771 and showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin level of ≤124 mg/L would predict mortality with 92% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Patients with lower serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels and decreasing trend in serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels were found to have more mortality and developed more complications. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin, total leucocyte count and serum creatinine at admission were independent predictors of mortality. Incorporating these variables, a score predicting mortality risk at admission was derived. The scoring system was compared to MELD score and King's College Criteria as individual predictor of mortality. Serum actin-free Gc-globulin level at presentation is predictive of outcome and can be used for risk stratification. Its persistent low-level predicts mortality and is correlated with various complications.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Malnutrition is frequent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with complications like ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, infections, and death. We determined the prevalence of malnutrition by various methods and its clinical importance in patients with cirrhosis. Methods Consecutive patients of cirrhosis from August 2013 to February 2015 were assessed. Nutritional status was assessed by traditional model (mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, serum albumin, creatinine height index, total lymphocyte count), handgrip, and body composition analysis measuring skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass. All patients were followed up for 12 months to assess the outcome. Results 247 patients (age 42.10?±?10.14?years, 81% male) were included in the study. Etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol in 53% patients. Prevalence of malnutrition was 59.5% according to traditional model, 66.8% by body composition analysis and 71.4% by handgrip. Nutritional status was poor in alcoholic cirrhotics versus nonalcoholics as assessed by triceps skinfold thickness (9.33?±?2.9 vs 11.64?±?3.5?mm; P?=?0.001), serum albumin (25.1?±?4 vs 28.1?±?4?g/L; P?=?0.001), and body fat mass (7.6?±?3.1 vs 8.7?±?3.3?kg; P?=?0.008). Prevalence of malnutrition was 12/27 (44.5%), 96/131 (73.3%) and 84/89 (94.4%) in Child's class A, B, and C respectively. Complications requiring hospitalization (71.3% vs 38.2%; 0.002) and mortality (41.1% vs 18.2%; P?=?0.001) were more in malnourished patients compared to well nourished. Nutritional assessment parameters significantly correlated with the liver disease severity (P?<?0.05). Conclusions Prevalence of malnutrition is high in patients with cirrhosis. It is associated with increased complications and mortality.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.

AB  - Abstract Objective To provide a current review of the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcomes in critically ill patients presenting to the ED with acute pancreatitis and subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre in Australia. Methods A retrospective single-centre study of adult patients admitted with pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis defined by Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score ≥2. Results Eighty-seven patients fulfilled criteria for inclusion during the study period, representing 0.9% of all ICU admissions. The median age of patients was 54. Survival was independent of patients? age, sex, aetiology and comorbidities. Mortality was 30.8% for both inpatient referrals to the ICU and for direct referrals via the ED. Higher mortality was identified among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (74.2 vs 24.6% in survivors; P?<?0.0001), vasopressor support (85.7 vs 33.8% in survivors; P?<?0.0001) or renal replacement therapy (60 vs 16.9% in survivors; P?<?0.002). BISAP score surpasses Ranson's and Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II scores in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors among unselected patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to ICU, whereas APACHE II discriminates better in the cohort admitted from ED. Conclusion Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Aetiology and comorbidity did not predict adverse outcomes in this population. BISAP score is non-inferior to APACHE II score as a prognostic tool in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used to triage admission. Evidence of persistent organ dysfunction and requirements for organ support reliably identify patients at high-risk of death.
