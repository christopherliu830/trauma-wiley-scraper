AB  - Summary This prospective study was designed to evaluate whether early changes in actin-free Gc-globulin levels were associated with complications and outcomes and to identify factors associated with persistent low actin-free Gc-globulin levels in acute liver failure (ALF). Thirty-two consecutive ALF patients admitted from October 2011 to December 2012 were followed up until death or complete recovery. All had serum actin-free Gc-globulin estimation at admission and at day three or expiry. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed. Nonsurvivors had significantly lower median actin-free Gc-globulin levels than survivors (87.32 vs 180 mg/L; P < 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.771 and showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin level of ≤124 mg/L would predict mortality with 92% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Patients with lower serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels and decreasing trend in serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels were found to have more mortality and developed more complications. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin, total leucocyte count and serum creatinine at admission were independent predictors of mortality. Incorporating these variables, a score predicting mortality risk at admission was derived. The scoring system was compared to MELD score and King's College Criteria as individual predictor of mortality. Serum actin-free Gc-globulin level at presentation is predictive of outcome and can be used for risk stratification. Its persistent low-level predicts mortality and is correlated with various complications.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Summary Organ transplantation has proven to provide curative treatment for most end stage solid organ diseases. Given this success, transplantation therapies have been proposed for certain tissues and functions lost due to trauma or that arise from congenital anomalies. Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) refers to the transfer of non-autologous peripheral tissues including skin, muscle, nerve, and bone as a functional unit (e.g. a hand) to replace non-reconstructible tissue defects. To date, approximately 80 patients worldwide have received a VCA and the potential to experience substantial growth in this field is evident. As such, VCA transplantation requires specific issues to be addressed for donors and recipients. This chapter focuses on the past, present and future of VCAs as a partner in transplantation.

AB  - Summary Metabolic disturbances may present with non-specific symptoms and signs and can be easily missed if blood tests are not undertaken. Advancing age is a risk factor for acute kidney injury, and is associated with a higher mortality and reduced renal recovery. Standard diagnostic criteria may miss acute kidney injury in the older patient. Sodium disturbances may be multifactorial and the cause may be more difficult to determine in the older patient. Symptoms and signs are largely related to speed of onset. Hypercalcaemia requiring emergency treatment is most often due to malignancy. This chapter includes: An outline of age related changes in the kidney Classification, management, and complications of acute kidney injury A summary of common causes of hyponatraemia A guide to the emergency management of hyponatraemia and hypercalcaemia

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.

AB  - Abstract Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease in Malaysia. The symptoms of leptospirosis vary from mild nonspecific flu-like illness to a severe condition which is usually associated with serious complication and fatality. To study the protein expression profile of mild and severe leptospirosis, 15 paired sera were collected from the patients who were mildly infected and following that progressed to severe stage. The proteome profiles of mild and severe cases were studied using 2DE analysis in combination with LC-MS/MS. The expression of proteins that were significantly different and had a fold difference of at least 2 had been identified and then validated using Western blot. Our study demonstrated apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I), serum amyloid A (SAA), transferrin (TF), haptoglobin (HP) and transthyretin (TTR) have significantly different expression between mild and severe leptospirosis. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software suggested the expression of these five proteins were modulated by acute phase response signaling pathway. Besides that, a functional network of lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry that interconnects these five proteins with interactomes also had been predicted by this software. In conclusion, this finding supports the potential of these five proteins to be the biomarkers for mild and severe human leptospirosis.

AB  - Summary Careful assessment of the biochemistry panel and familiarity with normal biochemistry values for neonatal foals is imperative in the workup of any critically ill neonate, particularly those with neurological signs. The importance of rapidity of change compared to the absolute value of the biochemical abnormality must be emphasised. Serial biochemical panels ideally assist in assessing rapidity of change. Many foals can have severe biochemical derangements in the absence of seizures. Identifying values that are significantly out of range should spur immediate therapy to correct them and potentially additional diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the abnormalities. A temporal relationship between correction of biochemical abnormalities and resolution of seizures and encephalopathic signs supports causation.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Mitral regurgitation caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease is the most common cause for congestive heart failure and cardiac-related mortality in dogs. Typically, it takes several years for the disease to progress from mild, clinically silent myxomatous mitral valve disease to severe disease with signs of congestive heart failure. A proportion of dogs will never progress into congestive heart failure before they die from other causes or old age. Some variables have been shown to be predictive of onset of congestive heart failure and they might be useful to identify dogs that need more frequent monitoring and eventually treatment. Results from several controlled clinical trials are available concerning medical treatment of dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease with or without congestive heart failure. These trials provide estimates of treatment effects and also allow identification of other variables with prognostic value for the outcome after the onset of congestive heart failure. Use of prognostic variables together with qualitative and quantitative results from clinical drug trials may aid the clinician and owner to plan and decide on optimal management of the myxomatous mitral valve disease dog. The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge of prognostic variables and therapy for this common condition in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes and risk factors for mortality in dogs that underwent surgical management of lung lobe torsion. Study design Retrospective case series from 5 veterinary teaching hospitals (2005?2017). Animals Fifty dogs with 52 instances of lung lobe torsion. Methods Data collected from medical records included signalment, clinical findings, results of clinicopathologic testing and diagnostic imaging, surgical treatment, lung lobe affected, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histopathologic and microbiologic findings, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone contact with primary care veterinarians. Results Fifty-two instances of lung lobe torsion were identified in 50 dogs, with a median follow-up of 453?days (range, 0?3075). Forty-six (92%) dogs survived to discharge. Dogs with concurrent torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes were less likely to survive (2/4) than those with torsion of the left cranial lung lobe (22/22). No other risk factors for mortality prior to hospital discharge were identified. Overall median survival time after hospital discharge was 1369?days. Four dogs had >1 episode of lung lobe torsion. Conclusion The percentage of dogs surviving to discharge after surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion was higher than previously reported. The short- and long-term prognosis was excellent with surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion. Clinical significance Surgery should be recommended when lung lobe torsion is suspected because of the high survival to discharge rate and excellent long-term prognosis.
