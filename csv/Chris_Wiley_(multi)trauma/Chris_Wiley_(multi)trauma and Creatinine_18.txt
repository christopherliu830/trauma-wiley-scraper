AB  - Summary A 15-year-old Boerperd stallion presented for thyroid enlargement associated with inappetance. Ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid gland revealed an enlarged left lobe, which, on cytological examination, contained numerous anaplastic cells. A mixed C cell microfollicular thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed following histopathological examination of the excisional biopsy specimen. In order to determine metastasis, pulmonary radiographs revealed a poorly-marginated soft tissue opacity caudo-dorsal to the cardiac silhouette. Thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy was performed comparing 99mTc-sestamibi with 99mTc-pertechnetate and no metastasis was detectable. Following hemithyroidectomy, the stallion made a full recovery without the need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Six months later, repeated thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy using 99mTc-sestamibi was normal.

AB  - Abstract Many positive trends in kidney transplantation were notable in 2017. Deceased donor kidney transplant rates and counts continued to rise, the kidney transplant waiting list declined for the third year in a row after decades of growth, and both short- and long-term allograft survival continued to improve year over year. In total, more than 220,000 patients were living in the United States with a functioning allograft. With 3 years of data available since implementation of the new kidney allocation system, better prediction of longer-term results of the allocation policy changes became possible. The data also reveal several areas in need of improvement and attention. Overall, the challenge of providing adequate access to kidney transplant persisted nationally, with additional dramatic regional variation. The proportion of living donor kidney transplants in both adults and children continued to fall, and racial disparities in living donor kidney transplant grew in the past decade.

AB  - Background:? Insulin resistance has been associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, central obesity, and dyslipidemia, all of which are important risk factors for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A greater degree of insulin resistance may predispose to renal injury by worsening renal hemodynamics through the elevation of glomerular filtration fraction. However, there are sparse data on the relationship between insulin resistance, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and total body fat or phase angle in CKD without diabetes. Methods:?We examined 84 non-diabetes CKD patients according to the K/DOQI definitions; only 79 patients were enrolled into the study (GFR between 15 and 90?ml/min/1.73?m2). The value of insulin resistance was obtained by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed to determine the percentage of total body fat or phase angle. GFR was calculated by the average of creatinine and urea clearances. Results:?The correlation analysis showed that HOMA-insulin resistance was positively correlated with phase angle (r?=?0.35, P?<?0.01), percentage of total body fat (r?=?0.27, P?<?0.01), body mass index (r?=?0.48, P?<?0.01) and serum triglyceride levels (r?=?0.32, P?<?0.01), but not significantly correlated with gender (r?=??0.07, P?>?0.05), age (r?=?0.05, P?>?0.05), GFR (r?=??0.006, P?>?0.05), and mean arterial blood pressure (r?=?0.11, P?>?0.05). Conclusion:?In non-diabetic chronic kidney disease patients, the major risk factor for insulin resistance is the amount of total body fat. The insulin level is not dependent on the GFR in these patients.

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was initially developed for the treatment of calcific aortic stenosis. In the recent years, however, TAVI has been used to treat selected patients with pure, severe AR. We report successful transfemoral implantation of a Symetis ACURATE neo bioprosthesis in a severely symptomatic, 87-year-old woman with pure AR and major comorbidities. We decided to use the ACURATE neo bioprosthesis for some of its features appeared to us as potentially useful in the setting of pure AR: the stabilization arches ensure perfect coaxial alignment and extreme stability of the device during deployment, and the ?waist? and the skirt were considered useful to obtain a good seal in the absence of significant valvular and annular calcifications. Finally, we decided to use a self-expanding valve to minimize the trauma to the aortic annulus. The procedure was successful and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3. At the 3-month control echocardiography, there was no residual AR, and the mean transprosthetic gradient was 3 mm Hg. The current case demonstrates that percutaneous TAVI with the ACURATE neo bioprosthesis may be used to treat pure, isolated AR in selected patients. The device has several interesting features that could make it advantageous in this setting. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Poor patient compliance is common during dialysis therapy. We aimed to study incidence of noncompliance, contributing factors, and effects on quality of life (QOL) among cadaveric renal transplantation waiting list patients. We included 86 renal transplantation waiting list patients (56M/30F). Dialysis duration, previous renal transplantation history, comorbid conditions, interdialytic weight gain, predialysis BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate were recorded. Noncompliance criteria were skipping >1 dialysis session or shortening a dialysis session>10?min in 1 month, interdialytic weight gain>5.7% of body weight, predialysis serum potassium >6?mEq/L, and phosphate level >7.5?mg/dl. There were 49 noncompliant (age: 46.8?±?21.8 years, HD duration: 83.9?±?48.7 months) and 37 compliant (age: 42.8?±?12.1 years, HD duration: 96.5?±?45.2 months) patients. QOL was evaluated by short form 36 and depression levels by Beck Depression Inventory. Previous renal transplantation was present in 24.4% and comorbid diseases in 31.3% of all patients. In depressed patients, 77.8% had comorbid diseases. No difference was found between the groups considering age, gender, dialysis duration, previous transplantation history, and comorbid diseases (p?>?0.05). Noncompliant patients had lower QOL (p?<?0.04). Noncompliant patients had higher degree of depression (p?=?0.01). QOL and Beck scores were negatively correlated (p?=?0.001, r?=??0.561). Noncompliance to diet and dialysis therapy is associated with depression, which further decreases QOL in renal transplantation waiting list patients. Early diagnosis of depression, is possible by monitoring noncompliance, and therapeutic intervention may benefit during the transplantation-waiting period.

AB  - Abstract There is mounting evidence that the quality of organs from cadaver donors may be influenced by events occurring around the time of brain death. Aim of this present study was to analyze the correlation of DGF with brain-dead donor variables in a single-center pediatric population and to evaluate DGF influence on patients- and grafts outcome. End-points of the study were DGF prevalence, DGF donor-related risk factors, graft function, patient- and graft survival rate, respectively, at six, 12, and 24 months FU. The univariate analysis showed that donor age above 15 yr and vascular cause of donor brain death represented risk factors for DGF. The multivariate analysis confirmed as independent risk factors for DGF donor age >15 yr. At six months FU, DGF showed a negative impact on graft function. In conclusion, among all considered brain-dead donor resuscitation parameters, just non-traumatic cause of death turned out to be of impact for DGF. Donor age >15 yr represented the only independent risk factor for prolonged DGF in our series of children. At two-yr FU, DGF showed a transient negative impact on six-month graft function.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Summary Major burn injury remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. With advances in burn care and with the development of experienced multi-disciplinary teams at regionalized burn centers, many children are surviving severe burn injury. As members of the multi-disciplinary care team, anesthesia providers are called upon to care for these critically ill children. These children provide several anesthetic challenges, such as difficult airways, difficult vascular access, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, altered temperature regulation, sepsis, cardiovascular instability, and increased requirements of muscle relaxants and opioids. The anesthesia provider must understand the physiologic derangements that occur with severe burn injury as well as the subsequent anesthetic implications.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes minimally invasive treatments for thrombosis including a multimodality approach centered on interventional radiology, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs target the clot directly by accelerating fibrinolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, and urokinase have been administered intravenously in cats and dogs with thrombosis with variable success. The chapter also talks about clinical signs, diagnostics, intervention, and long-term therapy of central venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, ischemia?reperfusion injury, and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in dogs and cats. Treatment of venous thrombi must be based upon consideration of the overall clot burden and extent, the resulting clinical signs associated with the venous obstruction, and the ability to control the underlying cause of the clot if it is identified. Echocardiography is an easily accessible modality useful in confirming a thrombus in the proximal pulmonary artery. Angiography, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are also useful modalities in confirming and locating the PTE.

AB  - Reflex sympathetic dystropy syndrome of the lower limbs in a renal transplant patient treated with tacrolimus. (Hospital de Mar, Barcelona, Spain) Transplantation 2000;70:210?211. This study describes the treatment of a 49-year-old woman who received a kidney transplant from a cadaver donor and was treated with tacrolimus. Three months later, the patient complained of severe pain in her lower limbs that affected both knees and ankles. Bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance were consistent with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. Laboratory tests that included creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, calcium, phosphate, urate, alkaline phosphatase, and parathormone were normal or near normal. Tacrolimus levels were around 13 ?g/mL. Clinical improvement appeared slowly and spontaneously during the following 3 months, without appreciable changes in the tacrolimus level. Conclude that in kidney transplant patients, tacrolimus could be a risk factor for the development of a reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) complications after cardiac surgery are uncommon, but are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as significant hospital resource utilization. Methods We analysed a prospectively collected database containing all adult cardiac surgery procedures performed from July 2001 to March 2011 at Monash Medical Centre and Jessie McPherson Private Hospital. Patients with post-operative GI complications were compared to patients without GI complications who were operated in the same period. Results The incidence of GI complications was 1.1% (61 out of 5382 patients) with an overall 30-day mortality of 33% (versus 3% in the non-GI complication group). The most common complications were GI bleeding, gastroenteritis and bowel ischaemia. Patients who had GI complications were significantly older, had higher incidence of renal impairment, chronic lung disease and anticoagulation therapy and were more likely to be in cardiogenic shock. Emergency procedures, combined coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery and aortic dissection cases were more common in the GI complication group. The GI complication group also had higher incidence of return to theatre, renal failure, stroke, septicaemia and multi-organ failure. Conclusions GI complications after cardiac surgery remain an uncommon but dreadful complication associated with high mortality. Our findings should prompt a high degree of clinical vigilance in order to make an early diagnosis especially in high risk patients. Further studies aiming to identify independent predictors for GI complications after cardiac surgery are warranted.

Animals Fifteen client-owned dogs with nonobstructive gallbladder disease. Methods Medical records were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, and outcome until suture removal. Results The SPAS was placed 1?cm caudal to the umbilicus. The procedure was completed with the SPAS alone in two cases. An additional cannula was added in 12 cases. In the last 10 cases, the additional cannula was placed at the beginning of the procedure. Dissection began at the cystic duct in 11 dogs (73%). In three cases (20%), the SPAS procedure was converted to a laparotomy; two of these conversions were elective, and one was emergent. The risk of conversion was affected by the experience of the surgeon (odds ratio = 0.53; P = .0105), and the rate of conversion was reduced when a cannula was added at the beginning of the procedure (P = .022). Fourteen dogs were discharged from the hospital. One dog died after being discharged due to severe cholangiohepatitis, and another dog died due to leakage of a gastrostomy tube. Conclusions The use of SPAS for cholecystectomy in dogs has an acceptable outcome. The experience gained by the surgeon and the addition of a cannula reduced the risk of conversion. Clinical Relevance/Impact Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed with a SPAS. The placement of an additional cannula at the beginning of the procedure is highly recommended.
