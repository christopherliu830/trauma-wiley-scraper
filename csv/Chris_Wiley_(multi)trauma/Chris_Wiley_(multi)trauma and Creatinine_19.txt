AB  - Background The objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of occult upper gastrointestinal abnormalities, presence of gastric acid as a contributing factor, and associations with clinical outcomes. Methods Data were extracted for study participants at a single centre who had an endoscopy performed purely for research purposes and in whom treating physicians were not suspecting gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic data were independently adjudicated by two gastroenterologists who rated the likelihood that observed pathological abnormalities were related to gastric acid secretion using a 3-point ordinal scale (unlikely, possible or probable). Results Endoscopy reports were extracted for 74 patients [age 52 (37, 65) years] undergoing endoscopy on day 5 [3, 9] of ICU admission. Abnormalities were found in 25 (34%) subjects: gastritis/erosions in 10 (14%), nasogastric tube trauma in 8 (11%), oesophagitis in 4 (5%) and non-bleeding duodenal ulceration in 3 (4%). The contribution of acid secretion to observed pathology was rated ?probable? in six subjects (rater #1) and five subjects (rater #2). Prior to endoscopy, 39 (53%) patients were receiving acid-suppressive therapy. The use of acid-suppressive therapy was not associated with the presence of an endoscopic abnormality (present 15/25 (60%) vs. absent 24/49 (49%); P = 0.46). Haemoglobin concentrations, packed red cells transfused and mortality were not associated with mucosal abnormalities (P = 0.83, P > 0.9 and P > 0.9 respectively). Conclusions Occult mucosal abnormalities were observed in one-third of subjects. The presence of mucosal abnormalities appeared to be independent of prior acid-suppressive therapy and was not associated with reduced haemoglobin concentrations, increased transfusion requirements, or mortality.

AB  - Feline obstructive ureteral disease will likely remain a common and frustrating cause of critical illness in cats for the foreseeable future. Since many cats are uraemic and cardiovascularly unstable secondary to obstructive nephropathy, prompt recognition using clinical intuition, blood work and diagnostic imaging is essential to make a timely diagnosis and decision about timing for intervention, if indicated. Multiple surgical and interventional procedures exist for the management of feline ureteral obstructions but there is no ideal technique and all currently available procedures carry risk of infection, re-obstruction, urine leakage and the need for additional procedures in the future. Therefore, until clear, evidence-based guideline exist, the decision about which ureteral procedure to perform in cats should be guided by nature of the obstruction, location, concurrent urolithiasis, infection and surgeon preference. In all likelihood, ureteral surgery, stents and ureteral bypass devices will continue to remain viable options and the decision about which procedure to use will be made on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Ureteronephrectomy is the most commonly performed surgical procedure of the kidney. It is indicated when one of the kidneys is detrimental to the animal's health whilst the function of the contralateral one is adequate to sustain life. This frequently occurs in cases of advanced hydronephrosis ? usually secondary to obstruction of the ureter or the renal pelvis. Whenever possible the kidney is spared, and alternative procedures are performed to resolve the obstruction. Nephrotomy and pyelotomy are rarely performed, and recently have been associated with or superseded by ureteral stenting. All the latter procedures are technically challenging, and require advanced expertise and facilities.

AB  - Scanty data suggests that large solutes show a kinetic behavior that is different from urea. The question investigated in this study is whether other small water-soluble solutes such as some guanidino compounds show a kinetic behavior comparable or dissimilar to that of urea. This study included 7 stable conventional hemodialysis patients without residual diuresis undergoing low flux polysulphone dialysis (F8 and F10HPS). Blood samples were collected from the inlet and outlet blood lines before the dialysis session, after 5, 15, 30, 120 minutes, and immediately after discontinuation of the session. Plasma concentrations of urea, creatinine (CTN), creatine (CT), guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA), guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), guanidine (G), and methylguanidine (MG) were used to calculate corresponding dialyzer clearances. A two-pool kinetic model was fitted to the measured plasma concentration profiles, resulting in the calculation of the perfused volume (V1), the total distribution volume (Vtot), and the inter-compartmental clearance (K12); solute generation and ultrafiltration were determined independently. No significant differences were observed between V1 and K12 for urea (6.4?±?3.3?L and 822?±?345?mL/min) and for the guanidino compounds. However, with respect to Vtot, GSA was distributed in a smaller volume (30.6?±?4.2?L) compared to urea (42.7?±?6.0?L???P?<?0.001), while CTN, CT, GAA, G, and MG showed significantly larger volumes (54.0?±?5.9?L, 98.0?±?52.3?L, 123.8?±?66.9?L, 89.7?±?21.4?L, and 102.6?±?33.9?L, respectively). These differences resulted in markedly divergent effective solute removal: 67%(urea), 58%(CTN), 42%(CT), 76%(GSA), 37%(GAA), 43%(G), and 42%(MG). In conclusion, the kinetics of the guanidino compounds under study are different from that of urea; hence, urea kinetics are not representative for the removal of other uremic solutes, even if they are small and water-soluble like urea.

AB  - Abstract Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is an important problem that remains undertreated, even by rheumatologists. We present a case of an elderly patient with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed more than 40?years ago, who suffered from recurrent fractures and attendant complications despite a bone mineral density (BMD) score in the osteopenic range and treatment with bisphosphonates. With improved treatment and outcome of lupus, an increasing number of elderly patients who are susceptible to osteoporotic fractures are expected. This case serves to highlight that rheumatic disease patients on steroids should be screened for GIO, as effective treatment and preventive measures are available. Teriparatide is a promising treatment for patients who have failed bisphosphonate treatment or who are at high risk for fracture. We should also bear in mind that BMD scores alone are not indicative of fracture risk, and other tools such as the WHO-FRAX (Fracture risk assessment tool), serum vitamin D3 levels and bone turnover markers should be used where appropriate. Other measures including attention to factors that contribute to falls should also be considered, necessitating a multi-disciplinary approach.

AB  - Laboratory rhesus macaques are often housed in pairs and may be temporarily or permanently separated for research, health, or management reasons. While both long-term social separations and introductions can stimulate a stress response that impacts inflammation and immune function, the effects of short-term overnight separations and whether qualities of the pair relationship mediate these effects are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of overnight separations on the urinary cortisol concentration of 20 differentially paired adult female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) at the California National Primate Research Center. These females were initially kept in either continuous (no overnight separation) or intermittent (with overnight separation) pair-housing and then switched to the alternate pair-housing condition part way through the study. Each study subject was observed for 5 weeks, during which we collected measures of affiliative, aggressive, anxious, abnormal, and activity-state behaviors in both pair-housing conditions. Additionally, up to three urine samples were collected from each subject per week and assayed for urinary free cortisol and creatinine. Lastly, the behavioral observer scored each pair on four relationship quality attributes (?Anxious,? ?Tense,? ?Well-meshed,? and ?Friendly?) using a seven-point scale. Data were analyzed using a generalized linear model with gamma distribution and an information theoretic approach to determine the best model set. An interaction between the intermittent pairing condition and tense pair adjective rating was in the top three models of the best model set. Dominance and rates of affiliation were also important for explaining urinary cortisol variation. Our results suggest that to prevent significant changes in HPA-axis activation in rhesus macaque females, which could have unintended effects on research outcomes, pairs with ?Tense? relationships and overnight separations preventing tactile contact should be avoided.

AB  - Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely used in critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF). The survival of patients who require CRRT and the factors predicting their outcomes are not well defined. We sought to identify clinical features to predict survival in patients treated with CRRT. We reviewed the charts of all patients who received CRRT at the Toronto General Hospital during the year 2002. Our cohort (n?=?85) represented 97% of patients treated with this modality in 3 critical care units. We identified demographic variables, underlying diagnoses, transplantation status, location (medical-surgical, coronary or cardiovascular surgery intensive care units), CRRT duration, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl), and presence of oliguria (<400?ml/d) on the day of CRRT initiation. The principal outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Among those alive at discharge, we assessed whether there was an ongoing need for renal replacement therapy. Greater than one-third (38%, 32/85) of patients survived to hospital discharge. Three (9%) of the survivors remained dialysis-dependent at the time of discharge. Survivors were younger than non-survivors (mean age 56 vs 60?y.), were on CRRT for a shorter duration (7 vs 13?d.), and had a higher baseline CrCl (79 vs 68?ml/min). Patient survival varied among different critical care units (medical surgical 33%, coronary 38%, and cardiovascular surgery 45%). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that shorter duration of CRRT, non-oliguria, and baseline CrCl?>?60?ml/min were independently associated with survival to hospital discharge (p?<?0.05). Critically ill patients with ARF who require CRRT continue to have high in-hospital mortality. A shorter period of CRRT dependence, non-oliguria, and higher baseline renal function may predict a more favorable prognosis. The majority of CRRT patients who survive their critical illness are independent from dialysis at the time of hospital discharge.

AB  - Abstract. The function of pancreatic grafts harvested from six pancreas-liver (PL) donors was compared to that of nine pancreas-alone (PA) donors. All donors had comparable physiological parameters. Pancreas and liver were flushed in situ with 4C Collins solution and the portal vein was vented immediately. The pancreaticoduodenal grafts were reflushed and stored in Collins solution (three PA and two PL), silica gel-filtered plasma (six PA and two PL), or University of Wisconsin solution (two PL). Later they were revascularized by the iliac vessels and drained into the bladder. All pancreas recipients were insulin-dependent. Serum glucose, amylase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, protein, albumin, and urine amylase, bicarbonate and pH were monitored for 12 days. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fischer's exact test. The PL grafts received a significantly higher aortic flush volume (5983 cc vs 1622 cc, P= 0.001) than those in the other group. Recipients of PL grafts had higher serum amylase (335 vs 250 IU/1) and lipase (1048 vs 424 IU/1), significantly lower levels of urine bicarbonate (11.2vs27.1 mEq/l, P= 0.01), pH (6.8vs7.3, P= 0.04), and amylase (9202 vs 19981 IU/l, P= 0.05) than those in the PA group. Moreover, they required longer periods of gastric suction (4.8 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 3.1 days, P = 0.04), and despite central venous nutrition (4/6 vs 1/9 patients, P = 0.02) had significantly lower serum protein (6.0 ±0.7 vs 5.2 ±0.4 g/dl, P=0.02) and albumin (2.7 ±0.3 vs 3.3±0.4g/dl, P= 0.01) when compared to the other group and to the pre-transplant values (P= 0.03). These data suggest that high volume aortic flush induces pancreatic graft injury. Suggestions for improvement are discussed.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently encountered in hospitalized patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. AKI and CKD are important risk factors for hypoglycemia, if these patients are treated with sulfonylureas and/or insulin. Common reasons include decreased insulin clearance, reduced gluconeogenesis, gastroparesis, hypoglycemic unawareness, and decreased food intake due to poor appetite or lack of timely access to food. Current guidelines generally recommend avoiding certain non-insulin agents in the inpatient setting, and using intravenous insulin (± subcutaneous [SC] basal insulin); or SC basal insulin (± nutritional/correction insulin). Patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency are known to have decreased insulin requirements and a specific approach for insulin dosing in this population of hospitalized patients is needed to minimize the incidence of hypoglycemia. In addition, knowledge of which non-insulin glucose-lowering agents can be used safely and effectively for this population in the in-hospital setting is also considered.

AB  - The biochemical, haemodynamic, clinical, and nutritional benefits of nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) compared with (c/w) 4?hr, 3/week conventional haemodialysis (CHD) are well known and accrue by increasing dialysis time and frequency either for 8?hrs alternate night/week (NHD3.5) or for 8?hrs 6 nights/week NHD (NHD6). However, there is little data yet comparing NHD3.5 with NHD6. 13 NHD6(8.15?hrs/night) were c/w 14 NHD3.5(7.8?hrs/night), all with similar demographic profiles. NHD6 had unrestricted diet and fluid intake but NHD3.5 needed some restriction. Before (b) and after (a) HD phosphate (PO4) control was ideal though bPO4 levels for NHD6 were lower (1.64?mmol/l) c/w NHD3.5(1.83?mmol/l). All NHD6 needed PO4 supplementation c/w 2/14 NHD3.5 but 5/14 NHD3.5 needed PO4 binders c/w 0/13 NHD6. Both had normal blood pressures with 3/14 NHD3.5 needing anti-hypertensives c/w 2/13 NHD6. The bHb was 122.8?g/l (NHD6) c/w 127.7?g/l (NHD3.5) and the balbumin was 38.3?g/l (NHD6) c/w 37.7?g/l (NHD3.5). NHD6 had lower b blood urea (10.2 c/w 19.5?mmol/l) and less interdialytic urea and creatinine fluctuation. NHD6 ultrafiltration rates (UFR) and intradialytic weight gains (mean?±?SEM) were significantly lower (248?±?22.7?ml/hr and 2.03?±?0.19?kg) c/w NHD3.5(453?±?34.6?ml/hr and 2.85?±?0.27?kg): UFR p?<?0.10. We conclude that NHD6 offers the optimum biochemical, volume, and clinical outcome but NHD3.5 still has a clear and major advantage over CHD and a dual additional appeal to providers seeking home-based therapy cost advantages and consumable expenditure control. A flexible dialysis program should offer all the time and frequency options of NHD but, in particular, should support NHD at a frequency sympathetic to the clinical, rehabilitation, and lifestyle aspirations of individual patients.

AB  - Background Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods Prospective study of a population-representative 1972?1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Results Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (N = 837, 50.5% male). suPAR (mean 2.40 ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, p < .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; p = .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; p < .001). Conclusions Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score has been extensively used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation and determine their prognosis, but with limited predictive value. Autonomic dysfunction may correlate with increased mortality after liver transplant. In this study, two autonomic biomarkers, complexity and deceleration capacity, were added to the predicting model for 1-year mortality after liver transplantation. Methods In all, 30 patients with end-stage liver diseases awaiting liver transplantation were included. Complexity and deceleration capacity were calculated by multi-scale entropy and phase-rectified signal averaging, respectively. Different combinations of autonomic factors and MELD score were used to predict mortality rate of liver transplant after 1-year follow-up. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to determine clinical predictability. Area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve represents the overall accuracy. Results The 1-year mortality rate was 16.7% (5/30). The overall accuracy of MELD score used for predicting mortality after liver transplantation was 0.752. By adding complexity and deceleration capacity into the predicting model, the accuracy increased to 0.912. Notably, the accuracy of the prediction using complexity and deceleration capacity alone was 0.912. Conclusion Complexity and deceleration capacity, which represent different dynamical properties of a human autonomic system, are critical factors for predicting mortality rate of liver transplantation. We recommend that these pre-operative autonomic factors may be helpful as critical adjuncts to predicting model of mortality rate in prioritizing organ allocation.

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - Abstract.? Bounameaux H (Division of Angiology and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland). Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions (Review). J Intern Med 2010; 268: 218?231. Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2?3. This initial period of 3?months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit?risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.
