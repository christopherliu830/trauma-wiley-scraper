AB  - Abstract Background:? Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is a revolution in minimally invasive surgery in recent years, and cholecystectomy is the most common intervention. However, laparoendoscopic single-site cholecystectomy (LESSC) is a controversial procedure. Its safety, cosmetic results, complications, post-operative pain and post-operative stay are not confirmed by multi-centre randomized controlled studies. Objectives:? This review examined the impact of LESSC versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). The primary outcomes were conversional rate and intraoperative and post-operative complications, and other outcomes were cosmetic results, operative time, post-operative pain and post-operative stay. Data sources:? Pubmed, EMbase, Web of Science, Ovid, clinical trials of the US National Institutes of Health and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register were searched to identify all possible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods:? Two reviewers completed article search, and eligible data were entered into a computerized spreadsheet for analysis. Results:? Nine studies were obtained using the search strategy. Patients accepting LESSC had a higher conversion rate than those having CLC (7.17 (3.00, 17.11) (P < 0.01)). There was no significant difference for total complications between the two groups (1.17 (0.76, 1.80) (P= 0.46)), but incidence of incisional hernia and haemorrhage (seroma) in the LESSC group was obviously higher than that in the CLC group. Operative time was much longer in the LESSC group (mean difference: 10.69 (3.14, 18.24) (P= 0.006)). Cosmetic results favoured LESSC; however, post-operative abdominal pain and post-operative stay were not significantly different between the two groups in most of the nine studies. Conclusions:? LESSC can be safely performed with better cosmetic results; however, it carries a higher conversion rate and a longer operative time, and offers no benefit in terms of post-operative abdominal pain and post-operative stay. Further RCTs, according to the CONSORT statement, are advocated to validate its objective benefits.

AB  - Forty-eight chronically (>3 months) ?-receptor-blocked patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension were studied on 49 occasions after random distribution to a 4-day, gradual preoperative withdrawal (n = 26) or a continuation (n = 23) of ?-receptor blockers. The patients were scheduled for either a cholecystectomy (n = 28) or a carotid thrombendarterectomy (n = 21) under neurolept anaesthesia. Three patients were excluded from the randomized part of the study due to complications (tachycardia, hypertension, severe angina) after therapy withdrawal. In subgroups, central haemodynamics (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 6, continued n = 8) and creatinine-kinase B (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 9, continued n= 11) were studied. Withdrawal of ?-receptor blockers was associated with high heart rates, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and a hyperkinetic circulation during pain stimuli. Significantly more postoperative ECG changes (p<0.02) indicative of myocardial ischaemia were found than in ?-receptor blocked patients. These patients had low heart rates but also pronounced increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, which in single patients could be associated with myocardial damage. These results imply that ?-receptor blockers should be continued before surgery and that a concomitant vasodilatatory therapy is likely to avoid the drawbacks of an increased cardiac afterload.

AB  - A three-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for loss of vision associated with hyperthermia, lethargy and anorexia. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis. Cytological examination of aqueous and vitreous humours was performed and revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture from aqueous and vitreous humour. No primary infection site was identified. Active uveitis resolved after systemic antibiotic therapy, but the vision loss was permanent. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to E. faecalis infection in a cat.

AB  - Summary Ureteral obstructions are a major clinical problem in small animal veterinary patients most commonly associated with ureteroliths, ureteral strictures, and trigonal neoplasia of the ureterovesicular junction (UVJ). With the invasiveness and morbidity associated with traditional surgical treatments, interventional options have become the mainstay of treatment in the author's practice. The main treatment options discussed in this chapter are the use of nephrostomy tubes, ureteral stents, and subcutaneous ureteral bypass devices (SUB). Ureteral stenting is most commonly accomplished using endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance in canine patients, and surgically-assisted with fluoroscopy in feline patients. These devices are used for a variety of obstructive disorders in both dogs and cats. The main type of ureteral stent used in veterinary medicine is an indwelling soft double pigtail ureteral stent that can remain in place for numerous months to years if necessary.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Abstract The overall number of pancreas transplants continued to increase to 1027 in 2018, after a nadir of 947 in 2015. New additions to waiting list remained stable, with 1485 candidates added in 2018. Proportions of patients with type II diabetes waiting for transplant (14.6%) and undergoing transplant (14.8%) have steadily increased since 2016. Waiting times for simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant have decreased; median months to transplant was 13.5 for simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant and 19.7 for pancreas transplant alone in 2018. Outcomes, including patient and kidney survival, as well as rejection rates, have improved consistently over the past several years. Pancreas graft survival data are being collected by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and will be included in a future report once there are sufficient cohorts for analysis.

AB  - Control of certain clinical and laboratory parameters affects morbidity and mortality of type 2 diabetic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) both before and after initiation of hemodialysis (HD). To identify areas and stage of renal failure where control of these critical variables needs improvement, we compared important clinical and laboratory parameters 6 months before (PRE) and 6 months after starting HD (POST) in 43 type 2 diabetic men with CRF, who were 69.3?±?10.7 years old at HD initiation. Differences, all at p?≤?0.05, were found in blood pressure, in mm Hg, at the physician's office, both systolic (PRE 154?±?16, POST 138?±?18) and diastolic (PRE 77?±?13, POST 69?±?11), serum cholesterol in mg/dL (PRE 206?±?61, POST 159?±?40), and serum creatinine in mg/dL (PRE 4.1?±?1.3, POST 7.0?±?1.8), while no differences were noted in blood hematocrit (PRE 36?±?7%, POST 34?±?9%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin (PRE 7.4?±?1.7%, POST 6.9?±?2.3%), serum glucose in mg/dL (PRE 151?±?67, POST 184?±?94), serum phosphorus in mg/dL (PRE 4.5?±?0.8, POST 4.6?±?1.5), serum calcium in mg/dL (PRE 8.7?±?0.5, POST 8.5?±?1.4), and serum albumin in g/dL (PRE 3.2?±?0.5, POST 3.4?±?0.6). Compared to the POST category, significantly (p?≤?0.05) higher percentages were found in the PRE category for systolic blood pressure >150?mm Hg (PRE 58.8%, POST 26.5%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin >8%(PRE 33.3%, POST 13.3%), serum cholesterol >200?mg/dL (PRE 48.4%, POST 19.4%). A lower percentage was found in the PRE category for serum phosphorus >5.5?mg/dL (PRE 13.2%, POST 31.6%), while the corresponding percentages for serum albumin <3.0?g/dL (PRE 21.6%, POST 18.9%) and serum calcium <8?mg/dL (PRE 7.9%, POST 13.2%) did not differ. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal failure, control of blood pressure, glycemia, and serum lipids appears to be better; whereas, control of serum phosphorus is worse in the first year after starting chronic hemodialysis than in the preceding year. There is room for improvement, both before and after hemodialysis initiation, in the control of these variables, which affect the clinical outcomes of hemodialysis.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46-year-old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5?mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37?°C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4?g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm3. Serum sodium was 134?mmol/l, potassium 6.4?mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3?mmol/l, urea 30?mmol/l, creatinine 998??mol/l, glucose 5.16?mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4?mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen-associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was >600?ng/ml (therapeutic range 80?400?ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (<200?ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4-h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72?h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.

AB  - Objective? To determine the clinical value of a novel osteoarthritis (OA) biomarker in detecting canine cruciate disease. Study Design? Cross sectional clinical study. Animals? Dogs (n=22) with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture and 12 control dogs. Methods? Concentrations of collagenase-generated cleavage epitope of type II collagen (Col2-3/4Clong mono, or C2C) in serum, urine, and joint fluid were compared between a group of dogs with CCL rupture and a control group. Correlation of C2C concentrations to the clinical stage of stifle OA was also evaluated. Results? There were no significant differences in C2C concentrations in serum, urine, and joint fluid between groups (P>.05). Subjective scores of lameness, joint effusion, osteophytosis were significantly more severe in the CCL rupture group compared with the control group (P<.05). There was no significant correlation of C2C concentrations with clinical stage of stifle OA (P>.05). Conclusion? This OA biomarker did not detect pathology associated with CCL rupture. Our results suggest that collagenase-specific degradation of type II collagen in articular cartilage may not be involved in the early stage of naturally occurring canine cruciate disease, and that pathology associated with naturally occurring CCL rupture is different from that of experimental OA model. Clinical Relevance? C2C is not clinically useful in detecting CCL rupture in dogs.

AB  - Summary Renal transplantation is an established treatment for end-stage renal failure in cats. Short- and long-term complications are relatively frequent. Ureteral complications, particularly ureteral obstruction, occur relatively frequently after feline renal transplantation. Delayed graft function in human renal transplant recipients is associated with an increased incidence of acute rejection, poor long-term graft function, and reduced survival. Allografts with delayed graft function should have minimal renal pelvic dilation (a sign of ureteral obstruction), good graft perfusion, and a normal resistive index. After renal transplantation, lifelong immunosuppressive therapy is needed to maintain the allograft and prevent rejection. In cats, the standard immunosuppressive protocol consists of microemulsified cyclosporine and prednisolone. Postoperative infections are relatively common in immunosuppressed feline renal allograft recipients. In cats with infections, appropriate medical therapy should be initiated. Cyclosporine concentration should be carefully monitored and adjusted.

AB  - ABSTRACT Kidney transplant provides significant survival, cost, and quality-of-life benefits over dialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease, but the number of kidney transplant candidates on the waiting list continues to grow annually. By the end of 2014, nearly 100,000 adult candidates and 1500 pediatric candidates were waiting for kidney transplant. Not surprisingly, waiting times also continued to increase, along with the number of adult candidates removed from the list due to death or deteriorating medical condition. Death censored graft survival has increased after both living and deceased donor transplants over the past decade in adult recipients. The majority of the trends seen over the past 5 years continued in 2014. However, the new allocation system was implemented in late 2014, providing an opportunity to assess changes in these trends in the coming years.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - The Aksys PHD system is designed for short quotidian dialysis employing a 52-liter batch of ultrapure dialysate and up to 30 in situ hot water reuses of the entire extracorporeal circuit including a 40-liter physical cleaning before each dialysis. Methods:?We studied the effect of the 52-liter tank during 108 long 5?8 hour dialysis 3.5?6 times/week in 5 patients and one 50-liter patient simulator for 4 weeks. Phosphate (PO4), beta-2 microglobulin (b-2), urea (BUN), and creatinine (creat) were measured pre-, during, and post-dialysis 86 times and in total dialysate 74 times during long dialysis. Tank saturation, Kt/V, and monthly chemistries were also measured. Results:? Patient weight 76?±?2?kg, QB 234?±?23?ml/min, QD 498?±?13?ml/min. Dialysate was recirculated 4.8 times during 8 hours. Analyte Short Long dialysis p Pre-BUN ???70?±?18 ???49?±?15 <0.0001 Pre-creat ???12?±?3 ???10?±?2 <0.0002 Pre-PO4 ?5.2?±?1.5 ?4.1?±?1.1 <0.003 Pre-b-2 34.0?±?5.3 27.8?±?4.5 <0.0001 All patients on 8?hrs???5 dialyses/week stopped phosphate binders within 3 weeks. eKt/V(urea) rose to 0.5 in one hour and then slowly to 0.8 at 8 hours. Weekly stdKt/V: Dialyses/week/Hrs: 2 5 8 5 2.2 2.7 3.0 6 2.7 3.4 3.6 7 3.1 3.8 4.4 At 8?hrs the tank was 99?±?8% saturated with BUN, 86?±?12% with creat, 77?±?18% with PO4, and only 12?±?5% with b-2. Total removal per dialysis increased 2 gm BUN, 0.4?gm?creat, 0.4?gm PO4, and 40?mg?b-2. The decline per reuse in conductivity clearance was only 0.7?±?1.2% during short and 1.4?±?1.4% during long dialysis (p?=?0.11). There was no change in monthly chemistries or hematologies. Discussion:? The data show that the Aksys PHD is very effective for long 8-hour dialysis. The data for PO4 and b-2 are the same as reported for conventional dialysis machines using 5 times as much dialysate, and the weekly stdKt/V if the PHD is used every night is twice the standard defined by K/DOQI. The exceptional cleanliness and biocompatibility by way of the one-per-month reuse should be a great advantage to patients. The full automatization saves the patient one hour every night and 30 minutes every morning. The PHD also economizes on filters and dialysate and is good for the environment.

AB  - ABSTRACT A 48 year old man rapidly deteriorated and died following the intentional ingestion of a commercial pesticide mixture containing chlordane and dichloroethyl ether with kerosene as the solvent vehicle. After oral ingestion, chlordane is primarily a neurotoxin. Dichloroethyl ether is a respiratory tract irritant. Both have effects on several other systems. Kerosene is a potent cause of aspiration pneumonitis when inhaled and gastric emptying is not recommended unless it is the vehicle for other, more toxic substances, as in this case. Management for both chlordane and dichloroethyl ether ingestion is supportive, involving airway maintenance, decontamination, and gastric lavage and charcoal administration.

AB  - Case A 65-year-old arteriopath with a history of myocardial infarction 5 months previously presented with classical signs of mesenteric infarction that led to a right hemicolectomy with an end ileostomy. Outcome Postoperative complications occurred due to unusually large volume ileostomy output in the subsequent 4 weeks, resulting in severe volume depletion and the sequelae that required intensive care support. These were triggered and prolonged by two episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis. Conclusions Sepsis-induced high ileostomy output following intestinal resection for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia is a serious complication. Early restoration of intestinal continuity following bowel resection for established infarction may prevent this complication.
