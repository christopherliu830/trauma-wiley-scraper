AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.

AB  - Abstract Proper pancreas retrieval during multi-organ recovery is one of the cornerstones of technically successful whole-organ pancreas transplantation. With evolving surgical approaches for organ retrieval and implantation, it has become standard to procure the pancreas in conjunction with other abdominal organs without compromising either vasculature, graft quality, or transplant outcomes. This review summarizes the major steps required for proper whole-organ retrieval of the pancreas allograft with suggestions and tips whenever alternative approaches are available.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, aggressive, soft-tissue infection that results in necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. It spreads rapidly and may progress to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death. Predisposing conditions include diabetes, chronic alcoholism, advanced age, vascular disease, and immunosuppression and many cases are preceded by an injury or invasive procedure. Necrotizing soft-tissue infection of the breast is uncommon, with only a few reported cases in the literature. We present a 53-year-old diabetic woman who presented to the emergency room with several weeks of worsening breast and shoulder pain, swelling, and erythema. Upon formal evaluation by the surgical service, a necrotizing soft-tissue infection was suspected, and the patient was scheduled for emergent, surgical debridement. Because of the aggressive nature and high mortality of this disease, immediate surgical intervention, coupled with antibiotic therapy and physiologic support, is necessary to prevent complications and death.

AB  - Increasing number of uremic patients, who need IHD, is a great challenge for every society but especially for poor and developing countries. The aim of our study is to look if small (not very expensive) increase in IHD adequacy is able to improve standard medical parameters. In 40 patients, treated with IHD for 57.5 (1?185) months, Kt/V was monitored on-line during the middle IHD session in the week, 4 times in each of 6 consecutive months. Measurements of Kt/V based on a conductivity method. In the first month of observation Kt/V was lower (1.09?±?0.02, p?<?0.0009) than in later months, in which Kt/V was ranging from 1.13?±?0.04 to 1.17?±?0.01. Blood morphology was estimated every month. At the beginning of study period, after 3 months, and at the end of studies, dry body mass, BMI, the blood pH and serum concentration of calcium, phosphate, intact PTH, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, iron, ferritin, urea, and creatinine were determined. The increase in Kt/V was accompanied by rising values of Hb (99.1?±?16.6 ? 105.1?±?12.5?g/l, p?=?0.022), Hct (31.6?±?5.2 ? 33.8?±?3.6%, p?=?0.004), MCV (95.9?±?7.7 ? 100.7 fl?±?5.7, p?=?0.000), iron (58.2?±?29.6 ? 73.2?±?27.8??g/dl, p?=?0.002), blood pH before (7.26?±?0.04 ? 7.41?±?0.04, p?=?0.000) and after (7.34?±?0.05 ? 7.48?±?0.05, p?=?0.000) IHD session as well as by decreasing values of PTH [918 (38?3500)? 420 (15?4341)?pg/ml, p?=?0.036]. Statistically unchanged parameters included dry body mass (70.4?±?15.6 ? 70.9?±?16.1?kg), BMI (28.21?±?6.73 ? 28.23?±?6.79?kg/m2), serum concentration of total protein (69.1?±?5.7 ? 70.9?±?4.8?g/l), phosphate (5.72?±?1.50 ? 5.39?±?2.02?mg/dl), cholesterol (203?±?49 ? 191?±?62?mg/dl) and ferritin (740?±?558 ? 632?±?346?ng/dl) as well as WBC (8.60?±?3.89 ? 6.52?±?1.50?K/nl) and PLT (251?±?91 ? 195?±?60?K/nl). There were correlations between Kt/V and serum concentrations of phosphate (r?=?0.370, p?=?0.019), PTH (r?=?0.314, p?=?0.048), ferritin (r?=?0.417, p?=?0.007), Hb (r?=??0.376, p?=?0.017), and Hct (r?=?0.374, p?=??0.017). Our results indicate that even a small increase in IHD adequacy leads to beneficial changes in management of uremic patients (better response on erythropoietin, diminished laboratory features of secondary hyperparathyroidism, better iron utilization). Correlation between Kt/V and examined parameters indicate that higher IHD doses were provided to patients in more advanced uremic state. It may partially explain advantages observed with incremental IHD adequacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an important treatment modality during severe sickle cell crisis (SCC). SCC patients who refuse, or cannot accept, RBCs present a unique challenge. Acellular hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) might be an alternative for critically ill patients in SCC with multiorgan failure due to life-threatening anemia. HBOC-201 (HbO2 Therapeutics) has been administered to more than 800 anemic patients in 22 clinical trials, but use of any HBOCs in critically ill sickle cell patients with organ failure is exceedingly rare. In the United States, HBOC-201 is currently only available for expanded access. CASE REPORT We report three cases of HBOC-201 administered to critically ill sickle cell disease patients in SCC with multiorgan failure, either who refused RBCs (Jehovah's Witnesses) or for whom compatible RBCs were not available. RESULTS Two patients received more than 20 units of HBOC-201, while the other received 6. The 27 units used in the third case equals the largest volume a patient has successfully received to date. All three patients survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION These reports suggest that blood substitutes such as HBOC-201 can provide an oxygen bridge in SCC with multiorgan failure, until corpuscular Hb levels recover to meet metabolic demand, and highlight the compelling biochemical properties that warrant further investigation.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of 80-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status. It discusses the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary embolism. Dyspnea accompanied by diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or syncope describes the geriatric patient who may be presenting with ACS. Geriatric patients presenting with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) demonstrate improved outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus fibrinolytic treatment. The diagnosis of CHF in elderly patients presenting with dyspnea is often delayed due to atypical symptoms and multiple comorbidities. Beta-blockers are very effective for management of CHF in elderly patients, they are contraindicated in the presence of comorbid pulmonary disease and can cause symptomatic bradycardias and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction disorders. Rapid and aggressive therapy must be tempered by patient and family wishes regarding end-of-life care.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess whether the initiation of vasopressor infusions via peripheral venous catheters (PVC) compared to central venous catheters (CVC) in ED patients with early septic shock was associated with differences in processes of care and outcomes. Methods We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the ARISE trial. We compared participants who had a vasopressor infusion first commenced via a PVC versus a CVC. The primary outcome was 90 day mortality. Results We studied 937 participants. Of these, 389 (42%) had early vasopressor infusion commenced via a PVC and 548 (58%) via a CVC. Trial participants who received a vasopressor infusion via a PVC were more severely ill, with higher median (interquartile range [IQR]) Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (17 [13?23] versus 16 [12?21], P = 0.003), and higher median (IQR) lactate (mmol/L) (3.6 [1.9?5.8] versus 2.5 [1.5?4.5], P?<?0.001). After adjusting for baseline covariates, the estimated odds ratio for mortality for PVC-treated patients was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.95?1.67, P = 0.11). Trial participants who had vasopressors commenced via PVC had a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of antimicrobials (55 [32?96] versus 71.5 [39?119] min, P?<?0.001) and a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of vasopressors (2.4 [1.3?3.9] versus 4.9 [3.5?6.6] h, P?<?0.001). Conclusion The practice of commencing a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was common in the ARISE trial and more frequent in trial participants with higher severity of illness. Commencement of a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was associated with some improvements in processes of care and, after adjustment, was not associated with an increased risk of death.

AB  - Objective? To investigate the development of gingival hyperplasia in dogs after renal transplantation and administration of microemulsified cyclosporine A (MCsA). Study Design? Experimental study. Animals? Healthy adult mongrel dogs (n=5). Methods? As part of study on renal transplantation, dogs administered MCsA (20?mg/kg/day), azathioprine, and prednisolone to prevent graft rejection were monitored for development of gingival changes. Prednisolone was discontinued after 3 months. MCsA dose was adjusted to maintain whole blood trough concentration of 400?700?ng/mL. Gingival change was evaluated by weekly examination and photodocumentation, and gingival biopsy for histopathology was performed at 28 weeks. Results? One dog was lost because of acute graft rejection. Gingival hyperplasia developed in 3 of 4 dogs. The earliest gingival changes occurred in the interdental papillae at 20 weeks after transplantation. On histopathology, the underlying connective tissue was thickened and contained increase numbers of fibroblasts and inflammatory infiltrates. Conclusions? Long-term immunosuppression with an MCsA-based treatment likely induces substantial gingival hyperplasia when therapeutic, immunosuppressive blood levels of MCsA were maintained for 32 weeks. Clinical Relevance? MCsA is used for immune-mediated diseases and preventing rejection after transplant in dogs. MCsA blood levels, and gingival hyperplasia should be monitored by routine examination of the interdental papilla in dogs administered MCsA for long periods.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - Abstract To evaluate the effect of donor age on graft and patient outcome after liver transplantation an analysis of a large-scale cohort study was performed at three tertiary referral liver transplant centers. Between April 1990 and June 1994, 772 adults underwent an initial single-organ liver transplantation. The age of the donors averaged 35 years;193 (25%) were 50 or above, the age used to define ?older? donors. Groups were compared for demographic, clinical, and biochemical features. Outcome was measured using results of biochemical tests after transplantation and by graft and patient survival. Compared with younger donors, older donors were more commonly women (59% vs. 33%:P ≤ .001) and died of central nervous system causes (79% vs. 28%) as opposed to trauma (13% vs. 63%:P ≤ .001). The recipients of the two groups of donor livers did not differ in important respects. However, intraoperatively, livers from older donors were more likely to be assessed as either ?poor? or ?fair? as opposed to ?good? (17% vs. 4%:P ≤ .001) by the harvesting surgeon and to have initial ?poor? or ?fair? bile production (29% vs. 18%:P ≤ .001). During the first week postoperatively, the serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels and prothrombin times were higher in recipients of older than those of younger donor livers. During follow-up, graft survival was less for recipients of older donor livers at 3 months (81% vs.91%:P = .0001) and at 1 (76% vs. 85%:P = .007) and 2 years (71% vs. 80%:P = .005); patient survival showed similar though less marked differences. This association of donor age and poorer graft survival persisted after adjusting for many variables using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Importantly, however, the association with poor graft survival was largely among recipients of older donor livers, the quality of which was assessed as fair or poor by the harvesting surgeon; recipients of older donor livers assessed as good had a retransplant-free survival similar to that of younger donor livers (87% vs. 91% at 3 months). Thus, use of older donor livers, the quality of which are judged to be good by the harvesting surgeon, is not associated with a decrease in patient or graft survival after liver transplantation. differences.

AB  - Abstract Williams?Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multi-system disorder that requires ongoing management by a primary care physician familiar with the natural history and common medical problems associated with the condition. Some abnormalities are unique to WBS, such as the elastin arteriopathy that often manifests as supravalvar aortic stenosis and hypertension. Still other features, such as diverticulosis, are seen in the general population but tend to present earlier in WBS. Life long monitoring of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems is essential to the clinical management of individuals with Williams?Beuren syndrome. Constipation should be aggressively managed, and symptoms of abdominal pain should prompt an evaluation for diverticulosis/diverticulitis. While the mean IQ of WBS is in the mild mental retardation range, difficulties with attention and anxiety are more likely to negatively impact independent functioning in the adult with WBS. There is no evidence for decline in cognitive ability over time, but adaptive functioning may be improved with treatment of anxiety by both behavior and medical modalities. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.) Hemoglobin 12.1?gm/DL 7.6?gm/DL Hematocrit 35.5?gm/DL 21.1?gm/DL Platelet count 268,000 tho/ul 43,000?tho/ul L.D.H 90?IU/L 2494?IU/L Valproic Acid 490.9?mg/L 74.1?mg/L * C.H. (Charcoal Hemoperfusion) Blood ? evidence of massive hemolysis intra-vascular hemolysis, shown in table (no evidence of HUS/TTP). She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - Abstract Background? Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the repair and regeneration of the endothelium and may represent a novel cardiovascular risk factor. South Asian subjects have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which is not fully explained by known risk factors. This study examined associations of EPCs with atherosclerosis and possible ethnic differences in EPCs. Materials and methods? A population sample of 58 European and South Asian adult men was enriched with the recruitment of an additional 59 European and South Asian men with known coronary disease. The coronary artery calcification score was measured by multi-slice computerized tomography (CT), carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT), and femoral plaques were measured by ultrasound. The subjects were further subdivided into three categories of coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary artery calcification score and clinical history. Total EPCs and non-senescent EPCs (ns-EPCs) were quantified after 5 days cell culture and the number of late outgrowth colonies was measured over a 6-week test period. Circulating CD34+ haematopoietic precursor cells were measured by flow cytometry. Results? Individuals with femoral plaques had reduced total and ns-EPCs. The number of ns-EPCs were reduced in individuals with the most coronary atheroma and were inversely related to the coronary calcification score and femoral IMT. These relationships persisted after multivariate adjustment for other risk factors. The numbers of late outgrowth colonies or circulating CD34+ cells were unrelated to the presence of atherosclerosis. There were no differences in the number of EPCs between European and South Asian subjects. Conclusion? The number of EPCs are reduced in subjects with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors. Reduction in EPC numbers may be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis but does not explain ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence?4 What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (MIP) has shown high efficacy and safety for the management of small renal stones. It was initially developed to overcome a gap between the minimally invasive extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and invasive conventional percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PCNL) in the management of low stone burden but there is debate as to whether the MIP is also effective for larger stones. The present study shows the high efficacy and safety of MIP, which is comparable to conventional PCNL in the treatment of stones of >20?mm, including complex staghorn stones. OBJECTIVE ?? To evaluate the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (MIP) in the management of large and complex renal calculi. PATIENTS AND METHODS ?? From January 2007 to March 2011, 73 patients with 83 renal units with large renal stones (>20?mm in diameter) were retrospectively evaluated. ?? Stones were classified into simple (isolated renal pelvis or isolated calyceal stones) or complex (partial or complete staghorn stones, renal pelvis stones with accompanying calyceal stones). ?? Stone-free rate, complications according to the modified Clavien system, decrease in haemoglobin, creatinine level, operative duration and hospital stay were compared for simple and complex renal calculi. RESULTS ?? The mean (sd) stone size was 36.7?(23.37)?mm and mean operative duration was 99.2?(48.3)?min. ?? In all, 65 cases (78.3%) were stone-free after the first procedure and another 14 needed an auxiliary procedure (four second-look percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy, nine ureterorenoscopy, and one extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy) to become stone-free, resulting in a 95.2% stone-free rate. ?? Complications occurred in 22 procedures (26.5%), 17 of them were Clavien Grade 1 or 2 (20.5%), five were Grade 3 (6%). There were no Grade 4 or 5 complications. ?? The only significant difference between complex and simple stones was the stone-free rate (96.9% vs 66.7%, P= 0.001). CONCLUSION ?? The MIP technique is effective and safe for larger stones with low morbidity, good success rate and reasonable operative duration.
