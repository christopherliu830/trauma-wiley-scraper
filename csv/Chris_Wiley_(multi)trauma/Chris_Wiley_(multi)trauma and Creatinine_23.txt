AB  - Objectives To characterise the presentation, clinicopathologic data and outcome of 29 dogs with presumed primary renal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of medical records of dogs with suspected primary renal lymphoma from 11 institutions. Results All dogs were substage b, and lethargy and gastrointestinal signs were common presenting complaints, as were azotaemia (n=25; 86%) and erythrocytosis (n=15; 51%) on biochemical testing. Ultrasonography typically revealed bilateral renal lesions (n=23; 79%), renomegaly (n=22; 76%) and abdominal lymphadenopathy (n=14; 48%). Chemotherapy was the only treatment in 23 dogs, of which 11 responded, all considered partial responses. For all dogs the median progression-free survival and median overall survival times were 10 days (range: 1 to 126) and 12?days (range: 1 to 212), respectively, and for dogs that responded to chemotherapy 41?days (range: 10 to 126) and 47?days (range: 10 to 212), respectively. Clinical Significance Primary renal lymphoma in dogs appears to be associated with a poor prognosis and short-lived response to chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract Background? Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the repair and regeneration of the endothelium and may represent a novel cardiovascular risk factor. South Asian subjects have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which is not fully explained by known risk factors. This study examined associations of EPCs with atherosclerosis and possible ethnic differences in EPCs. Materials and methods? A population sample of 58 European and South Asian adult men was enriched with the recruitment of an additional 59 European and South Asian men with known coronary disease. The coronary artery calcification score was measured by multi-slice computerized tomography (CT), carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT), and femoral plaques were measured by ultrasound. The subjects were further subdivided into three categories of coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary artery calcification score and clinical history. Total EPCs and non-senescent EPCs (ns-EPCs) were quantified after 5 days cell culture and the number of late outgrowth colonies was measured over a 6-week test period. Circulating CD34+ haematopoietic precursor cells were measured by flow cytometry. Results? Individuals with femoral plaques had reduced total and ns-EPCs. The number of ns-EPCs were reduced in individuals with the most coronary atheroma and were inversely related to the coronary calcification score and femoral IMT. These relationships persisted after multivariate adjustment for other risk factors. The numbers of late outgrowth colonies or circulating CD34+ cells were unrelated to the presence of atherosclerosis. There were no differences in the number of EPCs between European and South Asian subjects. Conclusion? The number of EPCs are reduced in subjects with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors. Reduction in EPC numbers may be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis but does not explain ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Objectives: To report the clinicopathological findings and outcome in cats with pancreatitis-associated extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction (EHBO) treated by choledochal tube stenting. Methods: Medical records of cats with EHBO secondary to pancreatitis that underwent choledochal stenting were reviewed. Information on outcome was obtained by re-examination of the cat or by telephone interview with the owners. Results: All cats had pancreatitis confirmed by histopathological examination of biopsy samples (n=6) or suspected based on gross examination at surgery (n=1). In six cats, a section of 3·5 to five French gauge red rubber catheter and in one cat a section of 22?G intravenous catheter were used as a choledochal stent. Two cats developed re-obstruction of the biliary tract within a week of the original surgery. One cat had confirmed episodes of ascending cholangitis postoperatively. Two cats had chronic intermittent vomiting in the postoperative period. Two cats died during the perioperative period. Five cats survived to discharge, three of which died seven to 24 months postoperatively and two of which remain alive to date. Clinical Significance: Choledochal stenting is an alternative to biliary diversion for management of feline pancreatitis-associated EHBO in select cases. However, there may be greater morbidity with this technique in cats compared with dogs.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Living-related donors are the source of almost all organ transplants in India. However, these donations fall far short of current needs, and there remains a huge disparity between demand and supply of organs. In the last five yr, a consistent increase in deceased donor transplant activity has been observed in some southern Indian states. This report describes our experience of establishing a new deceased donor program in the state of Uttar Pradesh in north India. Methods We describe our experience on counseling families of all brain-dead patients admitted to our center from October 2013 to September 2014 and data on retrieving and transplanting organs. Results A total of 99 brain-dead patients were identified, of which 67 were medically eligible as donors. Fourteen patients developed cardiac arrest before the counseling could begin. Only eight families agreed for multi-organ donation. Conclusion Lack of consensus among the family members, mistrust of the medical system, fear of mutilation of the body, and delay in the funeral were identified as the main reasons behind negative consent. Conversely, mass media campaign, proper ICU care of brain-dead patients, rapport with the family and streamlining all medico legal processes were associated with positive consent.

AB  - Objective To investigate local and systemic pharmacokinetics of gentamicin after intra-articular implantation of a gentamicin impregnated collagen sponge (GICS) in the inflamed canine joint. Study Design Descriptive repeated measures experimental study. Animals Dogs (n?=?9). Methods Stifle joint inflammation was caused by urate injection. Twenty-four hours later a GICS (gentamicin dose, 6?mg/kg) was arthroscopically implanted. Synovial fluid and plasma gentamicin concentrations were measured for 14 days after implantation, and pharmacokinetic parameters modeled using statistical moment analyses. Results Intra-articular gentamicin concentrations fell to sub-MIC for Staphylococcus sp. (4?µg/mL) by 22.4?hours (95% CI: 18.6?26.2) after sponge implantation. Cmax synovial was 2397?µg/mL (95%CI: 1161?3634?µg/mL) at 1.2?hours (95%CI: 0.5?1.8?hours). Plasma gentamicin concentrations achieved levels of Cmax plasma?=?8.0?µg/mL (95%CI: 6.1?10.0?µg/mL) at 1.5?hours (95%CI: 0.8?2.1) after GICS placement and fell below target trough of 2.0?µg/mL by 5.6?hours (95%CI: 4.7?6.5?hours) after GICS placement. Conclusions Intra-articular gentamicin concentration after GICS placement at an IV-equivalent dose reached high levels and declined rapidly. The maximum plasma levels attained were ?1/3 of the recommended sub-toxic target for people after parenteral gentamicin administration.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of a novel controlled-release formulation of carbimazole in feline hyperthyroidism. Methods: A multicentre, self-controlled study in 44 client-owned cats with history and clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, and total thyroxine concentration greater than or equal to 50 nmol/l. Treatment was started at 15 mg once daily, response assessed after 10 days, and 3, 5, 8, 26 and 53 weeks and dose adjusted as required. Results: The median dose of carbimazole was 10 mg (range 10 to 15 mg) and 15 mg (5 to 25 mg) once daily after 3 and 53 weeks, respectively. Median total thyroxine concentration dropped significantly from 118 nmol/l (50 to 320 nmol/l) at presentation to 33 nmol/l (n=40) after 10 days, 31 nmol/l (n=34) at 3 weeks and 21 nmol/l (n=18) at 53 weeks. Clinical signs improved or resolved in almost all cats within three weeks after starting treatment. Twenty-one adverse reactions possibly (20) or probably (1) related to treatment were reported. During treatment, increased blood urea nitrogen concentration was observed in 25 per cent of the cats, eosinophilia in 20 per cent and lymphopenia in 16 per cent, while liver enzymes tended to improve. Clinical Significance: Once daily administration of controlled-release carbimazole tablets was effective and had expected tolerance in hyperthyroid cats during short- and long-term treatment.

AB  - Abstract Antifungal agents may be associated with significant toxicity or drug interactions leading to sub-therapeutic antifungal drug concentrations and poorer clinical outcomes for patients with haematological malignancy. These risks may be minimised by clinical assessment, laboratory monitoring, avoidance of particular drug combinations and dose modification. Specific measures, such as the optimal timing of oral drug administration in relation to meals, use of pre-hydration and electrolyte supplementation may also be required. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antifungal agents is warranted, especially where non-compliance, non-linear pharmacokinetics, inadequate absorption, a narrow therapeutic window, suspected drug interaction or unexpected toxicity are encountered. Recommended indications for voriconazole and posaconazole TDM in the clinical management of haematology patients are provided. With emerging knowledge regarding the impact of pharmacogenomics upon metabolism of azole agents (particularly voriconazole), potential applications of pharmacogenomic evaluation to clinical practice are proposed.

AB  - Summary Cardiogenic shock may be due to a range of cardiac disorders. In 75% of cases, the cause is acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular failure, or, less commonly, ventricular septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture, free wall rupture or right ventricular infarction. This chapter summarizes focused clinical assessment and investigation in suspected cardiogenic shock. Diuretics are relatively ineffective in patients with cardiogenic shock, but can be used in case of fluid overload once the cardiac output has increased (as shown by improvement in the patient's mental state and skin perfusion): if renal function is normal, give furosemide 40 mg IV. If the patient is not improving, consider haemodynamic monitoring using pulse contour or thermodilution techniques to allow more accurate titration of therapy. Specific management is directed at the underlying cause. Pending definitive treatment, systemic blood pressure and organ perfusion must be maintained by inotropic/vasopressor therapy.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a description of a physiological finding rather than a diagnosis. Pulmonary arterial pressure is the result of interactions among pulmonary blood flow (right ventricular cardiac output), pulmonary vascular impedance and post-capillary pressure (typically reflecting left atrial pressure). When elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure (systolic/diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure > ?30/19 mmHg at rest) are accompanied by increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial hypertension may be considered secondary to left-heart failure. Introduction of Doppler methods to diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension has increased the awareness of the prevalence and importance of pulmonary arterial hypertension dogs with left-heart failure. Increasing understanding of the mechanism of development of pulmonary venous hypertension and reactive pulmonary arterial hypertension in dogs with left-heart disease has led to the development of successful additive therapies for progressive clinical signs in the setting of chronic therapy for congestive heart failure due to left-sided valvular and myocardial dysfunction. Because effective therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to chronic left-sided cardiac dysfunction are now available, screening for pulmonary arterial hypertension should be a regular part of the Doppler echocardiographic examination in a clinical setting of chronic therapy for left-sided congestive heart failure due to valvular or myocardial disease.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of meloxicam or tolfenamic acid administered preoperatively and postoperatively (five days in total) to cats undergoing surgical fracture repair. Methods: Eighty-eight otherwise healthy cats were matched according to fracture site and then randomly allocated to one of two groups, receiving 0·2 mg/kg meloxicam by subcutaneous injection (group M) or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg tolfenamic acid orally (group T) before anaesthesia. Analgesia was continued with 0.05 mg/kg oral meloxicam once daily or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg oral tolfenamic acid twice daily for four days postoperatively. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using visual analogue scales and a functional limb score. The drug administrator assessed feed intake and palatability of the treatment. Results: Data from 66 cats were analysed. Visual analogue scale pain scores and functional limb scores decreased over time in both groups but were not significantly different between treatments. Feed intake was similar in both groups. Meloxicam was significantly more palatable than tolfenamic acid on all treatment days. Clinical Significance: Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid demonstrated comparable analgesia, without clinically observable side effects. Meloxicam may be associated with superior compliance in clinical practice due to the higher palatability and once daily treatment resulting in better ease of administration.

AB  - Summary: The pattern of severe acute renal failure has changed considerably over the past 2 decades. Severe acute renal failure is now most commonly seen in the intensive care unit and is just one of the manifestations of the multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. the pathogenesis of severe acute renal failure is complex involving decreased renal perfusion, humorally mediated renal vasoconstriction and local migration and activiation of inflammatory cells. the initial final common pathway to renal injury seems to be outer medullary ischaemia. Protection from renal dysfunction in critically ill patients must therefore be directed toward sufficient haemodynamic resucitation to avoid inadequate medullary perfusion. Such perfusion is highly dependent on the maintenance of optimal intravascular filling, adequate cardiac output and, importantly, adequate renal perfusion pressure. In these patients, such renal perfusion pressure can often only be maintained if vasopressor agents are used and titrated to keep the mean arterial pressure at the highest effective and safe level (mean arterial pressure of approximately 80?85 mmHg in most septic patients). If severe acute renal failure develops despite full medical support, renal replacement therapy becomes necesary. There is now a growing worldwide trend toward the use of continuous haemofiltration techniques as the preferred mode of renal replacement therapy. Such techniques provide important practical advantages and, in many cases, are the only form of renal replacement therapy that the patient is able to tolerate. Continous haemofiltration also appears to provide not only outstanding haemodynamic stability but also some membrane adsorption and removal of the humoral mediators of sepsis. This makes continuous haemofiltration a particularly attractive approach to renal support and is responsible for this treatment now being the leading form of acute renal replacement therapy in Australia. After a relatively static period, the area of acute renal failure management is rapidly evolving and offering some promise of a level of support able to match the illness severity associated with it.
