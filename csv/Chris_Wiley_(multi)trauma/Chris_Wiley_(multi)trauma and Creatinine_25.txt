AB  - Abstract We report the clinical and toxicological features of a case of fatal iodine ingestion, and summarize the physiology, clinical characteristics and management of iodine ingestion. Physicians are likely to have little experience in managing such patients, particularly with the advent of less toxic preparations, and therefore need ready access to management guidelines. This case also highlights the potential for substances to retain their toxicity over long periods of time.

AB  - A seven-year-old, neutered male greyhound was presented with a history of episodic shifting hindlimb lameness and pain. Ischaemic necrosis of areas of the hindlimb digits and skin and a firm swelling within the medial right thigh musculature were found on physical examination. Investigation demonstrated thrombosis of the terminal aorta and right external iliac artery with ischaemic necrosis of muscular and dermal tissue distal to the sites of thrombosis. The dog was euthanased due to poor prognosis. Necropsy findings were of a poorly differentiated invasive sarcoma of the skeletal muscle of the proximal right hindlimb, thrombosis of the aorta and right external iliac artery and secondary renal glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemistry of the neoplastic tissue indicated angiosarcoma based on expression of CD31 and factor VIII-related antigen. Thrombosis was considered likely to be due to systemic hypercoagulability because of the presence of altered flow characteristics and endothelial damage in the vascular tumour bed. Aortoiliac thrombosis, paraparesis and hindlimb ischaemia are unusual sequelae of angiosarcoma in the dog.

AB  - With the improved accessibility to ultrasound, fine needle aspiration of abdominal organs is now performed frequently in many veterinary practices. Despite this, there are many ?unknowns? as to the best method to produce a high-quality sample. This report begins by highlighting recent literature on the risks and benefits of abdominal fine needle aspiration. It follows with recommendations about the equipment and method best suited to the procedure, including needle and syringe size and aspiration versus non-aspiration techniques. Various smear preparations and laboratory submission requirements are also discussed. The final aspect of the review more specifically discusses fine needle aspiration of specific abdominal organs: the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, prostate and abdominal lymph nodes.

AB  - Comparison of the University of California (Los Angeles) shoulder scale and the simple shulder test with shoulder pain and disability index: Single-administration reliability and validity. (Texas Woman's University, Houston, TX) Phys Ther. 2000;80:759?768. This study compared 2 shoulder measures?the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale and the Simple Shoulder Test (SST)?with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). One hundred ninety-two patients with shoulder disorders were recruited from one physician's office to complete the self-report sections of the 3 scales. Cronbach alpha values and standard errors of measurements (SEM) were calculated for each of the multi-item subscales. Validity was examined through calculation of correlation coefficients among the 3 scales. Factor analysis was completed to assess the underlying constructs of the SPADI and SST. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. The SEM values for the multi-item scales ranged from 4.75 to 11.65. Evidence for validity to reflect function was indicated by the correlation between the SST and the SPADI disability subscale. The factor analysis of the SPADI revealed loading on 1 factor, whereas the SST loaded on 2 factors. Conclude that all scales demonstrated good internal consistency, suggesting that all items for each scale measure the same constract. However, SEMS for all scales were high. Factor loading was consistent, suggesting that patients may not distinguish between pain and function. Comment by Philip S. Sizer Jr., MED, PT. Clinical practitioners are leaning toward evaluating functional status versus a pure-impairment-based approach to appraising shoulder limitations. Several scales have been developed for the evaluation of shoulder function, including the University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Scale (UCLA), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Investigations demonstrating the psychometric properties of these scales are limited in number. These investigators attempted to assess those properties, including internal consistency, reliability, and validity for all 3 scales. The analyses demonstrated internal consistency and construct homogeneity for the SPADI. However, all 3 scales demonstrated rather large standard errors of measure, which questions the reliability of the scales for measurement of an individual's progress. Regarding construct validity, the SPADI does not appear to distinguish between pain and dysfunction, disqualifying its use as a gold standard for comparison with other scales. While the SST purports to measure a single construct, the data suggests that it appears to measure 2 different constructs namely function and comfort. Additionally, the analyses appear to demonstrate that, while the scales may attempt to measure the same constructs, they apparently do not. Finally, the authors suggest that the precision of the UCLA scale is inferior to the other 2 scales and insufficient for following the progress of individual patients in the clinical setting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common medical emergency and may represent up to 14% of all diabetic admissions with an annual incidence of about 4.6 cases per 1,000 diabetics per year. A spectrum of disease is encountered and mortality rates vary in different series from 1.9% to 15%. The pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on interpretation of biochemistry results and on fluid and electrolyte resuscitation. A flexible approach to fluid resuscitation, careful interpretation of biochemistry results, and close monitoring should be combined with other standard aspects of management such as titratable insulin infusions and early treatment of identifiable precipitants in order to minimise morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Inclusion body myopathy (IBM) is a myopathy causing asymmetric proximal and distal limb muscle involvement in patients over 50 years. Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving upper and lower motor neuron in the spinal cord and brainstem, characterized by progressive muscle weakness resulting in paralysis. The pathogenesis of cell injury in both diseases is still unknown: several hypothesis have been proposed addressing viral, autoimmunity, genetic and oxidation stress factors. We report on 2 cases with clinical presentation of upper and/or lower motor neuron involvement and histopathological diagnosis of IBM. Case 1: a 68 years old man with an 18-month history of progressive weakness, spasticity, dysarthria, dysphagia. Neurological examination showed generalized muscle weakness, wasting of the finger flexors and quadriceps, fasciculations, deep tendon hyperreflexia. Electromyography (EMG) showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at limbs and tongue muscles. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced cMAP amplitude at the legs, Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) revealed marked pyramidal tract involvement. Blood examination showed increased E.S.R. with normal level of serum creatinine kinase, copper, ceruloplasmin, and iron. Antiganglioside antibodies titer was normal and blood lactate analysis showed normal values during exercise. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed increased protein level. Brain magnetic resonance imaging disclosed of involvement of the cortico-spinal tract and deposits of paramagnetic material in the basal ganglia with normal dopaminergic receptorial SPECT binding. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with ?rimmed vacuoles?. Case 2: a 64 years old woman with 20 month history of muscle weakness slowly progressing from upper to lower limbs. Neurological examination showed distal muscle weakness and wasting at the upper limbs, deep tendon hypo-areflexia. EMG showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at four limbs. MEP and nerve conduction studies were normal but H reflex and F late responses were absent. E.S.R. was increased, while antiganglioside antibodies titer, thyroid hormones dosage and CSF examination were normal. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with rare ?rimmed vacuoles?. These case reports, although not nosologically defined, confirm the clinical variability of the IBM and rise questions on the possible mechanisms of neuronal damage in motor neuron syndromes.

AB  - This report details two cases of adverse drug reactions to amlodipine. The first case presented with diffuse peripheral oedema and a history of amlodipine therapy. Haematology, clinical chemistry, endocrine testing, thoracic, abdominal and cardiac imaging revealed no cause for oedema. Amlodipine therapy was discontinued and oedema diminished markedly within 72 hours. The second case presented for bilateral retinal detachments secondary to systemic hypertension. Haematology, clinical chemistry, thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable and amlodipine therapy was begun. Within 72 hours, diffuse peripheral oedema developed that was unresponsive to therapy and the dog was euthanised. Veterinarians should be aware of the potential serious adverse events associated with commonly used drugs; severe, diffuse oedema is a possible adverse drug event in dogs treated with amlodipine.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the safety of an intraoperative fluorescein sodium (FS) injection and elucidate the relationships between the MRI findings, pathological diagnoses, and intraoperative staining characteristics of intracranial lesions in 22 dogs. Study Design Prospective case series. Animals Twenty-two dogs with intracranial lesions. Methods FS was intravenously administered to 22 dogs undergoing craniotomy for suspected intracranial tumors to evaluate perioperative and postoperative adverse effects. The intensities and patterns of gadolinium (Gd) enhancement on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative FS staining were graded, and their relationship was evaluated. Intraoperative FS staining characteristics and pathological diagnoses were compared. Results The only adverse effect noted was repetitive vomiting in 2 dogs. The intensities and patterns between preoperative Gd enhancement and intraoperative FS staining appeared to agree. High-grade glioma and histiocytic sarcoma had more intense FS staining. Lesions with strong Gd enhancement, including meningiomas and choroid plexus tumors, also had intense FS staining. Conclusion The intraoperative use of FS is a simple and safe technique to guide the resection of intracranial lesions in dogs. The findings on Gd enhancement, FS staining, and histopathology appeared to agree but require validation in a larger set of cases. Clinical Significance The intraoperative use of FS may improve the prognosis of dogs with brain tumors by guiding the resection of lesions.

AB  - Objective To conduct a prospective comparison of quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in patients who underwent ileal conduit (IC) urinary diversion with those who underwent orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancers. Patients and Methods Between January 2007 and December 2012, 227 patients underwent radical cystectomy and either IC urinary diversion or ONB (sigmoid or ileal) reconstruction. Contraindications for ON were impaired renal function (serum creatinine >2?mg/dL), chronic inflammatory bowel disease, previous bowel resection and tumour involvement at the bladder neck/prostatic urethra. Patients who did not have these contraindications chose to undergo either IC or ONB reconstruction, after impartial counselling. Baseline characteristics, including demographic profile, body mass index, comorbidities, histopathology of the cystoprostatectomy (with lymph nodes) specimen, pathological tumour stage, postoperative complications, adjuvant therapy and relapse, were recorded and compared. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL questionnaire C30 version 3 was used to analyse QoL before surgery and 6, 12 and 18 months after surgery. Results Of the 227 patients, 28 patients in the IC group and 35 in the ONB group were excluded. The final analysis included 80 patients in the IC and 84 in the ONB group. None of the baseline characteristics were significantly different between the groups, except for age, but none of the baseline QoL variables were found to be correlated with age. In the preoperative phase, there were no significant differences in any of the QoL domains between the IC or the ONB groups. At 6, 12 and 18 months in the postoperative period, physical functioning (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively), role functioning (P = 0.01, P = 0.01 and P = 0.003, respectively), social functioning (P = 0.01, P = 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively) and global health status/QoL (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively) were better in patients in the ONB group than in those in the IC group and the differences were significant. The financial burden related to bladder cancer treatment was significantly lower in the ONB group than in the IC group at 6, 12 and 18 months of follow-up (P = 0.05, P = 0.05 and P = 0.005, respectively) Conclusions ONB is better than IC in terms of physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, global health status/QoL and financial expenditure. ONB reconstruction provides better QoL outcomes than does IC urinary diversion.

AB  - Abstract Colchicine overdose is uncommon but frequently fatal. In this article we present two cases which exhibit the wide spectrum of colchicine toxicity and review the drug's pharmacology and organ system effects. Finally we provide a treatment algorithm and propose new directions for management. Colchicine binds to intracellular tubulin and prevents its polymerisation to form microtubules. As microtubules subserve a wide variety of roles in basic cellular function including protein assembly, mitosis, endocytosis, exocytosis, cell shape and motility, colchicine is profoundly toxic to all cell lines of the body. Previous studies have offered little to aid the clinician in the management of such patients. We present a series of treatment guidelines based on the current literature. Specifically, we propose that patients who do not develop gastrointestinal symptoms within eight hours of a small, isolated colchicine ingestion can be medically cleared. Additionally, the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms should be seen as an indicator of possible significant systemic toxicity requiring early resuscitation and intensive monitoring. The newer modalities of treatment including the use of colchicine-specific Fab fragments and Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor are also addressed.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare yet potentially fatal thrombotic microangiopathy. Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity via autoantibody formation has been associated with idiopathic TTP; however, specific triggers are poorly defined. Previous studies have reported seasonal associations of TTP, with warm-weather seasons appearing to have the strongest predilection. We characterized the seasonal distribution of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP at our multi-hospital institution. Methods: Apheresis records from 2005?2012 were queried for patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP, accompanying pre-plasmapheresis ADAMTS13 activity <10%, and no other explanations for thrombotic microangiopathy. Date of admission and ADAMTS13 activity were collected. Both initial episodes and relapses in patients whose initial episodes occurred since 2005 were included in the analysis. Goodness-of-fit chi-square analysis was performed and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results: Of 237 consecutive new patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of TTP, 73 patients met inclusion criteria and had a total of 110 unique presentations for either initial TTP episodes or TTP relapses. Sixteen patients had 37 relapses of their idiopathic TTP (range 1?7). No statistically significant seasonal or monthly associations were identified with either initial or any TTP episodes. Conclusion: A seasonal association of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP was not observed. Unknown variables may explain previous observations of seasonal associations of idiopathic TTP in other regions of the United States. Thus, individual institutions should characterize their own seasonal distributions of idiopathic TTP as part of the exploration of possible disease triggers in their respective areas. J. Clin.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted to heart transplant recipients by donor organs. Mid-term results were reported using HCV-positive donors in patients at risk of imminent death (group I, n?=?10), or in patients who otherwise would not have been offered heart transplantation (group II, n?=?10) because of age (9/10) or associated medical risk (1/10). Medical records pertaining to patients receiving HCV-positive allografts between July 1994 and December 1999 were reviewed. The recipients consisted of 19 males and one female, with a median age of 54?years for group I and 66 for group II. The HCV RNA level, seroconversion of anti-HCV antibody, biochemical liver dysfunction, and causes of death were examined. Older recipients received reduced immunosuppression. Two patients in group II were HCV positive and were also retransplants. The hospital mortality rate was 10% in group I and 20% in group II; both hepatitis C-positive recipients died postoperatively prior to discharge. All predischarge deaths were related to multi-system organ failure (MSOF). All 17 survivors were HCV negative prior to transplant. Of these, 4/17 seroconverted. HCV RNA was detected in two of them. At a median follow-up of 26.4?months, 2/11 current survivors continue to test anti-HCV positive and are RNA negative. Three-year actual survival was 40% for group I and 70% in group II. Transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD) accounted for one postoperative death in group I. Current data show that four out of 11 survivors had developed TCAD at 3-year follow-up, yielding an actual freedom from TCAD rate of 12/17 (70%) at 3-year follow-up. Hepatitis C transmission using a donor heart as the reservoir is moderate (25%). Limited use of such donors is justified in selected patients. The risk for hepatic disease may be reduced by tailoring immunosuppression specifically for such recipients, particularly if they are at low risk of rejection. Further studies are necessary to define a possible association between HCV and TCAD.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The demands in the Standardbred trotters industry require young, still growing horses, to be trained well above light exercise level. During that period, the risk of occurrence of energy imbalance and maladaptation to training is high. In man, the lack of energy homeostasis is considered as the basic problem in the development of chronic fatigue. Objective: To find objective biomarkers of early maladaptation to training in young racehorses under field conditions. Materials and methods: Sixty-five 2-year-old Standardbreds were followed during their first 3 months of training in 5 different training centres. Monthly measurement of morphological variables (weight, height at withers, body condition score, body composition), basic haemato-biochemical variables and endocrine levels (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones, leptin, IGF1, prolactin) were undertaken. Feeding levels and training programmes were also evaluated. At the end of the 3 month period, on the basis of an abnormal weight loss, 14 young horses were suspected of maladaptation to training (MT group). Morphological, haemato-biochemical, endocrine changes were compared between MT group (n = 14) and control group (C group, n = 40). Analysis of variance was calculated to study the effects of time and maladaptation to training. Results: Compared to C group, MT group showed a significant higher weight loss in relation to a higher loss of fat mass and body condition score (P<0.05). MT group presented higher GGT and white cell counts and lower red cell counts (P<0.05). Finally, MT group showed significant lower levels of T4 (P = 0.03) than C group. Conclusion: Some young horses presented signs of energy imbalance which were also associated with haematobiochemical and endocrine changes. Those markers might be useful for identification of maladaptation to training.

AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

AB  - Summary Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding usually presents with haematemesis or melaena, but should be considered in any patient with unexplained hypotension or syncope, or decompensated chronic liver disease. In patients with severe upper GI bleeding, a good outcome requires vigorous resuscitation, and close collaboration with medical, endoscopic, radiological and surgical teams: it is important to involve these specialists as early as possible to discuss the management plan. Urgent endoscopy is needed for patients with shock on admission, with known varices or signs of chronic liver disease, or evidence of continued bleeding. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be stopped/reversed, if the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks: for patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve, recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary stents, discuss this with a cardiologist. Patients with low-risk peptic ulcer bleeding based on clinical and endoscopic criteria (e.g. clean ulcer base) can be discharged on the same day as endoscopy.
