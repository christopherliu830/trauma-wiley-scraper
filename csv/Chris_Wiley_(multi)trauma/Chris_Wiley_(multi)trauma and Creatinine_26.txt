AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare yet potentially fatal thrombotic microangiopathy. Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity via autoantibody formation has been associated with idiopathic TTP; however, specific triggers are poorly defined. Previous studies have reported seasonal associations of TTP, with warm-weather seasons appearing to have the strongest predilection. We characterized the seasonal distribution of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP at our multi-hospital institution. Methods: Apheresis records from 2005?2012 were queried for patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP, accompanying pre-plasmapheresis ADAMTS13 activity <10%, and no other explanations for thrombotic microangiopathy. Date of admission and ADAMTS13 activity were collected. Both initial episodes and relapses in patients whose initial episodes occurred since 2005 were included in the analysis. Goodness-of-fit chi-square analysis was performed and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results: Of 237 consecutive new patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of TTP, 73 patients met inclusion criteria and had a total of 110 unique presentations for either initial TTP episodes or TTP relapses. Sixteen patients had 37 relapses of their idiopathic TTP (range 1?7). No statistically significant seasonal or monthly associations were identified with either initial or any TTP episodes. Conclusion: A seasonal association of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP was not observed. Unknown variables may explain previous observations of seasonal associations of idiopathic TTP in other regions of the United States. Thus, individual institutions should characterize their own seasonal distributions of idiopathic TTP as part of the exploration of possible disease triggers in their respective areas. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract Wegener?s Granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis that in its most severe form can cause respiratory failure, renal failure and subglottic stenosis requiring surgical airway access. We describe the use of portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and the long distance road transport of a patient with Wegener?s Granulomatosis who developed respiratory failure that was refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation. We have demonstrated the effective use of portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for stabilization and safe acute interhospital transfer over a long distance by road ambulance to a tertiary centre for further management.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

Methods A retrospective review of patients presenting to the ED with sepsis from January to December 2012 was conducted at Flinders Medical Centre, South Australia. Outcome measures were: time elapsed from triage to administration of initial antibiotic therapy and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 220 patients presented with sepsis, comprising 102 cases of uncomplicated sepsis and 118 severe sepsis. The median time to antibiotic administration was 3.5?h (interquartile range [IQR] 1.7?6.6) and in-hospital mortality was 28.6% (95% CI 22.6?34.6%). There was no association observed between delays to antibiotics and mortality in the total patient population. When stratified by presenting severity, patients with severe sepsis demonstrated a trend towards increased mortality when delays to antibiotics exceeded 6 h from triage (HR = 2.25, 95% CI 0.91?5.59, P = 0.08) in comparison with <1?h. Significant delays to antibiotic administration occurred when initial agents were charted as a ?regular medicine? (9.4?h, IQR 5.1?16.6) in comparison with a ?once only order? (3.4?h, IQR 1.7?6.7), P < 0.001. Conclusions Early administration of antibiotics specifically in patients with severe sepsis might be beneficial. Further studies within the ED are warranted to establish the effect of delayed antibiotics in a generalised sepsis cohort.

AB  - Abstract Management of early paracetamol poisoning is dependent on prompt administration of N-acetylcysteine to patients whose plasma concentrations of paracetamol exceed the normal-risk or high-risk treatment lines. Paracetamol poisoning presenting after 15 h since ingestion, especially as fulminant hepatic failure, requires meticulous supportive care of organ dysfunction. The putative mechanisms of action of N-acetylcysteine and its practical use are discussed. The best prognostic marker for paracetamol poisoning in ?established hepatotoxicity? is the prothrombin time. Indications for liver transplantation in paracetamol poisoning and exclusion criteria are also discussed.

AB  - Summary Background Primary hyperparathyroidism is uncommon in equids. Objectives To describe the diagnostic findings and efficacy of treatment in equids with primary hyperparathyroidism. Study design Retrospective case series describing 16 horses and one mule. Methods Cases were identified by retrospective review of records at Cornell University and via an ACVIM listserv query. Inclusion criteria were an equid with hypercalcemia, normal renal function and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) or histopathological diagnosis of a parathyroid adenoma. Equids with normal PTH and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) in the face of hypercalcemia were included as suspect cases. Results The most common presenting complaints were weight loss (12/17) and hypercalcemia (10/17). PTH was above reference range in 12/17 cases. Suspected parathyroid tumours were localised in 12/14 equids imaged using ultrasonography alone (2/3), technetium 99m Tc sestamibi scintigraphy alone (1/1) or both modalities (9/10). Three horses did not have imaging performed. Surgical exploration successfully excised tumours in six of 10 cases. Five were located at the thoracic inlet, and surgery resulted in complete cure. One tumour was excised from the thyroid lobe, and the horse remained hypercalcemic. Four other cases explored surgically, four treated medically and three that were not treated also remained hypercalcemic. Main limitations The small study size prohibited statistical analysis. Conclusions Parathyroid adenomas in equids can be successfully localised with ultrasonography and scintigraphy. Surgical excision appears more likely to be successful for single gland disease at the thoracic inlet.

Haematological abnormalities included an inflammatory leukogram and regenerative anaemia. Blood cultures remained sterile; clinical chemistry values were unremarkable. The puppy had recurrent seizures and was euthanased when 18 weeks old. Post mortem examination revealed a multisystemic inflammatory disease involving thyroids, lymph nodes, spleen, pancreas, bladder and lung, but no lesions to account for the neurological signs. The cause of this generalised disease was not recognised. The histological features are unusual and resemble those described in other dogs of this breed.

AB  - An in vitro study of dural lesions produced by 25-gauge Quincke and Whitacre needles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. (Hospital de Mostoles, Madrid Spain) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:393?402. This study evaluated the dural lesions produced by Whitacre and Quincke spinal needles in the external and internal surface of the dura mater of the lower spine area in an attempt to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of postdural puncture headaches (PDPH). The T11-L4 dural membranes from 5 fresh (immediately after extraction of organs for transplantation) male patients declared brain dead, ages 23, 46, 48, 55, and 60, were excised by anterior laminectomy. Morphologic orientation of the membrane and normal pH were maintained; 100 punctures at 90-degree angles were done with a new needle each time, 50 with 25-gauge Whitacre and 50 with 25-gauge Quincke needles. Half of the punctures with the Quincke needles were done with the bevel in the parallel direction to the axis of the spinal cord, and the rest with the bevel perpendicular to it. Fixation in solutions of 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer, followed by dehydration with acetone, was done 15 min after the punctures. The acetone was removed and the specimens were metallized with carbon followed by gold and inspected under a scanning electron microscope. When the area of the dural lesions found in the external and internal surfaces produced by the 2 types of needles was compared, no significant differences were found. The percentage of lesion closing area with the Quincke needles was 88.3% and 82.7% in the external and internal surfaces, respectively. With the Whitacre needles, the percentage of closing was 86.8% and 84.8% in the epidural and arachnoid surfaces, respectively. There were differences noted in the morphology of the lesions. The Whitacre needles produced coarse lesions with significant destruction in the dura's fibers while the Quincke needles produced a ?U?-shaped lesion (flap) that mimics the opened lid of a tin can, regardless of the tip's direction. Conclude that the needles produced lesions in the dura with different morphology and characteristics. Lesions with the Quincke needles resulted in a clean-cut opening in the dural membrane while the Whitacre needle produced a more traumatic opening with tearing and severe disruption of the collagen fibers. The lower incidence of PDPH seen in the Whitacre needles may be explained, in part, by the inflammatory reaction produced by the tearing of the collagen fibers after dural penetration. The inflammatory reaction may result in a significant edema, which may act as a plug limiting the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article that explains why a patient will develop a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after receiving a spinal with a Quincke needle and not after a Whitacre-type needle. The explanation is based more upon an inflammatory reaction than the direction of the needle cut. The Quincke needle appears to make a sharp cut while the Whitacre needle induced an inflammatory response including edema, which could block off the dura from leaking. It is very interesting that the response seen after the Whitacre needle was utilized occurred as quickly as it did. The article introduces the question as to whether a Quincke needle or a Whitacre needle is associated with more trauma to the dura, and which is better for decreasing the incidence of PDPD.

AB  - Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) Int J Dermatol 2000;39:481?486. This review aimed to familiarize the dermatologist with the essential features of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It highlights areas that are most likely to be of interest to the dermatologist. Information regarding diagnosis, pathogenesis theories, and treatment are included. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This paper analyses RSD from the point of view of a specialist in dermatology. It addresses in depth the definition of RSD (or the new name, CRPS type I), the symptoms required for adequate diagnosis, some theories to explain this syndrome, and some of the treatments available. It highlights the clinical pictures, which can cause RSD (trauma, ischemia, tumors, infection, neurological and iatrogenic causes), and particularly dermatological syndromes (minor surgery, postherpetic neuralgia, Dupuytren, vasculitis ?). The treatment has a bipolar objective: to relieve pain in order to be able to apply appropriate physical therapy, which will allow recovery of the involved limb. There are more than 60 treatments reported in the literature, suggesting that there is no universal protocol. However, prevention of RSD, and particularly the early onset of treatment are essential for achieving functional and pain relief. To suppress sympathetic hyperactivity, nerve blocks (somatic and sympathetic), intravenous regional blockade with guanethidine or reserpine, alpha blockers (phentolamine), beta blockers (propranolol), and calcitonine can be used. No reference is made to anticonvulsants (gabapentine, topiramate), antidepressants (ie, amitriptyline), intravenous lidocaine, or spinal cord stimulation.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe surgical techniques, caval occlusion times, and short-term outcomes in dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy. Study design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy between October 1, 2010 and May 31, 2018. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy were reviewed for signalment, perioperative management, surgical details, perioperative complications, mortality, and histopathology. Computed tomography images were reviewed to describe tumor morphology and signs of thrombus extension. Results Nineteen dogs had adrenal tumor thrombi extending into the prehepatic (14 dogs, 74%), hepatic (3 dogs, 16%), and posthepatic (2 dogs, 11%) caudal vena cava. Tumors occurred in left (11) and right (8) adrenal glands. Median caval occlusion was 6.5 minutes (range, 2?25). Two to six vascular tourniquets were used. Venotomy closure was performed under full caval occlusion in 11 dogs and by using a partial occlusion clamp in 8 dogs. Left ureteronephrectomy was performed in 5 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 21% (4 dogs). Conclusion Extension of caval tumor thrombus beyond the hepatic hilus did not preclude a good outcome. Longer caval occlusion than has been previously reported was tolerated in some cases. Number of vascular tourniquets used reflected the location of phrenicoabdominal vein insertion on the cava and length of the caval tumor thrombus. Venotomy closure under full occlusion was often required for right adrenal tumors. When required, ureteronephrectomy was left sided. Clinical significance Dogs with adrenal tumors extending beyond the hepatic hilus and those requiring a long caval occlusion time can survive adrenalectomy.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the prevalence and perinatal management of cases of arthrogryposis delivering at our hospital over a 6-year period. Methods This was a retrospective review of cases of arthrogryposis managed at a UK teaching hospital. Cases were identified from the regional congenital anomalies register and departmental databases. Case notes were reviewed and analysed. Results From 2002 to 2007, there were 27 cases of arthrogryposis. Sixteen (59.3%) were Caucasians, 7(25.9%) Asians and 4(14.8%) Afro-Caribbean; 17(63%) were nulliparous. In eight (29.6%) cases, there was a family history of congenital anomalies. Three had previously affected siblings and in three cases the parents were affected with arthrogryposis. Five (18.5%) were from consanguineous families. Eighteen (66.7%) cases were diagnosed prenatally at a mean gestational age of 21 weeks. Twelve (57%) were delivered by caesarean section. There were 18 live births. Sixteen (59%) cases were reviewed by clinical geneticist. Following detailed review and investigation including post-mortems, 20 (74%) of our cases had a formal diagnosis or likely cause identified. Conclusions Suspected cases of arthrogryposis require multi-disciplinary management to optimise the possibility of making a diagnosis and providing parents with accurate information to enable them to make informed choices regarding the pregnancy and providing information regarding likelihood of recurrence.

AB  - Summary A 2-day-old filly foal presented with signs of depression, recumbency and inappetence. Blood analyses revealed hypoalbuminaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperkalaemia. The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Abstract Our objective in this study was to identify the factors contributing to mortality in acute suppurative cholangitis which could be tested easily in every emergency clinic. This is a retrospective study enrolling 104 patients with acute suppurative cholangitis. Demographic and laboratory data were collected for analysis. In univariant analysis red cell distribution width, total bilirubin level, intensive care unit admission was identified as statistically significant (p?<?0.05) to predict mortality. Three variables were statistically significant in multivariate analysis: total bilirubin level equal to or more than 6.9?mg/dl, red cell distribution width equal to or more than 14.45%, and admission to intensive care unit. We found a new scoring system for prediction of mortality in acute suppurative cholangitis utilizing only three variables. This would serve as a simplified, rapid way to direct patients for advanced interventions instead of wasting time with more complicated and time consuming multi-variable scoring systems.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012; 42 (3): 290?302 Abstract Background and aims? Studies suggest clinical benefits of parenteral fish oil (FO), rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), over soyabean oil (SO), rich in n-6 PUFAs, in patients with pro-inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Because the mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear, the present study explored the effects of intravenous infusion of FO and SO on fatty acid incorporation, immune functions and (anti)oxidant balance in healthy human volunteers. Methods? Saline, a SO emulsion and a FO emulsion were administered for one hour on three consecutive days at a rate of 0·2?g/kg?BW/h to eight subjects in a randomized cross-over design with a 3-week interval between treatments. Plasma phospholipid and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fatty acid compositions, and leucocyte counts and functions were assessed prior to the first infusion (T?=?0, baseline) and 1?day (T?=?4, early effects) and 8?days (T?=?11, late effects) after the third infusion. Results? Fish oil infusion significantly increased n-3 PUFA proportions and decreased n-6 PUFA proportions in plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. There were no differences in immune functions or (anti)oxidant balance between treatments at any time. Conclusions? The present lipid infusion protocol appears to be safe and well tolerated and provides significant incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. In the absence of overt inflammation, no direct effects of FO were observed on immune function or (anti)oxidant balance. This model may be useful to evaluate effects of parenteral lipids in other settings, for example in individuals displaying an inflammatory state.

AB  - Summary An adult Quarter Horse gelding (Case 1) was evaluated for tachypnoea and acute dysphagia. A 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding (Case 2) was evaluated for respiratory stertor and severe, acute swelling of the head in the submandibular region. A physical examination, complete blood count, blood chemistry, upper airway endoscopy, and peripheral blood Anaplasma phagocytophilum polymerase chain reaction were completed for both horses. Both horses tested positive for A. phagocytophilum. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 1 revealed a feed contaminated pharynx, absent swallowing reflex, and left laryngeal hemiplagia. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 2 revealed severe diffuse pharyngeal swelling occluding the airway. Due to increased respiratory effort in Case 2, a tracheotomy was performed. In both horses, treatment consisted of intravenous oxytetracycline 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 2?3 days followed by minocycline 4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h for 10?14 days. Both horses made full recoveries.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, we review the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of eating disorders. In synthesizing this material, we note that the eating disorders truly underscore the relevance of a biopsychosocial perspective in the evaluation and treatment of psychiatric disorders. The epidemiology of the main eating disorders, anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), is considered in terms of prevalence, age of onset, gender, race, socioeconomic profile, etc. Etiology appears to be multi-determined and probably results from the complex intersection of a variety of biological, psychological, and social variables, which vary from case to case. The diagnoses of AN and BM are examined in detail, assessment tools enumerated, and the medical complications summarized. The treatment of AN and BN are dealt with in turn. With AN, the importance of engagement with the patient and determination of the appropriate treatment environment are underscored, and strategies for behavior modification outlined, with the initial focus being weight restoration. The roles of psychotherapy and psychotropic medications are described. For BN, the normalization of eating patterns and the interruption of the binge/purge cycle are the initial treatment goals. Treatment options include behavioral strategies, psychotherapy, and psychotropic medication. The difficulties in assessing outcome in these patients are discussed, and the potential impact on fertility and pregnancy. Finally, binge eating disorder is briefly reviewed.

AB  - McCune?Albright syndrome (MAS) is a rare disease resulting from a somatic, mosaic mutation of GNAS1 encoding the Gsα subunit of the G-protein coupled membrane receptor responsible for multiple hormonal signaling cascades. We present a patient with neonatal MAS who initially presented with neonatal diabetes and concern for congenital cardiac disease, and subsequently was found to have significant ACTH-independent neonatal Cushing syndrome. Her course included multi-system organ involvement, although she initially did not have obvious findings consistent with the MAS classic triad of café-au-lait macules, fibrous dysplasia, or peripheral precocious puberty. After medical and surgical treatment, she remains the only reported survivor of neonatal MAS. This clinical report alerts clinicians to the possibility of this disease in neonates with non-classical endocrine and non-endocrine manifestations of MAS, and demonstrates that this very early presentation is potentially survivable. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
