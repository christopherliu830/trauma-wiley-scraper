AB  - Objectives To investigate possible interactions visible on electroencephalogram recordings caused by concomitant administration of marbofloxacin and carprofen or cimicoxib in dogs without central nervous system disease. Methods Totally 21 client-owned dogs undergoing different surgeries were included in a randomised, blinded, clinical study. Each dog was assigned to one of two groups treated with either carprofen or cimicoxib pre- and postoperatively. After anaesthetic induction both groups received marbofloxacin intravenously while recording an electroencephalogram. Offline electroencephalogram analysis included qualitative evaluation and Fast Fourier Transformation. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated for 24 hours and after 10 days with the short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann?Whitney U test and Student's t-test with α set at 5%. Results Marbofloxacin injection caused no effects on quantitative and qualitative electroencephalogram parameters in both groups. No differences in postoperative pain scoring were found between treatment groups. Clinical Significance Concurrent use of marbofloxacin with either cimicoxib or carprofen did not induce neuroexcitatory activities in dogs without CNS disease directly after administration.

AB  - An eight-year-old, neutered male Burmese cat presented with five days vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine whether alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in near-lethal hyperkalemia either lowers potassium (K) rapidly or shortens duration of cardiac conduction disturbances. Methods: A controlled canine laboratory investigation of 3 treatments for severe hyperkalemia. Conditioned dogs (n = 8; 17?30 kg) received, in random order, 2 mmol/kg of each of 3 treatments (matched in sodium and water) in separate experiments ≥1 week apart: 1.05% NaHCO3 over 60 minutes (infusion therapy); 8.4% NaHCO3 over 5 minutes, then 14 mL/kg sterile water over 55 minutes (bolus therapy); 8.4% NaCl over 5 minutes, then 14 mL/kg sterile water over 55 minutes (saline therapy). Prior to administering one of the above therapies, the animals were anesthetized with 0.5?2.5% isoflurane and ventilated to maintain a normal Pco2. After 30 minutes of equilibration, 2 mmol/kg/hr (loading dose) of a 2-mmol/mL KCl solution was given until idioventricular or relative junctional bradycardic dysrhythmias were sustained for 15 minutes. Then KCl was decreased to 1 mmol/kg/hr (maintenance dose) for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Treatment was begun after 45 minutes of maintenance KCl infusion. Results: The pretreatment K level (all studies) was 9.06 ± 0.82 mmol/L (mean ± SD). Although the mean K level decreased more after saline therapy than after bolus therapy at every time, differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically important during the first 30 minutes. The means of the differences in decreases (saline minus bolus) were small, 0.26 (95% CI, -0.48 to 1.00) at 15 minutes, 0.16 (95% CI, -0.67 to 0.98) at 30 minutes. Dysrhythmia duration was shorter with bolus therapy than for saline therapy in only 1 of 5 dogs (p = 0.38). Conclusions: Hypertonic saline bolus lowered plasma K as effectively as NaHCO3 bolus in this animal model within the first 30 minutes. Clinically meaningful decreases due to alkalinization alone within 30 minutes are unlikely.

AB  - This case report describes congestive heart failure with pleural effusion in two middle-aged, pet house rabbits. Both had a history of acute onset dyspnoea, weakness and weight loss. Bi-atrial enlargement was seen on echocardiography in both rabbits. One rabbit had atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature complexes identified on electrocardiography. There was a radiographically evident pleural effusion in both rabbits and thoracocentesis was undertaken in one rabbit. These findings were confirmed on post-mortem examination. The aetiology for the underlying heart disease was not found, but the potential types of cardiomyopathies are discussed.

AB  - Summary Objective Recent studies have shown that an elevated 1-h postload plasma glucose (1hPG) is able to identify subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at high risk for future type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, clinical studies about the characteristics of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with elevated 1hPG are lacking. The aim of this study was to analyse the 1hPG level in CHD patients with NGT. Methods A total of 204 CHD patients with NGT were recruited. Subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, echocardiography and coronary angiography. Demographic data were recorded and blood samples obtained. According to the 1hPG cut-off point of 8·6 mm, patients were divided into two groups: 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm (n = 65) and 1hPG < 8·6 mm (n = 139). Results Compared with the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, subjects with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm had a worse metabolic profile, exhibiting significantly higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride level and lower HDL-cholesterol level. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels were higher in the 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm group than in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group. Coronary angiography revealed that single-vessel changes were more frequent in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, but there were no significant differences in the Gensini score. Conclusions Patients with CHD with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm have a worse metabolic profile, higher levels of hsCRP and multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that, in patients with CHD, elevated 1hPG increases coronary risk factors and may be a marker for early-stage glucose intolerance.

AB  - Histological assessment of baseline chronic kidney injury may discriminate kidneys that are suitable for transplantation, but has not been validated for appraisal of donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidneys. ?Time-zero' biopsies for 371 consecutive, solitary, deceased-donor kidneys transplanted at our center between 2006 and 2010 (65.5% DCD, 34.5% donation after brain death [DBD]) were reviewed and baseline chronic degenerative injury scored using Remuzzi's classification. High scores correlated with donor age and extended criteria donors (42% of donors), but the spectrum of scores was similar for DCD and DBD kidneys. Transplant outcomes for kidneys scoring from 0 to 4 were comparable (1 and 3 year graft survival 95% and 92%), but were much poorer for kidneys scoring ≥5, with 1 year graft survival only 73%, and 12.5% suffering primary nonfunction. Critically, high Remuzzi scores conferred the same survival disadvantage for DCD and DBD kidneys. On multi-variable regression analysis, time-zero biopsy score was the only independent predictor for graft survival, whereas one-year graft estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) correlated with donor age and biopsy score. In conclusion, the relationship between severity of chronic kidney injury and transplant outcome is similar for DCD and DBD kidneys. Kidneys with Remuzzi scores of ≤4 can be implanted singly with acceptable results.

AB  - Summary Ureteral stent placement for the management of malignant ureteral obstructions has been a mainstay of palliative treatment for humans with non-resectable tumors to preserve renal function. Ureteral stents have also been placed preoperatively for patient stabilization prior to surgical intervention. Urothelial neoplasia in dogs is often complicated by local tumor invasion and obstruction of the urethra, ureters, or both. Nephrostomy tube placement or hemodialysis can provide temporary relief, but radical surgeries have traditionally been the only viable alternative for long-term management in veterinary patients. This chapter describes the placement of a double pigtail ureteral stent as a minimally invasive, long-term treatment option for malignant obstructive neoplasia in dogs and cats. The author has also used this technique in a small number of feline patients with malignant obstructions, though the subcutaneous ureteral bypass (SUB) device is generally preferred in cats.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare an estimate of blood loss obtained using measurements from the Hemocue photometer with a standard estimate in dogs undergoing spinal surgery. Study design? Prospective clinical study. Animals? Twenty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods? During surgery, blood and all lavage fluids were collected in the suction container and on to swabs. To prevent blood clot formation in the suction container, 10?mL citrate-phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) was added. At the end of the procedure, the total volume in the suction container was recorded. It was shaken to ensure uniformity and a 5 mL sample tested with the HemoCue photometer. Blood loss in the suction container was calculated as follows: Blood in suction (mL)?=?volume in bottle (mL)???[suction haemoglobin (Hb) concentration (g?dL?1)/pre-operative Hb concentration (g dL?1)]. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs (weight of soaked swabs minus that of dry swabs) to provide the Hemocue estimate of total blood loss. A standard haemorrhage estimate was performed using the volume of fluid in the suction container at the end of surgery in excess of the total volume of lavage fluid available, minus 10?mL CPDA. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs to provide the standard estimate of total blood loss. Data were analyzed with a paired t-test. Retrospective power calculations demonstrated an 80% power to detect a mean difference of 25?mL between the two methods with a level of significance of 0.05. Results? There was no significant difference in calculated blood loss between the two methods (p?=?0.8, mean difference: ?2?mL, 95% CI: ?20 to 16?mL). Conclusions and clinical relevance? The HemoCue may be used to help estimate blood loss in dogs undergoing spinal surgery.

AB  - Abstract:  Objectives:? The aim of this study was to analyze short- and long-term results of liver transplantation (LT) in patients over 65?yr. Material and methods:? Between 1996 and 2004, 386 patients underwent 415 LT at our center. The main indication for LT was post-necrotic cirrhosis in 59%, followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over cirrhosis in 33%. Half of the patients (53%) were hepatitis C virus (HCV) +. Overall, 72 patients were >65?yr of age. Actuarial survival, causes of mortality and postoperative complications were compared between groups: patients under and over 65?yr. Risk factors for poor outcome in patients over 65?yr were also analyzed. Results:? The older group had more patients at Child A stage, more HCC as an indication for LT and more HCV (+) patients, p?<?0.05. No differences were observed in donor and surgery characteristics, except for lower multi-transfusion and higher incidence of grafts with steatosis in the older group (p?<?0.05). Actuarial survival at one, three, five and 10 yr was 82%, 75%, 72%, and 70% for the <65?yr group vs. 77%, 66%, 55%, and 55% for the >65?yr group (p?=?0.03). Main causes of mortality in patients >65?yr were recurrence of underlying disease and medical causes. In the older age group, fewer infections (p?=?ns) and rejections (p?=?0.017) occurred in the postoperative period. Risk factor for poor outcome in the group of patients over 65?yr in multivariate analyses was pre-LT renal insufficiency (odds ratio 3.5, p?=?0.002, 95% confidence interval 1.58?7.82). Conclusion:? Results in patients >65?yr are comparable to those <65?yr if older LT candidates are carefully selected. Overimmunosuppression should be avoided in older candidates, as its effects could worsen the pre-existing diseases common in elderly patients.

AB  - Abstract Although the medical profession is slowly realizing that many disorders in the aged must be treated differently than in the young, there is still no proper appreciation of these age differences. Too often, when a patient reaches life-expectancy age, the physician relaxes his medical attention. It is assumed that the patient will die soon, although the actuarial statistics may show that he has many more years of life. Accordingly, therapy should be more intensive in order to attain the maximal life span. Elderly people will tolerate many major operations (e.g., herniorrhaphy or thyroidectomy) as well as young people. However, when it comes to serious major operations (e.g., radical neck dissection or radical excision of the rectum for carcinoma), the mortality rate for the aged may be four to eight times higher than for young patients. Elderly patients tolerate emergency major operations and complications very poorly. The chronologic age is not the chief factor in the mortality rate; more important are the operative complications. Therefore, preoperatively, every effort should be made to identify and treat diseases that might cause complications postoperatively. After operation a close watch must be kept for complications so that they may be treated promptly and effectively. Operative technic must be meticulous, with no excessive trauma and with particular attention to hemostasis and wound closure. The operation should be completed in the shortest possible time consistent with safety. A summary of 6 reports in the medical literature shows an operative mortality rate for major operations of 2.6 per cent in patients under 60, compared to 7.2 per cent for patients over 60. The mortality rate for emergency operations is much higher than for elective operations?18.5 per cent versus 6.5 per cent, respectively. A summary of 4 reports shows that cardiac complications were the greatest single cause of postoperative mortality (21.6 per cent), with pneumonia and atelectasis a close second. Despite precautions such as bandaging the extremities and early ambulation, pulmonary embolism accounted for 9.4 per cent of the deaths. [Though inoperable carcinoma caused more deaths (22.2 per cent of the entire group) than any of the other diseases, it is classified as a multiple cause.] Since the mortality rate for major operations in both aged and young patients is still significant, there is great need for more accuracy in determining operability.

AB  - Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) solution is increasingly used to flush and preserve organ donor kidneys, with efficacy claimed equivalent to University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. We observed and reported increased graft pancreatitis in pancreata flushed with HTK solution, which prompted this review of transplanting HTK-flushed kidneys. We analyzed outcomes of deceased-donor kidneys flushed with HTK and UW solutions with a minimum of 12 months follow-up, excluding pediatric and multi-organ recipients. We evaluated patient and graft survival and rejection rates, variables that might constitute hazards to graft survival and renal function. Two-year patient survival, rejection, renal function and graft survival were not different, but early graft loss (<6 months) was worse in HTK-flushed kidneys (p < 0.03). A Cox analysis of donor grade, cold ischemic time, panel reactive antibodies (PRA), donor race, first vs. repeat transplant, rejection and flush solution showed that only HTK use predicted early graft loss (p < 0.04; relative risk = 3.24), almost exclusively attributable to primary non-function (HTK, n = 5 (6.30%); UW, n = 1 (0.65%); p = 0.02). Delayed graft function and early graft loss with HTK occurred only in lesser grade kidneys, suggesting it should be used with caution in marginal donors.

Methods Determination of urine protein:creatinine ratio in 32 dogs with lymphoma compared with 30 healthy dogs. Results Canine patients with lymphoma are more likely to be proteinuric compared with healthy dogs. Proteinuria is common in dogs with lymphoma, although in most cases it is not severe. The presence of proteinuria is not linked with the stage or substage of lymphoma. Clinical Significance Mild proteinuria is a common finding in dogs with lymphoma. The clinical impact of the proteinuria is probably low.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare the anaesthetic, analgesic and cardiorespiratory effects of intramuscular (IM) medetomidine and ketamine administered alone or combined with morphine or tramadol, for orchiectomy in cats. Study design Randomised, blinded, prospective clinical study. Animals Thirty client-owned cats. Materials and methods Cats (n = 10 in each group) received a combination of medetomidine (60 ?gkg?1) and ketamine (10 mg kg?1) alone (MedK); combined with morphine (0.2 mg kg?1) (MedKM), or combined with tramadol (2 mg kg?1) (MedKT) IM. Time of induction, surgical and recovery events were recorded, and physiological parameters measured and recorded. Analgesia was evaluated with a visual analogue scale, a composite scoring system and the von Frey mechanical threshold device, every hour from three to eight hours post-drug administration injection. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed model, Kruskal?Wallis or Chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Results Median (IQR) induction and recovery times (minutes) were not significantly (p = 0.125) different between groups: 5.6 (2.7?8.0), 7.4 (5.1?9.6) and 8.0 (5.8?14.9) for induction and 128.5 (95.1?142.8), 166.4 (123.1?210.0) and 142.9 (123.4?180.2) for recovery, with MedK, MedKT and MedKM, respectively. Two cats (MedKM) required alfaxalone for endotracheal intubation. In all groups, three or four cats required additional isoflurane for surgery. Arterial oxygen tension overall (mean ± SD: 66 ± 2 mmHg) was low. Surgery resulted in increased systolic arterial blood pressure (p < 0.001), haemoglobin saturation (p < 0.001), respiratory (p = 0.003) and heart rates (p = 0.002). Pain scores did not differ significantly between groups. Von Frey responses decreased over time; changes over time varied by treatment (p < 0.001), MedK returning to baseline values more rapidly than MedKM and MedKT. No cat required rescue analgesics. Conclusion and clinical relevance All three protocols can provide adequate anaesthesia and analgesia for orchiectomy in cats. However, rescue intervention to maintain surgical anaesthesia may be required in some cats. Oxygen supplementation is advised.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary artery thrombosis (PAT) is involved in lung vascular dysfunction during acute chest syndrome (ACS) complicating sickle cell disease (SCD). No clinical score is available to identify patients eligible for multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography during ACS. This retrospective study aimed to develop a risk score for PAT during ACS (PAT-ACS risk score). Patients with SCD were investigated by MDCT during ACS. A logistic regression was performed to determine independent risks factors for PAT and to build the PAT-ACS risk score. A total of 43 episodes (11·9%) of PAT were diagnosed in 361 episodes of ACS. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors, which were included in the PAT-ACS risk score: a baseline haemoglobin >82 g/l, the lack of a triggering factor for ACS, a platelet count >440 ? 109/l and a PaCO2 <38 mmHg at ACS diagnosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the PAT-ACS risk score was 0·74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0·69?0·79) and differed from that of the revised Geneva score (0·63 (95% CI 0·58?0·69); P = 0·04). The negative predictive value of a PAT-ACS risk score ≥2 was 94%. In conclusion, we propose a simple clinical risk score to identify SCD patients at high risk of PAT during ACS.

AB  - Sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death in patients in noncoronary intensive care units. Currently, there are no specific treatments that reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and MODS. We report three patients who received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for sepsis with MODS who completely recovered. The first patient, a 3-year-old male presented with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated respiratory, renal, coagulation, hepatic, and neurologic dysfunction. After 5 TPEs, the patient fully recovered. The second patient was a 36-year-old pregnant female who developed MODS at 22 weeks of gestation. She had developed respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation dysfunction following pneumonia and concurrent urinary tract infection resulting in an intrauterine fetal demise. After 8 TPEs, the patient was discharged home with only mild residual hepatic dysfunction. The third patient, a 50-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, was found unresponsive in over 100°F heat and diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus-associated MODS. Her respiratory, coagulation, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems were affected. The patient underwent 6 TPEs after which she had marked improvement. In conclusion, TPE may be an effective adjunct therapy in MODS by possibly removing toxic mediators and replacing deficient factors using donor plasma. J. Clin.
