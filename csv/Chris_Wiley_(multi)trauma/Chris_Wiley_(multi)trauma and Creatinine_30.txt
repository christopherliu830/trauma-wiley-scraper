AB  - Reasons for performing study Triamcinolone is commonly used in equine practice for the treatment of orthopaedic conditions. A serious potential adverse effect of triamcinolone is laminitis. However, evidence for the risk of laminitis associated with triamcinolone use is limited. Objectives To determine the risk of laminitis within 90 days of triamcinolone administration and compare with the risk of laminitis in a veterinary-attended horse population. Study design Retrospective study of clinical records. Methods Text mining and data extraction was performed using content analysis software (SimStat-WordStat v.6) on a database of anonymous digital clinical records from a convenience sample of North American equine practices (n?=?9). Medical records were retrieved using a dictionary of keywords for 3 groups of horses: 1) treated with triamcinolone, 2) age and practice matched control population (no triamcinolone) and 3) all laminitic horses. Records of horses within Groups 1 and 2 were mined for evidence of laminitis within a 90-day period of treatment or a random date respectively. Data manipulation and analysis was performed using R v3.0.0 (R Development Core Team). The prevalence of laminitis within all groups was determined and relative risk of developing laminitis determined by single logistic regression. Results The clinical records of 225,777 horses were examined. Overall prevalence of laminitis within the database was 1.1% (n?=?2533). Triamcinolone was administered to 12.4% (n?=?27,898) horses and 0.07% of treated horses (n?=?20) developed laminitis. In the control population (n?=?56,695), 0.2% of horses (n?=?134) developed laminitis. The risk of developing laminitis was significantly lower in the triamcinolone treatment group than the control population (OR 0.3 95%CI, 0.18?0.48 P<0.001). Conclusions Triamcinolone treatment does not increase the overall risk of a horse developing laminitis. However, further investigation of risk factors for laminitis in the 20 horses identified by this preliminary study is warranted to aid development of evidence-based treatment guidelines.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Effective diagnosis of equine laminitis is necessary to allow prompt instigation of palliative and therapeutic treatments, yet there has been limited work regarding diagnostic accuracy. Objectives To compare the prevalence of clinical signs in laminitis and non-laminitis lamenesses to evaluate the capabilities of discrimination for differential diagnosis. Study design Analytical epidemiological study. Methods Veterinary practitioners completed a pre-designed checklist of laminitis-associated clinical signs identified by literature review, for equine lameness of any origin. A case was defined as a horse/pony with veterinary-diagnosed, clinically apparent laminitis, attended by a participating practitioner. Associations between clinical signs and case/control status were tested by logistic regression with adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with veterinary practice as a fixed effect, and Wald P-value calculated. Multivariable analysis using graphical classification tree-based statistical models allowed comprehension of the prevalence in the data associated with particular clusters of clinical signs. Results Data were collected for 588 laminitis cases and 201 non-laminitis lamenesses. The overall prevalence of specific clinical signs ranged from 2.7% for ?sole prolapse? to 85.0% for ?lame at trot?. Differences in prevalence ranged from ?14.1% for ?lame at trot? (more common in controls) to +71.9% for ?short stilted gait at walk? (more common in cases). Five clinical signs had a difference in prevalence of greater than +50%: ?reluctance to walk?, ?short, stilted gait at walk?, ?difficulty turning?, ?shifting weight? and ?increased digital pulse?. Bilateral forelimb lameness was the best discriminator (92% of animals with this clinical sign had laminitis). The additional presence of increased digital pulses improved this to 99%. Flat/convex sole, shifting weight and short stilted gait at walk were also useful discriminators. Conclusions This is the first study to provide information aiding diagnostic hypothetico-deductive reasoning based on clinical signs to differentially diagnose laminitis from other lamenesses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In man, pulmonary veins (PV) are of major importance in atrial fibrillation pathophysiology as ectopy often originates in atrial myocardial sleeves extending in the PV wall. In addition, PV size on ultrasound is used to assess left atrial volume overload. In horses, PV anatomy and ultrasound have hardly been studied. Objectives To study PV anatomy and establish a standard approach for echocardiographic identification of the PV from a right and left parasternal view. Study design Anatomical and echocardiographic description. Methods Firstly, post mortem left atrial and PV silicone corrosion casts were made in 10 horses to investigate normal PV anatomy. Secondly, left and right parasternal ultrasound images and silicone casts were made in 3 horses, to compare images and casts. Results Four major PV ostia were identified on the casts, draining specific lung areas. From a right parasternal longitudinal view, ostium III was identified between the right atrial wall and right pulmonary artery, and ostium II left-dorsal to it. From a left parasternal oblique short-axis view, ostium III, its antrum and side-branches were used as anatomical landmarks (adjacent to the right atrial wall). Slightly more caudal, ostium II was visualised with, in one horse, its antrum and 2 branches. Ostium I was only seen in one horse, slightly ventral to ostium II. Ostium IV was always identified in cross-section on a left short-axis view, left to the pulmonary artery bifurcation. Conclusions A standard echocardiographic approach allows identification of pulmonary veins in adult horses. Left oblique and short axis views were superior although right long-axis views also showed ostiums II and III. These data allow reference values to be established for pulmonary venous size and flow, and to investigate new treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are currently no studies detailing cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release and clearance in normal horses post exercise using an analytically validated assay. These data are essential for selecting appropriate sampling times in equine athletes with suspected myocardial damage. Objective To plot the magnitude and time course of cTnI release and clearance, using a validated cTnI assay, after maximal effort. Study design Descriptive longitudinal study. Methods Five clinically normal Standardbred racehorses in full race training were included in the study. Physical examinations were performed on subjects and blood samples were taken via jugular venipuncture pre-exercise. Horses were exercised in harness at race intensity in groups on a training track. A second blood sample was taken immediately post exercise and an intravenous catheter was then placed in a jugular vein. Hourly blood samples were taken for 24?h. All samples were collected in red top serum Vacutainer? tubes and allowed to clot for 30?min before being centrifuged and serum harvested. Serum samples were stored at ?80°C until analysis. All samples were analysed using the Abbott ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity cTnI? assay. Results Mean resting cTnI level was 1.33?±?0.6?ng/l (range, 0.82?2.33?ng/l). All horses exhibited an increase in cTnI level after exercise with peak elevation occurring 2?6?h post exercise (mean, 4.6?±?1.7?h). Mean peak increase in cTnI level was 11.96?±?9.41?ng/l (range, 1.72?23.76?ng/l). All horses returned to baseline levels within 24?h. Conclusions All horses experienced an increase in cTnI post exercise, with the peak occurring 2?6?h post exercise. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of these increases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Gastric ulceration is an important cause of morbidity in horses. Currently, gastroscopy is the only reliable antemortem method for definitive diagnosis; however, it is unsuitable as a screening test because it is expensive, invasive and time-consuming. Sucrose permeability testing represents a simple, economical, non-invasive alternative to gastroscopy for screening purposes, and the feasibility of this approach in the horse has been reported [1]. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose as a screening test for gastric ulceration. Study design Cross-sectional design. Methods One hundred and one adult horses with and without naturally occurring gastric ulcers were studied. The diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose for detection of gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min after administration of 1?g/kg bwt of sucrose via nasogastric intubation was assessed with ROC curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Sucrose concentration in blood was compared with gastroscopy as the gold standard; and sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were calculated across a range of sucrose concentrations. Cut-off values were selected manually to optimise sensitivity. Results The prevalence of gastric ulcers was 83%. The AUC?±?95% CI for blood sucrose concentration when used to distinguish between horses with and without gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min was 0.592 (0.441?0.744) and 0.615 (0.469?0.761) respectively. Sucrose concentrations of 4.70??mol/l at 45?min; and 4.57??mol/l at 90?min were selected as optimal cut-offs. Using these cut-offs, Se ranged from 64.4% to 77%; and Sp ranged from 42.9% to 50%. Conclusions Blood sucrose is neither a sensitive nor specific test for detecting gastric ulcers in adult horses with naturally occurring ulcers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Training and rehabilitation techniques which improve core muscle strength are beneficial for improvement of dynamic stability of the equine vertebral column. The Equiband? system, consisting of resistance bands attached to a customised saddle pad, is suggested to provide constant proprioceptive feedback during motion to encourage recruitment of abdominal and hindquarter musculature. Objectives To quantify the effect of the Equiband? system on back kinematics and movement symmetry. Study design Longitudinal intervention study. Methods Quantitative analysis of back movement and gait symmetry before/after a 4-week exercise programme. Inertial sensor data was collected from 7 horses at Weeks 0 and 4 of a fixed exercise protocol. Analysis with and without the Equiband? system was completed at trot in hand on a hard surface, and for both reins on the lunge on a soft surface. Six back kinematic and 3 movement symmetry parameters were calculated according to published methods. Movement symmetry values were side-corrected to allow comparison between reins on the lunge. A mixed model (P<0.05) evaluated the effects of the Equiband? system over time, and trotting direction on back kinematic and movement symmetry parameters. Results The Equiband? system significantly reduced (all P<0.02) roll, pitch and mediolateral displacement in the cranial-mid thoracic region. Across all horses, back displacement and range of motion values were significantly greater (P<0.01) on the lunge than in a straight line, movement symmetry was consistent with having corrected all horses to be left-sided. Conclusion Preliminary results suggest the Equiband? system may aid dynamic stabilisation of the vertebral column.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Horses run on curves during training and competition, and are often trotted in circles to assist lameness diagnosis. The effects of moving on a curve on tendon strain in the distal limb are not known. Objectives To investigate the effect of curve running on the tendons and ligaments of the equine distal limb. Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Cadaver forelimbs from 6 Thoroughbred horses were loaded on a forceplate using a hydraulic ram. Limbs were loaded to 17?33?N/kg on a flat surface and with medial and lateral wooden wedges under the hoof to simulate curve running with the limb being on the inside and outside of a curve, respectively. Tendon length was measured for the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons (SDFT and DDFT), accessory ligament of the DDFT (ALDDFT), the suspensory ligament body (SL) and the medial and lateral suspensory ligament branches (SBM and SBL) using motion capture. A mixed effects model was used for data analysis. Results Under most loading conditions SL was under most strain and DDFT least. For a medial 15° wedge SDFT was under 0.4% greater load than SL (P?=?0.04). SBM was under 0.48% greater strain than SBL with a lateral 20° wedge (P?=?0.01), and SBL was under 1.37% greater strain than SBM with a medial 20° wedge (P<0.01). Conclusions Curve running leads to increasing and asymmetrical strain on the suspensory ligament branches. This difference is unlikely to be sufficient to cause injury, but may assist lameness diagnosis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diffusion of local anaesthetic solution after a mid-pastern ring block has not been investigated. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following injection of radiodense contrast medium as performed for a mid-pastern ring block. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. One and a half ml radiodense contrast medium was injected over the medial or lateral palmar digital nerve at the level of the proximal aspect of the ungular cartilages. A dorsal ring block was performed on the ipsilateral side, 1.5?cm proximal to the palpable palmar aspect of the proximal eminence of the middle phalanx, using 2 or 5?ml contrast medium. Both forelimbs were injected on 2 days (48 injections). Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately, 10 and 20?min after injections. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After dorsal injections the contrast medium was distributed in a diffuse patch over the ipsilateral half of the proximal phalanx (PP), extending proximally over the half of the length of PP in all limbs (greatest proximal extension: 89.0% of the length of PP [from distal] after 2?ml, 94.2% after 5?ml). There was significant proximal diffusion in the first 10?min after injection and significant dorsal diffusion between all time points (P<0.01). There was significant positive association between injected volume and the proximal extension of the dorsal contrast patch (P?=?0.01). The median dorsal diffusion was to the dorsal midline of PP; 5?ml contrast medium resulted in significantly greater dorsal diffusion than 2?ml (P<0.01). The dorsal and the palmar contrast patches did not merge. Conclusions Diffusion to the proximal aspect of P1 occurred even after injection of only 2?ml contrast medium. Fetlock region pain may be influenced by a mid-pastern ring block. Ethical animal research:?Written consent had been obtained from a representative of the horses' owner prior to starting the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The measurement of immunoglobulins is important in foals, as individuals with evidence of failure of passive transfer are at increased risk of infection and death during the first month of life. Objectives To identify which test is most suitable for determining the foal's IgG concentration as applied in practice. A distinction was made between hospitalised foals and healthy low risk foals in the field. Study design Prospective study including 46 foals <7 days old, divided into 4 groups based on age and health status. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated manually. Significance was set at P<0.05. Methods Several screening tests were compared to the IgG concentration measured by turbidimetric immunoassay: serum and plasma total protein, albumin and protein spectrum including gamma globulin concentration (GGC) measured by chemistry analyser, total protein by refractometer, glutaraldehyde coagulation test and a semi-quantitative enzyme immunoassay (SNAP). IBM SPSS Statistics 20A was used. A one-way ANOVA with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for determining significant differences among tests and between groups. Correlations between the turbidimetric immunoassay and the screening tests were calculated using linear regression with a 95% CI. Results Group differences were not found. The most accurate alternative test was the combination of total serum protein measured by a chemistry analyser (R 0.83) and GGC (R 0.84) with sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 100% and 95 and 93% respectively. A total serum protein of ≥49?g/l and a GGC of ≥6?g/l corresponded with an IgG concentration of ≥8?g/l. Conclusions According to this study, the most reliable alternative test suitable in a clinical setting for the determination of IgG concentration was measuring total serum protein by a chemistry analyser in combination with serum GGC.

AB  - Reasons for performing study When managing strangles in horses, it is crucial to detect chronic infection with Streptococcus equi (SE), i.e. silent carriers. Objectives Evaluate diagnostics for SE carriers over time in a farm. Study design Longitudinal observational study. Methods Sixty-three Icelandic horses isolated on an island were studied 4 to 26 months after remission of acute strangles, including repeated clinical examination and collection of blood, nasopharyngeal lavage (NPL), and guttural pouch lavage (GPL) samples. Twenty-two horses were treated with penicillin locally and systemically. Serology for S.?equi was examined by iELISA [1]. Nasopharyngeal lavage and GPL samples were investigated for S.?equi and S.?zooepidemicus by real-time PCR [2]. Results Thirty-three per cent were SE carriers after 15 months, despite repeated penicillin treatment. In 16/18 carriers, GPL samples were PCR-positive, but not NPL samples, whereas the opposite was true in 2 horses. Several carriers with persistent aerocystitis were not detected by 3 consecutive NPL samples. Five of 18 carriers were seronegative (27.8%) at 15 months. Following conservative treatment, 7 of these 18 carriers were still carriers at 20 months, 8 were negative, and 3 were lost for sampling. Only GPL samples were positive at this point, and only 1/7 carriers were seropositive. Conclusions To detect chronic carriers of strangles, RT-PCR analysis from both GPL and NPL samples may be necessary. Serological screening at individual level often misses individual carriers in long-term cases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Pleural effusion (PE) is reported to occur most commonly secondary to bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses, with neoplastic effusions contributing the minority of cases. The majority of these reports originate from America and Australia, where long distance transport of horses, a recognised risk factor, appears to occur more frequently. Anecdotally, neoplastic PE is more commonly diagnosed in the UK. Objectives To describe the causes of PE in horses resident in the UK, and to identify potential markers that can help differentiate between infectious and neoplastic causes of PE. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods Medical records from 4 referral hospitals in southern England were searched for horses diagnosed with PE. Information gathered from medical records included signalment, diagnosis (infectious vs. neoplastic), admission physical examination and biochemical findings, and characteristics of the effusion (volume, cell count, total protein [TP] concentration). Statistical comparisons were made between the neoplastic and infectious group using appropriate testing. Results Seventy horses were identified, of which 28 (40%) were neoplastic and 42 were infectious. Horses with infectious effusions were significantly younger (median 7 vs. 13 years; P?=?0.002) and had significantly smaller volumes of pleural fluid drained at admission (9.8 vs. 32.3?l; P<0.001). Horses with infectious PE had a significantly higher rectal temperature (38.6 vs. 38.2°C; P?=?0.03), fibrinogen concentration (7.8 vs. 5.7?g/l; P?=?0.02) and serum amyloid A concentration (223 vs. 104?mg/l; P?=?0.02). Pleural fluid characteristics identified a significantly greater cell count and TP concentration in horses with infectious PE (47?x?109/l vs. 3.4?x?109/l; P<0.001; 54 vs. 31?g/l; P?=?0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that in the UK neoplastic effusions account for a greater proportion of PE than previously reported. A large volume of PE in an older horse with a low cell count and TP concentration should increase the index of suspicion of neoplasia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is a common reason for owners to seek veterinary treatment for their working equids in Morocco. There is no information available regarding cultural, religious or educational barriers to obtaining treatment or about the typical workload of these animals which may predispose them to colic. Objectives To characterise the typical workload and feeding regimens of working equids in Morocco; to characterise the ability of owners to recognise the clinical signs and causes of colic; and to identify specific barriers to the veterinary treatment of colic. Study design Questionnaire-based survey. Methods A standardised, structured questionnaire was administered, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter, to the owners of working equids presenting their animals to 2 centres run by SPANA (The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad). Participation was voluntary and informed consent was obtained prior to the interview. Results All of the 102 participants that completed questionnaire were male. Ninety-eight owners used their animals for pulling carts, with 12% of animals working 7 days per week. 14% of animals were offered water by their owner once per day and 2% every other day. 25% of animals were loose and allowed free to feed unsupervised when not working. 29% of owners were not able to name any cause of colic and 25% did not recognise any clinical signs; only 12% associated colic with gastrointestinal pain. 83% of owners would not seek veterinary treatment due to financial constraints if free treatment at SPANA centres were not available. Conclusions Colic remains a common problem amongst working equids in Morocco. Improved knowledge of management factors associated with colic and how to recognise abdominal pain may reduce the incidence of colic and improve prognosis. The findings presented can be used to inform and develop owner education programmes. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all owners and was delivered in the native language. No details identifying the owner were recorded. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine gastric glandular disease (EGGD) is a common condition, for which the underlying pathophysiology is undetermined. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies have been proposed as a method for adapting therapy. Objectives To evaluate diagnostic information obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Methods Twenty-one horses undergoing elective humane slaughter were subjected to gross examination of the glandular mucosa. Glandular pathology was graded using EGUS Council guidelines from digital camera images. Mucosal biopsies were obtained using a ?single-bite? (1.8?mm; A and 2.4?mm; B) or ?double bite? technique (2.4?mm; C) using endoscopic biopsy instruments. Tissue was formalin fixed, processed and stained using standard protocols. Inflammatory infiltrates visualised histologically were graded (mild, moderate or severe) and compared with ulcer grade. Full thickness biopsies were also obtained adjacent to the biopsy site and of other visual lesions and inflammatory cell counts were compared with mucosal biopsies using ICC. Results Full thickness samples were artefact free and allowed visualisation of all layers. Mucosal biopsy samples contained mucosa in all samples, submucosa in 55% (C), 61% (A) and 66% (B) of samples and glands in 50% (B), 66% (A) and 100% (C). Samples from A were too small for histological assessment (33%) and tissue damage was commonly seen in A and B (n?=?8 and n?=?10) when compared with C (n?=?3). Horses with normal glandular appearance (grade 0; n?=?7) mostly demonstrated mild gastritis (n?=?5). Severe gastritis was identified in mild EGGD (grade 1/2), whilst mild and moderate gastritis was identified in all EGGD grades. There was no histological evidence of ulceration or erosion. There was poor agreement between cell numbers and sampling techniques (ICC<0.29). Conclusions These data show lack of ulcerative pathology and instead inflammation in EGGD. Lesion appearance is a poor indicator of underlying severity. Mucosal biopsies offer limited value in predicting underlying disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The bacteria Clostridium botulinum has been associated with equine grass sickness (EGS); however, the effect on the wider horse's gut microbiome is currently unknown. Objectives To characterise the bacterial dysbiosis that occurs within the gut microbiome of horses with EGS and to identify and quantify Clostridium botulinum within the faecal microbiota of the affected horses. Study design Case?control study. Methods Faecal samples were collected from horses with a histological diagnosis of EGS and matched controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted and sequenced to characterise the microbial communities in the group. Faecal samples were collected from a total of 33 horses over 2 years. This included 13 EGS cases, 14 matched controls and 6 hospital controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted from samples and the v4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. DNA was sequenced on the MiSeq platform and data was analysed using QIIME. Differences in community profile between the 3 groups of horses were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Results There was a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes bacteria in horses with EGS compared to the 2 control groups. Discriminant analysis identified bacterial genera Desulphovibrio and Veillonella and the bacterial species Veillonella parvula as increased in abundance. There was no noticeable increase in C.?botulinum in the faecal microbiome of EGS horses in this study. Conclusions The dysbiosis characterised by bacterial sequencing showed a similar shift to that identified previously in colitis horses and human inflammatory bowel disease. It is currently unclear how Verrucomicrobia bacteria are linked to grass sickness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by The University of Liverpool ethics committee. Owner informed consent was obtained before sampling. Sources of funding:?The Equine Grass Sickness Fund and The University of Reading. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension overload is increasingly being recognised in dressage horses and, like forelimb suspensory ligament injury, tends to be seen in horses with extravagant trot steps. However, there is limited understanding of the effects of different paces within the trot on forelimb movement, therefore it is difficult to advise rationally on prevention or management of these types of injury. Objectives To compare forelimb kinematics of collected and medium or extended trot in dressage horses. Study design Prospective study. Methods Twenty mixed-breed dressage horses (age 9?±?4 years; height 168?±?6?cm; weight 600?±?63?kg; median competition level?=?advanced medium) were tested at collected and medium/extended trot (age and training level dependent) in a straight line on an artificial surface ridden by their own rider at sitting trot. Four strides of each pace were recorded using high speed motion capture (240?Hz). Markers were placed on the horses' forelimbs at predetermined anatomical sites. Fetlock, carpus, elbow and shoulder angles were derived at midstance. Descriptive statistics and mixed effect multilevel regression analyses were performed on the data. Results Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased at medium compared with collected trot (coefficient: 5.70; CI 2.58?8.82; P<0.01) and extended compared with collected trot (coefficient: 8.59; CI 5.16?12.02; P<0.01). Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased when carpus extension angle (coefficient: 0.61; CI?=?0.4?0.82; P<0.01) and shoulder flexion angle were increased (coefficient: 0.18; CI 0.01?0.33; P<0.05). Conclusions Fetlock extension increased when the horses performed lengthened trot paces, more in extended than medium trot. The loading of the carpus and shoulder were related to fetlock extension, suggesting that lengthened paces affect the loading of the entire forelimb. Lengthened paces may be contraindicated in horses with fetlock hyperextension or suspensory ligament injury; they may be a potential risk factor for these injuries. Interaction with the surface could also have a role that could be further investigated. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Health Trust ethical review committee. Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Elise Pilkington Charitable Trust, Dr Wilfrid Bechtolsheimer, British Dressage.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Subpalpebral lavage (SPL) systems are commonly used to facilitate treatment of ophthalmic conditions in the horse, are placed in differing positions and are associated with various complications. Objectives To evaluate differences in complication rates between SPL placement in the upper vs. lower eyelid and factors associated with development of complications. Study design Retrospective, clinical study. Methods Clinical records from the Royal Veterinary College (2000?2013) were evaluated. Data collated included age, breed, sex, clinician, training, ophthalmic condition, pharmacological agents administered, catheter position, duration of placement, where the catheter was managed (hospital/home) and any complications observed. Data was initially interrogated using chi-squared tests and then binary logistic regression models built to evaluate these factors. Results Data was obtained from 135 horses aged 6 days to 30 years. Duration of SPL was 3?60 days (median 8; IQR 7?15). Complication rates were lowest for medicine residents (10%), when compared with interns (42%), medicine clinicians (27%) and surgeons (16%). There was no difference in complication rate between SPL management at home (15.4%) compared with the hospital (16.1%; P?=?0.94). Position of catheter placement was influenced by stage of training (P?=?0.04; boarded clinicians were more likely to place in lower eyelid) and associated with duration of treatment (P?=?0.03; longer treatment times with SPLs in upper eyelid). Complications were associated with catheter position (P?=?0.03; upper 12.8%; lower 22.2%), antimicrobial administration (P?=?0.008; 13.2% when used; 25.0% when not) and plasma administration (P?=?0.004; 30.4% when used; 13.0% when not). Conclusions Subpalpebral lavage placement in the upper eyelid was associated with fewer complications. Use of antimicrobials appeared protective against complications and plasma should only be administered when indicated as it was associated with increased complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Synovial fluid (SF) is located in joint cavities, tendon sheaths and bursae. In joints it comprises a serum filtrate with additional contributions from articular cartilage, synovium and bone. Low molecular weight metabolites represent the end product of the cell regulatory processes. Synovial fluid represents a potential source of disease specific metabolites that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and be used in its early diagnosis. Objectives We hypothesise that there are different metabolomic profiles that can be identified in early OA SF and some of these metabolites are potential biomarkers. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Synovial fluid was used from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 9 normal and 9 OA Thoroughbred horses following macroscopic, microscopic and synovitis scoring. SF was analysed with Proton (1H)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with a 600?MHz Avance III equipped with a cryoprobe and chilled sample-jet autosampler. The software we use is Topsin 3.1 and IconNMR 4.6.7. The following methods were used in order to identify changes in lipids and small molecules; 1D Nuclear Overhauser Effect, Longitudinal Encode-decode and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill. Data analysis was undertaken using unsupervised statistical methods and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results The results demonstrated clustering on principle component analysis between normal and OA samples. Seven metabolites were identified as significantly different in OA P<0.05; mobile lipid 1, methyl group, 2 lactates, proline and 2 citrates. Furthermore total lipid load correlated very closely to Mankin's scoring. Using IPA we identified metabolic pathways relating to altered glycolysis in early OA. Conclusions We identified the metabolic fingerprint of early OA which may allow for better phenotyping of disease states and thereby facilitate targeting of improved treatment regimes.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Accurate diagnosis of chronic foot pain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows appropriate case selection for palmar/plantar digital neurectomy (PDN). Objectives To report follow-up for chronic foot pain treated by PDN, with and without MRI diagnosis. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods The electronic patient records of all animals that underwent PDN were reviewed. Follow-up was obtained from owners using a structured postal/telephone questionnaire. Chi squared/Fisher's exact tests or 2-sample t tests were used, with statistical significance set as P<0.05. Results One hundred and nine PDN cases were undertaken. Follow-up response rate was 72.5%. From these 79 cases, 52 had MRI (MRI+) and 27 did not (MRI?). There was no significant difference in case distribution between the 2 groups: predominantly horses, Warmbloods, geldings, used for full competitions, except MRI+ were younger than MRI? (median 9.99 and 11.71 years respectively, P?=?0.004). Median follow-up time for MRI+ was 31.4 months, and for MRI? was 36.8 months. There was no significant difference in outcome. In total, 78.9% MRI+ achieved their intended use, compared with 73.1% MRI?. For those intended for exercise, 83.7% MRI+ reached a level of exercise, compared with 87.5% MRI?. Median length of exercise maintenance was 25.2 months for MRI+ and 24.0 months for MRI?. For MRI+ there was one suspected and one confirmed neuroma and 4 neuritis cases. Two MRI? animals developed neuritis. Complications requiring euthanasia occurred in 2 MRI? cases: complete rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon in a bilateral forelimb lameness and one previous chronic laminitic with solar prolapse. Conclusions These results are comparable with previous reports of 80% of MRI+ returning to previous athletic use for 20 months. Achievement of intended use, length of exercise maintenance and complication rate was similar with and without MRI diagnosis, although both catastrophic complications occurred in animals which did not undergo MRI.
