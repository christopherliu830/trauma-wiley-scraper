AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season. Restoration of fertility in this study was lower than that previously reported and potential reasons for this include limited pre-surgical diagnostic testing, differing prior pathologies or reasons for sub-fertility, and case selection.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine whether horses could become infected with cyathostomins when bedded in deep litter straw. Objectives The specific objective of the study was to determine whether cyathostomin eggs could hatch and develop to infective larval stages on straw bedding. Study design Experimental study. Methods Four horticultural incubators were set up to simulate 3 straw bedding scenarios, and one grass turf control. Faeces were placed on 12 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass over a 17-day period. The plots within incubators A, B, and C contained dry straw, watered straw, and deep litter straw, respectively. Plot 1 of each incubator contained a faecal pat of a horse that tested negative for strongyle eggs ? these were to serve as negative control plots. Plots 2 and 3 of each incubator contained a faecal pat from horses that had average faecal worm egg counts (FWEC) of 269 epg and 921 epg, respectively. A thermostat within each incubator was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 20°C. Results No L3 larvae were recovered from the control plots of each incubator, and none were recovered from any of the plots within Incubator A. L3 larvae were first detected on plots 2 and 3 of Incubator B on Day 8, and on plot 3 of incubators C and D on Day 10. Conclusions It is evident that equine Cyathostominae can develop to infective L3 larvae on straw bedding, but only when the straw is moist. Therefore, it may be speculated that a horse bedded in deep litter straw may become infected by ingesting the infective L3 larvae contaminating the straw. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study While open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice for most ulnar fractures conservative treatment is sometimes chosen due to financial constraints. Additional motives for the choice of treatment may be present, and the clients perception is therefore of interest. Objectives To compare survival and outcome between horses treated for an ulnar fracture, either surgically or conservatively and to assess clients perception of treatment. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Medical records and radiographs of horses treated between January 2002 and December 2012, with a diagnosis of ulnar fracture were reviewed. Information regarding short- (within 1 year) and long-term (>1 year) outcome and owner satisfaction with treatment was obtained via telephone questionnaires. Differences between groups were investigated using a chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results Fracture types included 11 type 4, 7 type 5, one type 2, and one type 1b fracture. Eleven horses were treated surgically (Group 1). Nine horses were managed conservatively (Group 2). Group 1: 7/11 (64%) survived >1 year, 5/11 (45%) returned to previous athletic level. In Group 2: 6/9 (67%) survived >1 year, 4/9 (43%) returned to previous athletic level. No significant difference in outcome could be detected. There was no difference in the total treatment cost for horses that stayed at the hospital (P?=?0.22). Owners in Group 1 expressed more satisfaction with the treatment than owners in Group 2. Several of the latter expressed welfare concerns regarding the prolonged stall confinement in harness involved with this treatment. Conclusions Veterinarians recommending therapy for cases of ulnar fractures should be aware that many can be treated surgically with a good outcome. Prolonged hospitalisation and stall confinement of horses treated conservatively was a major welfare concern of the owners interviewed and had the same total cost as surgical treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF), causing epizootic lymphangitis (EZL), is endemic in parts of Africa including, Ethiopia, Senegal and Gambia. Despite its high prevalence, impact on animal welfare and socio-economic importance, there is little evidence upon which to build practical disease control strategies. The performance and availability of diagnostic tests currently used by clinicians is problematic. Methods such as pattern recognition of clinical signs and microscopy lack specificity and other reported methods are either not commercially available or not readily feasible in these settings (e.g. culture). This is a significant barrier to further understanding this disease within endemic countries. Objectives To validate a nested PCR method to confirm the presence of HCF in equine clinical samples. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Twenty-nine horses with suspected EZL were included from topographically varied regions of Ethiopia. Clinical data, lesion location drawn onto equine silhouettes, blood samples and aspirates of pus from cutaneous nodules were obtained before treatment provided by SPANA clinic. Blood and clinical data were collected from a further 20 horses with no cutaneous EZL lesions. Giemsa stained impression smears of pus were examined microscopically. Aliquots of heat-inactivated pus and blood were inoculated onto Whatman FTA cards and imported to the UK with Defra approved licensing. A nested PCR targeting the ITS region, was used to identify samples containing HCF and PCR products were sequenced. Results HCF was confirmed in heat-inactivated FTA card pus samples from 24 horses, additionally, 23 blood samples were positive from EZL suspected cases. Bioinfomatic analyses suggested that there was diversity within the ITS region among these HCF products. Conclusions These PCR techniques allow the rapid diagnosis of HCF directly from equine clinical samples. The identification of HCF in blood raises questions about the pathogenesis of HCF in horses and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Atrial fibrillation is a common equine arrhythmia. Quinidine alone, or with digoxin are common treatments. Studies on outcome in Warmblood populations in which duration of the AF is often unknown are limited. Objectives To identify the factors that are associated with the success of full treatment cardioversion with oral medication, and establish whether there are differences in these factors between institutions. Study design Retrospective case series using patient records of Equine University Clinic of Utrecht University and Rossdales Equine Hospital, Newmarket. Methods Forty-nine horses treated with quinidine were identified (29 Warmbloods, 20 Thorougbreds, 1 Anglo-Arabian). Details of signalment, history, duration physical examination and echocardiography including left atrial size and presence of mitral regurgitation were retrieved. Clinical details including mean weight, age and left atrial size were compared between clinics using independent samples t test. Association between variables and cardioconversion were evaluated in a backwards logistic regression using Akaike's information criterium (AIC) and odds ratios were calculated. Factors were sex, clinic, breed, mitral regurgitation, duration and poor performance. Covariates were age, weight and the size of the left atrium. Significance was set at 0.05. Results Fifty-one horses (mean age 8.8?s.d. 4.5 years) were treated with quinidine sulfate, 18 also received digoxin. Eighty per cent converted to sinus rhythm. In 8 horses the known duration was less than 3 months. The only factor associated with successful treatment was the use of digoxin in combination with quinidine sulfate (odds ratio 12.4; 95% CI 2.61 and 91.85 according to AIC analysis). Conclusions In this retrospective case series, there is much potential for bias in the data; however, the use of digoxin in addition to quinidine was associated with improved conversion rates regardless of breed even though AF duration was unknown in most horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Every year, several equine influenza (EI) epidemics are reported worldwide. Equine influenza vaccination is the most efficient method of prevention; however, not all horses develop sufficient immunity after EI immunisation, increasing the risk of infection, infectious virus excretion and the spread of the disease. Objectives This study aimed to better understand poor vaccine response mechanisms during the primary EI vaccination. Study design Cohort study. Methods The EI humoral immune response was measured in 118 Thoroughbred foals set in 3 different stud farms (SF#1 to SF#3) after the primary course of EI vaccination. All foals were immunised with a recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, following the vaccine manufacturer's recommendations. The age at first vaccination was 4 to 8 months. Sera were tested by single radial haemolysis (SRH) against the A/equine/Jouars/4/2006 EIV strain (Florida clade 2) at the time of the first vaccination (V1), 2 weeks and 3 months after the second immunisation (V2), 2 days and 3 months after the third immunisation (V3). Results Short (V2?+?2 weeks) and mid-term (V3?+?3 months) SRH antibody levels were statistically different between the stud farms (P-value?=?0.0011 and 0.003, respectively), with SF#1<SF#3<SF#2 and SF#1 SRH antibody titres below the protection threshold (i.e. 85?mm2) at all time points studied. SRH antibody levels induced by EI vaccination were related to the age of foals at the first immunisation (SF#1 median age 143 days, SF#2 median age 181 days and SF#3 median age 156 days), but were independent of the presence of maternal derived antibodies (MDA; P-value 0.41). Given the results in SF#1, a booster immunisation (V4) was brought forward to restore protective levels of antibody. Conclusion Independently of the presence of MDA, the age of foals at first immunisation plays an important role in the establishment of adequate antibody levels.

AB  - Reason for performing study Measurement of lactate in horses with colic has been described for over 20 years. Objectives To systematically review the evidence on the use of plasma and/or peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS scoring system. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to colic; 32 studies related to the use of lactate in the diagnosis of colic, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using QUADAS. Both papers investigated the use of plasma and peritoneal lactate to identify strangulating intestinal lesions. Both were cross-sectional studies, and together they evaluated a total of 71 horses with confirmed strangulating lesions. Appraisal of the studies using the QUADAS tool was performed. Both papers met QUADAS criteria relating to study design and data analysis, but the QUADAS tool did highlight some limitations in terms of sample and control groups in both papers. Data analysis varied, with one study developing a model to predict the presence of a strangulating lesion, which included peritoneal lactate and other measurements, and the other study assessing optimal predictive values associated with concentrations of peritoneal lactate. Both studies concluded that peritoneal lactate was a more useful diagnostic test than blood lactate. Conclusions Despite the large numbers of publications reporting use of lactate, only a small number used study designs considered suitable for evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy as proposed by the Cochrane Library. Although the current evidence is limited, there is agreement on the value of peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for strangulating intestinal lesions. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ethmoidal infection with Aspergillus spp. is rarely reported in horses. Three horses suffering from unilateral infection with Aspergillus spp. of the ethmoid with varying underlying conditions are described. Study design Case series. Methods Diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the ethmoid (presence of white mycotic plaques on a layer of thick yellow mucus) and confirmed by fungal culture (A. fumigatus) and/or cytology. Clinical details and outcome were obtained from the medical records and by contacting owners. Results Horse 1 and 2 had a progressive ethmoid haematoma (PEH) and had been treated for over 5 months with repeated formalin injections (one horse after initial surgical debulking of the PEH that also invaded the maxillary and sphenopalatine sinuses) before the infection with Aspergillus was diagnosed. The third horse, presented with poor performance and nasal discharge, had congenitally abnormal anatomy of the right dorsal nasal passage and right ethmoids. In the 2 horses with PEH the mycotic plaques were removed transendoscopically successfully. After 6 weeks the infection was no longer present at endoscopy in both horses (follow-up endoscopy: Horse 1 no relapse >16 months and Horse 2 no relapse >7 months). In the third horse, it was not possible to remove all mycotic plaques, therefore systemic treatment with itraconazole (3?mg/kg bwt q. 12?h for 8 weeks orally) was started. After 8 weeks, the clinical signs had resolved and endoscopy showed that the Aspergillus infection had cleared (follow-up: no relapse >14 months). No side effects were seen with systemic itraconazole treatment. Conclusions In horses with underlying ethmoidal conditions, secondary infection with Aspergillus spp. may occur. Transendoscopic removal of the mycotic plaques alone may be successful and if this approach is not feasible or unsuccessful, systemic treatment with itraconazole can be considered.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recent studies evaluating owner sound horses have identified a large proportion of horses with motion asymmetries but the prevalence, type and magnitude of asymmetries have not been investigated. The increasing use of objective lameness evaluation necessitates a further characterisation of the differences between lameness and motion asymmetries. Objectives To investigate prevalence, and quantify type and magnitude of motion asymmetries during straight-line trot in riding horses, perceived sound by their owners. Study design Cross-sectional prospective study. Methods Vertical head and pelvic movement symmetry was measured in 220 Warmblood riding horses, all functioning in daily work and considered sound by their owners; 100 of these individuals had been included in a previous report [1]. Body-mounted uni-axial accelerometers were used and differences between maximum and minimum head (HDmax, HDmin) and pelvic (PDmax, PDmin) vertical displacement between left and right forelimb and hindlimb stances were calculated during straight-line trot. Previously used symmetry thresholds (absolute differences >6?mm for the head and >3?mm for the pelvic variables) were used. Results The thresholds for symmetry were exceeded for 159 horses (72%) for at least one variable, HDmax (n?=?41, mean 12.7?mm, s.d. 5.5), HDmin (n?=?58, mean 14.3?mm, s.d. 7.1), PDmax (n?=?87, mean 6.5?mm, s.d. 3.10), PDmin (n?=?77, mean 5.7?mm, s.d. 2.1). Contralateral and ipsilateral concurrent fore- and hindlimb asymmetries were detected in 41 and 49 horses, respectively. Conclusions A surprisingly large proportion (72%) of horses perceived as sound by their owner showed movement asymmetries during straight-line trot. It is not known to what extent these asymmetries are related to pain or mechanical abnormalities as opposed to ?normal variation? and this leads to 2 potential welfare problems ? either too many horses in training are actually ?lame? or many horses categorised as ?lame? have no locomotor system disease. Ethical animal research:?This study was conducted within guidelines of the participating sites institutional animal care and use procedures (C 206/10, C48/13) and informed consent for data collection was obtained from the horse owners prior to the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It has been suggested that ultrasonography is unreliable for the detection of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) based on comparison between ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance images. Objectives To compare ultrasonography with gross and histopathological post mortem examination in horses with PSD diagnosed based on the response to local anaesthesia and ultrasonography. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Nineteen horses with hindlimb PSD were humanely destroyed. The ultrasonographic abnormalities were graded prospectively as mild, moderate or severe based on predefined criteria. Thirty-seven lame limbs were examined grossly and 36 suspensory ligaments (SLs) were examined histologically. The histological images were graded blindly based on predefined criteria (0?3 for each tissue type; 0?=?normal, 3?=?severe abnormality). Descriptive statistics were performed. Results Ultrasonographic lesions were graded moderate in 31/38 (81.6%) and severe in 7/38 (18.4%) limbs; in 4/36 (11.1%) limbs adhesion formation between the proximal aspect of the SL and the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon was predicted. Gross post mortem examination revealed substantial adhesions between the proximal aspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissues in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs; in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs there were adhesions between the body of the SL and the mid plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone, extending distally in 6 (16.2%) limbs. Histology revealed abnormalities (grades 1?3) of the collagenous tissue in 25/36 (69.4%) limbs. Muscle was abnormal (grades 1?3) in 35/36 (97.2%) limbs and adipose tissue (grades 1?3) in 16/36 (44.4%) limbs. Neural abnormalities (grades 1?3) were seen in 23/36 (63.9%) limbs and vascular changes (grade 1 and 2) in 2/36 (5.6%) limbs. In 1/36 limbs no abnormality was detected. Conclusions Ultrasonography was reasonably reliable for the detection of SL pathology based on histology as a gold standard, but the ability to detect gross adhesions was limited. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Animal Health Trust and had informed consent of the owners. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Sagittal plane slab fractures of the third carpal bone are a recognised injury in the racehorse. One study [1] reported 32 horses with sagittal fractures, 69% raced again. Surgical management appeared beneficial, with all horses that underwent inter-fragmentary compression racing again. Objectives To document the success rate following sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone in UK-based racehorses, and to compare conservative and surgical management. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Inclusion criteria were Thoroughbred racehorses with a simple sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone. Exclusion criteria were comminuted fractures, radial carpal bone fractures and short incomplete linear lucencies. Fractures were classified as complete, incomplete or uncertain. Time from injury to next race was recorded. Success rates were compared by Fisher's exact test. Results Forty horses were identified. Two were subjected to euthanasia and 3 have <6 months follow-up. Eleven were managed nonsurgically of which 4 (36%) were complete (5 uncertain) and 7 (64%) raced, 154?508 days following injury (median 242 days). Twenty-seven horses underwent surgery to place a single 3.5?mm (n?=?26) or 4.5?mm (n?=?1) lag screw under arthroscopic guidance, of which 18 (67%) were complete. Thirteen (48%) raced again 147?711 days following surgery (median 256 days) P?=?0.48. Of 23 horses with complete fractures 13 (57%) raced again, compared with 5/15 (33%) horses with incomplete fractures P?=?0.2. Of horses with complete fractures, 10/18 (55%) underwent surgery and raced again compared to 3/4 (75%) horses managed conservatively P?=?0.62. Conclusions The results confirm that the prognosis for athletic function is favourable but do not suggest that surgery is beneficial, or necessary for complete fractures. The numbers managed conservatively are small and it was not clear radiographically if the fracture was complete in 5/11 horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Previous studies show the effect of toe or heel wedges on tendon strain but there is little understanding of the effect of other shoe types. Objectives To quantify the effect of different shoeing conditions on the strain in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), distal check ligament (ALDDFT) and suspensory ligament (SL). Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Twelve equine cadaver forelimbs were loaded onto a force plate mimicking stance phase. Markers were placed proximally and distally in each tendon structure and tracked using a motion capture system and strain was calculated. Tendon strain was determined for the following conditions: barefoot, glue on heart bar and aluminium racing plates with and without packing material. Data were analysed using a mixed effects model. Results Significant variation in strain was observed between tendons. The DDFT had the lowest strain, then the ALDDFT, SDFT and SL. Glue on heart bar shoes significantly increased SDFT and SL strain compared to barefoot for the same leg force. Aluminium racing plates without packing material increased ALDDFT and SDFT strain and with packing material increased ALDDFT and SL. Conclusions Shoe selection should be based on minimising strain in the tendon with greatest injury risk. Aluminium racing plates with packing material may be most appropriate for the majority of racehorses as they do not significantly increase SDFT strain.

AB  - Reasons for performing study New therapeutic strategies to modulate immune responses in human and equine allergic airway diseases are under extensive investigation. Stimulation of Treg cells with immune modulating agents is a novel therapeutic option. Objectives The aim of this field study was to compare the effects of a nebulised nanoparticulate CpG immunotherapy (CpG-GNP) with and without specific allergens. Study design Longitudinal clinical study comparing 2 therapeutic options. Methods Twenty RAO-affected horses were divided into 2 treatment groups (CpG alone and CpG with allergens). Two specific allergens were selected for each horse according to anamnesis and a functional in vitro test. Treatments were given by nebulisation 7 times and the horses were examined 3 times: baseline (I), after the treatment course (II), and after 6 weeks later (III). Clinical parameters, indirect intrapleural measurement, arterial blood gas, amount of tracheal mucus and neutrophil percentage were evaluated. Results CpG alone resulted in a significant improvement in clinical parameters and a significant reduction of tracheal mucus after treatment and at 6 weeks post treatment. After CpG plus specific allergens, there was significant improvement of 70% of examined parameters. However, there were no significant differences in the results compared with CpG-GNP treatment alone. Conclusions There were no significant differences between treatment groups. CpG-GNP immunotherapy alone produced a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory parameters and may have potential as for treatment of equine and human allergic inflammatory airway diseases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little data on BALF cytokine profiles are available from racehorses with IAD; cytological diagnosis being most frequently made from one lung only per horse. Objectives To compare cytokine mRNA expressions and protein concentrations in BALF from both lungs of horses with unilateral IAD-consistent cytology. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods As part of a larger study, 250?ml saline was randomly instilled in one lung and 500?ml in the contralateral lung of 30 clinically healthy Standardbred racehorses. This procedure was repeated 72?h later, inversing the volume per lung. Cytological cut-off values for IAD diagnosis was neutrophil proportions >10% when instilling 250?ml. For these samples, mRNA expression and concentrations of IL-1?, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-? were determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Results Eleven horses had BALF with IAD- and CTL-consistent cytology from, respectively, each lung, and were enrolled in the study (22 samples). Data were not significantly influenced by the sampling day, and BALF total cell counts or cytokine concentrations were not significantly different among lungs. Relative mRNA expression of IL-1? (3.887?±?3.082; P?=?0.01) and IL-10 (3.225?±?1.710; P?=?0.005) were significantly higher in BALF of IAD- compared to CTL consistent lungs (respectively 1.408?±?1.118 and 1.488?±?1.393); and also correlated to neutrophil proportions (respectively r?=?0.54; P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.65; P?=?0.001). Conclusions Differences in cytokine mRNA expression were associated with IAD- or CTL consistent BALF cytology in the same racehorses in training. These findings suggest that specific local immune reactions or regulation within the lower airways should be considered in IAD.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is the most common equine emergency problem, and one of the main causes of equid deaths. The horse owners' ability to recognise colic is a critical first step in determining case outcome. Objectives To assess equine owners' knowledge and recognition of colic. Study design Online questionnaire of horse owners. Methods An online survey was designed to evaluate owners' approach to colic in the horse. The survey included questions on owner demographics, their recognition of colic (including owner's opinions of their ability to recognise colic, their approach, and their recognition of colic using case vignettes), and their knowledge of normal ranges for clinical parameters. Descriptive and chi squared statistical analysis was performed. Results The survey was completed by 1061 UK respondents. Six per cent of owners thought they could recognise all types of colic, 61% said they could recognise most cases and 30% said they could recognise some but not all cases. Owners said they would assess faecal output (73% of respondents), gastrointestinal sounds (69%), respiratory rate (62%) and heart rate (50%) in horses with suspected colic. One fifth (22%) of owners would call a vet immediately without assessing any parameters. Many respondents either did not know, or provided incorrect estimates of normal values for clinical parameters: 30.4% were ?unsure? of the normal heart rate and 35.5% gave heart rate values which were outside reference ranges; only 24.5% gave appropriate values for normal respiratory rates and only 31% gave normal temperature values. There was no statistical significance between participants' age, educational qualifications, or their experience with horses and their knowledge of normal clinical parameters. Conclusions Owners varied in their approach and ability to recognise colic, and many had significant gaps in their knowledge of normal parameters. Educational materials and/or training to assist owners could help address these issues. Ethical animal research:?The study did not involve animal research. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The questionnaire was conducted in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act, and the British Educational Research Association's Revised Ethical Guidelines for Educational Research (2004).

AB  - Summary Background Palmar osteochondral disease (POD) is a common cause of lameness in competition horses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive diagnostic modality currently available, however it may not be financially or logistically practical for routine screening of POD. There is increasing interest in the use of metabolomics for diagnosis prior to progression to irreversible damage. Objectives To determine metabolite levels in synovial fluid (SF) of horses with a clinical diagnosis of POD based on diagnostic analgesia and MRI, with the hypothesis that metabolomic profiles differ between diseased and healthy joints. Study design Prospective clinical study. Methods Synovial fluid was collected from metacarpo/tarsophalangeal joints (MC/TPJ) of 29 horses (n = 51 joints), including 14 controls (n = 26) and 15 cases (n = 25), the latter with lameness localised to the MC/TPJ and MR changes consistent with POD (n = 23). Spectra were produced using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analysed. Results Twenty-five metabolites were recognised associated with various biosynthetic and degradation pathways. The metabolite abundances within the controls demonstrated increased variability compared with the clinical group. The low level of variance between the spectra of the two groups was explained by five principal components. Cross-validation of the cohort demonstrated modest separation of predictive power (R2 = 0.67; Q2 = 0.34). Although statistical significance was not achieved, the most influential metabolites were glucose and lactate. Main limitations The modest sample size and variation in signalment, background and presenting condition of the controls may have impacted the discriminative power of the constructed models. The lack of matched controls, differences in time of fluid collection and freezing times may have also reduced accuracy when representing metabolite profiles. Conclusions This study identified and quantified metabolites present in MC/TPJ SF of clinical cases with POD.

AB  - Abstract Observations? A 22-month-old male neutered Coton De Tulear dog was presented for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy under general anesthesia. The anesthetic plan included premedication with intramuscular meperidine (4?mg?kg?1) but meperidine was inadvertently administered at ten-fold this dose. Within 5?minutes, the dog was unresponsive to external stimulation, and by 10?minutes post-injection developed generalized signs of central nervous system (CNS) excitement. Initial therapy included inspired oxygen supplementation, and single intravenous (IV) doses of diazepam (0.68?mg?kg?1) and naloxone (0.03?mg?kg?1) to no effect. A second dose of diazepam (0.46?mg?kg?1, IV) abolished most of the signs of CNS excitement. General anesthesia was induced and the endoscopy performed. Time to extubation was initially prolonged, but administering naloxone (final dose 0.1?mg?kg?1, IV) to effect enabled extubation. After naloxone, the dog became agitated, noise sensitive, and had leg and trunk muscle twitches. Diazepam (0.30?mg?kg?1, IV) abolished these signs and the dog became heavily sedated and laterally recumbent. Naloxone administration was continued as a constant rate infusion (0.02?mg?kg?1?hour?1, IV) until approximately 280?minutes post-meperidine injection, at which time the dog suddenly sat up. Occasional twitches of the leg and trunk muscles were observed during the night. The dog was discharged the next day appearing clinically normal. Conclusions? Given that the CNS excitatory effects of normeperidine are not a ? opioid receptor effect, the use of naloxone should be considered carefully when normeperidine excitotoxicity is suspected. Benzodiazepines may be beneficial in ameliorating clinical signs of normeperidine excitotoxicity.

AB  - Two cases of dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy in 16-week-old male lurcher siblings are reported. The myopathies were characterised by regurgitation, progressive weakness and muscle wastage. The dogs had generalised weakness in all four limbs, with more pronounced weakness in the pelvic limbs. Reduced withdrawal in all limbs, muscle contracture and lingual hypertrophy were noted. Serum creatine kinase activities were markedly elevated. Electromyographic abnormalities included fibrillation potentials. Histopathological and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Clinical improvement was noted in one of the cases with l-carnitine supplementation and supportive therapy. Genetic transmission of the disease was postulated as the dogs were siblings.
