AB  - Introduction The evaluation of acid-base balance of horses is important because it detects alterations that affect their performance and health. There are studies relating these changes with endurance type effort, but few regarding sprint exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the fitness level of Quarter Horses performing barrel racing could be differentiated by quantitative acid-base analysis. Methods For this purpose, 10 horses were distributed into two groups: high (HF) and lower (LF) fitness as defined by the trainer. GPS and frequency meter were used for the measurements. Venous blood gas analysis was performed using a portable analyzer (I-stat) before and after exercise. Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and concentration of non-volatile buffers (Atot) were determined. Variables before and after exercise were compared within and between groups by t-test (P<0.05). Results The average track distance was 125?m. There were no differences between maximum or average velocity and heart rate, which were 30.76?±?0.53?km/h, 22.85?±?0.28?km/h, 206?bpm?±?3.91 versus 27.7?±?2.4?km/h, 21.94?±?0.3?km/h and 203?bpm?±?5.77 for the HF and LF groups, respectively. SID values before exercise were significantly lower for the LF group. Both groups showed a significant increase in Atot and AG, while pH, HCO3-, SIG and SID decreased significantly after exercise. Conclusions Metabolic acidosis was observed using both the traditional and the quantitative approach. It was not possible to differentiate the fitness level of horses in the study.

AB  - Introduction Acid-base disturbances are frequently assessed using traditional variables PCO2, pH, and bicarbonate. This study aimed to compare the changes in acid-base balance in horses performing a CEI endurance race (160?km) using traditional and quantitative methodologies. Methods Blood samples were drawn before racing, at the vet-gate (66?km), immediately after racing, and 2 and 15?h after racing from 18 participating horses. The mean velocity of the horses was 17?km/h. PCO2 and pH were measured (I-Stat). Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and total volatile buffers (Atot) were calculated using formulas from the literature. Data for finishers (F) and non-finishers (N) was compared with an unpaired test. Data collected for finishers at all time-points was compared by repeated ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results PCO2 was lower in group N at the 66?km time-point. In group F, AG had a bimodal behaviour, declining immediately after exercise and then increasing at 2 and 15 hours. There was a slight increase in pH post-exercise. After 2 hours, Atot increased while PCO2 decreased. Compared to SIG immediately after racing, SIG at 2 and 15 hours after racing was decreased. Traditional methodology suggested mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to hyperventilation of the finishers. Quantitative methodology suggested metabolic acidosis reflected by decreasing SID trend and a significant increase of Atot. Conclusions Acid-base imbalances are present in endurance racing horses and differences were found between the traditional and quantitative methods of assessment.

AB  - Introduction During anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, lactate and H+ ions accumulate in muscle fibers and pass into the bloodstream. Monocarboxylate transporter type 1 and its ancillary protein CD147 transport H+ and lactate ions from the plasma into red blood cells, thereby maintaining acid/base homeostasis and retarding systemic acidosis and fatigue. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of CD147 protein in the red blood cells of Arabian horses with different levels of athletic ability. Methods Blood samples were taken from 12 Arabian horses before exercise. The horses were divided into two groups: untrained horses (UH, n?=?6) and 160-km endurance horses (FEI, n?=?6). The amount of CD147 in the plasma membranes of their red blood cells was determined by Western blotting analysis using a human-specific anti-CD147 antibody previously validated for horses. The medians were compared by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test at 5%. Results CD147 protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45?kDa was found in the red blood cell membranes of the studied horses. The CD147 expression levels of the two groups were not different (P?=?0.065). The observed median values (min?max) were 0.50 (0.37?1.26) and 0.27 (0.09?0.69) arbitrary optical density units for the FEI and UH group respectively. Conclusions Studies must be performed with more horses to determine if a different level of CD147 expression exists in FEI horses related to their intensive training programs or to the genetic traits of each horse.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered in North America for the prophylactic treatment of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Plasma total CO2 concentration (ctCO2) provides a clinically useful screening test for the presence of metabolic acid-base disturbances, including the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents to racehorses. Some racing jurisdictions account for the metabolic alkalosis and increased plasma ctCO2 induced by furosemide administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between pre-race furosemide dose and pre-race plasma ctCO2 in Thoroughbred racehorses. Methods Jugular venous blood was collected anaerobically into 3?mL partially evacuated plastic tubes containing lithium heparin from 226 Thoroughbred horses administered a variable dose of furosemide (150?500?mg IV, n?=?217) 3?4 hours previously or not administered furosemide (n?=?9). Plasma ctCO2 was calculated from the measured values for pH and pCO2 using a blood gas and pH analyzer [Radiometer ABL 700] and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Data was analyzed using multivariable linear regression and P<0.05 was significant. Plasma ctCO2 in mmol/L increased linearly (P?=?0.0006) with furosemide dose in milligrams adjusted for sex (female, stallion, gelding), such that ctCO2?=?33.38???0.71(if female)???0.63(if stallion)?+?0.0040???(furosemide dose). Conclusions Intravenous administration of furosemide (150?500?mg) produces a linear dose-dependent increase in ctCO2 in plasma. High intravenous doses of furosemide (500?mg) have the potential to increase plasma ctCO2 to near the threshold value used to identify the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents. This finding supports an allowance of 2.0?mmol/L for furosemide administration used by some racing jurisdictions in North America.

AB  - Introduction Big respiratory cycles (BRCs) are a sporadic but normal occurrence during galloping exercise. Their relationship to performance capacity as reflected by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is unclear. Methods 7 Thoroughbreds completed multiple incremental exercise tests up to 13?m/s on a treadmill to determine their VO2max while wearing a mask that measured inspired and expired volumes (VI, VE) and VO2 on a breath-by-breath basis. Frequency and duration of BRCs were related to speed and VO2max using regression analysis. Numbers of BRCs for each test were counted and the duration, VI, VE and VO2 of each BRC determined and compared to the corresponding average values of the 5 breaths following the BRCs, and VO2max for the exercise bout. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results The frequency of BRCs was 64% when all speeds and runs were considered. The number and appearance of BRCs varied considerably between horses. BRC numbers were greatest at 6 and 13?m/s and least at 9?m/s, and significantly related by polynomial regression (r2?=?0.90). BRC duration was not related to breathing frequency when all BRCs were considered due to the existence of two distinct clusters of BRCs. The duration of those lasting <1.25?s was inversely related to speed (r2?=?0.77) as were those >1.25?s in length (r2?=?0.55). BRC VI and VE were greater than normal VI and VE and the difference increased linearly (r2?=?0.89 and 0.87, respectively) as speed increased from 6?m/s (VI: 8.0?±?0.6%; VE: 8.9?±?0.7% greater) to 13?m/s (VI: 42?±?2%; VE: 57?±?3% greater). Individual VO2max was not related to the number, length or volume of BRCs. Conclusions The frequency, duration and size of BRCs do not affect VO2max and vary considerably within a given treadmill test and between horses.

AB  - Introduction Eccentric muscle contractions (?negative? work, e.g., downhill running) affect human skeletal muscle differently than concentric contractions, increasing muscle size and strength more than concentric exercise training with reduced oxygen consumption (VO2). Better understanding of skeletal muscle and cardiopulmonary responses to downhill training may indicate a role for this in Thoroughbred training. We hypothesised that Thoroughbreds would reduce metabolic energy cost and cardiopulmonary function when they ran at equivalent speed on a declined treadmill compared with running horizontally or uphill. Methods Five well-trained Thoroughbreds ran for 2-min incremental exercise intervals on a treadmill at 1.7, 3.5, 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0?m/s on a +4% incline, 0% incline (horizontal) and ?4% decline in random order on different days. Cardiopulmonary and O2-transport variables were measured and analysed with two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Holm-?idák pairwise-comparisons. Results Horses ran at all inclines with identical stride frequency and length. At identical uphill speeds they had significantly higher (vs. horizontal) mass-specific VO2 (43% mean increase) and CO2 production (VCO2/Mb), cardiac output (Q/Mb), heart rate, arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2), and reduced arterial O2 tension and saturation; tidal volume tended to be higher (P?=?0.060). Downhill running reduced (vs. horizontal) VO2/Mb (19% mean decrease), VCO2/Mb, Q/Mb and PaCO2. Fractional energy cost increase (incline) and reduction (decline) decreased linearly with increasing speed. Conclusions Thoroughbreds run downhill with lower energy cost than on the level or uphill and the cost changes with speed. It remains to be determined if eccentric training induces skeletal muscle changes in horses.

AB  - Introduction Training related cardiac adaptation is documented in Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds, including an increased incidence of AV valve regurgitation. In Warmbloods less is known about training effects on cardiac function or subclinical valve regurgitation. Methods Fifteen adult untrained Warmbloods (aged 3.8?±?0.7 years) were compared with fifteen adult Warmblood eventers (aged 11.4?±?0.9 years) competing at CIC2* (group 1, n?=?5) and CCI2*, CIC3*, CCI3* and CCI4*levels (group 2, n?=?9) and fifteen healthy adult Warmbloods competing at advanced dressage (group 3, n?=?5), Prix Saint Georges, Intermediate or Grand Prix (group 4, n?=?10) levels (mean age 10.3?±?0.7 years). The presence of heart murmurs, valve regurgitation and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated, and training intensity was scored. A correlation was found between bodyweight and not height. Differences in cardiac morphology were compared using General Linear Models with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (SPSS version 20), using group and bodyweight as covariates. Significance was set at P<0.05. Prevalence of audible heart murmurs and valvular regurgitation was higher in eventers (0?20% and 29?79%, respectively and dressage horses (7?40% and 7?60%, respectively) than controls (0?20% and 7?20%, respectively). Interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd, left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV mean wall thickness (LVMWT) were greater in groups 2 and 4 than controls; group 4 also had a greater pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and LV posterior wall (LVPWd). Group 1 showed a greater LVMWT; group 4 a greater end point septal separation (EPSS). Training intensity influenced in both categories IVSd and MWT; in eventers also the right ventricular diameter in diastole and in dressage horses also LVPWd, LVM, EPSS and PAD. Elite eventers and dressage horses showed an increased prevalence of audible murmurs and valvular regurgitation. Cardiac adaptations resembled those associated with resistance and endurance training. Increased performance level and training intensity accompanied increased cardiac muscle thickness and volume. These effects should be considered during sales and performance evaluations.

AB  - Introduction Subchondral bone fatigue is an important cause of poor performance, morbidity and mortality in racehorses. Fatigued bone is repaired by remodelling, a process that is attenuated under high cyclical loads, yet the effects of training on remodelling activity in Thoroughbred racehorses is unknown. We hypothesised that remodelling rates are lower in training horses than those that are resting from training. Methods Sections of the palmar metacarpal condyles from Thoroughbred horses that were in race training (n?=?24) or resting from training (n?=?24) at the time of death were examined with light microscopy and back scattered electron microscopy (BSEM). Bone area fraction (B.Ar/T.Ar), and eroded bone surface (E.Pm/T.Ar) were measured within two regions of interest; (1) the lateral parasagittal groove (PS); and (2) the lateral condylar subchondral bone (LC). BSEM variables were analysed for the effect of group (independent samples t-test), region (paired t-test) and interaction with time since change in training status (general linear model). Mean?±?SE are reported. Results For both regions of interest E.Pm/T.Ar was lower in the training horses (PS: 0.39?±?0.06?mm?1, LC: 0.24?±?0.04?mm?1) than in the resting group (PS: 0.65?±?0.07?mm?1, P?= 0.010, LC: 0.85?±?0.10?mm?1, P<0.001). Lower subchondral bone porosity was observed, reflected by higher B.Ar/T.Ar in the LC of training horses (90.8?±?0.6%) than resting horses (85.3?±?1.4%, P?=?0.0010). E.Pm/T.Ar was higher with increased duration of a training period in the lateral condyle (r2?=?0.26, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Race training inhibits remodelling in the subchondral bone of highly loaded areas of the distal metacarpus. Therefore periods of less intense loading are important for allowing repair of subchondral bone fatigue in Thoroughbred racehorses.

AB  - ABSTRACT A retrospective study of 27 dogs with deep mycoses was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of initial laboratory results in determining a diagnosis. Fifteen cases of disseminated blastomycosis, five cases of disseminated histoplasmosis and seven cases of gastrointestinal phycomycosis were studied. Haematologic results consistent with a chronic inflammatory disease (mild to moderate anaemia and moderate to marked monocytosis) were common findings in blastomycosis and phycomycosis. Cases of histoplasmosis were characterized by a more severe anaemia with a neutrophilia and left shift. The severe anaemia present in three out of five (3/5) dogs with histoplasmosis was apparently due to myelophthisis and intravascular erythrocyte fragmentation. Coagulation function tests and/or the haemograms suggested the presence of microangiopathic haemolysis in four dogs with histoplasmosis. Clinical chemistry results in blastomycosis and phycomycosis were usually unremarkable. Hepatic lesions in histoplasmosis were suggested by increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and decreases in serum albumin. Cytology was frequently diagnostic for blastomycosis (11/13 cases) and histoplasmosis (3/4 cases) but was inconsistent in phycomycosis (1/3 cases).

AB  - Abstract Previous research has identified potential issues of establishing and maintaining breastfeeding among women who experience severe maternal morbidity associated with pregnancy and birth, but evidence in the UK maternity population was scarce. We explored the association between severe maternal morbidity and breastfeeding outcomes (uptake and prevalence of partial and exclusive breastfeeding) at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum in a UK sample. Data on breastfeeding outcomes were obtained from a large cohort study of women who gave birth in one maternity unit in England to assess the impact of women's experiences of severe maternal morbidity (defined as major obstetric haemorrhage, severe hypertensive disorder or high dependency unit/intensive care unit admission) on their post-natal health and other important outcomes including infant feeding. Results indicated that among women who responded (n?=?1824, response rate?=?53%), there were no statistically significant differences in breastfeeding outcomes between women who did or did not experience severe morbidity, except for women with severe hypertensive disorder who were less likely to breastfeed either partially or exclusively at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum. Rather, breastfeeding outcomes were related to multi-dimensional factors including sociodemographic (age, ethnicity, living arrangement), other pregnancy outcomes (neonatal intensive care unit admission, mode of birth, women's perceived control during birth) and post-natal psychological factors (depressive symptoms). Women who experience severe maternal morbidity can be reassured that establishing successful breastfeeding can be achieved. More studies are required to understand what support is best for women who have complex health/social needs to establish breastfeeding.

Liporace, 3 Blagovast Nikolov, 4 Gwendolyn Taylor, 5 Melanee Newman, and 1 Andrew G. Herzog ( 1 Harvard Neuroendocrine Unit, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ; 2 Harvard Clinical Research Institute, Boston, MA ; 3 Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical School, New York, NY ; 4 Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA ; and 5 Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Past observations in small studies have suggested that seizures may not occur randomly in the majority of women with epilepsy. They often tend to cluster (Tauboll et al. 1991; Bauer et al. 2001; Haut S et al. 2006). Systematic investigations in large prospective investigations, however, are lacking. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the distribution of seizure occurrence in women with localization related epilepsy. Methods: The present data come from the first 100 women, aged 13?45, who were participating in the baseline phase of a multicenter investigation of supplemental progesterone therapy for the treatment of intractable seizures in women with localization related epilepsy. The women recorded seizures and menses during 3 baseline menstrual cycles. A midluteal progesterone level ≥ 5 ng/ml was used to identify ovulatory cycles. The goodness of fit of the Poisson distribution to the distribution of seizures during the combined three-cycle observation period in each woman with ≥10 seizures was tested by chi square analysis. ?2 values >5.99 identified women with nonrandom seizure distributions. Nonrandom distributions were further categorized as uniform (variance/mean < 1) or clustered (variance/mean >1). Results were similar to an alternative method of testing nonrandom distributions against a uniform distribution for each subject using the Pearson chi square statistic with categorization as clustered if p value was ≤ .05. Results: 75 women had ≥10 seizures over the 3 month observation period. Seizure distributions in these 75 women were random in 29 (38.7%). Among the remaining 46 (61.3%) who had non-random distributions, 6 (8.0%) had uniform distributions and 40 (53.3%) had clustered distributions. Clustering was significantly more pronounced among women with anovulatory cycles than among women with ovulatory cycles (variance/mean ± 2 SD = 6.1 ± 5.3 vs 2.2 ± 1.7; t-test for independent samples: p = .006). No correlation was demonstrated between clustering and age of subjects, age of epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, EEG laterality and individual AEDs. Conclusions: The preliminary findings of this prospective study suggest that the majority (53.3%) of women with localization related epilepsy have clustered seizure distributions and that clustering may be significantly more common with anovulatory than ovulatory cycles.

Ward, and Epilepsy Radiosurgery Study Group ( 1 Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, Charlottesville, VA ; and 3 Neurology, University California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ) Rationale: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) offers an alternative to open surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), but its safety and efficacy are not well-established. We report the two year outcome on seizure remission and morbidities of a multicenter, prospective pilot study of GKS. Methods: Patients had unilateral MTLE as determined by standard presurgical evaluation. GKS, randomized to 20 Gy or 24 Gy comprising 5.0?7.5mL at the 50% isodose volume, was performed on mesial structures including the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Treatment plans were approved at a central site to insure uniformity of lesions. Patients and primary treating physicians were blinded to dose. Regular visits with seizure diaries were obtained for 3 months at presurgical baseline and postoperatively for every three months until 18m, then at 24m. Patients were counted as ?seizure-free? if no seizures (excluding auras) occurred between visits 18m-24m. Any subject that was not available for analysis was considered not seizure-free. Results: Of 40 planned enrollments, 30 qualified resulting in 13 subjects in the high dose and 17 in the low dose group. 1 patient was lost to follow-up soon after treatment. 1 subject in the low-dose group underwent standard lobectomy after not being seizure-free 24 months following treatment. 1 subject experienced papilledema that responded partially to dexamethasone and underwent temporal lobectomy. Reductions in seizure frequency were seen in the high-dose group at 3, 6, 15, 18, and 24 months and for the low-dose group at 12, 15, 18, and 24 months (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Thus, both groups showed significant reductions in seizures at approximately one year following treatment. The low-dose group showed a seizure-free response at 24 months of ? 60% and the high-dose group response was ? 80% at 24 months. Although there is a difference in the seizure-free rates for the two treatment groups, the Fisher's Exact Test using a 2-sided p value indicates that the difference in percentage seizure-free for the two groups is not statistically significant (p = 0.1194), a conclusion limited by the low power to resolve differences between treatment groups. Rates of steroid treatment, new headaches, and visual field defects did not differ between dose or seizure-outcome groups. Conclusions: GKS may offer a safe and effective alternative to standard open surgery for unilateral MTLE. High-dose GKS may be more effective than low-dose without additional morbidity. Disadvantages of GKS include latency to seizure-freedom. Further work is required to determine which patients may benefit from GKS.

Fountain ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: The natural history of epilepsy, and particularly the rate of seizure freedom (SF), is generally unknown except in a few specific epilepsy syndromes. The rate of SF is generally regarded to be low if patients do not respond to the first two medications. However, our experience suggests that some patients with refractory epilepsy become SF. We hypothesized that the rate of SF is higher than expected and correlated with the seizure class and epilepsy syndrome. Methods: Standardized data were prospectively collected by epileptologists from established and new patients seen in the UVA Epilepsy Clinic from April 1998 to November 2004. Data were acquired directly from patients and medical records, refined and cleaned by standardized methods and updated at each clinic visit. Analysis was limited to patients with definite epilepsy > 5 years old. Frequency of each seizure (SZ) type was collected at each visit. Patients were categorized into 14 classes by the combination of SZ types they possessed and classified by ILAE syndromes. For each subject, monthly SZ frequency of each SZ type was plotted over time for the study duration. SF was defined as a total frequency of 0 for at least 6 mo. in patients who had at least 3 SZ frequency entries. Results: From 1638 subjects, 988 had 3 or more SZ frequency entries and were followed for a mean of 37 mo. SF developed in 25% (243), established SF was present throughout the time period in 23% (231), and 52% (514) continued to have seizures. Among those SF, mean duration of follow-up was 24.5 mo. and mean duration of SF was 20.9 mo. The majority (56%) of those SF had a moderately high baseline SZ frequency of 1?15/mo, while 21% had < 1/mo and 15% had a very high SZ frequency of >15/mo. Subjects with GTCs only were most likely to have a low SZ frequency (60%) and mixed types to have a very high frequency (67%). SF rate was highest for subjects with generalized SZs (113 of 355 subjects or 31%) and lowest for mixed SZs (6 of 28 subjects or 21%). SF rate was highest for idiopathic localization-related (53%) and idiopathic generalized (38%) and lowest for other generalized epilepsies (25%). Conclusions: An overall rate of seizure freedom of 48% with 25% becoming SF during the study period is higher than generally expected for established epilepsy. Patients with only generalized SZs, or idiopathic generalized and idiopathic localization-related epilepsies are more likely to become SF but some rate of SF develops in all SZ types and syndromes. It is likely that recall bias and other factors give clinicians the impression that only few patients with epilepsy are seizure free. This demonstrates that SF is a reasonable goal in the treatment of established epilepsy, depending on the SZ type and epilepsy syndrome. (Supported by University of Virginia.) 1 Susana E. Camposano, 1 David A. Lyczkowski, 1 Sonja K. Rakowski, and 1 Elizabeth A. Thiele ( 1 Herscot Center for TSC, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Epilepsy is the most common medical manifestation of TSC, with a high incidence of infantile spasms and partial epilepsy that often is refractory to medical treatment. We describe the incidence, prevalence, management, and control of seizures in a large population of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients meeting clinical criteria for TSC who were seen through our TSC clinical program between January 1999 and November 2005. Results: 194 patients met criteria for TSC (mean age 16 years, range 7 months to 60 years), including 91 females. 172 (88.7%) had a history of seizures (mean age 14.8 years, SD 14.8). Twenty-two (11%) patients did not have a history of seizures (mean 24.1years, SD 13.7). The latter group was significantly older (Student's t test, p < 0.005). TSC diagnosis in patients with no seizure history diagnosis may be established later in life, and they might be underrepresented in our sample. Median age at seizure onset was 6 months (range, newborn to13 years average, mean 1.8 years). Sixty-nine patients (43% of those with seizures) had a history of infantile spasms. Of those who had DNA mutational analysis and seizures (n = 122), patients with IS had a higher proportion of TSC2 mutations compared to those without IS (41/56 with IS versus 28/66 without IS, ?2 p < 0.001) Seizure control Detailed information on 158 patients was available for seizure control analysis. At the time of the last visit, 55 (35%) had been seizure free for one year or longer. 33 (21%) of them, including 4 that underwent epilepsy surgery, were on medications, with an average of 3.28 (total, current and past, range 1to 11) antiepileptic drugs (AED). They had been seizure free for an average of 6.65 years, maximum 28 years. Twenty-three were on current mono-therapy. Twenty-two patients (14%), including 4 that had seizure surgery, were off medications and had been on an average number of 2.81 AEDs (range 1 to 6). Refractory epilepsy Seventy-three patients who had been treated with 3 or more treatments, including AEDs, vagal nerve stimulator (12), ketogenic diet (10), or low glycemic index treatment (2) without reaching seizure control for one year were classified as refractory. They did not differ in mutational frequencies from 26 non-refractory patients (?2= NS), who did achieve seizure control with one or two AEDs. Fifty-nine patients were excluded from this analysis, since they had not been treated with more than 2 AEDs or other treatments and had not achieved seizure control for one year. Epilepsy surgery was performed in 27 refractory patients; 10 of them eventually became seizure free. Nineteen refractory patients became seizure free after being treated with 3 or more AEDs. Conclusions: TSC comprises a wide epilepsy spectrum, with early onset of seizures, high IS incidence and high intractabilitity rates. Nonetheless 35% achieve complete seizure control. 1 Kimford J. Meador, 2 Nancy Browning, 3 Morris J. Cohen, 4 Laura Kalayjian, 5 Joyce Liporace, 6 Page B. Pennell, 7 Michael D. Privitera, 8 Andres Kanner, and 9 Debra T. Cantrell ( 1 Neurology, University of Florida, Gaineville, FL ; 2 EMMES Corporation, Rockville, MD ; 3 Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ; 4 Neurology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ; 5 Neuroscience, Riddle Health Care, Media, PA ; 6 Neurology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA ; 7 Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; 8 Neurology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ; and 9 North Texas Epilepsy Center, Irving, TX ) Rationale: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can produce behavioral teratogenesis in animals at dosages less than required to produce anatomical teratogenesis. We sought to evaluate the cognitive effects of in utero AED exposure in humans in order to determine if differences exist across commonly prescribed AEDs. Methods: The NEAD Study is an ongoing prospective multicenter observational investigation, which enrolled pregnant women with epilepsy taking monotherapy carbamazepine (CBZ), lamotrigine(LTG), phenytoin (PHT), or valproate (VPA). The long-term goal of the study is to examine children from these pregnancies at 6 years old to determine if differential neuropsychological effects exist from in utero exposure across the four most commonly employed AEDs in pregnant women. This analysis is based on currently available results at 2 years old from the Mental Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development for 166 children (CBZ = 43, LTG = 57, PHT = 38, VPA = 28). The childrens' Mental Developmental Index (MDI) scores were analyzed by Analysis of Covariance controlling for maternal IQs. Results: Children exposed in utero to valproate had lower MDI scores at 2 years of age compared to the other 3 AEDs (p = .028). Follow-up pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference for VPA-LTG (p = .018) and a trend for VPA-CBZ (p = .056). Mean (SD) MDIs were: CBZ = 94 (15), LTG = 97 (17), PHT = 90 (19), VPA = 85 (19). The percentages of children with MDI < 70 for each AED were: CBZ = 12%, LTG = 11%, PHT = 13%, VPA = 25%. The adverse effect of VPA was related to anticonvulsant blood level (p = .0001). Conclusions: These findings in conjunction with prior studies imply that in utero valproate exposure is more likely than other commonly used AEDs to impair cognitive development. Thus, valproate poses a greater risk for the unborn child for behavioral as well as anatomical teratogenesis. Additional studies are needed to confirm the present findings and to delineate the risks for other AEDs. (Supported by NIH/NINDS #2RO1 NS38455.) 1 Wayne M. Alves, 1 Yuhua Li, 2 Virinder Nohria, on behalf of the 205 Study Investigators ( 1 Research  and 2 Clinical Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Retigabine is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) that enhances the potassium currents mediated by human KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 potassium channels and exhibits potent anticonvulsant activity in a broad spectrum of epilepsy animal models. The safety and efficacy of retigabine in refractory partial-onset seizures has been previously reported [1]. This report provides a descriptive analysis evaluating the efficacy of retigabine on complex partial seizures (CPS) in patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. Methods: 399 patients with partial-onset seizures (age range: 16?70 years, baseline seizure frequency: ≥4 seizures/month) participated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Study design included an 8-week baseline phase and 16-week double-blind treatment period (8-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance). Patients received either placebo or retigabine 600, 900, or 1200 mg/day and up to 2 approved AEDs. The primary efficacy variable was percent change from baseline in monthly total partial-seizure frequency. The percent change in monthly seizure rate for seizure types was considered as a secondary endpoint. Of 396 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 344 (86.9%) had CPS. 103 (26%) patients had simple partial seizures without secondary generalization (SPS). Results: Retigabine produced a linear dose-dependent reduction in monthly total partial-seizure frequency of 23%, 29% (p = 0.043), and 35% (p 0.001) for retigabine 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day, respectively, versus 13% for placebo. Looking at the most common seizure subtype, monthly CPS frequency was also significantly reduced. Median monthly CPS rate was reduced by 29.8% (p = 0.062), 26.5% (p = 0.064), and 40.0% (p = 0.002) for retigabine 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day, respectively, versus 14.8% for placebo. Monthly median SPS rate was reduced by 23.2% (p = 0.66), 34% (p = 0.77), and 37.6% (p = 0.15) for retigabine 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day, respectively, versus 15.2% for placebo. Conclusions: While retigabine is effective in reducing monthly total partial-onset seizures at 900 and 1200 mg/day, it appears to be effective in reducing the rate of complex partial seizures in all doses tested. Similar numerical trends for SPS frequency were observed but sample sizes are too small to draw a conclusion. Retigabine is currently undergoing global phase 3 studies as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adults with refractory epilepsy. Reference 1 Porter P, Alves W, Nohria V, et al.

In a completed randomized, controlled trial (SP667), lacosamide (400 and 600 mg/day) reduced seizure frequency in subjects with uncontrolled partial seizures. Lacosamide has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Methods: SP755 was an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of lacosamide in subjects with uncontrolled partial seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with or without vagus nerve stimulation. Concomitant AEDs were held stable during an 8-week baseline. Subjects (n = 485) who reported at least 8 seizures with no more than a 21-day seizure-free period were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, lacosamide 200 or 400 mg/day (given bid), respectively. Subjects were titrated over 4 weeks to the randomized dose in 100 mg/week increments. Treatment was maintained for 12 weeks, followed by blinded transition to an open-label extension trial or discontinuation. Efficacy was evaluated with continuous and categorical intent-to-treat analyses of seizure frequency (maintenance vs baseline). Safety was evaluated with adverse event (AE), ECG, vital sign, and clinical laboratory data. Results: The median percent reduction in seizure frequency was 21%, 35%, and 36% for placebo, lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively. The lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day treatment groups were statistically significant over placebo in reducing seizure frequency from Baseline to the Maintenance Phase (p = 0.0223 and 0.0325, respectively). The 50% responder rates were 26%, 35%, and 41% for placebo, lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively. Statistical analysis for responder rate over placebo was significant for lacosamide 400 mg/day (p = 0.0063) and approached significance for the 200 mg/day group (p = 0.0735). Rates for patient discontinuations from the trial for AEs were 6%, 6%, and 16% for placebo, lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively. The most common (≥10% in any lacosamide group) AEs were dizziness, headache and diplopia. Conclusions: Data from this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that adjunctive lacosamide (200 and 400 mg/day) produced a statistically significant reduction in partial seizures in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures and support further development of lacosamide as an antiepileptic drug.

Li, and 1 Fernando Cendes ( 1 Department of Neurology, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Department of Medical Genetics, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are a group of epilepsies with generalized onset of the seizures. According to the main seizure type IGE are divided in subsyndromes. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is normal. The EEG supports the diagnosis when it shows the typical generalized spike and wave (GSW) discharges with normal background. Despite of these features, sometimes focal epileptiform discharges may be registered in the EEG. Some authors believe that these focalities represent fragmented GSW discharges but the pathophysiology of the focalities is still under investigation. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a quantitative technique of MRI analysis that allows automatic comparison between images. This method also increases the sensibility to detect small areas of structural abnormalities. The objective of this study was to investigate the focalities present on the EEG records of patients with IGE using VBM. Methods: Patients were classified according to clinical and EEG features following previous recommendations. All patients had at least one EEG with typical GSW discharges and one with clear focal epileptiform discharges. All patients were submitted to MRI evaluation in a 2T MRI scanner (Elscint, Haifa, Israel). A 3D T1 gradient echo sequence with 1 mm isotropic voxels was used for VBM analysis. Images were previously processed using the software SPM2 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk). All images were submitted to spatial normalization, automatic segmentation, modulation and smoothing. The images of each patient were individually compared with a group of 47 controls (23 women, mean age 32 ± 14, range 19?67). Statistical analysis was performed searching for areas of gray matter concentration (GMC) abnormalities. The statistical level selected was a corrected p < 0.05 (false discovery rate). The localization of the focal discharges on the EEG was compared to the VBM results. Results: Twenty-two patients with IGE diagnosis were evaluated. Nine had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), 6 patients had absence epilepsy (AE) and 7 had generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening (GTCS). Eight of the 9 (89%) patients with JME presented areas of GMC abnormalities. EEG analysis showed correspondence in 6 of 8 patients (75%). Five of 6 (83%) patients with AE presented areas of GMC abnormalities. EEG analysis showed correspondence in 3 of 5 patients (60%). Five of 7 (71%) patients with GTCS presented areas of GMC abnormalities. EEG analysis showed correspondence in 2 of 5 patients (40%). Conclusions: This study supports that subtle structural abnormalities characterized mainly by increased GMC may be responsible for the focal epileptiform discharges observed in the EEG of IGE. These focalities are also probably involved in the pathophysiology of the IGE.

Worrell, 1 Matt Stead, 2 Rick Marsh, 2 Fred Meyer, 1 Greg Cascino, 1 Elson So, and 3 Brian Litt ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; 2 Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; and 3 Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The range of physiologic and pathologic oscillations recorded from human brain extend well beyond what is commonly recorded with clinical acquisition systems. The range of local field activity in human epileptogenic brain extends from DC to ?700 Hz. The clinical relevance of DC fluctuations, infraslow oscillations (0.01?0.1 Hz) and ultrafast oscillations (100?700 Hz) is unclear, but recent research supports the possible role of pathological high-frequency oscillations in the genesis of focal onset seizures. Methods: We studied 10 consecutive patients undergoing presurgical evaluation with hybrid subdural and depth electrodes. The custom hybrid depth and subdural electrodes (Adtech) used for intracranial EEG recordings contain an array of microwire electrodes (40 um?60 um) and clinical macroelectrodes (1?4 mm). The EEG was acquired using a DC coupled broadband amplifier operating in parallel with the clinical EEG acquisition system. Results: The broadband recordings from all 10 patients (5 neocortical grids and 5 temporal depth electrodes) showed oscillations extending from DC to ?700Hz. Infraslow oscillations and DC fluctuations tended to be more spatially distributed, but were most prominent in the region of seizure onset. Ultrafast oscillations (>100 Hz) were most often localized, and were most prominent within the seizure onset zone. The ultrafast oscillations were most evident on the microwire electrodes, and were modulated by slow frequency oscillations. Conclusions: Human epileptogenic brain generates local field oscillations that extend over a wide dynamic range (DC-700 Hz). In addition to activity in the usual clinical bands (?0.5?100 Hz) there are DC fluctuations and shifts, infraslow frequency oscillations (?0.01?0.1 Hz), and ultrafast oscillations (>100?700 Hz) present. The presence of ultrafast oscillations are often highly localized and most evident on microwire recordings, but can be absent from large clinical macroelectrodes. This suggests that clinical macroelectrodes (2 mm) may partially average out ultrafast local field potentials. (Supported by NIH/NINDS K23NS47495?03.) 1 Wenbo Zhang, 2,5 Deanna L.

MSI clinical application is receiving more attention. Presurgical functional brain mapping with MSI allows guidance during surgical decision-making and decreases the invasiveness of presurgical evaluation in epilepsy, brain tumor or cerebral vascular diseases. This report describes the patients tested and confirmed by invasive brain monitoring intraoperatively or with subdural grid placement, in the MSI Lab of Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA and United Hospital at Saint Paul, Minnesota. Methods: Twenty-nine patients experienced both functional brain mapping with MSI (148-channel Magnes 2500 WH System, 4-D Neuroimaging, San Diego, CA) and invasive brain mapping (11 patients with intra-operative mapping, 18 with subdural electrode placement) in Minnesota Epilepsy Group between Dec 2004 and June 2006. Standard MSI protocols were applied for localization of language (word recognition task for receptive language mapping), somatosensory (pneumatic piston as stimuli), and primary motor cortex (voluntary finger tapping). The magnetic sources are modeled as a single equivalent dipole. The dipoles were superimposed onto the 3-dimensional SPGR MR images (1.4 mm slice thickness, no gap). Results: In the 29 patients, there were 8 patients with language mapping, 26 with motor mapping and 16 with somatosensory mapping. In the 51 brain function components, somtosensory and motor MSI dipoles were overlapped with the locations of invasive cortical mapping or located within 1 cm range from the sites of invasive cortical mapping; language MSI dipoles were located in the sulcus overlapped by cortical mapping on surface. There were no non-predicted neurological deficits after resective surgery in 28 patients. One patient did not experience resection due to the overlapping of motor cortex and epileptogenic focus. Conclusions: Functional brain mapping with MSI is an accurate tool to localize brain function for surgical planning. Using MSI information properly may reduce the number of invasive brain mapping procedures. 1 Chad Carlson, 3 Catherine Schevon, 4 Jeff Stout, 1 Siddhartha Nadkarni, 2 Werner Doyle, 2 Howard Weiner, 1 Steven Pacia, 1,2 Orrin Devinsky, and 1 Ruben Kuzniecky ( 1 Neurology, New York University, New York, NY ; 2 Neurosurgery, New York University, New York, NY ; 3 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 4 New York MEG, New York, NY ) Rationale: The lateralization and localization of partial seizures, particularly in extratemporal epilepsy syndromes, remains difficult despite improved diagnostic imaging and electroencephalographic techniques. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) is increasingly employed in the presurgical evaluation. This study retrospectively examines the positive predictive value (PPV) of MSI for lateralizing the epileptogenic zone. Methods: All epilepsy surgical cases performed after the availability of MSI (4-D Neuroimaging, equivalent current source dipole localization) at our center were identified. 163 surgeries in 152 patients were performed. 73 patients had a diagnostic pre-operative MSI. Results were available to the epilepsy team prior to surgery; however the MSI results did not directly affect the resection. We compared MSI lateralization to the ICEEG lateralization and resection. These results were reviewed in the context of the surgical outcome for patients with more than six months of post-surgical follow-up. Results: 12 of the 73 patients did not have resections due to non-lateralizable or non-localizable seizures or because their implants were diagnostic bilateral strip surveys. 30 patients had resections limited to the temporal lobe (4 with focal tumors). 3 patients had frontal tumors. 10 patients had multi-focal lesions secondary to tuberous sclerosis complex. The MSI was normal in 9 patients. Of those with an abnormal MSI, 39 had unilateral abnormalities ipsilateral to the resection and 6 had abnormalities limited to the contralateral hemisphere. 19 patients had bilateral findings, with 10 demonstrating a clear predominance ipsilateral to the resection. 40/61 patients undergoing resections had six or more months of follow-up. The PPV for MSI lateralization is shown in the table below. Positive Predictive Value of MSI for Lateralization of Epileptic Foci Number of Patients PPV PPV + Bilateral All Patients 73 61% ?77% Engel I Outcome 25/40 77% ?91% Engel II Outcome ?5/40 75% 100% Engel III Outcome ?6/40 67% ?67% Engel IV Outcome ?4/40 75% ?75% Engel II-I VOutcomes 15/40 71% ?78% PPV = Positive Predictive Value. PPV + Bilateral = Positive Predictive Value including patients with bilateral localizations with a predominance to the side of resection. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis demonstrates both the validity of MSI for lateralizing the epileptogenic zone as well as the method's limitations; the specificity of the MSI technique for predicting the epileptogenic zone cannot exceed its ability to lateralize correctly. Thus, clinicians should interpret the MSI in the context of other presurgical studies, rather than rely on it as an independent predictor of the epileptogenic zone. (Supported by FACES.) 1 Gregory L.

Methods: Subjects were 18?65 years with intractable partial-onset seizures and localized epileptogenic onset region(s). Subjects with ≥12 simple partial (SP) sensory or motor seizures, complex partial seizures (CPS) or generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures over an 84-day baseline period qualified for implant. The RNS was connected to up to 2 leads (subdural and/or depth), which were targeted to the seizure focus. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the trial. Efficacy was assessed during two time periods, the 84-day period beginning 28 days post-implant (primary) and the most recent 84 days for which a subject could have received therapy (secondary). Results: During the primary evaluation period, the responder rate (≥50% reduction in seizures) in 50 subjects (excluding 1 subject with no disabling seizures at baseline and 14 subjects blinded off) was 32% for CPS (n = 44), 63% for GTC (n = 16), and 26% (n = 50) for total disabling seizures (TDS) (SP motor, CPS and GTC). The median percentage reduction in seizure frequency was: CPS 27%, GTC 59% and TDS 29%; seizure reduction was significant for CPS (p < 0.05) and TDS (p < 0.001) (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). For the secondary evaluation period, as of 4/28/06, the responder rate for 62 subjects (excluding 1 subject with no disabling seizures at baseline and 2 subjects previously blinded off with fewer than 84-days of therapy on) was 40% for CPS (n = 52), 55% for GTC (n = 22), and 41% for TDS (n = 61). The median percentage reduction was: CPS 34%, GTC 66% and TDS 35%, and seizure reduction was significant for CPS (p < 0.05), GTC (p < 0.005), and TDS (p < 0.001). In 65 implanted subjects (including 17 device replacements) representing 65 patient years, there were no serious unanticipated device-related AEs, and responsive neurostimulation was well tolerated. Conclusions: An investigation of the RNS? system demonstrated safety and a sustained reduction in CPS, GTC and TDS events. Preliminary results indicated that the RNS? system may provide a safe and effective treatment for adults with intractable partial-onset epilepsy. (Supported by NeuroPace, Inc.) 1 Angela Y.

Kissela ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Department of Veteran's Affairs, Fresno, CA ) Rationale: Stroke-related seizures are frequently defined as early (within 2 weeks after stroke) and late. The incidence of early and late seizures is relatively well established. The incidence of acute seizures (≤24 hours after stroke) is unknown. In this population-based study, we aimed to establish the incidence of acute post-stroke seizures in a biracial cohort. We also sought to determine if there were any differences between race, stroke subtype, and stroke localization. Methods: All stroke cases between 7/93?6/94 within the population of the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan region were identified by review of all primary and secondary stroke diagnoses (ICD-9 codes 430?436) from 19 local acute-care hospitals, outpatient clinics, autopsy cases, and death certificates. Clinical and demographic data was collected by study nurses and subsequently reviewed by study physicians. The presence of seizures in the 24 hours after stroke symptom onset was obtained through additional record review; patients with a prior history of seizure were excluded. All available neuroimaging performed at the time of stroke was reviewed by study physicians. Variable Seizure No Seizure p-value Age (years) 67.0 ± 20.3 71.6 ± 13.0 0.01? Gender (male) 53 (43.4%) 1241 (44.2%) 0.88? Race (black) 18 (14.8%) ?473 (16.8%) 0.55? Hypertension 70 (57.4%) 1744 (62.1%) 0.30? Heart Disease 48 (39.3%) 1149 (40.9%) 0.73?

Initial GCS 12 (3, 14) ??15 (14, 15) <0.0001 Initial Rankin ?0 (0, 3) ???0 (0, 3) 0.54? 30-day Mortality 35 (28.7%) ?361 (12.8%) <0.0001 Hemorrhagic Stroke 39 (32.0%) ?295 (10.5%) <0.0001 Data analyzed using logistic regression model Results: We identified 2932 strokes who had no prior history of seizures, of which 122 (4.2%) had seizures within the first 24 hours of stroke onset. Of ICH/SAH patients, 11.4% had a seizure within the first 24 hours of stroke onset (p ≤ 0.0001 vs. all stroke). In ischemic stroke, we observed a trend towards seizures being more common with cardioembolic stroke vs. all other ischemic stroke subtypes (4.5% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.07). There was a higher mortality rate in patients who developed stroke-related acute seizures. See table for additional detail. Conclusions: The overall rate of epileptic seizures within the first 24 hours of stroke onset is 4.2%. Risk factors for developing seizure activity include younger age, lower initial GCS score, and hemorrhagic stroke (ICH/SAH). Patients with stroke-related acute seizures have a higher 30-day mortality than patients without seizures. This may be related to a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in this group. 1,2,3 N.

Pohlmann-Eden ( 1 Universitaetsklinikum Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany ; 2 Mara Hospital, Bethel Epilepsy Centre Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany ; and 3 Krembil Neuroscience Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada ) Rationale: To identify the best predictors of postoperative verbal memory decline in patients undergoing left temporal lobe excisions for epilepsy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out using data from 59 patients with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent en-bloc resection. Memory was measured by a standard word list-learning task (z-score for total number of words over 5 trials) administered before and after surgery. A new rating was devised for the MR images, to characterize the extent of hippocampal damage. Atrophy and signal change of the hippocampus were examined separately. Both changes were assessed on a scale: 0 = no change 1 = moderate atrophy/signal change, 2 = severe atrophy/signal change. The average of these two factors was calculated to classify the degree (range 0 to 2) of mesiotemporal sclerosis (MTS). The Wada results included number of correctly identified items after ipsilateral injection and contralateral injection (pass/fail boundary: 67%), as well as an asymmetry score. In various multiple regression analyses, Wada test scores (injection ipsilateral, injection contralateral, asymmetry score), neuropsychological test scores before surgery, MRI scores (atrophy, increased signal change, MTS) and further risk factors such as age of onset were entered as the independent variables. The difference in the verbal memory test was the dependent variable. Results: After surgery, 35% of the patients showed a memory decline indicated by a z-score loss of more than one point. The regression analyses revealed that the pre-operative memory test score was the strongest predictor of memory change (p < 0.05, adjusted R Square = 0.341). Higher preoperative performance in the verbal memory task was associated with a greater risk of verbal memory decline after surgery. The second significant predictor was the MTS classification (p < 0.05, adjusted R Square = 0.428). Greater damage to the hippocampus was associated with less decline following surgery. None of the other variables, including the Wada results and other risk factors, were significant predictors of memory outcome. Conclusions: The Wada test results did add to the prediction of verbal memory decline in this sample of patients in whom temporal lobe resection was considered safe with regard to the risk of amnesia (i.e., adequate memory functioning following ipsilesional injection compared to contralesional injection). Thus, the clinical data obtained routinely before surgery seems to be sufficient to predict risk of memory decline in the majority of TLE patients. However, our findings do not refute the usefulness of the Wada test for excluding from surgery those patients who are at risk for amnesia after temporal lobe resection. 1 Cigdem I.

Methods: Sixteen non-surgical patients had a repeat brain MRI with a mean interval of 3.7 years and 16 post-surgical patients had two postoperative MRI scans with a mean interval of 4.8 years. We measured ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal volumes (IHV and CHV) in the non-surgical group and CHV in the postsurgical group. Hippocampal shape deformity analysis (HSDA) was also performed in each group. Results: In non-surgical patients, both IHV and CHV decreased significantly between the two scans (7.3 ± 5.7%, p < 0.001 and 2.5 ± 2.6%, p = 0.002). Moreover, IHV percent decreases were significantly correlated with the number of total seizures between the two scans (r = 0.57, p = 0.02). HSDA also showed inward deformities in both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi in non-surgical patients (uncorrected p < 0.05). In post-surgical patients, mean CHV (2481.1 ± 364.9 mm3) for first postsurgical scans was not significantly different from mean CHV (2480.4 ± 316.1 mm3) for second scans. Total seizure numbers during the year before surgery were negatively correlated with CHV losses between the two postsurgical scans (r =?0.72, p = 0.002). HSDA of contralateral hippocampi between the two postsurgical scans mainly showed outward deformities in head, body and tail but small inward deformities in tail. Conclusions: These results suggest that recurrent seizures induce progressive atrophy in both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi, but that a seizure-free state after the resection of an epileptic focus prevents longitudinal volume loss of the contralateral hippocampus and may facilitate a partial volume increase.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training results in improved mitochondrial efficiency but it is unclear if dietary selenium level can further modify mitochondrial function. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and exercise training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At week 14, all horses underwent a 2?hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Permeabilized muscle fibers obtained from the gluteus medius of horses at rest were analysed for mitochondrial function via high resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity with Complex I substrates was determined using the respiratory control ratio (RCR) of state 3 (with ADP) and state 2 (without ADP; leak respiration). Electron transport system capacity (ETSC) was determined by uncoupling phosphorylation and respiration using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS) activities were assessed in resting muscle samples obtained at week 0 and 14, and in response to the SET. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA. Results Leak, state 3, ETSC, CS and CCO were higher (P<0.05) at wk 14 compared to wk 0 in all horses, but were not affected by training or Se level. Additionally, CS and CCO were unaffected by the SET. Conclusions Mitochondrial number (CS activity) and efficiency were unaffected by training and dietary Se level, but did increase over time, perhaps due to growth of horses. A more strenuous training protocol may be needed to induce mitochondrial adaptations.

AB  - Introduction The study aim was to determine whether there is a link between pelvic misalignment and uneven forelimb hoof size. Previous research suggests that increased loading increases hoof size, but correlation with pelvic misalignment is unknown. Methods 30 healthy, sound, multidiscipline horses, regularly shod/trimmed every 6 weeks, were assessed. Tuber coxae heights were measured in triplicate from the dorsal aspect to ground level, with the horse standing square, using a plumb line and measuring stick. Difference between means indicated value and direction of pelvic misalignment. Using a 300?mm digital vernier calliper, triplicate measurements of hoof width (lateral to medial edge) and hoof length (dorsal to palmar edge) were made of both fore-feet, prior to and after farrier trimming, and were obtained by the farrier (blinded to pelvic measurements) at two shoeing intervals 6 weeks apart. Both methods were tested for reliability and repeatability to ±?1?mm. Statistical analyses included Chi-square, symmetry indices and one-way ANOVA. Results Ventral pelvic rotation was related to greater growth in hoof width on the contralateral forelimb and greater growth in hoof length on the ipsilateral forelimb. There was a significant relationship between uneven hoof width and pelvic rotation direction (P?=?0.0002), and a significant relationship between uneven hoof length and pelvic rotation directional (P?=?6.1?x?10-7). There was a significant relationship between amount of growth in hoof width (P?=?0.0002) and hoof length (P?=?4.8?x?10-6) with pelvic misalignment. Conclusions This study provides evidence of a statistically significant relationship between the alignment of the pelvis and growth of horse's front hooves. Further study would be beneficial in enhancing understanding of the chain of compensatory effects on the equine body.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Lower airway diseases are common problems in sports and racing horses. In humans, exercise causes increased susceptibility to respiratory infections associated with down-regulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules. Because numerous cell types are implicated in important defense mechanisms against airborne infections, we aimed to assess the effect of training on innate immune responses of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC) and blood monocytes. Methods PAM, EBEC and monocytes were collected at rest and after a standardized exercise test (SET) from eight untrained, trained and deconditioned horses. We compared their respective expression of TLR1-9 by qPCR and their cytokinic responses following exposure to various TLR ligands by ELISA. Data were reported as least square means and analyzed by a global linear mixed model. Results The mRNA expression of TLR3 was down-regulated by training in PAM (P<0.0001) and monocytes (P<0.015), whereas the mRNA expression of TLR4 was up-regulated in monocytes (P?=?0.0004) only. Monocytes stimulated with TLR2- and TLR4-ligands showed increased cytokine secretion after training and deconditioning (P<0.025). EBEC from trained horses produced less TNF-alpha (P<0.05) after treatment with ligands of TLR2 and TLR3 compared with EBEC from untrained horses. The production of TNF-alpha (P<0.001) and IFN-beta (P<0.001) in non-stimulated and stimulated PAM was decreased in trained and deconditioned horses. Conclusions The impaired cytokine production in PAM and EBEC after a training period might explain the increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and is associated with the activation of cells at the systemic level.

AB  - Introduction The aims of the study were to monitor fitness level of young Friesian horses and to assess whether fitness data has a predictive value for the final performance score and whether familial aggregation of response to training could be detected. Methods Sixty-six young Friesian horses, offspring of six different stallions (A, B, C, D, E and F), underwent a 7-week performance test. Horses were given a performance score for their dressage ability (0?110 points), and fitness was evaluated with standardised-exercise-tests (SET) at the beginning (SET-I) and the end (SET-II) of the period. Heart rate (HR; beats/min) was measured in both SET, and plasma lactate concentration (LA; mmol/L) was measured only in SET-II. The majority of data were analyzed with an ANOVA-test or a linear-model (P<0.05). Results Fitness of horses improved significantly between SET-I and II (P?=?0.015). There was a large heterogeneity in responsiveness to training; some horses were high-responders, whereas others were non- or low-responders. There was a familial aggregation of HRcanter-1 response to training (P?=?0.039); offspring of stallion C decreased significantly more in HR than offspring of stallions A (P?=?0.09), D (P?=?0.013) and F (P?=?0.009). HR had no predictive value for the performance score, but horses that did not reach the anaerobic threshold in SET-II scored significantly better (73.8?±?5.6 points) than horses that did (69.9?±?5.9 points, P?=?0.025). Conclusions The present study reports, for the first time in the horse, familial aggregation of HR-response to training. HR could not predict final performance score, but LA-concentrations during SET-II were predictive. Ethical Animal Research Consent was obtained from the owners of all horses.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to determine if yearlings would have higher oxidative stress and lower antioxidant status than mature mares after a single bout of intense exercise before and after training. Methods Seven Standardbred yearling fillies (18?±?2.4?mo) and seven mares (13?±?2.1?yr) ran a repeated sprints exercise test before (RSET1) and after (RSET2) an 8-wk training protocol. Blood samples and middle gluteal muscle samples were taken before and after exercise, and throughout recovery. Data is presented as mean?±?SE and all analyses were done in the context of a linear mixed model with random intercepts for horse. Results In RSET1, mares had higher plasma malondialdehyde than the yearlings (P<0.05), but the yearlings had higher muscle malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, erythrocyte total glutathione and glutathione peroxidase (P<0.05). In RSET2, yearlings had higher plasma nitric oxide than the mares (P<0.05). In RSET2, the mares had lower plasma malondialdehyde, and higher muscle malondialdehyde, total glutathione and nitric oxide as compared to RSET1 (P<0.05). The yearlings in RSET2 had higher muscle nitric oxide and lower erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase than in RSET1 (P<0.05). Plasma cortisol, creatine kinase and muscle glutathione peroxidase had little difference with age or training. Conclusions Prior to training, the yearlings had lower lipid peroxidation and higher antioxidants than the mares. Training reduced oxidative stress and improved antioxidant status in the mares, while few effects of training were seen in the yearlings. This suggests that age is an important defense against exercise-induced oxidative stress. Ethical Animal Research Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Review Board approved the study.

AB  - Introduction In equestrian sports where horses exercise at submaximal levels, the identification of some clinical conditions leading to poor performance can remain difficult. The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease. Ethical Animal Research This study was based on clinical cases referred to the Equine Sports Medicine Practice. Horse owners referred their horses and consented to all procedures described.

AB  - Introduction Arabian horses have the best records in long distance endurance racing (80?160?km). The endurance horses are interesting models to calculate the heritability (h2) of exercise ability. Heritability indicates the percentage of trait transmitted by parents to their descendants (h2?=?Genetic variance/Total variance). In human athletes, heritability of physiological traits calculated using twin design were 0.12, 0.72 and 0.32 for VO2max, Heart Rate max and endurance capacity respectively. Heritabilities of 0.28 and 0.06 for speed and placing respectively are reported in endurance horses. The aim of this study was to calculate the heritability of recovery heart rate, cardiac recovery time and average speed in long distance endurance racing. Methods The results of 132 endurance races (80?160?km) from 2007 to 2011 were analyzed. The database included 4421 horses of known pedigrees representing 655 sires with a mean of 18.5 products per sire. The data were analyzed using Restricted Estimator of Maximal Likelihood (REML, VCE6) method with animal mixed model including country, ride distance, age, gender, common environment as fixed effects and animal genetic as random effect. Results Heritabilities (SE) were 0.12 (0.06), 0.15 (0.02) and 0.46 (0.08) for speed, recovery heart rate and cardiac recovery time respectively. Conclusions The speed and heart rate recovery seem more influenced by training and environmental effects than the cardiac recovery time which is more influenced by genetics. This high heritability is consistent with heritability of V200 found in French Trotter population previously and may indicate a putative quantitative trait linkage.
