AB  - A previous donor intervention trial found that therapeutic hypothermia reduced delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation. This retrospective cohort study nested in the randomized dopamine trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT000115115) investigates the effects of spontaneous donor hypothermia (core body temperature <36°C) on initial kidney graft function, and evaluates 5-year graft survival. Hypothermia assessed by a singular measurement in the intensive care unit 4-20 hours before procurement was associated with less DGF after kidney transplantation (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.91). The benefit was greater when need for more than a single posttransplant dialysis session was analyzed (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.28-0.82). Donor dopamine ameliorated dialysis requirement independently from hypothermia in a temporal relationship with exposure (OR 0.93, 95%CI 0.87-0.98, per hour). A lower core body temperature in the donor was associated with lower serum creatinine levels before procurement, which may reflect lower systemic inflammation and attenuated renal injury from brain death. Despite a considerable effect on DGF, our study failed to demonstrate a graft survival advantage (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.54-1.27), whereas dopamine treatment was associated with improved long-term outcome (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99 per hour).

AB  - Summary Objective: To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of amikacin in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and to analyse whether these patients show different kinetic behaviour on the basis of their clinical diagnoses. Method: The patient population comprised 104 medical ICU patients on amikacin treatment for several presumed or documented Gram-negative infections. Four study groups were defined according to patients' clinical diagnosis: sepsis group (n= 39), trauma group (n= 20), pneumonia group (n= 21) and ?other diagnosis? group (n= 24). The pharmacokinetic parameters for amikacin in these patients were then compared. Results: The ICU patients were found to have increased values for the amikacin volume of distribution (0.52 ± 0.21 litres/kg), whereas total amikacin clearance expressed as a linear function of creatinine clearance was Cl (ml/min/kg)= 0.13 ± 0.86 ClCR which is not significantly different from other estimations reported in the literature. However, this relationship revealed statistically significant differences among the four groups of ICU patients. Moreover, the septic and trauma patients showed higher (but not statistically significant) values for the amikacin volume of distribution. Conclusion: The amikacin pharmacokinetic parameters obtained should allow Bayesian individualization of amikacin doses in patients admitted to medical ICUs, on the basis of their clinical diagnoses.

AB  - Abstract This study tested the hypothesis that activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) contributes towards the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in the mouse. The effects of LPS on plasma glucose, biochemical markers of hepatic, renal and pancreatic exocrine function and lung content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were examined in homozygous PAR-2 knockout mice (PAR-2 -/-) and genetically equivalent, homozygous PAR-2 +/+ mice. The effect of LPS was also examined in normal mice receiving dexamethasone (10 mg kg?1, i.p.) or saline as a positive control. At six hours after intraperitoneal injection, LPS (40 mg kg?1) produced an increase in rectal temperature, hypoglycaemia and elevations in serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and lipase, as well as an increase in lung MPO content. Dexamethasone treatment reduced LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and elevation of serum ALT concentrations but did not modify elevations in serum creatinine and lipase concentrations or the increase in lung MPO content. The changes in serum concentrations of glucose, ALT, creatinine and lipase produced by LPS in PAR-2 -/- mice were not different from those seen in wild-type or PAR-2 +/+ mice. These data suggest that activation of PAR-2 may not play a pivotal role in LPS-induced multi-organ dysfunction.

AB  - Liver transplantation (LT) with donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors has been associated with a high rate of ischemic-type biliary strictures (ITBSs) and inferior graft survival. To investigate the impact of an intraoperative tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on outcomes following DCD LT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of DCD LT at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) and the Ochsner Medical Center (OMC). Between 2009 and 2013, 85 DCD LTs were performed with an intraoperative tPA injection (n?=?30 at TGH, n?=?55 at OMC), and they were compared with 33 DCD LTs without a tPA. Donor and recipient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion requirement (3.2?±?3.4 versus 3.1?±?2.3 U, P?=?0.74). Overall, biliary strictures occurred less commonly in the tPA-treated group (16.5% versus 33.3%, P?=?0.07) with a much lower rate of diffuse intrahepatic strictures (3.5% versus 21.2%, P?=?0.005). After 1 and 3 years, the tPA group versus the non-tPA group had superior patient survival (97.6% versus 87.0% and 92.7% versus 79.7%, P?=?0.016) and graft survival (96.4% versus 69.7% and 90.2% versus 63.6%, P?<?0.001). In conclusion, a tPA injection into the hepatic artery during DCD LT reduces ITBSs and improves graft and patient survival without increasing the risk for bleeding.

AB  - Abstract:? Introduction:? To assess the efficacy of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free immunosuppression vs. calcineurin-based immunosuppression in patients receiving expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys. Patient and methods:? Thirteen recipients of ECD kidneys were enrolled in this pilot study and treated with induction therapy and maintained on sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone. A contemporaneous control group was randomly selected comprised of 13 recipients of ECD kidneys who had been maintained on CNI plus MMF and prednisone. Results:? For the study group vs. the control group, two-yr graft survival was 92.3% vs. 84.6% (p?=?NS), two-yr patient survival was 100% vs. 92.3% (p?=?NS) and the acute rejection rates were 23% vs. 31% (p?=?NS), respectively. Renal function was significantly better in the study group compared with control up to the six-month mark, after which, it remained numerically but not statistically significant. Complications were more common in the study group, but serious adverse events requiring discontinuation were rare. Conclusion:? This pilot study demonstrates that CNI-free regimens can be safely implemented in patients receiving ECD kidneys with excellent two-yr patient and graft survival and good renal allograft function. Longer follow-up in larger randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish these findings.

AB  - Summary The paramount aim of predictive toxicology in drug discovery and development is to assess the safety of drugs for use in humans. This chapter presents drug induced kidney injury as an example to illustrate the value and limitations of novel biomarkers by providing an overview of their (patho) physiological role and mechanistic link to toxicity, performance in experimental toxicity studies, approval by regulatory bodies, and application to preclinical decision making. Traditional markers of renal function such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are inherently insensitive as they indicate kidney injury only when large amounts of the renal epithelium have been lost. The most widely studied urinary kidney biomarker is kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM-1) encoded by the gene Havr1 (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1). Advances in science and technology (e.g., microRNAs, next-generation sequencing) may also offer unique opportunities for the discovery of predictive biomarkers.

AB  - Summary Nonheart beating donation (NHBD) of the liver is a relatively new potential source of grafts. Guidelines to indications and contraindications to donation from controlled nonheart beating donors are still being formulated. We report a successful case of transplantation of a liver from a controlled nonheart beating donor who sustained significant injuries following a road traffic accident. Emergency laparotomy with peri-hepatic packing was performed to control haemorrhage from lacerations in segments VI and VII. Forceful packing resulted in an area of focal ischaemia in segment VI. Trauma to the liver should not be considered an absolute contraindication to controlled NHBD.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012 Abstract Background? This study tested the hypothesis that surgical stress and the host response to this trauma trigger an inflammatory cascade in which the neutrophil plays a central role. We hypothesised that pre-operative neutrophil migratory responses will correlate with post-operative clinical outcome in our shock model of open-heart surgery patients. We also tested the hypothesis that surface expression of adhesion molecules involved in the migratory process ? CD11b, CD47 and CD99 ? could be used to predict outcome. We believe that combining neutrophil migratory response, CD11b, CD47 and CD99 with the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) will strengthen the power of the EuroSCORE not only in predicting post-operative mortality but also other clinical endpoints. Materials and methods? Neutrophils were isolated pre-operatively from n?=?31 patients undergoing open-heart surgery and allowed to migrate across endothelial monolayers in response to N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP). Isolated neutrophils were also assessed for surface expression of CD11b, CD47 and CD99 in response to fMLP by flow cytometry. Post-operative clinical parameters collected included days 1?5 white cell count and creatinine levels as well as intensive care unit (ICU) and post-operative hospital stay. Results? Pre-operative surface expression of CD99 and CD47 correlates with post-operative creatinine levels (P?<?0·05), a measurement of renal injury. We also show that while the logistic EuroSCORE alone can be used as a predictor of ICU stay, when combined with pre-operative CD99 surface expression, it improves its AUC value (0·794). Conclusion? Immunological markers, specifically the ability of the neutrophil to migrate, combined with the logistic EuroSCORE lead to improved sensitivity and specificity to predict patient outcome.

AB  - Abstract:? First described in the 1500s, scurvy is infrequently seen in industrialized countries today, although vulnerable patient groups remain. A 15-yr-old girl underwent liver transplantation at age 26?months for a primary diagnosis of biliary hypoplasia, and subsequently developed late allograft failure and progressive renal insufficiency culminating in listing for combined liver retransplantation and kidney transplantation at age 13?yr. She required regular hemodialysis treatment for 12?months prior to deceased donor organ availability, with a complicated clinical course including recurrent septic episodes and severe cachexia. Ten months after initiation of hemodialysis, she presented with severe bone pain, purpura, ecchymoses, gingival hyperplasia, mucosal bleeding, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Serial serum ascorbic acid levels were found to be extremely low (<10??mol/L) despite routine supplementation both in her dialysate and via regular oral supplementation. Histopathology from skin biopsy revealed purpura, hyper- and parakeratosis, and follicular plugging. She had ECG and 2D echocardiogram disturbances, as well as osteopenia and sclerosis of the extremities on radiological evaluations. Therapy with high-dose ascorbic acid (1?g/day orally) led to complete resolution of skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of awareness and recognition of this historic diagnosis, and particularly in children with end-stage organ disease with severely compromised nutrition.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Summary The prevalence of underlying renal disease in pregnancy is estimated to be as high as 3%. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal death are increased. Although data are limited, current evidence indicates that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy serum creatinine is the best predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes are progressively worse with higher stages of chronic kidney disease. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize the well-being of both patients: the mother and her fetus. Pregnancies complicated by dialysis and renal transplant warrant special considerations. Effective contraception and evidence-based preconception counseling are important.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: F2-isoprostanes have been used extensively to quantify lipid peroxidation in association with risk factors in various diseases. Horses with colic may have intestinal ischaemia and/or inflammation characterised by oxidative stress and increased production of isoprostanes. Objectives: To gather preliminary data regarding the feasibility of using urine F2-isoprostanes and isoprostane metabolites as early screening tools for the presence of gastrointestinal disease requiring surgical intervention in horses and ultimately develop a stall-side test capable of identifying these horses as early as possible for timely referral. Methods: Concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were determined by mass spectroscopy and normalised to urine creatinine (Cr) concentrations in urine samples from 42 healthy control horses and 43 horses with gastrointestinal pain or colic. Results: Horses with colic were treated medically (n = 21) or surgically (n = 22). Mean ± s.d. concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were significantly higher in horses with colic (2.94 ± 1.69 and 0.31 ± 0.22?ng/mg Cr, respectively), compared to control horses (1.89 ± 1.39 and 0.22 ± 0.08?ng/mg Cr, respectively). Mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations were significantly higher in horses undergoing surgery (0.38 ± 0.28?ng/mg Cr) compared to controls and medical colics (0.26 ± 0.11?ng/mg Cr). Nonsurvivors had significantly higher mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations (0.47 ± 0.39?ng/mg Cr) than control or surviving colic horses (0.29 ± 0.24?ng/mg Cr). Conclusions: Measurement of urine isoprostane metabolite concentration may be a useful prognostic indicator in equine colic. Potential relevance: Urine isoprostane metabolites may aid in early recognition of surgical colic. Isoprostanes are a potential therapeutic target to prevent further systemic and gastrointestinal tissue injury in horses with colic.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sporadic measurement of serum triglycerides in depressed and inappetant clinically ill horses revealed severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible evidence of lipaemia on several occasions, leading to the inclusion of serum triglyceride concentrations in the routine serum biochemistry evaluation of our hospital. Since then, more cases have been identified and treated for hypertriglyceridaemia, raising questions about the prevalence, predisposing factors and significance of these findings. Hypotheses: 1) Severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible opacity of the serum occurs more commonly in clinically ill and inappetant horses than previously described and 2) appropriate treatment using i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition would decrease serum triglycerides to normal limits and might result in improved appetite and attitude of the patient. Methods: The laboratory computer database from 2000 and 2001 was searched for increased serum triglycerides (>5.65 mmol/l) in any horse breed, ponies and miniature breeds excluded. Data analysed included subject details, diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, treatment, response to treatment and outcome. Results: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in 13 horses, with serum triglyceride concentrations 6.17?18.29 mmol/l, while none showed visible lipaemia. All horses had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and all but one had an increased serum creatinine concentration. Treatment with i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition resulted in decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Conclusions: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in inappetant and clinically ill horses without evidence of serum opacity more commonly than previously described. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose horses to hypertriglyceridaemia, while the increased creatinine concentration might be a predisposing factor or result of the condition. Horses identified in our study readily responded to treatment and appetite and attitude improved coincident with decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Potential relevance: Hypertriglyceridaemia could perpetuate inappetance and depression in clinically ill horses and potentially predispose to fatty infiltration of the liver and other organ systems.

AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the point prevalence of proteinuria in dogs presenting to the University of Georgia Oncology Service for the first time. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 60 client-owned dogs with a confirmed cancer diagnosis were included but those with lower urinary tract neoplasia were excluded. Each dog's signalment, cancer diagnosis, previous cancer treatments, current medications and travel history were recorded. Renal values, electrolytes, packed cell volume, total solids, systolic blood pressure, urinalysis, urine protein:urine creatinine and retinal examinations were recorded. Non-proteinuric, borderline proteinuria and overt proteinuria were defined as urine protein:urine creatinine <0·2, ≥0·2 but <0·5, and ≥0·5, respectively. Urine culture was performed in dogs with active urine sediments or overt proteinuria. Results Twenty-nine dogs were non-proteinuric (48·3%), 22 (36·7%) borderline proteinuric and nine (15%) overtly proteinuric. None were azotaemic. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) was detected in 18 (30%) dogs. Of these, six were non-proteinuric, nine borderline proteinuric, and three overtly proteinuric. Proteinuria was detected in 51% of dogs presented to our oncology service, the majority of which were classified as borderline. Clinical Significance The high proportion of proteinuria in dogs in this study suggests that screening for proteinuria in dogs with cancer may be prudent. Larger studies are required to correlate specific cancer types and the impact of treatment with the development, magnitude and persistence of proteinuria.

AB  - Acta Ophthalmol. 2010: 88: e259?e264 Abstract. Purpose:? To investigate the amount of systemic oxidative stress-related DNA damage and serum total antioxidant status of patients with normal-tension glaucoma compared with healthy controls. Methods:? Forty-three patients with normal-tension glaucoma selected from 60 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with primary open-angle glaucoma were enrolled. Each patient?s intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured seven times over a 24-hour period. Those whose highest IOP was over 21?mmHg were excluded. Forty control subjects were recruited. The serum total antioxidant status was assessed colorimetrically by its ability to reduce the generation of the radical cation ABTS (2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate). The urinary 8-hydroxy-2?-deoxyguanosine was measured as a marker of oxidative DNA damage and normalized to creatinine. The results were compared between healthy subjects and patients with normal-tension glaucoma. Results:? The control and normal-tension glaucoma groups did now show significant differences for age, gender, serum fructosamine, cholesterol and triglyceride levels; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index; and prevalence of hypertension. The serum total antioxidant status was significantly higher (p?=?0.01) and the urinary 8-hydroxy-2?-deoxyguanosine/creatinine level significantly lower (p?=?0.03) in the patients with normal-tension glaucoma compared with the controls. Even after we adjusted the data for independent variables, the incidence of normal-tension glaucoma was significantly correlated with high serum total antioxidant levels (p?=?0.03; odds ratio, 1.007; 95% confidence interval, 1.001?1.013) and low urinary 8-hydroxy-2?-deoxyguanosine/creatinine (p?=?0.02; odds ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.61?0.96). Conclusions:? Increased serum total antioxidant and decreased 8-hydroxy-2?-deoxyguanosine may reflect compensatory alterations in response to increased systemic oxidative stress in patients with normal-tension glaucoma.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Adverse effects on renal health and haemostasis have been documented in human patients administered hydroxyethyl starches (HES). Gelatins could provide useful substitutes for HES should similar adverse effects be identified in horses. Objectives To compare the effects of a 4% modified fluid gelatin (MFG) with a 130/0.4 6% tetrastarch (TES) on haemodilution, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), haemostasis and renal parameters in healthy ponies. Study design Randomised crossover. Methods Three treatments (A?=?10?ml/kg bwt TES, B?=?10?ml/kg bwt MFG and C?=?20?ml/kg bwt MFG) were administered to 6 healthy ponies with a one-week washout period. Packed cell volume (PCV), total serum protein (TSP), COP, platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thromboelastography (TEG) were measured at baseline and at multiple time points up to 24?h post infusion. Serum creatinine, urine specific gravity (USG), urine protein:creatinine (UPC), urine GGT:creatinine (UGC) and urine sediment examination (USE) were performed before and 24?h after each treatment, and one week after the final treatment. Results All treatments caused significant haemodilution and increases in COP with treatment C having a significantly greater effect on PCV than other treatments. The platelet count decreased with all treatments and was significantly lower for treatment C compared with treatment B. No significant differences were observed in any TEG parameter within or between treatments. No significant differences in PT, aPTT or fibrinogen were observed between treatments. Serum creatinine, UGC and UPC did not change significantly pre- and post study. USG and USE remained within normal limits. Conclusions 4% MFG could be considered as an alternative to 130/0.4 6% TES for volume expansion and oncotic support. Neither MFG nor TES were associated with clinically significant adverse effects on haemostasis or renal parameters. Ethical animal research:?This research was approved by the University of Pretoria's Animal Ethics Committee. The animals used in the study were part of a research herd belonging to The University of Pretoria. Sources of funding:?The Department of Companion Animal Clinical Studies, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, The Abe Bailey Trust Fund, The South African Veterinary Foundation and The South African Equine Veterinary Association. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract Critically ill patients, not infrequently present alterations of physiological parameters that determine the success/failure of therapeutic interventions as well as the final outcome. Sepsis and polytrauma are two of the most common and complex syndromes occurring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and affect drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and elimination. Pharmacological management of ICU patients requires consideration of the unique pharmacokinetics associated with these clinical conditions and the likely occurrence of drug interaction. Rational adjustment in drug choice and dosing contributes to the appropriateness of treatment of those patients.
