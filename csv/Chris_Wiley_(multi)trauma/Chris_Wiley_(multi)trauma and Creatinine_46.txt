AB  - Nutrition support is recognized as an important cofactor in altering morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients. Paramount in delivering proper nutrition support is the accurate determination of baseline metabolic and nutritional status, thus influencing necessary protein requirements. After nutritional intervention, routine laboratory monitoring is used to measure the efficacy and to reassess metabolic stress level. Accurate determination of nitrogen excretion (and nitrogen balance) remains the standard in prescribing and monitoring the protein and nutritional treatment regimen. This article examines nitrogen excretion determinations in the clinical setting, including proper collection techniques, laboratory measurements, and analyses and their effect upon nitrogen balance studies.

AB  - Summary Nursing cats and dogs will benefit from ongoing analgesia post-cesarean, or to manage post-surgical or traumatic pain or inflammatory illness. It is hoped that future studies investigating the commonly prescribed analgesics, including the secretion of analgesics in milk of lactating dogs and cats, will be undertaken to offer guidance in managing this group of animals. An alternative, or as post-operative analgesia a fentanyl, continuous rate infusion (CRI), with careful titration to a minimal effective dose, is suggested for cats and dogs. A clinical interpretation of analgesia may be due to behavioural changes and sedation produced by serotonin re-uptake inhibition. Anesthesia and analgesia protocols should be designed based on the health status of the dam/queen, the procedural need and the expected pain level. Alpha2 agonists are commonly administered to cows and mares without apparent effect on the neonatal calf or foal, but the effects may be different in puppies and kittens.

AB  - As a major cause of renal failure, transient renal ischemia and reperfusion induce both acute kidney injury and late fibrosis, which are the common pathological manifestations of end-stage renal disease. Curcumin is a biologically active polyphenolic compound found in turmeric. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that curcumin has a protective action against renal fibrosis, whereas mechanisms underlying the anti-fibrosis role of curcumin remain poorly defined. Here, we found that APPL1, an important intracellular binding partner for AdipoR, was involved in the pathogenesis of acute injury or fibrosis and was significantly upregulated by curcumin in a mouse model of ischemia reperfusion-induced late kidney fibrosis. Moreover, Akt signaling was the specific signaling pathway identified downstream of APPL1 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Our in vitro experiment demonstrated that curcumin alleviates ischemia reperfusion-induced late kidney fibrosis via the APPL1/Akt pathway. These data are helpful for understanding the anti-fibrosis mechanism of curcumin in the pathogenesis of AKI-induced late fibrosis.

AB  - Organ transplantation is an acceptable option for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with end-stage kidney or liver disease. With worse outcomes on the waitlist, HIV-infected patients may actually be disproportionately affected by the organ shortage in the United States. One potential solution is the use of HIV-infected deceased donors (HIVDD), recently legalized by the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act. This is the first analysis of patient-specific data from potential HIVDD, retrospectively examining charts of HIV-infected patients dying in care at six HIV clinics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014. Our data suggest that there are four to five potential HIVDD dying in Philadelphia annually who might yield two to three kidneys and three to five livers for transplant. Extrapolated nationally, this would approximate 356 potential HIVDD yielding 192 kidneys and 247 livers annually. However, several donor risk indices raise concerns about the quality of kidneys that could be recovered from HIVDD as a result of older donor age and comorbidities. On the other hand, livers from these potential HIVDD are of similar quality to HIV-negative donors dying locally, although there is a high prevalence of positive hepatitis C antibody.

AB  - The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often considered to be a contraindication to organ donation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of DIC+ donors on kidney recipient (KR) evolution. We identified 169 KRs with DIC+ donation after brain death donors between January 1996 and December 2012 in 6 French transplant centers. Individuals were matched using propensity scores to 338 recipients with DIC? donors according to donor age and sex, whether expanded criteria for the donor existed, graft year, and transplantation center. After kidney transplantation, delayed graft function was observed in 28.1% of DIC+ KRs and in 22.8% of DIC? KRs (NS). Renal allograft survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 94.5%, 89.3%, and 73.9% and 96.2%, 90.8%, and 81.3% in DIC+ KRs and DIC? KRs, respectively (NS). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was similar between DIC+ and DIC? KRs at 3 months, 1 year, and 10 years: 45.9 vs 48.1 mL/min, 42.1 vs 43.1 mL/min, and 33.9 vs 38.1 mL/min, respectively. Delayed calcineurin inhibitor introduction or induction had no impact on delayed graft function rate or eGFR evolution at 10 years after transplantation in DIC+ KRs. Donor DIC did not seem to affect initial outcome, long-term graft function, or allograft survival.

AB  - Abstract Host stem/progenitor cells can be mobilized and recruited to a target location using biomaterials, and these cells may be used for in situ tissue regeneration. The objective of this study was to investigate whether host biologic resources could be used to regenerate renal tissue in situ. Collagen hydrogel was injected into the kidneys of normal mice, and rat kidneys that had sustained ischemia/reperfusion injury. After injection, the kidneys of both animal models were examined up to 4 weeks for host tissue response. The infiltrating host cells present within the injection regions expressed renal stem/progenitor cell markers, PAX-2, CD24, and CD133, as well as mesenchymal stem cell marker, CD44. The regenerated renal structures were identified by immunohistochemistry for renal cell specific markers, including synaptopodin and CD31 for glomeruli and cytokeratin and neprilysin for tubules. Quantitatively, the number of glomeruli found in the injected regions was significantly higher when compared to normal regions of renal cortex. This phenomenon occurred in normal and ischemic injured kidneys. Furthermore, the renal function after ischemia/reperfusion injury was recovered after collagen hydrogel injection. These results demonstrate that introduction of biomaterials into the kidney is able to facilitate the regeneration of glomerular and tubular structures in normal and injured kidneys. Such an approach has the potential to become a simple and effective treatment for patients with renal failure. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:241?250

AB  - Machine perfusion (MP) has been used as the kidney preservation method in our center for over 10 years. The first, small (n = 74) prospective, single-blinded randomized study comparing MP and Cold Storage (CS) showed that the incidence of delayed graft function was higher after CS. There have been no reports in the literature on the effect of storage modality on long-term function of renal allografts. This paper presents an analysis of long-term results of renal transplantation in 415 patients operated on between 1994 and 1999. Of those, 227 kidneys were MP-stored prior to KTx. The control group consisted of 188 CS kidney transplants. Kidneys were not randomized to MP or to CS. Donor demographics, medical and biochemical data, cold ischemia time, HLA match and recipient data were collected. Standard triple-drug immunosuppression was administered to both groups. Mortality, graft survival and incidence of return to hemodialysis treatment were analyzed. Despite longer cold ischemia time and poorer donor hemodynamics in MP group, 5-year Kaplan-Meier graft survival was better in MP-stored than in CS-stored kidneys (68.2% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: In this nonrandomized analysis, kidney storage by MP improved graft survival and reduced the number of patients who returned to dialysis.

AB  - Summary The current management of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is maximal conservative therapy within an intensive care environment. The only commonly accepted indication for operative intervention is the presence of infected pancreatic necrosis. We present a case wherein a laparotomy performed for treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) arising in the setting of SAP in the absence of pancreatic necrosis prevented early mortality and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of ACS as a new indication for operative intervention in SAP.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is no longer a contraindication to transplantation. For HIV-infected patients, HIV-infected deceased donors (HIVDD) could attenuate the organ shortage and waitlist mortality. However, this practice would violate United States federal law. The goal of this study was to estimate the potential impact of legalizing transplantation of HIV-infected organs by quantifying the potential pool of HIVDD. Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data, HIV-infected deaths compatible with donation were enumerated. Using HIV Research Network (HIVRN) data, CD4 count, plasma HIV-1 RNA level, AIDS-defining illnesses and causes of death were examined in potential HIVDD. Using UNOS data, evaluated donors who later demonstrated unanticipated HIV infections were studied. From NIS, a yearly average of 534 (range: 481?652) potential HIVDD were identified, with 63 (range: 39?90) kidney-only, 221 (range: 182?255) liver-only and 250 (range: 182?342) multiorgan donors. From HIVRN, a yearly average of 494 (range: 441?533) potential HIVDD were identified. Additionally, a yearly average of 20 (range: 11?34) donors with unanticipated HIV infection were identified from UNOS. Deceased HIV-infected patients represent a potential of approximately 500?600 donors per year for HIV-infected transplant candidates. In the current era of HIV management, a legal ban on the use of these organs seems unwarranted and likely harmful.

AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading preventable cause of death within hospitals. Among all the inpatients, those in the intensive care units (ICU) represent a high-risk category due to the severity of their illnesses, immobility which is often prolonged and iatrogenic factors such as central venous catheters. In many respects, the ICU patients differ from others who develop VTE. Symptoms like leg swelling, seen with VTE, are often present in these patients due to other reasons, while self-reporting of complaints related to VTE like chest or leg pain are not likely in severely ill patients. In addition, patients are often perceived to have a bleeding risk that outweighs their thrombosis risk; as such, thromboprophylaxis may be delayed by several days or even omitted altogether with a significant impact on mortality. In summary, patients in ICU are complex and present multiple challenges to clinicians in relation to the prevention and treatment of VTE. Thrombosis prevention should be a high priority for every patient and is only achieved with a careful daily assessment of their clinical condition.
