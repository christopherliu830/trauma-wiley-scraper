AB  - We determined and compared the mortality of pancreas transplant recipients and of patients on the pancreas waiting lists by using United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and International Pancreas Transplant Registry (IPTR) data. From January 1, 1995, through May 31, 2003, a total of 12 478 patients were listed for a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant; 2942 for a pancreas after (previous) kidney transplant (PAK); and 1207 for a pancreas transplant alone (PTA). In this retrospective observational cohort study, patients with multiple listings at different transplant centers and patients who changed transplant centers were counted only once. The Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) and the UNOS kidney transplant database were used to update mortality information. By univariate analyses, 4-year patient survival rates on the waiting lists (vs. post-transplant), in the SPK category, were 58.7% (vs. 90.3%); in the PAK category, 81.7% (vs. 88.3%); and in the PTA category, 87.3% (vs. 90.5%). Up to one-third of recipient deaths after post-transplant day 90 were not related to the transplant procedure itself. Multivariate analyses showed that the overall mortality in all three categories was not increased after transplantation (for SPK recipients only, it was significantly decreased). In summary, the mortality for solitary pancreas transplant recipients is not higher than for wait-listed patients.

AB  - Patient X: A 67-year-old Caucasian man slips on a patch of ice. He has abrasions to his hands and has sustained significant damage to his hip. At the emergency room, he informs clinicians he takes atorvastatin, metformin, and glimepiride to treat hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). X-rays reveal a fractured hip, which will require total hip replacement surgery.

AB  - Abstract Brain-dead donors are frequently hypovolemic and hypotensive requiring vasopressor support. We studied a stroke volume-based fluid resuscitation and vasopressor weaning protocol prospectively on 64 hypotensive donors, with a recent control cohort of 30 hypotensive donors treated without a protocol. Stroke volume was measured every 30 minutes for 4 hours by pulse contour analysis or esophageal Doppler. A 500 mL saline fluid bolus was infused over 30 minutes and repeated if the stroke volume increased by 10%. No fluid was infused if the stroke volume did not increase by 10%. Vasopressors were weaned every 10 minutes if the mean arterial pressure was greater than 65 mm Hg. The protocol group received 1937 ± 906 mL fluid compared to 1323 ± 919 mL in the control group (P = .003). Mean time on vasopressors was decreased from 957.6 ± 586.2 to 176.3 ± 82.2 minutes (P<.001). Donors in the protocol group were more likely to donate four or more organs than donors in the control group (OR = 4.114, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.003-16.876). While more organs were transplanted per donor in the protocol group (3.39 ± 1.52) than in the control group (2.93 ± 1.44) (P = .268), the difference did not reach statistical significance. A goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol decreased organ ischemia and may increase organs transplanted.

AB  - Abstract A 6-year-old neutered male domestic short-haired cat was presented to the Comparative Ophthalmology service at Michigan State University with a 3-week history of decreased appetite and redness of the left eye. The left forelimb had been removed 15?months previously because of the presence of a subcutaneous fibrosarcoma. In the left globe, a large iridal mass was associated with increased intraocular pressure and retinal detachment. A smaller mass involving the right iris was also present. Imaging revealed a 2-cm mass in the left caudodorsal lung lobe, and abdominal ultrasound showed multifocal bilateral renal masses. Aspirates of these masses were nondiagnostic. The left globe was removed for palliative reasons, and histopathology showed that fibrosarcoma was infiltrating the iris, choroid, and optic nerve. Despite systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin, the animal died 4?months after initial presentation. Histopathology confirmed highly angioinvasive metastatic fibrosarcoma also in the right uveal tract, the lungs, and both kidneys.

AB  - Abstract:? Backgrounds:? To investigate the feasibility of adult liver transplantation from donors with cocaine use. Methods:? Of 807 adult liver transplantations performed between 1994 and 2000, 72 donors (8.9%) were current cocaine users. Donor characteristics and post-transplantation outcomes were retrospectively compared between the 72 cocaine and 126 control group selected from the remaining 735 donors, matched for age and having no history of drug use. Results:? Marijuana, opiates and amphetamines were drugs of abuse often present with cocaine. Except for a high incidence of acute alcohol use in the cocaine donors, donor characteristics were comparable. The cocaine group had a significantly higher graft loss within three months of transplant (18.1% vs. 7.9%, p<0.05), and had a trend toward lower graft survival (76% vs. 86% at one?yr). Conclusions:? Potential adverse effect of cocaine and substances concurrently involved on donor liver was suggested. To clarify the distinct acceptance criteria of cocaine users for liver donation, prospective study is warranted.
