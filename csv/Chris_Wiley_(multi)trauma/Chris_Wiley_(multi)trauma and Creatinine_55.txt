AB  - Abstract Glomerular crescents are most common in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis but also occur in non-inflammatory chronic glomerulopathies; thus, factors other than inflammation should trigger crescent formation, eg vascular damage and plasma leakage. Here we report that Alport nephropathy in Col4A3-deficient Sv129 mice is complicated by diffuse and global crescent formation in which proliferating parietal epithelial cells are the predominant cell type. Laminin staining and transmission and acellular scanning electron microscopy of acellular glomeruli documented disruptions and progressive disintegration of the glomerular basement membrane in Col4A3-deficient mice. FITC-dextran perfusion further revealed vascular leakage from glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space, further documented by fibrin deposits in the segmental crescents. Its pathogenic role was validated by showing that the fibrinolytic activity of recombinant urokinase partially prevented crescent formation. In addition, in vitro studies confirmed an additional mitogenic potential of serum on murine and human parietal epithelial cells. Furthermore, loss of parietal cell polarity and unpolarized secretion of extracellular matrix components were evident within fibrocellular crescents. Among 665 human Alport nephropathy biopsies, crescent formation was noted in 0.4%. We conclude that glomerular vascular injury and GBM breaks cause plasma leakage which triggers a wound healing programme involving the proliferation of parietal cells and their loss of polarity. This process can trigger cellular and fibrocellular crescent formation even in the absence of cellular inflammation and rupture of the Bowman's capsule.

AB  - N-methyl-thio-tetrazole (NMTT) has been proposed as a causative factor in antibiotic-associated coagulopathy. To evaluate this hypothesis, a nationwide surveillance program was initiated to determine the relative frequency of antibiotic-associated coagulopathy and the importance of specific risk factors. A total of 970 patients were studied, with 491 being treated for infections and 479 receiving antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis. The NMTT-containing antibiotic cefotetan was compared with non-NMTT-containing antibiotics, for example, cefoxitin and cefazolin (prophylaxis only), and an aminoglycoside-antianaerobic (AG + AA) combination. Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were measured for each patient prior to the start of antibiotics and within 24?96 hours after the conclusion of drug administration. The patient population was relatively young [mean (SD) age 51.0 (20) yrs] with good nutritional status. The overall frequency of hypoprothrombinemia (4.5%) and bleeding (1.7%) was very low, and was highest with the use of AG + AA (p < 0.05). No statistical differences were observed for the remaining antibiotic regimens in either the prophylaxis or treatment group. Logistic regression analysis identified treatment with the AG + AA combination, presence of liver disease, and renal dysfunction as factors associated with an increased risk of hypoprothrombinemia. In conclusion, this study suggests that the frequency of antibiotic-associated coagulopathy is low, regardless of antibiotic, in patients who are not critically ill and not malnourished.

AB  - Abstract Aim Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent commonly used for the prevention and treatment of bleeding disorders. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods From 2005 to 2014, we encountered four CKD patients who experienced severe complications related to TXA. Clinical manifestations and outcome of these patients were recorded. We then performed a qualitative literature review of published cases of TXA toxicity in CKD patients in the PubMed database from 1 January 1972 to 31 December 2015. Results In our centre, two peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients developed neurotoxicity after intravenous TXA use for surgical bleeding and one PD patient developed neurotoxicity after oral TXA use for post-polypectomy colonic bleeding. One kidney transplant recipient developed acute obstructive uropathy due to retention of blood clot at the pelvi-ureteric junction of graft kidney after taking oral TXA for menorrhagia. Dosage of TXA was not adjusted according to renal function in all cases. All of them recovered without permanent disability after TXA was stopped. From our literature search, we identified two cases of neurotoxicity (one PD, one stage 4 CKD patient), one case of retinal toxicity in a haemolysis (HD) patient, one case of ligneous conjunctivitis in a CKD patient, and one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a CKD patient. Conclusion Neurotoxicity is a very common clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in CKD patients. Thrombotic complication is rare. Dosage adjustment of TXA is essential in CKD patients.

AB  - Summary.? Background:? Increasing the threshold to define a positive D-dimer could reduce unnecessary computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) but might increase rates of a missed PE and missed pneumonia, the most common non-thromboembolic diagnosis seen on CTPA. Objective:? Measure the effect of doubling the standard D-dimer threshold for ?PE unlikely? Revised Geneva (RGS) or Wells? scores on the exclusion rate, frequency and size of a missed PE and missed pneumonia. Methods:? Patients evaluated for a suspected PE with 64-channel CTPA were prospectively enrolled from emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient units of four hospitals. Pretest probability data were collected in real time and the D-dimer was measured in a central laboratory. Criterion standard was CPTA interpretation by two independent radiologists combined with clinical outcome at 30?days. Results:? Of 678 patients enrolled, 126 (19%) were PE+ and 93 (14%) had pneumonia. Use of either Wells??≤?4 or RGS?≤?6 produced similar results. For example, with RGS?≤?6 and standard threshold (<?500?ng?mL?1), D-dimer was negative in 110/678 (16%), and 4/110 were PE+ (posterior probability 3.8%) and 9/110 (8.2%) had pneumonia. With RGS?≤?6 and a threshold <?1000?ng?mL?1, D-dimer was negative in 208/678 (31%) and 11/208 (5.3%) were PE+, but 10/11 missed PEs were subsegmental and none had concomitant DVT. Pneumonia was found in 12/208 (5.4%) with RGS?≤?6 and D-dimer?<?1000?ng?mL?1. Conclusions:? Doubling the threshold for a positive D-dimer with a PE unlikely pretest probability could reduce CTPA scanning with a slightly increased risk of missed isolated subsegmental PE, and no increase in rate of missed pneumonia.

AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.
