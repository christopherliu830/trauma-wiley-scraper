AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR; synonymous with NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) is a universal physical technique best known for non-invasive detection and anatomical mapping of water protons (H). MR-spectroscopy (MRS) records protons from tissue chemicals other than water, intrinsic phosphorus containing metabolites, sodium, potassium, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. MRS is therefore an imaging technique with the potential to record human and animal biochemistry in vivo. As a result of wide availability of MRI equipment in research laboratories and hospitals, MRS is a serious competitor with PET to define normal body composition and its perturbation by pharmacological and pathological events. This article describes practical aspects of in vivo MRS with particular emphasis on the brain, where novel metabolites have been described. A survey of these new aspects of neurochemistry emphasize their practical utility as neuronal and axonal markers, measures of energy status, membrane constituents, and osmolytes, as well as some xenobiotics, such as alcohol. The concept of multinuclear in vivo MRS is illustrated by diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of several human brain disorders. Although these methods are currently most frequently encountered in human studies, as well as with transgenic and knockout mouse models, MRS adds a new dimension to anatomic and histopathologic descriptions.

AB  - Summary Pancreas donor selection and recognition are important to cope with increasing organ shortage. We aim to show that the PDRI is more useful than the P-PASS to predict acceptance and should thus be preferred over P-PASS. Eurotransplant donors from 2004 until 2014 were included in this study. PDRI logistical factors were set to reference to purely reflect donor quality (PDRI donor). PDRI and P-PASS association with allocation outcome was studied using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Regional differences in donor quality were also investigated. Of the 10 444 pancreata that were reported, 6090 (58.3%) were accepted and 2947 (28.2%) were transplanted. We found that P-PASS was inferior to PDRIdonor in its ability to predict organ reporting, acceptance, and transplantation: AUC 0.63, 0.67 and 0.73 for P-PASS vs. 0.78, 0.79 and 0.84 for PDRIdonor, respectively. Furthermore, there were significant differences in donor quality among different Eurotransplant countries, both in reported donors and in transplanted organs. PDRI is a powerful predictor of allocation outcome and should be preferred over P-PASS. Proper donor selection and recognition, and possibly a more liberal approach toward inferior quality donors, may increase donation and transplant rates.

AB  - Key Clinical Message The stalling or regression of pubertal development may be the first sign of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in adolescent males. We report here a case of pediatric hypergonadotropic hypogonadism that likely developed secondary to ischemic injury during severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This case highlights the importance of performing genital exams during all evaluations of pediatric patients.

AB  - Background: The neuroendocrine response following major surgery has not been previously influenced by either regional anaesthetic techniques or opioid analgesia probably due to insufficient intraoperative afferent neural blockade. In this study we attempted to determine whether significant inhibition of these pathways could be achieved by combining preoperative high spinal anaesthesia with postoperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia. In theory too, there may be additional benefits over perioperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia on pain and pulmonary dysfunction. Methods: 20 ASA 1?3 patients undergoing elective colonic surgery were studied. Gp 1 (n=10) received a high spinal intraoperative block to T4 using 6mls of 0.5% bupivacaine plus continuous epidural 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. Gp 2 (n=10) patients received epidural 0.5% bupivacaine block to T4 plus continuous epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. We measured a) plasma glucose and Cortisol at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 h; b) forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and peak flow rate (PFR) preoperatively, at 8 and 24 h; c) visual analogue pain scores (VAS 0?10) at rest, cough and mobilisation at 8 and 24 h; d) block height every hour for 12 hours then 3 hourly; e) 24-hour urine volumes for dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline f) 24-hour PCA morphine requirements. Results: The two groups did not differ in age, sex, height, weight, duration of surgery, blood loss or serum albumin. Pain relief was excellent and similar in both groups. The average 24 hour morphine consumption was 10 mg in both groups with no differences in the block height. All the patients had a 30?50% reduction in FEV1, FVC and PFR (P>0.05). Metabolically, there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups except a higher rise in glucose in Gpl at 2 and 3 h (P=0.0312 and 0.014). 24-hour catecholamine studies showed no differences for noradrenaline (P=0.8), adrenaline (P=0.47) and dopamine (P=0.36). Conclusions: Thoracic epidural bupivacaine/diamorphine infusion provided excellent postoperative analgesia following colonic surgery. An intraoperative combined spinal/epidural technique conferred no additional benefit on analgesia, pulmonary function and the neuroendocrine response.

AB  - Compilations of articles important to the pharmacist practicing in the emergency department have not been published. Consistent with other specialty areas of practice, a collection of important literature is valuable for both the new and experienced clinician. A diverse breadth of medical problems are represented that were felt to be the most pertinent issues facing the emergency medicine pharmacist; however, it is not intended to be a complete representation of available literature.
