AB  - Purpose To present the pathophysiology, differential diagnoses, assessment techniques, and treatment options for hepatic hydrothorax. Data Sources A case study is presented with supporting material from current medical literature. Conclusions Hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion caused by the flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space through an actual defect in the diaphragm. Successful outcomes depend on early detection and timely referral of often-subtle lung involvement. Implications for Practice Although incidence is reported to be as high as 12% in cirrhotic patients, standard medical references attach little importance to pul-monary risks in this population. Hepatic hydrothorax should always be considered in the cirrhotic patient with a pleural effusion.

AB  - Summary Excellent outcomes are currently being achieved for children undergoing heart transplantation. The commonest indication for transplantation in children is dilated cardiomyopathy, but congenital heart disease (CHD) accounts for almost 40% of cases. Surgical ingenuity has led to successful transplantation for all forms of congenital defects, including abnormalities of situs. Infants undergoing transplantation for CHD have the highest perioperative mortality. None-the-less, infants who survive the early post-transplant period have the best long-term survival, likely reflecting a degree of immunological privilege. Adolescents have the worse post-transplant outcomes, in part related to poor adherence to medication regimens. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil are the most commonly used agents and approximately 70% of pediatric recipients receive induction therapy, most commonly with rabbit antithymocyte globulin. This is often used to help facilitate steroid avoidance or early steroid withdrawal, strategies providing particular advantage to pediatric recipients. The spectrum of post-transplant complications is similar to adults, though post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) occur more frequently, largely related to the high frequency of naïve status to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at the time of transplantation in young recipients. As for adults, very long-term survival is limited by the development of coronary allograft vasculopathy. Retransplantation is used with relative frequency in the pediatric population, with reasonable long-term results when performed beyond the first six months after primary transplantation. Although enormous progress has been made over the last two decades, pediatric heart transplantation continues to be a palliative, rather than a curative therapy.

AB  - Introduction: The treatment of choice for breast cancer is modified radical mastectomy or in selected case breast conserving surgery. Typically, patient will have a long hospital stay after surgery due to the collection of lymph. Premature removal of drain will incur seroma formation and may predispose to wound infection. Review of literature shows that there has not been adequate address to this condition, particularly the use of pressure garment in reducing lymph output. We report our experience in an interim analysis of a randomized controlled study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of pressure garment on early removal of drains, shortening of hospital stay and reducing the incidence of seroma formation. Methodology: From September 1999 to November 2000, 44 consecutive patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer were invited to participate in this study. Our occupational therapist arranged for tailor made pressure garments. Soft foam mimicking the external mammary prosthesis was fashioned so that appropriate pressure was applied on to the operative site to prevent lymph accumulation. They were randomized into two groups (1) with pressure garment (2) without pressure garment. The single surgeon performing the mastectomy was blinded until the completion of surgery when the result of randomization was sought from the principal investigator. The occupational therapist inspected daily to ensure the vest was filled satisfactorily. OPD assessments were arranged at 2 weeks and 8 weeks. Results: (range in parentheses) Conclusion: Use of breast pressure garment did not prevent seroma formation but reduced the volume of drainage and facilitated early removal of drains resulting in a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay of 2.7 days. Such breast vest has great impact on the hospital economy.

AB  - The increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is higher for proximal than for distal tumors. As microsatellite instability (MSI) is a feature of proximal tumors, we hypothesize that an increase in MSI tumors may account for the age-related proximal shift in CRC. Methods: A representative sample of 230 CRCs from 3 age groups was selected from a CRC database. MSI was determined by PCR. MLH1 and MSH2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the methylation of the MLH1 gene promotor (PM) by methylation-specific PCR. Results: MSI tumors became more frequent (p < 0.01 chi square) and more proximal in distribution (p = 0.01 loglinear) in the oldest age group. MSI was associated with loss of expression of MSH2 in the young age group. PM and inactivation of MLH1 increased with age. Conclusion: MSI tumors became more frequent and proximal in older patients. This trend was associated with differences in the underlying mechanisms responsible for the MSI phenotype.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate prospectively use of the haemorrhoid circular stapler (HCS) in day case haemorrhoidectomy. Methods: Patients with prolapsing piles needing haemorrhoidectomy who met the criteria for day surgery were recruited. In addition to the standard practice, a comprehensive explanation regarding the procedure was given at the preoperative assessment clinic. All patients received lactulose 2 consecutive days before surgery and a prophylactic dose of intravenous metronidazole on induction of anaesthesia. Haemorrhoidectomy was performed with the circular stapler (HCS33-Ethicon Endosurgery) employing the Longo technique. A diclofenac suppository and absorbable anal dressing were administered at the end of the procedure. Postoperative pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale prior to discharge on the same day. Patients were discharged with a bulking agent plus lactulose, oral diclofenac, TNG ointment and a telephone number to call for queries. Patients were seen at 1, 4 and 12 weeks after surgery during which time they would report on symptoms, duration of rest and overall satisfaction. Results: 20 patients underwent the procedure. Only 1 patient required hospital admission, due to side effects of general anaesthesia. The mean pain score on discharge was 3.8 (range: 0?8). All patients were able to take up normal activities within the first week and passed regular motions with relatively mild symptoms. Conclusion: Day case haemorrhoidectomy is not only feasible using the HCS, good patient satisfaction can also be achieved.

AB  - Background: Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and exposure to N-nitroso compounds (NOC) are considered the two most important contributing factors in gastric carcinogenesis. It has been shown in a previous study that H. pylori also catalyzes N-nitrosation in vitro. Whether the N-nitrosating activity of H. pylori plays any role in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma has yet to be determined. Methods: H. pylori strains isolated from patients with different gastroduodenal pathologies were subcultured with the addition of morpholine (a nitrosable chemical) and sodium nitrite at a concentration of 25mM and 16mM, respectively. The bacteria were allowed to grow for 6 to 8 hours until OD600 of the culture media reached a value between 0.6 and 0.8. The culture-supernatants were then separated at 4°C, and the quantity of N-nitroso-morpholine formed was assayed using gas chromatography, as described by Suzaki and Mitsuoka. The nitrosating activity of individual H. pylori strain was calculated by adjusting the OD600 to unity. Bacterial genotypes, cagA, iceA and vacA of the H. pylori isolates were also determined by polymerase chain reaction based on published primer sequences. N-nitrosating activities of the H. pylori strains were compared with regard to the patient characteristics, the bacterial genotypes, and their related disease categories. Results: 20 strains from gastric cancer (GC), 27 from duodenal ulcer (DU) and 22 from non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) were studied. Though patients with GC were significantly older than those with DU and NUD, the 3 groups were comparable with regard to patient?s gender and bacterial genotypes. All 69 H. pylori strains expressed N-nitrosating activities with a uni-modal distribution (median 41.3 ?g/L; range: 9.2?152.3 ?g/L). Strains isolated from GC patients had a significantly higher mean N-nitrosating activity (65.3 ± 27.2 ?g/L) than those collected from patients with DU (43.8 ± 24.9 ?g/L) or NUD (33.8 ± 21.1 ?g/L) (p = 0.003, one-way ANOVA), but there was no difference between the DU and the NUD groups. Neither the patient characteristics (age and gender) nor the bacterial cagA, iceA and vacA subtypes had any association with the nitrosating activity. Conclusions: H. pylori-catalyzed N-nitrosation may be important in gastric carcinogenesis as strains isolated from stomach cancer patients express a higher level of N-nitrosating activity than those found in non-cancer patients.

AB  - Background & Objective: Patients undergoing elective rectal cancer surgery are usually given Fraxiparine based on recommended dosages from Caucasians? studies (0.2 ml if body weight <50 kg and 0.3 ml if body weight >50 kg) as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In our Chinese population, however, a number of cases of severe bleeding complications were observed with this standard dosage regimen. A prospective randomized study was therefore conducted to compare the anti-Xa activity and bleeding complications of this standard regimen and a reduced dosage regimen (0.1 ml if body weight < 50 kg and 0.2 ml if body weight > 50 kg). Methods: 29 patients with rectal cancer (standard : reduced = 14 : 15) were included in this study. Fraxiparine was given 4 hours prior to surgery and blood was taken just before surgery for measurement of anti-Xa activity. Postoperatively the patients were examined clinically for DVT. Perioperative blood loss, transfusion requirements and postoperative bleeding complications were also recorded and analyzed prospectively. Results: The mean anti-Xa activity was significantly higher in the standard dosage group (0.302 u/ml vs 0.219 u/ml, P = 0.029). There was no clinically overt DVT in the two groups. Total perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were not different in both groups. However, one patient in the standard dosage group has developed major intraoperative bleeding that necessitated packing and relaparotomy for haemostatsis. This patient finally died of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Gross haematuria was also observed in two patients in the standard dosage group. None of the patients in the reduced dosage group had developed any major or minor bleeding complications postoperatively. Conclusion: Fraxiparine as DVT prophylaxis in the Chinese population should be administered at a reduced dosage because it is shown in this study to be as effective as the standard dosage regimen in preventing DVT and yet it is associated with fewer bleeding complications.

AB  - Controversies still exist as to the exact definition of phimosis, true indications for circumcision, and results of different treatment options. A prospective study in the two years straddling the Millennium was done to definite the exact role of circumcision in the management of the preputial problems amid continuing controversies and in the wake of a new medical treatment, i.e. steroid application emerging since 1993. 244 referrals resulted in 195 circumcisions in 1999. Detailed analysis revealed that the indication was doubtful and arguable in 13.5% and 16%, respectively. The overall complication rate (bleeding, infection and rephimosis) occurred in 12%. Starting from 2000, application of 0.02% Trimcinolone cream was instituted: successful retraction in 74 was achieved in 81/95 patients. No side effects were noted. The positive predicting factors were identified. Circumcision has been advocated as a routine to decrease the incidence of UTI, STD or Cancer. However, circumcision is fraught with early and late problems. There have only been 9 reported on the use of steroid application, all using potent preparations. We pioneered the use of a much weaker steroid that was documented to have comparable efficacy. Our proposed algorithm for offers great advantages, including tremendous savings to the hospital, and lifetime benefits to the patients!
