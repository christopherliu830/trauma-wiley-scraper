AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) is an excellent modality to depict and study the complex anatomy of the skull using multi-planar 2D images as well as 3D renderings. The foramina of the skull have been described on CT and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Congenital occipitoatlantoaxial malformations are rare in dogs; however, hypermotility or stenosis can cause severe neurologic compromise secondary to compression of the spinal cord. Atlantooccipital overlapping is rostral malposition of the atlas and axis resulting in compression of the cerebellum and kinking of the medulla oblongata. Benign calvarial hyperostosis has been described in young Bull Mastiffs as a diffuse thickening of the bones of the calvarium, with some similarities to craniomandibular osteopathy. Skull fractures due to trauma are best appreciated on CT images. CT features of osteomyelitis in the skull include soft tissue swelling, multifocal bone lysis with poorly defined cortical margins, regions of sclerosis, and irregular periosteal reaction.

AB  - Summary Urine samples were collected from 67 patients attending a Regional Pain Unit for treatment of chronic pain. Patients treated with steroids or with any signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome were excluded. The urine Cortisol/ creatinine ratio was subsequently measured. Values for the urine Cortisol/creatinine ratio were elevated in 31% of the patients, and grossly elevated in some. These patients could not be differentiated from those with normal ratios on the basis of pain or mood scores, cause of pain or drug therapy; they tended to have pain of shorter duration. Possible interpretations of these results are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective Sepsis induces an inflammatory response that results in acute renal failure (ARF). The current study is to evaluate the role of S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in renoprotection from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Methods Rats were divided to three groups. First group received LPS (5 mg/kg body weight), second group was treated with LPS + GSNO (50 ?g/kg body weight), and third group was administered with vehicle (saline). They were sacrificed on day 1 and 3 post-LPS injection. Serum levels of nitric oxide (NO), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were analysed. Tissue morphology, T lymphocyte infiltrations, and the expression of inflammatory (TNF-α, iNOS) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) mediators as well as glutathione (GSH) levels were determined. Key finding Lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased body weight and increased cellular T lymphocyte infiltration, caspase-3 and iNOS and decreased PPAR-? in renal tissue. NO, creatinine and BUN were significantly elevated after LPS challenge, and they significantly decreased after GSNO treatment. TNF-α level was found significantly increased in LPS-treated serum and kidney. GSNO treatment of LPS-challenged rats decreased caspase-3, iNOS, TNF-α, T lymphocyte infiltration and remarkably increased levels of IL-10, PPAR-? and GSH. Conclusion GSNO can be used as a renoprotective agent for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.

AB  - Severe trauma leads to considerable losses of nitrogen in the first days after the accident. As nutritional efforts cannot reduce these losses sufficiently, an adjunctive therapy using the anabolic steroid nandrolone decanoate (Nd) was applied. In a double-blind study 10 male multiple-traumatized patients each received 50 mg of Nd on day 3 and 25 mg of Nd on day 6 after the trauma, an additional 10 patients received placebo only. Both groups had identical nutritional support. Nitrogen balance, total nitrogen excretion as well as plasma amino acid concentration, and urine amino acid excretion were measured daily. The anabolic agent improved the nitrogen balance mainly by reducing nitrogen excretion. 3-Methylhistidine excretion and renal amino acid losses were decreased. Nandrolone decanoate increased the concentration of total plasma amino acids. The underlying principle seems to be an amino acid-saving mechanism with a renal site of action. It is shown that in the early posttraumatic period nandrolone decanoate improves nitrogen metabolism. Further studies are required to determine whether this offers a clinical benefit to trauma patients.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - Objective? To identify preoperative diagnostic results that predict postoperative complications and survival in feline renal-transplant recipients. Study Design? Retrospective clinical study. Animals? Sixty-one feline renal allograft recipients. Methods? Medical records for 61 consecutive cats that underwent renal allograft transplantation between January 1, 1996, and December 1, 1999, were reviewed. Age, diagnosis, body weight, body condition score, preoperative medical treatment, systolic blood pressure, packed cell volume, biochemical parameters at admission and at the time of surgery, postoperative complications, and postoperative survival were recorded. Associations of preoperative data with the occurrence of postoperative complications were determined using logistic regression. Postoperative survival was graphed using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative-survival plot. Associations of covariates with postoperative survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results? Two parameters were significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative central nervous system (CNS) disorders: blood urea nitrogen concentration (odds ratio = 1.083; 95% CI = 1.018 to 1.148) and serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.413 to 2.187) at the time of surgery. Postoperative survival 6 months after transplantation was 59%, though 3-year survival remained at 42%. Of all covariates investigated, only recipient age (relative hazard = 1.183; 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.334) was significantly associated with survival. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance? Standard measures of preoperative renal dysfunction do not predict postoperative survival in cats after renal transplantation, although an increase in the degree of preoperative azotemia is associated with an increased risk of CNS disorders after surgery. Increased recipient age is associated with decreased survival after renal transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Current immunosuppression in VCA is largely based on the experience in solid organ transplantation. It remains unclear if steroids can be reduced safely in VCA recipients. We report on five VCA recipients who were weaned off maintenance steroids after a median of 2 months (mean: 4.8 months, range 2?12 months). Patients were kept subsequently on a low dose, dual maintenance consisting of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenloic acid with a mean follow-up of 43.6 months (median?=?40 months, range 34?64 months). Early and late acute rejections responded well to temporarily augmented maintenance, topical immunosuppression, and/or steroid bolus treatment. One late steroid-resistant acute rejection required treatment with thymoglobulin. All patients have been gradually weaned off steroids subsequent to the treatment of acute rejections. Low levels of tacrolimus (<5?ng/mL) appeared as a risk for acute rejections. Although further experience and a cautious approach are warranted, dual-steroid free maintenance immunosuppression appears feasible in a series of five VCA recipients.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study is to determine the factors contributing to survival of patients on hemodialysis. Methods: Data were collected from 8 dialysis centers, and 432 patients were recruited. Among them, patients who underwent hemodialysis thrice a week for more than 3 years and received antihypertensive therapy or had systolic blood pressure of more than 160?mm Hg before dialysis secession were selected. Subsequent survival status and cause of death were ascertained for the next 3.5 years. The logistic multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of death. Variables used for the purpose of this analysis were patient gender, age, underlying renal disease (unknown and others (0), CGN (1), DM (2)), medication, serum albumin, history of having cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular accidents (yes or no), the levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), hemoglobin, serum calcium and inorganic phosphate, ?2-microglobulin, intact PTH, and other laboratory data. Results:?First step logistic regression analysis indicated age, underlying renal diseases, serum creatinine, GOT, ?2-microglobulin were associated with increased relative risk (RR) of dying. According to the formula calculated in this analysis, if the levels of serum creatinine increased 1?mg/dl, the ratio of dying increased by 1.210. Also, compared to the patients aged between 50 to 64 years old, the patients aged between 65 to 90 years old had 1.521 times dying ratio. Conclusions:?From this study, it is suggested that age, creatinine, underlying renal diseases, ?2-microblobulin, past history of cerebrovascular disease, serum creatinine, and GOT were important factors contributing to patients? survival.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.

AB  - Twenty-four?hour urine collection is the recommended method for estimating sodium intake. To investigate the strengths and limitations of methods used to assess completion of 24-hour urine collection, the authors systematically reviewed the literature on the accuracy and usefulness of methods vs para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) recovery (referent). The percentage of incomplete collections, based on PABA, was 6% to 47% (n=8 studies). The sensitivity and specificity for identifying incomplete collection using creatinine criteria (n=4 studies) was 6% to 63% and 57% to 99.7%, respectively. The most sensitive method for removing incomplete collections was a creatinine index <0.7. In pooled analysis (≥2 studies), mean urine creatinine excretion and volume were higher among participants with complete collection (P<.05); whereas, self-reported collection time did not differ by completion status. Compared with participants with incomplete collection, mean 24-hour sodium excretion was 19.6 mmol higher (n=1781 specimens, 5 studies) in patients with complete collection. Sodium excretion may be underestimated by inclusion of incomplete 24-hour urine collections. None of the current approaches reliably assess completion of 24-hour urine collection.

AB  - BACKGROUND Diagnosis of bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) in patients with lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms is challenging without using invasive urodynamic tests. Recently, we showed in vitro that urothelial strips from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) release more ATP than controls. Here, we tested whether urinary ATP can be used as a wall tension transducer non-invasive biomarker to detect BOO in patients with BPH. METHODS 79 male patients with BOO and 22 asymptomatic controls were recruited prospectively. Patients were asked to complete the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire and to void at normal desire into a urinary flowmeter; the postvoid residual volume was determined by suprapubic ultrasonography. Urine samples from all individuals were examined for ATP, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase. RESULTS BOO patients had significantly higher (P?<?0.001) urinary ATP normalized by the voided volume (456?±?36?nmol) than age-matched controls (209?±?35?nmol). Urinary ATP amounts increased with the voided volume, but the slope of this rise was higher in BOO patients than in controls. A negative correlation was detected between urinary ATP and flow rate parameters, namely maximal flow rate (r?=??0.310, P?=?0.005), Siroky flow-volume normalization (r?=??0.324, P?=?0.004), and volume-normalized flow rate index (r?=??0.320, P?=?0.012). We found no correlation with LUT symptoms IPSS score. Areas under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were 0.91 (95%CI 0.86?0.96, P?<?0.001) for ATP alone and 0.88 (95%CI 0.81?0.94, P?<?0,001) when adjusted to urinary creatinine. CONCLUSIONS Patients with BOO release higher amounts of ATP into the urine than the control group. The high area under the ROC curve suggests that urinary ATP can be a high-sensitive non-invasive biomarker of BOO, which may have a discriminative value of detrusor competence when comparing BPH patients with low urinary flow rates.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - SUMMARY 1. In the present study, we investigated whether treatment with α-lipoic acid (LA), a powerful and universal anti-oxidant, has renal protective effects in rats with ischaemic acute renal failure (ARF). 2. Ischaemic ARF was induced by occlusion of the left renal artery and vein for 45 min followed by reperfusion, 2 weeks after contralateral nephrectomy. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma concentrations of creatinine (Pcr) and urinary osmolality (Uosm) were measured for the assessment of renal dysfunction. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) and fractional excretion of Na+ (FENa) were used as indicators of glomerular and tubular function, respectively. 3. Renal function in ARF rats decreased markedly 24 h after reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injection of LA at a dose of 10 mg/kg before the occlusion tended to attenuate the deterioration of renal function. A higher dose of LA (100 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated the ischaemia/reperfusion-induced increases in BUN (19.1 ± 0.7 vs 7.2 ± 0.7 mmol/L before and after treatment, respectively), Pcr (290 ± 36 vs 78.1 ± 4.2 ?mol/L before and after treatment, respectively) and FENa (1.39 ± 0.3 vs 0.33 ± 0.09% before and after treatment, respectively). Treatment with 100 mg/kg LA significantly (P < 0.01) increased Ccr (0.70 ± 0.13 vs 2.98 ± 0.27 mL/min per kg before and after treatment, respectively) and Uosm (474 ± 39 vs 1096 ± 80 mOsmol/kg before and after treatment, respectively). 4. Histopathological examination of the kidney of ARF rats revealed severe lesions. Tubular necrosis (P < 0.01), proteinaceous casts in tubuli (P < 0.01) and medullary congestion (P < 0.05) were significantly suppressed by the higher dose of LA. 5. A marked increase in endothelin (ET)-1 content in the kidney after ischaemia/reperfusion was evident in ARF rats (0.43 ± 0.02 ng/g tissue) compared with findings in sham- operated rats (0.20 ± 0.01 ng/g tissue). Significant attenuation (P < 0.01) of this increase occurred in ARF rats treated with the higher dose of LA (0.24 ± 0.03 ng/g tissue). 6. These results suggest that administration of LA to rats prior to development of ischaemic ARF prevents renal dysfunction and tissue injury, possibly through the suppression of overproduction of ET-1 in the postischaemic kidney.

AB  - Introduction:? A bioartificial kidney, which consists of a continuous hemofilter and a bioartificial tubule device using proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), is desired to develop for preventing long-term complications in hemodialysis patients. A bioartificial tubule device should function for a long duration in terms of the simplicity and the economy. Continuous hemofiltration with 10?L/day of filtrate could maintain plasma urea, creatinine and ?2-microglobulin in patients at low levels compared to those in standard hemodialysis patients. Methods:? 6 bioartificial tubule devices, in which LLC-PK1 cells were grown on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber capillaries (membrane area: 0.4?m2, 1600 fibers), were used to evaluate the transport ability of H2O, glucose and Na+, and leak rates of urea and creatinine for 2 weeks when the medium containing 50?mg/dL of urea and 5.0?mg/dL of creatinine was perfused inside of the cell-attached membranes and another medium containing 2.5?g/dL of albumin was perfused outside of the membranes. Scanning electron micrograph of cross-sectional findings of the hollow fibers was taken at 6, 10, and 14 days after formation of confluence. Results:? By conversion into 1?m2 of membrane area, transport of H2O, glucose, and Na+ was 6266?± 995?mL/day, 22832?±?7240 mg/day, and 941.3?±?180 mEq/day, respectively at 6 days after confluence. Leak rates of urea and creatinine across the cell-attached membranes were 22?±?6.1% and 19.2?±?4.9 with albumin addition, whereas 13.1?±?1.9% and 12.2?±?1.6 without albumin addition. Transport capacity of these components and the leak rates had continued for 10?13 days, and decreased thereafter because of the formation of the multilayers. Bioartificial tubule devices with membrane area 1.0?m2 can reach the targeted amounts of H2O, glucose, and Na+ transports when 6?L of 10?L/day of hemofiltrate has to be regenerated, substituting 4?L with meal and drinks.

AB  - We studied early renal function in 241 consecutive patients who received cadaveric renal transplants at two different transplantation centers (group 1, n?=?90; group 2, n?=?151). Univariate and multivariate analyses of data from group 1 showed a significant correlation between seven donor variables and early renal function after cadaveric renal transplantation. A scoring system was developed from these seven donor variables (cause of death, 0?6 points; history of hypertension, 0?6; final creatinine clearance before procurement, 0?6; age, 0?6; history of diabetes mellitus, 0?3; cold ischemia time, 0?3; and severity of renal artery plaque, 0?3). Data from group 2 were used to validate the donor scoring system and stratify cadaver kidneys on the basis of score: grade A, 0?5 points; grade B, 6?10; grade C, 11?15; and grade D, 16?32. A significant decline in early renal function was observed with increasing donor score and grade of cadaver kidney. In conclusion, a donor scoring system based on information available at the time of procurement can be used to estimate early graft function after cadaveric renal transplantation and may assist in the allocation of marginal organs.

AB  - While severe nephrotoxicity is uncommon during gold therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the prevalence of mild nephrotoxicity has not been investigated. To study this, levels of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase (NAG) (nmole/hr/mg urinary creatinine), and ?2microglobulin (?2M) (?g/mg urinary creatinine) were measured in urine samples from 33 patients with RA receiving gold and 28 patients with various musculoskeletal diseases not receiving gold. Each patient had a normal urinalysis and blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine. LAP was above 30 in 55% of RA patients and 7% of controls (p < 0.01). NAG was above 100 in 70% of RA patients and 14% of controls (p < 0.01). In 8 RA patients, NAG was over 200; LAP was over 100 in 4, but in none of the controls. ?2M was above 0.32 in 7 of 23 female RA patients and in none of 12 female controls (p = 0.012) and none of the male patients. Patients who excreted high levels of ?2M also excreted high levels of NAG and LAP. These data show that gold in therapeutic doses affects renal tubular cells, causing the release of NAG and LAP from lysosomes and brush borders of the cells. This may represent the mildest stage of nephrotoxicity. Elevated ?2M in the urine of some patients indicate a degree of nephrotoxicity sufficient to cause renal tubular dysfunction.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?When life-threatening bleeding occurs in patients on warfarin, timely reversal becomes imperative. In the USA, warfarin effect is commonly reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The use of FFP is complicated by delays in correction, volume overload and often, inadequate correction. Objective:?Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a protocol for rapid administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in the setting of the urgent need for reversal of warfarin. Methods/patients:?We instituted a policy for rapid delivery and administration of PCC. Appropriate patients received 25?50?U?kg?1 of PCC. The prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratios (INR) was recorded before and immediately after dosing, and 24?h postdosing. Patients requiring surgical interventions were cleared for the operating room (OR) immediately. Fifty-eight patients were treated, with a median age of 75.5?years (range 26?92). Results:?The median INR on presentation was 3.8 (1.4?52.8). Immediately following PCC administration the median INR was 1.3 (0.9?5.7), only two patients with INRs exceeding 2.0. The benefit was maintained at 24?h with a median INR of 1.5 (1.1?3.4). Four patients experienced thrombotic events during their hospitalization, (two deep vein thrombosis, two non-q-wave myocardial infarction) although none was attributed to PPC therapy. Conclusions:?PCC administration is an effective treatment modality for the correction of warfarin anticoagulation in the urgent setting. Advantages over FFP include more timely correction, absence of volume overload and potentially more complete correction. Broader use of PCC in this setting appears to be appropriate.

AB  - Summary: The present study was undertaken in the hope that conflicting opinions concerning interrelationships among minimal change disease (MCD), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPG) and focal segmental glomeruloscierosis (FSGS) might be elucidated by morphometric methods performed by image analysis, as well as to study whether serum creatinine and changes in quantitatively analysed glomeruli could correlate with the interstitial fibrosis in these glomerulopathies. Fifteen renal biopsy specimens from children with MCD, 10 with primary MPG and 12 with FSGS for whom both light and electron microscopy as well as immunofluorescence microscopy and full clinical data were available, were examined quantitatively. As a control five biopsy and 10 autopsy specimens of the normal kidneys were used. Our quantitative study showed that in MCD, MPG and FSGS glomerular and interstitial values differed from normal. Morphometric differences between MPG and both MCD and FSGS groups were also shown. Although the mean values of total glomerular area and relative interstitial volume were increased in FSGS patients, in total glomerular cells per unit of glomerular area and mesangium (% of total glomerular area) were similar in both MCD and FSGS groups. In MPG strong positive correlations existed between interstitial volume and serum creatinine, interstitial volume and total glomerular cells per unit of glomerular area as well as between interstitial volume and glomerular mesangium (% of total glomerular area). In FSGS there was significant positive correlation between interstitial volume and serum creatinine. In the MCD group all correlations were weak and not significant. In conclusion, our morphometric studies suggest a close relationship between MCD and FSGS, and indicate that MPG is a separate morphologic entity in children.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Acinetobacter baumannii and A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex are commonly encountered pathogens in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment and prognostic risk factors in nosocomial pneumonia caused by these microorganisms. Methods The study was conducted retrospectively in Uludag University Hospital and included 356 adult non-neutropenic patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Results Of the subjects, 94.9% (n?=?338) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. The clinical response rate was 57.2%, the 14-day mortality 39.6% and the 30-day mortality 53.1%. The significant independent risk factors for the 30-day mortality were severe sepsis (OR, 2.60; 95% CI: 1.49?4.56; P?=?0.001), septic shock (OR, 6.12; 95% CI: 2.75?13.64; P?<?0.001), APACHE II score?≥?20 (OR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28?3.50; P?=?0.003) and empiric monotherapy (OR, 1.63; 95% CI: 1.00?2.64; P?=?0.048). Multi-trauma (OR, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.11?5.68; P?=?0.028) was found to be a protective factor. In patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS)?>?6 on the third day of treatment, both the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were high (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.001). Also, the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were significantly higher in the patients treated with empiric monotherapy compared with combination therapy (48/93 (51.6%)?46/123 (37.4%), P?=?0.037 and 62/93 (66.7%)?65/123 (52.8%), P?=?0.041, respectively) in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant strains. Conclusion Mortality rates were high in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant A. baumannii or A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex. In the units with a high level of carbapenem resistance, antibiotic combinations should be considered for empiric therapy.
