AB  - Background: Although prophylatic antibiotics has been proven to be effective in reducing wound complications after appendectomy, the most efficacous dosage remains uncertain. Aim: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotics after appendectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis. Methods: From July 1995 to December 2000, all patients aged between 15 and 70 years with appendectomy performed via a right lower abdominal incision were considered for the study. Exclusion criteria included pre-admission antibiotics, diabetes mellitus, known drug allergy and ruptured appendicitis. Intravenous Cefuroxime, 1.5g, and Metronidazole, 500 mg were given at induction of anaesthesia. After appendectomy, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment protocols: (A) no further antibiotics, (B) 2 more doses of antibiotics, or (C) a 5-day course of antibiotics. Outcomes of surgery were compared using 1-way ANOVA or Chi-square where appropriate. Results: Of 275 patients recruited, 6 had normal appendix revealed by histology and were excluded. Treatment A, B and C were assigned to 92, 94 and 83 patients, respectively. The 3 groups were comparable in demographics and pre-operative characteristics. The outcomes were as follows: Conclusions: A single dose of preoperative antibiotics is adequate for prevention of wound infection in non-perforated appendicitis. Prolonged use of antibiotics is cost-ineffective and may lead to unnecessary complications.

AB  - The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in management of acute cholecystitis remained controversial. Unless contraindicated or refused, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy was offered to patients suffered from acute cholecystitis in our department. Patients data and outcome were collected and analyzed to assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure and to identify predictive factors for conversion. From January 1999 to December 2000, a total of 78 patients with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were operated. 18 patients had immediate open operation due to previous upper abdominal surgery, or presence of septic shock/peritonitis. Laparoscopic cholecystomy (LC) were successful in 41 (68.3%) of the remaining 60 patients and converted in 19 (31.7%). No mortality was found in the successful or attempted laparoscopic group but 3 patients died in the open group, probably due to poorer premorbid state. The successful LC group had the best outcome in terms of shorter postoperative stay (mean 8.2 days) and less complication rate (7.3%). The only statistically significant predictive factor for conversion are WBC count >19 ? 109/L and duration of symptoms of more than 72 hours after onset. Conclusion: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is safe and effective when operated within 72 hours of symptom onset before significant sepsis occur.

AB  - Objectives: The present study was conducted to report the transitions in the practice of laparoscopic cholecsytectomy since the inception of ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to evaluate the contemporary outcomes of day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: Hospital database of patients who underwent cholecystectomies for benign hepatobiliary pathologies were reviewed between 1993 and 1999. Changes in the practice of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and length of hospital stay were analyzed. Causes for unanticipated admission and readmission were evaluated. Results: Of 2891 laparoscopic cholecystectomies recruited in the present study, 888 (31%) were performed as day case and 2003 (69%) were inpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The annual number of ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy increased from 3 (0.6%) in 1993 to 212 (48%) in 1997, which was followed by a plateau in the next 3 years. There was a significant shift of patients who used to stay overnight to same day discharge, accounting for the increment of ambulatory procedures. Twenty-eight (3.2%) patients were admitted overnight after operation because of pain (n = 11), nausea and vomiting (n = 7) and other reasons (n = 10). Conclusions: The present study demonstrated a net trend towards ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Post-operative pain was the commonest reason for unanticipated admission after operation. Ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy heralds the wave of the future.

AB  - Objective: To study the long-term upper tract complications in patients with ileal conduit urinary diversion following total cystectomy. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective review of all the patients who attended regular follow-up at the Urostoma Clinic of a general hospital in year 1999. 86 patients were available for analysis: male-to-female ratio 2:1, age 24 to 92 (mean 70.6) years, duration of follow-up 1.1 to 28.5 (mean 10.5) years. 87.2% of the patients had had total cystectomy for bladder cancer. Results: Among the 86 patients, the incidences of acute pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis and impairment of renal function were 11.6% (10), 46.5% (40) and 46.5% (40) respectively. Four patients eventually developed end stage renal failure. Presence of acute pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis correlated with subsequent development of renal impairment (p < 0.05). At 5 and 10 years, incidences of hydronephrosis were 19.8% and 32.6% respectively, incidences of renal impairment were 27.9% and 37.2% respectively, and the overall incidences of having either or both of these upper tract complications were 33.7% and 50.0% respectively. Ultrasonography and/or intravenous urography were the first-line investigations to screen for hydronephrosis. Of the 40 patients with hydronephrosis, 25 had non-obstructed ureters as confirmed by contrast studies and DTPA renography, and the other 15 required flexible conduitoscopy?with contrast conduitography, retrograde pyelo-ureterography and/or biopsy?to ascertain the nature of urinary obstruction: mid-conduit stenosis (1), tumour recurrence at anastomosis (1), anastomotic stricture (9) and ureteral stricture (4). One other patient was incidentally found to have TCC in left renal pelvis. Of the 86 patients, 13 had remedial surgical intervention for the complications, including: balloon dilatation of mid-conduit stenosis (1), nephrectomy (5), revision of ileal conduit (5) and conversion to continent cutaneous diversion (2). Conclusions: Ileal conduit urinary diversion resulted in signifi-cant long-term upper tract complications. 50% of the patients developed complications by 10 years. Regular long-term follow-up is mandatory.

AB  - Background: Urodynamic studies like uroflowmetry and pressure flow study can be performed in various postures although the natural posture for male subjects is standing. Difference in posture may affect voiding performance and make comparison of results from different centers difficult. Aim: To evaluate whether posture (sitting and standing) in male patients would significantly affect the parameters of uroflowmetry and voiding efficiency. Patients and Method: This was a prospective randomized study. Consecutive male patients attending outpatient uroflowmetry from June to August 2000 were recruited. Uroflow was performed in sitting and standing posture. In order to eliminate accustomisation, they were randomized into first sitting or first standing. Uroflow parameters like voided volume, residual urine, voiding efficiency, peak and mean flow rate were analysed by 2-tailed paired t-test. Results: There were 74 subjects (first sitting 35, first standing 39) and age was comparable. There was no statistically significant difference among all the parameters with respect to posture. To our surprise there was also no accustomisation effect, probably due to adequate patient instruction. Conclusion: Uroflow parameters and voiding function are the same in sitting or standing position for male subjects.

AB  - Reconstructive procedures of the head and neck aim to repair soft tissue and bony defects while restoring optimal function and cosmesis. The development of microvascular surgery has offered the possibility of free tissue transfer from distant sites to head and neck area. This allows reconstruction of composite defect in one stage. We would like to review a group of patients with various head and neck defects which were reconstructed with microvascular free flap. Between January 1995 and December 2000, seventy nine patients underwent 82 microvascular free flap reconstruction following major head and neck resection. There were 26 fibular, 25 radial forearm, 20 jejunal, 4 lateral arm, 4 rectus abdominus, 2 latissimus dorsi and 1 groin flaps. The majority (95%) of patients had advanced head and neck cancer. The common tumor sites were oral cavity (55%), hypopharynx (23%) and mandible (9%). Three patients (4%) died perioperatively. There were five total flap failure (6%). The overall major morbidity was 17%, including anastomotic leakage, orocutaneous fistula and major wound infection. The general medical complications rate was 17%. Donor site morbidity rate was 11% and the majority were in form of superficial wound infection. Given the good results observed and versatility of free flaps, we concluded that microvascular grafts should be considered in reconstructing head and neck defects following major ablative surgery.
