AB  - The treatment of acute hepatic failure has developed rapidly over the last 40 years, reducing morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. Whilst this has been partly attributed to significant improvements in the specialist medical management of these patients, advances in surgical techniques and pharmaceutical developments have led to the establishment of successful liver transplantation programmes, which have improved mortality significantly. This review will examine the clinical impact of alternative methods that have been used to provide extra-corporeal hepatic support. Non-biological, bio- logical and hybrid hepatic extra-corporeal support will be explored, offering a comprehensive historical overview and an appraisal of present and future advances.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract Purpose to evaluate the current rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) in our medico-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), to identify risk factors, and to determine the outcome of PE in ICU. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients requiring intensive care admission during a one-year period. We included, in this prospective study, all the patients with confirmed PE admitted in ICU with more than 18 years of age, and expected to stay in ICU for more than 48 hours. Only the patients who had a clinical suspicion (unexplained hypoxemia and/or shock) for PE underwent diagnostic studies. Results During the study period, 842 patients were admitted in our ICU. One hundred and two patients were excluded. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed in 75 patients (10.1%). In our study, all patients (100%) had received some forms of pharmaceutical prophylaxis (PP) during ICU stay. The median time from ICU admission to diagnosis of PE was 6 days. The diagnosis of PE was made by spiral CT in 74 patients (98.7%), and by echocardiography in 1 case (1.3%). The mean ICU stay was 26.3 ± 26.5 days (median: 20 days). During their ICU stay, 73 patients (97.3%) developed one, or more, organ failure. Respiratory failure was the most observed (97.3%). Moreover, 38 patients (50.6%) developed nosocomial infections and 29 (38.6%) died. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with mortality were the presence of shock the day of PE diagnosis and the presence of right ventricular dilatation on echocardiography. Conclusion Our findings confirm that subjects in the ICU are at high risk of PE, due to a high number of risk-factors. PE was associated with higher ICU mortality and a significantly higher ICU LOS. Our results invite to revise the preventive strategies of deep venous thrombosis and PE in patients requiring ICU admission.

AB  - The case of a 78 year old man who presented with fever and hepatic abscesses is reported. He was found to have an infected abdominal aortic aneurysm and the organism cultured was Streptococcus milleri. He was treated with an in situ Dacron graft and high-dose intravenous penicillin. This may be suitable treatment when Gram-positive organisms are involved and there is no gross peritoneal soiling.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses various urinary and renal diseases in small animals. Disorders of the upper and lower urinary tract can produce nonspecific clinical signs including anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and weight loss. Several signs can be helpful in localizing disorders, and the discussed terminology is useful in describing clinical signs associated with disorders of the urinary tract. Patients with urinary tract disorders, and more specifically renal diseases, can have impaired metabolism and excretion abilities, putting them an increased risk for adverse events when administered certain medications and anesthetics. Patients with urinary tract diseases often require the administration of anesthesia for diagnostic and treatment procedures, making it important for nursing staff to understand how anesthetics can affect the renal patient. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying structural problems of the upper and lower urinary tract including stones, tumors, changes in kidney architecture such as pyelectasia, and evaluating for the presence of obstructions.

AB  - Abstract Background Knowledge about patients with acute liver failure (ALF) in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) is lacking. Aims To evaluate whether the pattern of ALF would be similar to previous studies and whether, despite potentially low transplantation rates, mortality would be comparable. Methods We obtained data from the ANZ Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database and the ANZ Liver Transplant Registry for 10 years commencing 2005 and analysed for patient outcomes. Results During the study period, 1?022?698 adults were admitted to intensive care units across ANZ, of which 723 had ALF. The estimated annual incidence of ALF over this period was 3.4/million people and increased over time (P = 0.001). ALF patients had high illness severity (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III 79.8 vs 50.1 in non-ALF patients; P < 0.0001) and were more likely to be younger, female, pregnant and immunosuppressed. ALF was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio 1.5 (1.26?1.79); P < 0.0001). At less than 23%, the use of liver transplantation was low, but the mortality of 39% was similar to previous studies. Conclusions ALF is a rare but increasing diagnosis in ANZ intensive care units. Low transplantation rates in ANZ for ALF do not appear to be associated with higher mortality rates than reported in the literature.

AB  - Since Haissaguerre and his colleagues demonstrated the importance of the pulmonary veins in the generation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 1998, a variety of different ablative interventions have been performed to eliminate AF. Various complications related to catheterization, ablation itself including pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial effusion, stroke, and atrioesophageal fistula have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome characterized by enhanced activation of coagulation with some intravascular fibrin formation and deposition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient whose condition was complicated by DIC after segmental ostial isolation of pulmonary veins for persistent AF. The patient has completely recovered from the DIC by hemodialysis, administration of blood constituents for 15 days.
