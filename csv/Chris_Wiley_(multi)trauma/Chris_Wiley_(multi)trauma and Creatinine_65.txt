The change in management of donor organs into HCV and non-HCV patients likely contributed to this outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: The goal of this study was to compare the antegrade-approach and bilateral-approach strategies for chronic total occlusion (CTO). Background: The retrograde approach has been reported for difficult CTO lesions. Methods: This study assessed 96 consecutive patients with 119 CTO lesions. The lesions were treated with either an antegrade approach (A group) or a combined bilateral antegrade and retrograde approach (B group). The specific intervention techniques, in-hospital success rate, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were compared. Results: Lesions with well-developed septal collaterals with nontortuous microchannels were preferentially chosen for the B group versus A group (P < 0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Compared with the A group, there were more CTO lesions located in the right coronary artery in the B group (P < 0.001). In the B group, the CTO lesions had a longer length and needed stiffer wires for crossing than in the A group (P = 0.001 and 0.046, respectively). The technical success rate was 94% and 86% for the A group and the B group, respectively (P = 0.127). In-hospital complications were not different between the two groups. The B group needed a higher radiation exposure dose and a greater exposure time than the A group (P < 0.001). In the B group, use of the retrograde method significantly increased the final success rate. Conclusions: These results suggest that all CTO lesions should first be managed with an antegrade approach. When there is difficulty crossing the lesion, switching to a bilateral approach is an option for lesions with well-developed collaterals. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise throughout the world by patients looking for ?safer? alternatives. However, data on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to CAM are lacking. In a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we retrospectively studied CAM-related health-seeking behavior and attempted to identify those who developed possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF. In this study, we examine the clinical, biochemical, and liver histopathologic characteristics of possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF, describe implicated CAM agents, and discuss predictors of patient outcomes. Out of 1,666 patients with cirrhosis, 68% used CAM at some point. A total of 35.7% (n = 30/84) patients presented with CAM-related DILI leading to ACLF in the whole CAM-DILI-related decompensation cohort. The most common CAM was unlabeled polyherbal Ayurvedic formulations. Of possible patients with ACLF, 63% self-medicated with CAM based on social media sharing. Mean age ± SD was 51.9 ± 9.9 years, 83% were male patients, median follow-up duration was 173 (range, 14-584) days, median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 13 (range, 10-14), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium score was 30.1 ± 4.8, median chronic liver failure-organ failure (CLIF-C-OF) score was 11 (range, 8-14), and median CLIF-C-ACLF score was 98 (range, 87-127). Portal-based neutrophilic predominant mixed inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, autoimmune-like features, and severe cholestasis were seen on liver biopsy. Overall, 53% of patients died (median survival 194 days). Baseline overt hepatic encephalopathy and CLIF-C-OF score, total bilirubin, hyponatremia and leukocytosis, and grade of ACLF predicted 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month mortality, respectively. Conclusion: Possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF has a high mortality. Strict monitoring and identification of CAM use among people with cirrhosis and an integrative public health educational practice can help ameliorate this modifiable risk factor that potentiates heavy liver disease burden and resource use.

AB  - Background Apixaban and rivaroxaban are approved for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and embolic stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The aim of this study was to find appropriate methods of monitoring the anticoagulant effects of are direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and establish on-therapy ranges using conventional tests. Methods A total of 184 samples were collected from 91 patients receiving DOACs. Concentrations of apixaban and rivaroxaban in plasma were accessed by an anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay. PT, APTT, antithrombin, D-dimer, dRVVT screen/confirm, FDP, and fibrinogen levels were measured. On-therapy ranges were calculated by substituting previously reported trough plasma concentrations of DOACs. Results Anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay-based DOACs levels were 26.0-279.5 (115.9 ± 56.5) ng/mL for apixaban at 2.5 mg BID, 19.9-565.1 (205.3 ± 162.4) ng/mL for apixaban at 5 mg BID, 2.3-395.3 (205.3 ± 162.4) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 15 mg OD, 3.6-494.8 (119.6 ± 95.1) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 20 mg OD, and 9.6-431.4 (140.8 ± 113.6) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 15 mg BID. PT (%), antithrombin, and dRVVT confirm tests showed good correlation with plasma apixaban levels. Plasma rivaroxaban concentrations were correlated well with PT (sec), PT (%),and dRVVT confirm results. On-therapy ranges established for dRVVT confirm test by linear regression were as follows: 1.32-1.52 for apixaban 2.5 mg BID, 1.12-1.75 for apixaban 5 mg BID, 1.11-1.78 for rivaroxaban 15 mg OD, 1.09-1.64 for rivaroxaban 20 mg OD, and 1.22-1.81 for rivaroxaban 20 mg BID. Conclusions Apixaban concentrations were well correlated with PT (%), antithrombin, and dRVVT confirm test. Rivaroxaban concentrations showed good correlation with PT (sec), PT (%), and dRVVT confirm test.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (cohort) Level of Evidence?2b What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Tumour in a solitary functioning kidney represents an absolute indication for nephron-sparing surgery whenever technically feasible. We report the longest follow-up data comparing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic cryoablation in patients with solitary kidney with oncological follow-up to five years. OBJECTIVES ??We compare perioperative, functional and intermediate-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) vs laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) for small renal tumour in patients with a solitary kidney. ??A treatment algorithm is also proposed. PATIENT AND METHODS ??Over a 10-year period (02/1998-09/2008), 78 patients with a small tumour in a functionally solitary kidney underwent LPN (n= 48) or LCA (n= 30). ??Baseline, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS ??Demographic data were similar between the LPN and LCA groups. Tumours were somewhat larger (3.2 vs 2.6?cm) in the LPN group. LPN was associated with greater blood loss (391 vs 162?mL; P= 0.003), and trended towards more post-operative complications (22.9% vs 6.7%; P= 0.07). ??By 3 months post-operative, eGFR decreased by 14.5% and 7.3% after LPN and LCA, respectively (P= 0.02). Post-operative temporary dialysis was required after 3 LPN (6.2% vs 0%, P= 0.16). ??Median follow-up time for LPN and LCA was 42.7 and 60.2 months, respectively. ??Local recurrence was detected in 4 (13.3%) LCA patients only (P= 0.02). ??Overall survival was comparable between LPN and LCA at 3 and 5 years, respectively (P= 0.74). The LPN group had superior cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival at 3 and 5 years compared to the LCA group (P < 0.05, for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS ??Given adequate technical expertise, both LPN and LCA are viable nephron-sparing options for patients with tumour in a solitary kidney. ??Although LCA is technically easier and has superior functional outcomes, oncologic outcomes are superior after LPN.
