AB  - SUMMARY Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery (MOS) whereas hematinic deficiency can delay the recovery from postoperative anemia. Both conditions can, however, be corrected before elective procedures are undertaken. We therefore evaluated the prevalence of anemia and hematinic deficiencies in MOS patients. Demographic and laboratory data were gathered from all MOS patients from a single institution between January 2001 and December 2002. A total of 715 patients (483 women/232 men) entered the study. According to WHO criteria, the prevalence of anemia was 10.5% and increased with age, without gender-related differences. Preoperative hemoglobin was <?13?g/dL in 19.4% of patients, and the prevalence of hematinic deficiencies was 33% for iron, 12.3% for vitamin B12 and 3% for folate. In anemic patients, there were 30.8% with hematinic deficiency anemia (20% with iron-deficiency anemia), 30.8% with anemia of chronic disease and 38.4% with anemia of mixed or indeterminate cause. The prevalence of anemia, as well as of hematinic deficiencies, is high in MOS patients. Therefore, whenever possible, patients undergoing MOS should be assessed early enough to allow for proper investigation and treatment prior to the scheduled procedure.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most serious complications seen in intensive care units (ICUs). However, its epidemiology, risk factors and clinical outcomes in surgical critically ill patients remains unclear. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of the university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. AKI was diagnosed according to the KDIGO 2012 criteria. Results A total of 189 of the 400 patients enrolled in our study developed AKI (47.3%). The severity was: stage 1 = 29.6% of all AKI (56 cases), stage 2 = 30.7% (58 cases), and stage 3 = 39.7% (75 cases). Risk factors of AKI development included a higher BMI, a greater APACHE-II score, septic shock, use of mechanical ventilation, acute medical complications during surgical admission, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. After adjustment for covariates, only the most severe stage of AKI (stage 3) was associated with increasing 28-day ICU mortality compared with no AKI stage, HR = 7.75 (95% CI, 1.46?41.20, P = 0.02). Conclusion Acute kidney injury is common and is associated with an increase in mortality in surgical ICU patients. There should be more focus on patients with AKI risk factors to prevent this deleterious event.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Vascular calcification has played a vital role in increasing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) estimated by plain lateral abdominal radiography in MHD patients. Methods Lateral abdominal radiography was used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS). The serum level of fibroblast growth factor-23 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were divided into two groups: no or minor calcification group (AACS <?5) and moderate to severe calcification group (AACS ≥?5). All patients were followed up to death or the end of the study (30 November 2016). Results A total of 114 patients were enrolled in this study, including 64 males (56.1%), and the mean age was 57.42?±?13.48?years. Seventy-six patients (66.7%) exhibited AAC. Independent predictors for moderate to severe calcification were older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.02?1.10), P = 0.003), longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.01 (1.00?1.02), P = 0.039), presence of smoking (OR 3.01 (1.18?7.70), P = 0.021) and higher Log fibroblast growth factor-23 serum levels (OR 2.83 (1.01?7.94), P = 0.048). During a median follow-up of 6.0 (5.6, 6.1) years, 22 patients (19.3%) died of all-cause death, and 17 cases (14.9%) died of CVD. Kaplan?Meier survival curves showed that patients in the moderate to severe calcification group had significantly higher all-cause (28.3 vs 11.5%, P = 0.028) and CVD mortality (22.6 vs 8.2%, P = 0.035) than that in the no or minor calcification group. A multivariate Cox regression showed that AACS (hazard ratio 1.08 (1.01?1.15), P = 0.022) was an independent predictor of CVD mortality. Compared with the no or minor calcification group, the risk of CVD mortality was increased by a factor of 3.14 in patients in the moderate to severe calcification group (hazard ratio 3.14 (1.04?9.44), P = 0.042). Conclusion Our data suggest that AAC is prevalent in MHD patients and could provide potential predictive information for CVD mortality. Plain lateral abdominal radiography, which is simple and cheap and involves lower radiation, might represent an appropriate screening method for evaluating vascular calcification in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Background: Although liver resection has become an established procedure in western countries and South-east Asia it is still not performed frequently in most centres in India. In the last 10 years newly created specialized units have been performing more liver resections but no major series have been reported. Patients and methods: We analysed the results of 241 hepatic resections in the Gyan Burman Liver Unit, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital to compare our results with those published from established centres and to identify the factors relating to morbidity and mortality. To examine the effect of a greater experience with the procedure we compared the outcome of our operations from 1996?2000 (first period) and those from 2001?2005 (second period). Results: The overall mortality and morbidity rates were 6.6% and 44.8%, respectively, which are comparable with those of most recently published Western series. Life-threatening complications occurred in 12.4% patients. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of comorbid conditions, intraoperative blood transfusions of >3 units, hepatocellular carcinoma with underlying cirrhosis and gall bladder carcinoma with jaundice were the independent risk factors for morbidity, whereas the presence of comorbid illness and underlying liver cirrhosis were the risk factors for mortality. During the second period there was an increase in the number of operations performed (66 vs 175; first vs second period), but the mortality rates remained essentially unchanged (6.1% vs 6.8%). Discussion: Hepatic resections can be performed safely in India with results comparable to those achieved in the West. Increasing experience did not reduce overall mortality. Perhaps more careful patient selection and better perioperative management of comorbid illnesses may reduce the morbidity and mortality further.
