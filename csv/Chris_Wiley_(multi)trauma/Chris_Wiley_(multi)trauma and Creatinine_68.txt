AB  - Summary Objective? To compare the prevalence of genitourinary abnormalities in men diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) in a Cameroonian hospital and those without. Patients and methods? Consecutive adult men aged 18?75?years, whose midstream urine samples were received for microscopy, culture and sensitivity at the microbiology laboratory of the Yaounde University Teaching Hospital, Cameroon, constituted the study population. Genitourinary abnormalities were diagnosed from history, physical examination, abdominal and transrectal ultrasonography, plain abdominal X-ray, and if indicated urethrocystoscopy and biopsy. Results? Of the 206 patients who qualified, 179 completed the study and 63 (35.2%) were found to have UTI. A total of 41 (65.1%) patients with UTI (mean age 69.2?years) had at least one genitourinary abnormality, compared to 13 (11.2%) of those without UTI (mean age 61.9?years) (P?<?0.001). The age-adjusted prevalence of genitourinary abnormalities was 59.4% in the UTI group and 12.1% in the non-UTI group (P?<?0.001). The most frequent genitourinary abnormality in men with UTI was benign prostatic enlargement, followed by urethral stricture. The crude odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for UTI associated with genitourinary abnormality was 14.77 (6.80?32.05), and the adjusted odds ratio 11.51 (7.08?29.46). Conclusion? Urological evaluation of Cameroonian men with UTI, using simple history taking, physical examination, ultrasound examination and plain abdominal X-ray, could have significant clinical benefits in this tropical African region.

AB  - Abstract Modification of the current allocation system for donor livers in the United States to incorporate recipient serum sodium concentration ([Na]) has recently been proposed. However, the impact of this parameter on posttransplantation mortality has not been previously examined in a large risk-adjusted analysis. We assessed the effect of recipient [Na] on the survival of all adults with chronic liver disease who received a first single organ liver transplant in the UK and Ireland during the period March 1, 1994 to March 31, 2005 (n = 5,152) at 3 years, during the first 90 days, and beyond the first 90 days, adjusting for a wide range of recipient, donor, and graft characteristics. Compared to those with normal [Na] (135?145 meq/L; n = 3,066), severely hyponatremic recipients ([Na] <130 meq/L, n = 541), had a higher risk-adjusted mortality at 3 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04?1.59; P < 0.02). The excess mortality was, however, confined to the first 90 days (HR 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18?2.04; P < 0.002) with no significant difference thereafter. This was also true for hypernatremic recipients ([Na] >145 meq/L, n = 81), who had an even greater risk-adjusted mortality compared to normonatremic recipients (overall: HR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25?2.73; P < 0.002; ≤90 days: HR 2.29; 95% CI, 1.42?3.70; P < 0.001; >90 days: HR 1.12; 95% CI, 0.55?2.29; P = 0.8), whereas mildly hyponatremic recipients ([Na] 130?134 meq/L, n = 1,127) had similar risk-adjusted mortality to those with normal [Na] at the same time points. In conclusion, recipient [Na] is an independent predictor of death following liver transplantation. Attempts to correct the [Na] toward the normal reference range are an important aspect of pretransplantation management. Liver Transpl 13:1115?1124, 2007. ? 2007 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract? Objective: The objective was to examine the influence of gender in diabetic patients following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: A study from an 11-year hospitalization cohort with prospective data collection was conducted. Included in the study were diabetic patients undergoing CABG surgery between October 1993 and May 2004 (n = 2781). Patients who underwent any surgery other than CABG or had a previous cardiac surgery were excluded. The study examined 25 risk factors and 14 outcome variables. Results: Twelve risk factors were found to be significantly different between male and female diabetic patients undergoing CABG. Correlation coefficients were computed among the 12 significant risk factors. Three main risk factors emerged: age 70 years or greater, abnormal LVH, and number of grafts. For outcome variables, females experienced more renal complications, intraoperative complications, longer hospital stay, and mortality. Logistic regression analysis showed that after controlling for age, LVH, and number of grafts, female diabetic patients undergoing CABG were more likely to experience intraoperative complications (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0, p = 0.025) and longer hospital stay (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.039). However, there was no significant difference between male and female diabetic patients after CABG surgery with renal complications (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95-2.1, p = 0.132) or mortality (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.85-2.8, p = 0.153). Conclusion: Female diabetic patients, when compared to male diabetic patients undergoing CABG, have significantly more intraoperative complications and longer hospital stays following surgery.

AB  - A 16-year-old, neutered male, domestic short hair cat had abdominal distension and systemic hypertension. Radiography, ultrasonography, excretory urography, and renal scintigraphy were performed to establish the diagnosis and implement appropriate treatment. Bilateral perirenal pseudocysts were confirmed surgically and histopathologically. Following bilateral renal capsulectomy, systemic hypertension decreased and global glomerular filtration rate improved to normal limits. Multiple imaging modalities helped establish the diagnosis and guided implementation of appropriate treatment.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic severe malarial anaemia (SMA) has a high fatality rate of 30?40%; most deaths occur in children awaiting blood transfusion. Blood transfusion services in most of Africa are not capable of delivering adequate supplies of safe blood in a timely manner to critically ill children with SMA. Contrary to widely held belief, hypovolaemia, rather than heart failure, has emerged as a common complication in such children. We examined the safety of pre-transfusion management (PTM) by volume expansion, aimed at stabilizing children and obviating the urgency for blood transfusion. Kenyan children with severe falciparum anaemia (haemoglobin?<?5?g/dl) and respiratory distress were randomly assigned to 20?ml/kg of 4·5% albumin or 0·9% saline or maintenance only (control) while awaiting blood transfusion. PTM was apparently safe since it did not lead to the development of pulmonary oedema or other adverse events. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome [mean percentage reduction in base excess between admission and 8?h (95% confidence interval)] between the control group 42% (19?66%) albumin group 44% (32?57%) and saline group 36% (16?57%); adjusted analysis of variance F?=?0·31, P?=?0·7. However, the number of children requiring emergency interventions was significantly greater in the control group, four of 18 (22%) than the saline group 0 of 20 (P?=?0·03). We have established the safety of this PTM in children with SMA whilst awaiting blood transfusion at a hospital with an adequate blood-banking program. The impact on mortality should be assessed where blood transfusion services are unable to supply emergency transfusions.
