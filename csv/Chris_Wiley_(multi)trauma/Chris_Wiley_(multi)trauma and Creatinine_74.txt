AB  - Summary Entrance of air into the pleural cavity results in positive intrapleural pressure that causes collapse of the lungs, with a subsequent drop in venous return and cardiac output. In dogs or cats, esophageal perforation can lead to pneumothorax, and it can also result from rupture of an emphysematous bulla, pleural bleb, neoplasm, Paragonimus cyst, or abscessed lung lobe. Thoracocentesis should be performed when pneumothorax is suspected and it might be required as a life-saving procedure prior to radiographic or ultrasonographic confirmation of air accumulation. In more severely affected animals, tachypnea and respiratory distress can occur, or collapse can result from pneumomediastinum accompanied by pneumothorax. Mediastinitis or a mediastinal mass effect can result from fungal infection causing enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, or by bacteria directly inoculated through the thoracic wall or entering via an esophageal or tracheal route. Chylothorax is caused by leakage of lymphatic fluid from the thoracic duct into the pleural cavity.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the new Cobalt?Chromium (Co-Cr) Presillion? stent for the treatment of high-risk acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent represents the gold standard treatment for acute MI. Methods and Results: We enrolled patients with high-risk acute MI (either ST-segment elevation MI or non-ST-segment elevation MI) treated with PCI using a new Co-Cr bare metal stent with closed cells design and limited balloon compliance. We considered high-risk features as one of the following: age ≥70 years, ejection fraction ≤35%, glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min, diabetes mellitus, rescue PCI, or chronic atrial fibrillation or other conditions requiring long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. Primary outcome of the study was rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, new MI, and target-vessel revascularization. A total of 129 consecutive patients were enrolled (69 ± 11 years, 74% men): 71 (55%) patients with ST-segment elevation MI and 58 (45%) patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI. A total of 153 vessels (169 lesions and 179 stents) were treated. The device success rate was high (98.8%). In-hospital MACE rate was 5.4% mainly because of death associated with the acute MI. At 1-year follow-up, the MACE rate was 17.3%, with 11% all-cause death (7.9% of cardiac origin), 0.6% of stent thrombosis, and 4.6% target-vessel revascularization. Conclusions: The use of the Co-Cr Presillion stent in patients with high-risk acute MI treated invasively seems to be safe and efficacious with optimal deliverability and good long-term outcomes and represents a good option in the treatment of these patients. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Efforts to increase deceased donation have included the use of US Public Health Service (PHS) high-risk donors. The homeless have high rates of medical and substance abuse issues that are often unrecognized. This study investigates whether the homeless should become suitable organ donors. We retrospectively reviewed 193 brain-dead prospective donors from Hawaii's organ procurement organization (OPO; 2013-2018) and compared two groups: homeless (n = 13) and non-homeless (n = 180) prospective donors. The homeless prospective donors were older (48.0 vs 40.7 years, P = .009) and had more substance abuse (30.8% vs 10%, P = .046), methamphetamine use (53.8% vs 12.2%, P = .001), cocaine use (23.1% vs 3.9%, P = .022), and urine with amphetamines (54.5% vs 17.9%, P = .049). The homeless prospective donors trended toward more PHS high-risk designation (50% vs 19%, P = .062). There was no difference in medical history, gender/race, hepatitis serologies, authorization for donation, and organs procured/transplanted between prospective donors. We have provided evidence that the homeless should become prospective organ donors; however, they have more high-risk behaviors and often have limited information. Larger studies from OPOs are needed to better characterize organ donation and track disease transmission in this population.

AB  - Objective To assess the use of local haemostatic agents (HAs) in a prospective multicentre large series of partial nephrectomies (PNs). Patients and Methods Prospective National Observational Registry on the Practices of Haemostasis in Partial Nephrectomy (NEPHRON): the study was conducted in 54 French urological centres from 1 June to 31 December 2010. In all, 570 consecutive patients undergoing a PN were enrolled in this study in a prospective manner. The data was collected prospectively via an electronic case-report form: five different sheets were included for preoperative, perioperative, postoperative and follow-up data respectively. Information related to haemostasis was analysed. Results The median patient age was 60 years and the mean (range) tumour size was 3.68 (0.19?15) cm. An HA was primarily used in 71.4% of patients, with a statistically significant difference among surgical approaches (P = 0.024). In 91.8% of cases, a single use of a HA was sufficient for achieving haemostasis. The HA was used either alone (13.9%) or in association with sutures (80.3%). One or more additional haemostatic action(s) was needed in 12.3% of the cases. When comparing patients who received a HA with those who did not receive a HA, there was no statistical difference between the groups for tumour size (P = 0.542), collecting system drainage (P = 0.538), hospital stay (P = 0.508), operation time (P = 0.169), blood loss (P = 0.387) or transfusion rate (P = 0.713). Conclusion HAs are widely used by urologists during PN. Progress is needed for standardising HA application, especially for the timing of application. For the time being, the role of the HA in nephron-sparing surgery is still to be evaluated.
