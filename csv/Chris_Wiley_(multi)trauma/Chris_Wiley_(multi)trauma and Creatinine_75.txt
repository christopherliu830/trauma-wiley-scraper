AB  - ABSTRACT Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in renal transplant recipients. Frequency of UTIs depend on many factors such as age, female gender, kidney function, co-morbidity, type and amount of immunosuppression, urological instrumentation and/or the follow-up period (short term or long term) after kidney transplantation. UTI may worsen graft and patient survival. A significant proportion of renal transplant recipients with UTIs may develop acute pyelonephritis (APN), which is an independent risk factor for deterioration of graft function. Renal transplant recipients with UTIs are often clinically asymptomatic as a consequence of immunosuppression. UTI, however, may progress to APN (particularly in the early post-transplant period), bacteraemia and the full blown picture of urosepsis. Strategies for long term prophylaxis and antimicrobial treatment of UTI in renal transplant recipients are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Rhabdomyolysis has been reported infrequently with salmonella infection. Since 1964, there have been at least 22 reports associated with gastroenteritis or bacteraemia. Twenty cases have been associated with non-typhoidal strains of Salmonella, with single reports of Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi and Typhi. A second case of typhoid fever associated with rhabdomyolysis was recently diagnosed in Ann Arbor, USA in a traveller returning from an endemic area. Prompt diagnosis and treatment resulted in a good outcome. Salmonella infection should be considered by clinicians as a possibility in the differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - A 7-year-old female spayed domestic shorthair cat was referred to the urology service for nonsurgical urocystolith removal. A urolith was attached to the urothelium by ectopic bone. Interventional removal without surgery was successful. Follow-up evaluation 3 years after urolith removal revealed recurrent uroliths, bladder wall mineralization, and marked renal mineralization. This case illustrates the metaplastic potential of the urothelium and that ectopic bone should be included among the pathological factors that promote lithogenesis.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to describe a single-center experience with neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal life support (ECLS) and compare patient-related outcomes with those of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry. A retrospective review of subject characteristics, outcomes, and complications of patients who received the ECLS at Penn State Health Children?s Hospital (PSHCH) from 2000 to 2016 was performed. Fisher?s exact test was used to compare the PSHCH outcomes and complications to the ELSO Registry report. Data from 118 patients were included. Survival to discontinuation of the ECLS was 70.3% and 65.2% to discharge/transfer. Following circuitry equipment changes, the survival to discharge/transfer improved for both neonatal (<29 days) and pediatric (29 days to <18 years) patients. The most common complications associated with ECLS were clinical seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and culture-proven infection. ECLS for pulmonary support appeared to be associated with a higher risk of circuit thrombus and cannula problems. When compared to the ELSO Registry, low volume ECLS centers, like our institution, can have outcomes that are no different or statistically better as noted with neonatal and pediatric cardiac patients. Pediatric patients requiring pulmonary support appeared to experience more mechanical complications during ECLS suggesting the need for ongoing technological improvement.

Liver transplantation using elderly donors: a risk factor analysis. ?Clin Transplant 2011: 25: 270?276. ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Survival after liver transplantation is negatively impacted by use of elderly deceased donors, but excluding them would increase waiting times and waiting list mortality. We reviewed our experience with liver transplantation (LT) utilizing livers from deceased donors 65?yr of age and older to identify those factors that impact graft survival. All adult patients (≥18?yr old) who underwent primary LT using deceased donor livers from donors aged ≥65?yr between February 1995 and November 2003 were included. With multivariate analysis we found four unfavorable characteristics significantly associated with higher post-transplant graft failure rate. These characteristics are hepatitis C as an etiology of liver disease, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score >20, serum glucose level of donor >200?mg/dL at the time of liver recovery, and skin incision to aortic cross-clamp time >40?minutes in the donor surgery. The five-yr estimated graft survival rates having 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 unfavorable characteristics were 100%, 82.0%, 81.7%, 39.3%, and 25.0%, respectively (p?<?0.05). Our data demonstrated good graft survival can be achieved in LT using elderly donor liver allografts with appropriate patient selection, donor blood glucose management and efficient liver recovery with minimal manipulation of the liver during donor surgery.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims The long-term clinical outcomes in initial survivors with acute liver failure (ALF) are not well known. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the 2-year clinical outcomes among initial survivors and liver transplant (LT) recipients that were alive 3 weeks after enrolment in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG). Methods Outcomes in adult ALFSG patients that were enrolled between 1998 and 2010 were reviewed. Results Two-year patient survival was significantly higher in the 262 LT recipients (92.4%) compared to the 306 acetaminophen (APAP) spontaneous survivors (SS) (89.5%) and 200 non-APAP SS (75.5%) (P < 0.0001). The causes of death were similar in the three groups but the time to death was significantly longer in the LT recipients (P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of 2-year mortality in the APAP group were a high serum phosphate level and patient age (c-statistic = 0.65 (0.54, 0.76)), patient age and days from jaundice to ALF onset in the non-APAP group (c-statistic = 0.69 (0.60, 0.78)), and patient age, days from jaundice, and higher coma grade in the LT recipients (c-statistic = 0.74 (0.61, 0.87)). The LT recipients were significantly more likely to be employed and have a higher educational level (P < 0.05). Conclusions Two-year outcomes in initial survivors of ALF are generally good but non-APAP patients have a significantly lower survival which may relate to pre-existing medical comorbidities. Spontaneous survivors with APAP overdose experience substantial morbidity during follow-up from ongoing psychiatric and substance abuse issues.

AB  - Summary Levetiracetam is a pyrrolidine derivative that differs from all other currently approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in its chemical structure, pharmacological profile and mechanism of action, and as a consequence possesses unique properties. Unlike other AEDs, levetiracetam is not active in standard animal screening models that rely on production of an acute seizure. Levetiracetam shows linear pharmacokinetics. Plasma or serum concentrations of levetiracetam have been determined using gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detection, high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The adverse effect profile of levetiracetam has been well characterized during phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials as well as post-marketing experience. Levetiracetam has a unique position among AEDs because of its pharmacokinetic properties and lack of clinically relevant drug interactions, which make it easy to use with a broad spectrum of activity. The need for laboratory monitoring is minimal when using levetiracetam.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? This study was undertaken to determine whether intensive care unit nurses possess adequate knowledge to implement the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system and to understand nurses? attitudes towards this scoring system. Design.? A questionnaire, which contained 20 multiple-choice questions to test knowledge of the scoring system and 27 statements with a five-points Likert type scale to assess attitude, was developed by researchers for this study. Methods.? The participants consisted of 102 intensive care unit nurses working in adult, emergency, or coronary intensive care units in a large teaching hospital (Veterans General Hospital) in Taiwan, where the APACHE II scoring system is used routinely by nurses. Results.? On the knowledge section of the questionnaire, 76% of the questions were answered correctly. However, more than 50% of the nurses were uncertain about how to score a patient's chronic history status, only 44.1% of the nurses knew that APACHE II total scores range from 0 to 71, and only 37.3% understood that the value for bicarbonate in venous samples could replace the arterial pH value. The results of the attitude questionnaire revealed that nurses believed APACHE II was useful mainly for statistical purposes by the administration rather than for patient care, but acknowledged that the scores could provide a reference for more aggressive treatment. Conclusions.? The questionnaire answers indicated that greater knowledge concerning the APACHE II is needed. Relevance to clinical practice.? Information and training concerning the proper use and purpose of APACHE II needs to be provided, especially for those intensive care unit nurses using this evaluation tool to score patients? conditions routinely.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the pharmacological features of bisphosphonates. It presents clinical trial data-registration studies and outcome data within each registration clinical trial. Bisphosphonates are a highly effective and safe therapy that reduces the risk of all fractures in the postmenopausal population. Their benefit-to-risk ratio strongly favors a benefit in patients at high risk of fracture. They may be associated with side effects, though there is no established causality between bisphosphonate use and osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical midshaft femur fractures. Nevertheless, continued vigilance and better science are important as we learn more about long-term bisphosphonate administration. It appears that high risk patients should not only be treated but that treatment may need to be maintained to reduce further incident fractures. All management decisions in patients, however, need to be made on a case-by-case basis and made with shared decision-making with the patient.

AB  - Summary Diagnostic imaging safety has garnered considerable interest in medical literature because of concerns of health risks attributable to imaging investigation. Perhaps the greatest concern is the likelihood of cancer development, secondary to the use of increasing numbers and exposures of medical radiation, especially resulting from the increasing use of multislice CT scanners. Additional health concerns are the toxicity of iodine-based contrast agents (IBCAs) that are used in CT, and gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) that are used in MRI. The literature on the excretion of GBCAs and IBCAs into breast milk, and the gastro-intestinal absorption of these agents from breast milk is very limited. A review of the literature, however, reveals important facts: less than 1% of the administered maternal dose of contrast agent is excreted into breast milk; and less than 1% of the contrast medium in breast milk ingested by an infant is absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract.
