AB  - Abstract In this editor's review, articles published in 2012 are organized by category and briefly summarized. We aim to provide a brief reflection of the currently available worldwide knowledge that is intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of technologies and methods of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration. As the official journal of the International Federation for Artificial Organs, the International Faculty for Artificial Organs, and the International Society for Rotary Blood Pumps, Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration from all over the world. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide such meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected, and especially to those whose native tongue is not English. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers, the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our publisher, Wiley Periodicals, for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to recording further advances in the coming years.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to describe a single-center experience with neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal life support (ECLS) and compare patient-related outcomes with those of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry. A retrospective review of subject characteristics, outcomes, and complications of patients who received the ECLS at Penn State Health Children?s Hospital (PSHCH) from 2000 to 2016 was performed. Fisher?s exact test was used to compare the PSHCH outcomes and complications to the ELSO Registry report. Data from 118 patients were included. Survival to discontinuation of the ECLS was 70.3% and 65.2% to discharge/transfer. Following circuitry equipment changes, the survival to discharge/transfer improved for both neonatal (<29 days) and pediatric (29 days to <18 years) patients. The most common complications associated with ECLS were clinical seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and culture-proven infection. ECLS for pulmonary support appeared to be associated with a higher risk of circuit thrombus and cannula problems. When compared to the ELSO Registry, low volume ECLS centers, like our institution, can have outcomes that are no different or statistically better as noted with neonatal and pediatric cardiac patients. Pediatric patients requiring pulmonary support appeared to experience more mechanical complications during ECLS suggesting the need for ongoing technological improvement.

Liver transplantation using elderly donors: a risk factor analysis. ?Clin Transplant 2011: 25: 270?276. ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Survival after liver transplantation is negatively impacted by use of elderly deceased donors, but excluding them would increase waiting times and waiting list mortality. We reviewed our experience with liver transplantation (LT) utilizing livers from deceased donors 65?yr of age and older to identify those factors that impact graft survival. All adult patients (≥18?yr old) who underwent primary LT using deceased donor livers from donors aged ≥65?yr between February 1995 and November 2003 were included. With multivariate analysis we found four unfavorable characteristics significantly associated with higher post-transplant graft failure rate. These characteristics are hepatitis C as an etiology of liver disease, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score >20, serum glucose level of donor >200?mg/dL at the time of liver recovery, and skin incision to aortic cross-clamp time >40?minutes in the donor surgery. The five-yr estimated graft survival rates having 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 unfavorable characteristics were 100%, 82.0%, 81.7%, 39.3%, and 25.0%, respectively (p?<?0.05). Our data demonstrated good graft survival can be achieved in LT using elderly donor liver allografts with appropriate patient selection, donor blood glucose management and efficient liver recovery with minimal manipulation of the liver during donor surgery.

AB  - Abstract Background Immunosuppressive drugs may prevent or partially reverse progression of renal AA-amyloidosis, a rare complication of Crohn's disease, often fatal due to renal failure. Materials and methods The clinical, biological and pathological data of 16 patients treated since 1976 were reviewed. Serum amyloid A was determined in surviving patients. Results The median age of the 16 patients (13 men) was 23·5 years (range 16?69). At Crohn's disease onset, Montreal phenotypes were similar to reported data. Out of 15 patients with renal insufficiency, 8 developed a nephrotic syndrome and 7 a low grade proteinuria. The single patient without renal insufficiency had nephrotic syndrome. A significant correlation (P < 0·05) between the extension of renal amyloid A and sclerosis was found in 12 patients. One patient had a 10 year remission of nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive drugs. In 6 patients treated with anti-TNF-α (Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-α) agents, anaphylactic reaction (1/6), death from septic shock (1/6), 5-year remission (1/6) or reduction of nephrotic syndrome (1/6) and stabilization of renal insufficiency (2/6) were observed. Surgery was performed in 10 patients. Kidney transplantation was performed in 5 of the 8 patients dialysed for end-stage renal failure. Among 6/16 patients (37%) still alive, 3 belong to the 5 transplanted patients (survival: 3?20 years) and 3 to the anti-TNF-α drugs treated patients; all but one exhibited a low serum amyloid A level. Conclusions Suppression of Crohn's disease inflammation potentially leads to the control of amyloid A production, assessed by a decrease of serum amyloid A. Kidney transplantation provides a long survival.

AB  - Abstract The majority of oral surgery patients do not require the input of a critical care department (CCD). However, oral surgeons working in secondary care may be involved in the management of such patients. This may be due to surgical complications or sequelae (predicted or otherwise) or for medical reasons. Oral Surgery trainees working within Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery departments are likely to be involved in managing patients whose presenting condition necessitates care within a CCD. This article gives an overview of the reasons for use of a CCD and some of its functions.
