AB  - Summary This chapter provides clues in the physical examination and history that will differentiate cardiac disease from respiratory disease in dyspneic patients. Dogs with cardiac disease commonly have a history of coughing (moist, nocturnal), exercise intolerance, labored breathing, cachexia, and sometimes collapse. Cats rarely have a history of coughing with cardiac disease. Coughing is more commonly seen with bronchial asthma and other pulmonary diseases of cats. The cardiac disease is confirmed with physical examination, cardiac auscultation, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, thoracic radiographs, and sometimes Holter monitoring. Emergencies associated with canine heartworm disease include right-sided heart failure and pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic disease, caval syndrome associated with heavy worm burden, or acute pulmonary thromboembolism usually following adulticide treatment. In caval syndrome or severe infections with a large worm burden, echocardiography can be used to identify worms in the right heart chambers and/or pulmonary artery.

AB  - Use of very old donors in liver transplantation (LT) is controversial because advanced donor age is associated with a higher risk for graft dysfunction and worse long-term results, especially for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive recipients. This was a retrospective, single-center review of primary, ABO-compatible LT performed between 2001 and 2010. Recipients were stratified in four groups based on donor age (<60 years; 60?69 years; 70?79 years and ≥80 years) and their outcomes were compared. A total of 842 patients were included: 348 (41.3%) with donors <60 years; 176 (20.9%) with donors 60?69 years; 233 (27.7%) with donors 70?79 years and 85 (10.1%) with donors ≥80 years. There was no difference across groups in terms of early (≤30 days) graft loss, and graft survival at 1 and 5 years was 90.5% and 78.6% for grafts <60 years; 88.6% and 81.3% for grafts 60?69 years; 87.6% and 75.1% for grafts 70?79 years and 84.7% and 77.1% for grafts ≥80 years (p?=?0.065). In the group ≥80 years, the 5-year graft survival was lower for HCV-positive versus HCV-negative recipients (62.4% vs. 85.6%, p?=?0.034). Based on our experience, grafts from donors ≥80 years may provide favorable results but require appropriate selection and allocation policies.

AB  - Summary Adequate volume maintenance is essential to prevent acute renal failure during major surgery or to ensure graft function after renal transplantation. The various recommendations on the optimum fluid therapy are based, at best, on sparse evidence only from observational studies. This article reviews the literature on perioperative fluid management in renal transplantation. Crystalloid solutions not exerting any specific side-effects are the first choice for volume replacement in kidney transplantation. The use of colloids should be restricted to patients with severe intravascular volume deficits necessitating high volume restoration. The routine application of albumin, dopamine, and high dose diuretics is no longer warranted. Mannitol given immediately before removal of the vessel clamps reduces the requirement of post-transplant dialysis, but has no effects on graft function in the long term. There is insufficient evidence on the best use of dialysis, but it seems peritoneal dialysis pretransplant is associated with less delayed graft function, whereas the preference of dialysis post-transplant is not yet well-founded. This review article should provide better guidance for fluid management in kidney transplantation until best-evidence guidelines can be established based upon more research.

AB  - Abstract Background Immunosuppressive drugs may prevent or partially reverse progression of renal AA-amyloidosis, a rare complication of Crohn's disease, often fatal due to renal failure. Materials and methods The clinical, biological and pathological data of 16 patients treated since 1976 were reviewed. Serum amyloid A was determined in surviving patients. Results The median age of the 16 patients (13 men) was 23·5 years (range 16?69). At Crohn's disease onset, Montreal phenotypes were similar to reported data. Out of 15 patients with renal insufficiency, 8 developed a nephrotic syndrome and 7 a low grade proteinuria. The single patient without renal insufficiency had nephrotic syndrome. A significant correlation (P < 0·05) between the extension of renal amyloid A and sclerosis was found in 12 patients. One patient had a 10 year remission of nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive drugs. In 6 patients treated with anti-TNF-α (Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-α) agents, anaphylactic reaction (1/6), death from septic shock (1/6), 5-year remission (1/6) or reduction of nephrotic syndrome (1/6) and stabilization of renal insufficiency (2/6) were observed. Surgery was performed in 10 patients. Kidney transplantation was performed in 5 of the 8 patients dialysed for end-stage renal failure. Among 6/16 patients (37%) still alive, 3 belong to the 5 transplanted patients (survival: 3?20 years) and 3 to the anti-TNF-α drugs treated patients; all but one exhibited a low serum amyloid A level. Conclusions Suppression of Crohn's disease inflammation potentially leads to the control of amyloid A production, assessed by a decrease of serum amyloid A. Kidney transplantation provides a long survival.

AB  - Abstract Liver allograft re-use is an exceptional way of enlarging the donor pool. We describe here a case of a re-used liver allograft, originating from an insulin-intoxicated donor and transplanted at first into a recipient presenting with hyperacute liver failure due to paracetamol intoxication. Because the original recipient developed an irreversible cerebral oedema, the allograft was re-implanted electively 55.5 h later into a patient with post-viral C cirrhosis and solitary hepatocarcinoma. Both donor and recipient operations were technically successful; liver function after the second use of the graft was normal.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.
