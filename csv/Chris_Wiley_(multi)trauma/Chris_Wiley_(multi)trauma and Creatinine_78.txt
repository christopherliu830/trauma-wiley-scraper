AB  - Abstract Liver allograft re-use is an exceptional way of enlarging the donor pool. We describe here a case of a re-used liver allograft, originating from an insulin-intoxicated donor and transplanted at first into a recipient presenting with hyperacute liver failure due to paracetamol intoxication. Because the original recipient developed an irreversible cerebral oedema, the allograft was re-implanted electively 55.5 h later into a patient with post-viral C cirrhosis and solitary hepatocarcinoma. Both donor and recipient operations were technically successful; liver function after the second use of the graft was normal.

AB  - Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of the donor heart is believed to increase the risk of allograft failure after transplant. However this effect is not well quantified, with variable findings from single-center studies. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was used to analyze the effect of donor LVH on recipient survival. Three cohorts, selected in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines, were examined: recipients of allografts without LVH (<1.1 cm), with mild LVH (1.1?1.3 cm) and with moderate?severe LVH (≥1.4 cm). The study group included 2626 patients with follow-up of up to 3.3 years. Mild LVH was present in 38% and moderate-severe LVH in 5.6% of allografts. Predictors of mortality included a number of donor and recipient characteristics, but not LVH. However, a subgroup analysis showed an increased risk of death in recipients of allografts with LVH and donor age >55 years, and in recipients of allografts with LVH and ischemic time ≥4 h. In the contemporary era, close to half of all transplanted allografts demonstrate LVH, and survival of these recipients is similar to those without LVH. However, the use of allografts with LVH in association with other high-risk characteristics may result in increased mortality.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.

AB  - Abstract Background Despite extensive research in atherosclerosis, the mechanisms of coronary atherothrombosis in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients are undetermined. Objectives Our aim was to find candidate genes involved in STEMI by analysing leucocyte gene expression in STEMI patients, without the influence of secondary inflammation from innate immunity, which was assumed to be a consequence rather than the cause of coronary atherothrombosis. Methods Fifty-one patients were included at coronary angiography because of STEMI. Arterial blood was sampled in the acute phase (P1), at 24?48 h (P2) and at 3 months (P3). Leucocyte RNA was isolated and gene expression analysis was performed by Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. By omission of up- or downregulated genes at P2, secondary changes from innate immunity were excluded. Genes differentially expressed in P1 when compared to the convalescent sample in P3 were determined as genes involved in STEMI. Results Three genes were upregulated at P1 compared to P3; ABCG1 (P = 5.81 ? 10?5), RAB20 (P = 3.69 ? 10?5) and TMEM2 (P = 7.75 ? 10?6) whilst four were downregulated; ACVR1 (P = 9.01 ? 10?5), NFATC2IP (P = 8.86 ? 10?5), SUN1 (P = 3.87 ? 10?5) and TTC9C (P = 7.18 ? 10?6). These genes were also highly expressed in carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Conclusions We found seven genes involved in STEMI. The study is unique regarding the blood sampling in the acute phase and omission of secondary expressed genes from innate immunity. However, the results need to be replicated by future studies.
