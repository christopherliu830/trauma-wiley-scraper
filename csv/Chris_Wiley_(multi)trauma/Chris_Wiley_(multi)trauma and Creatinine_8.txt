AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cimicoxib (Cimalgex?; Vétoquinol SA) for the control of perioperative pain in dogs. Methods A double-blind, randomized, controlled multi-centre field study was conducted in 237 dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery. Pain was monitored by the attending veterinarian over the 7 days following the surgical procedure using two pain-scoring systems and a visual analogue scale. An enhanced monitoring protocol for postoperative pain was utilized during the first 24 hours after surgery. The dog owner's assessment of perceived analgesia during this time period was also recorded. Results Cimicoxib demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority compared to carprofen. These findings were confirmed by owners? assessments and by the evolution of the pain scores. Both drugs were well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Significance Cimicoxib had non-inferior efficacy and tolerability when compared to carprofen for the control of perioperative pain in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Abstract Introduction This study was conducted to determine whether an intra-operative ratio of at least 1:1:2 of fresh frozen plasma (FFP):platelets (PLTs):packed red blood cells (pRBCs) improves outcomes in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Methods A single-center, retrospective study of deceased donor OLT recipients (MELD ≥15) requiring intra-operative pRBC transfusion (years 2013-2016). Patients were grouped into those receiving an intra-operative ratio of ≥1:1:2 of FFP:PLTs:pRBCs vs ratios <1:1:2. Results Patients in ≥1:1:2 group (n = 150) and patients in <1:1:2 group (n = 80) were matched for baseline characteristics (P > .05). Patients in the ≥1:1:2 group had lower pRBC and intra-operative blood product requirements (11 ± 0.5 vs 19 ± 1.4 units, P < .001, and 33 ± 1.3 vs 43 ± 3.3 units, P = .006, respectively), improved 1-month mortality (0 vs 8%, P = .002), improved 1-year survival (P = .004), less intra-operative cardiac arrest (3% vs 10%, P = .03), and shorter operating room time (389 ± 7.2 vs 431 ± 17.2 minutes, P = .03). After multivariate adjustment for baseline and intra-operative variables, balanced blood product transfusion (BBPT) was significantly associated with less intra-operative pRBC transfusion (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.72). Conclusion Balanced blood product transfusion is associated with reduced transfusion requirements in OLT.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis, a pro-inflammatory state that alters tubular handling of filtered albumin. We hypothesized that dipstick albuminuria (DA) is associated with a lower rate of AKI recovery in septic patients. Methods This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study of adults with sepsis-associated AKI in an urban academic intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with unknown baseline serum creatinine (SCr), absent urinalysis, and those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min per 1.73m2 or receiving chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. The independent variable was DA (negative or trace, 30 mg/dL, and ≥100 mg/dL) within the first 72 h of ICU stay. The outcome variable was AKI recovery at 30 days following hospital discharge, defined as the last SCr returning to a level less than 1.5 times the baseline SCr level and independence of RRT. Results A total of 988 patients were included in the study. The median length of hospitalization was 11 days. The patients with higher degree of DA had worse critical illness scores. After adjustment for several confounders, DA ≥30 mg/dL was independently associated with ?no AKI recovery? at 30 days post-discharge (adjusted OR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01?1.95 for DA =30 mg/dL and 1.67, 1.15?2.42 for DA ≥100 mg/dL, P =?0.02). Other independent predictors of ?no AKI recovery? were cumulative fluid balance, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, exposure to diuretics, and the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusion Dipstick albuminuria ≥30 mg/dL is independently associated with lower rate of AKI recovery at 30 days post-discharge. Our findings emphasize the potential utility of a simple routine test of DA in the risk-stratification of AKI recovery in ICU septic patients.

AB  - Introduction Blood is often collected from performing poorly horses to measure blood variables that may indicate a reason. However, intense exercise affects many blood variables and therefore time of sampling can affect the interpretation of results. This study examined the behaviour of blood variables after racing to determine the magnitude of the changes and to determine when it is better to collect samples. Methods Blood was sampled in 17 Standardbred racehorses 3 and 2 days before as well as 2 and 3 days after racing. GGT, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, CK, AST, LDH and cortisol were measured in plasma, and haematocrit, haemoglobin, number of erythrocytes, total white blood cells, granulocytes and lymphocytes were measured in EDTA blood. Parametric data was analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher test; non-parametric data with Friedman test and Wilcoxon test. Results Plasma Ca concentration was lower on day 3 after racing than on day 2 before racing (P<0.01). P concentration and GGT activity were higher at days 2 and 3 after racing compared to before racing (P?=?0.01). Erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin were higher at day 2 after racing than before and 3 days after racing (P<0.01). The other variables were not affected. Conclusions Some slight but significant changes in blood variables have to be taken in account when interpreting biochemical and haematologic variables for poor performance diagnosis in Standardbreds. It seems preferable to take blood samples on the third day after racing than on the second day.

AB  - Abstract Patients with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are one of the most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). Although the recognition of patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardized approach to the research framework using a common language for data definitions must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardized data definitions set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive data definitions set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible acute coronary syndrome was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardized data definitions set will facilitate?knowledge translation? by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Yellow fat disease or steatitis is characterised by a local or general inflammation of fat tissue and is occasionally found in horses. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide range of nonspecific clinical signs. Objectives To describe clinical signs, treatment, outcome and ultrasonographic findings in horses with steatitis. Study design Retrospective study (January 2008 to January 2015). Methods History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Results Twenty cases (18 horses, 2 donkeys; 9 mares, 9 stallions, 2 geldings) were retrieved from 13,707 patient records. Mean age was 1.6 (±?0.8) years (range 1 month?3.5 years). All cases appeared between October and February except for one (August). History included dullness, recumbency, decreased appetite and weight loss. Fever, ventral oedema, stiff/painful gait and painful neck were found. Low haematocrit, low vitamin E and selenium and increased levels of creatinine kinase and particularly lactate dehydrogenase were almost consistent findings. On ultrasound, ventral oedema was found. Subperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, coronary and caudal mediastinal fat showed homogenously increased echogenicity. Especially the subperitoneal fat was surrounded by oedema or free fluid. Increased amounts of abdominal, thoracic and pericardial fluid were often found. Fat biopsies were taken in the neck or from the retroperitoneal fat in the ventral flank. In all horses where fat biopsy was taken (n?=?13), steatitis was confirmed. Treatment consisted of selenium and vitamin E (intra-muscular injection followed by oral treatment) supplementation and anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone or prednisolone parenteral or oral) for at least 1?4 weeks. Fourteen animals (70%) survived. Full recovery took about 2?6 months. Conclusions Yellow fat disease may be underdiagnosed because of the nonspecific clinical signs. Ultrasound was extremely helpful for making a diagnosis. Recovery was rather slow but was achieved in 70% of the animals. Ethical animal research:?Research ethics committee oversight not currently required by this conference: retrospective study of clinical records. Explicit owner informed consent for inclusion of animals in this study was not stated. Source of funding:?Ghent University (institutional). Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

AB  - Abstract Toxic oxygen free radical damage is thought to play an important role in events such as trauma and sepsis, in which adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure (MOF) are the major causes of late death. Serum lipofuscin concentration has been proposed as an indicator of lipid peroxidation caused by toxic oxygen free radicals. Serum lipofuscin level was measured in 75 healthy controls and sequentially in 66 patients in the intensive care unit; the latter included 18 patients who had undergone elective major vascular surgery, 20 after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and 28 with severe blunt trauma. Fifteen of the 66 patients died within 2 days. Ten of the remaining 51 patients developed ARDS and/or MOF and 41 had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Serum lipofuscin concentration in controls showed a positive correlation with age. Compared with controls, all three patient groups had significantly increased lipofuscin concentrations during the first day after major vascular surgery, trauma or shock. In addition, the ten patients who subsequently developed ARDS and/or MOF showed significantly increased lipofuscin levels on day 1, compared with those in the 41 who had an uncomplicated clinical course. The concentration of serum lipofuscin, which may act as a simple and valuable measure of grading oxidative stress, is positively related to the incidence of subsequent ARDS and/or MOF in patients at risk of these syndromes.

AB  - Background: Although hyperamylasemia has been reported in a large proportion of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), its clinical significance as well as the pathogenic mechanism remain poorly understood. Apart from pancreatic cellular injury, impaired renal function or hypercalcemia after CPB was also proposed to play a possible role in the etiology of postoperative hyperamylasemia. The study was designed to investigate whether avoidance of CPB would limit amylase elevation. Methods: Serum levels of amylase and lipase were measured before operation, 24 and 48 hours after surgery in 58 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without the use of CPB over a 10-month period. The choice of procedure was based mainly on the native coronary anatomy and left ventricular function. Postoperative complications as well as the plasma levels of creatinine and calcium were also carefully monitored. Results: Three surgical approaches were used for CABG: CPB (conventional on-pump through median sternotomy, n = 32), OPCAB (off-pump through median sternotomy, n = 14), and MIDCAB (off-pump through left minithoracotomy, n = 12). There was no hospital mortality. No patient had postoperative abdominal complications. Transient hyperamylasemia occurred in 14 patients, 7 in the CPB group (22%), 5 in the OPCAB group (36%), and 2 in the MIDCAB group (17%). The increase in amylase levels was similar among groups. However, no lipase elevation was detected in any patient. There was no clear correlation between hyperamylasemia and an increased creatinine level. Perioperative plasma calcium levels were normal in patients who had hyperamylasemia. Conclusion: There is no significant difference in the incidence of hyperamylasemia among patients undergoing myocardial revascularization with or without the use of CPB and irrespective of mode of surgical access. Hence, CPB is not the major factor responsible for hyperamylasemia, as previously believed.

AB  - Abstract The cadaveric renal graft is exposed to ischaemic injury during preservation and to oxidative damage during reperfusion. Both these mechanisms are known to cause cell damage, which may impair graft function. Reperfusion injury (RPI) is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ascorbic acid (AA) is a potent physiological extracellular scavenger of ROS. We perfused 31 renal grafts immediately before implantation with a solution of Euro-Collins containing 0.5 mg/ml of AA to diminish RPI. From every donor, the contralateral kidney served as a control. The control grafts were perfused with the same perfusion as those of the AA group, only without the AA substitution. We assessed the effect of AA by recording serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, initial graft function and early rejections. The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) was 32% in the AA group, and 29% in the control group. Other parameters were also similar in both groups, except for the length of DGF, which showed a trend towards a shorter duration in the AA group. The pre-operative systemic AA concentration was significantly (P=0.01) lower in the haemodialysis patients than in those on peritoneal dialysis. In conclusion, this clinical study could not demonstrate significant benefits of AA in renal transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim:? To study the low-molecular-weight metabolites in blood plasma of patients with the progressive disease, gastric cancer, and to characterize different stages from chronic superficial gastritis (CSG) to chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), gastric dysplasia (DYS) and finally gastric cancer (GC). Methods:? We applied gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) to determine metabolites levels in plasma obtained from 80 patients including 19 with CSG, 13 with CAG, 10 with IM, 15 with DYS and 22 with GC (nine preoperation and 13 postoperation). Principal component analysis (PCA) and statistics were used to differentiate the stages and to identify the markers of gastric cancer. Results:? Totally, 223 peaks were detected in GC/TOF-MS and 72 compounds were authentically identified. CSG showed distinct difference from the other groups of CAG, IM, DYS and GC, whose plots clustered closely. IM clustered closely to GC, suggesting similar metabolic patterns of them. Fifteen identified metabolites contributed most to the differentiating between CSG and GC, and characterized different stages of GC. Statistics revealed elevated levels of 2-Hydroxybutyrate, pyroglutamate, glutamate, asparagine, azelaic acid, ornithine, urate, 11-eicosenoic acid, 1-monohexadecanoylglycerol and ?-tocopherol, while downregulation of creatinine, threonate in GC group, indicating that GC patients were obviously involved in oxidative stress, and perturbed metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids. Conclusion:? The metabolic phenotype of CSG is significantly different from GC, while that of IM is similar to it. The discriminatory metabolites characterizing progressive stages from CSG to GC might be the potential markers to indicate a risk of GC.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the clinical characteristics, perioperative complications, and outcomes in dogs surgically treated for gastric carcinoma. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Forty client-owned dogs with histologically confirmed gastric carcinoma. Methods Medical records were reviewed for preoperative diagnostics, surgery, histopathology, postoperative complications, adjuvant chemotherapy, disease progression, and survival. Variables were assessed for associations with outcome by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results Surgical treatment included partial gastrectomy (28 dogs), Billroth I (9 dogs), subtotal gastrectomy (2 dogs), and submucosal resection (1 dog). Major postoperative complications occurred in 8 of 40 dogs, including septic peritonitis secondary to dehiscence in 4 dogs. The median progression free interval was 54?days, and the median survival time (MST) was 178?days (range, 1?1902). According to multivariable analysis results, experiencing an intraoperative complication was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.1?9.8, P = .005), and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy correlated with an improved survival (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2?0.9, P = .03). Conclusion In this population of dogs, MST exceeded historically reported data, major postoperative complication rates were comparable to established literature, and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival. Clinical significance Results from this study may be used to counsel owners more accurately regarding prognosis for dogs undergoing surgical excision for gastric carcinoma.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about hearing impairment in patients after organ transplantation. We conducted a single-center study to evaluate hearing impairment in patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). A questionnaire was sent to 695 adult patients after OLT to assess characteristics and course of auditory impairment. Risk factors such as ototoxic drugs were taken into consideration. Clinical follow-up, including immunosuppressive therapy, was analyzed in detail. The questionnaire was completed by 521 patients (75%). Hearing impairment was reported by 184 patients (35%). A total of 43 patients (8%) suffered from hearing abnormalities prior to OLT. The remaining 141 patients (27%) developed hearing impairment after transplantation. Main problems were hearing loss (52%), tinnitus (38%), and otalgia (30%). There was no association of post-OLT hearing disorders with age or known risk factors. In 43% of patients, onset of hearing impairment was within 2 yr post-OLT. Hearing loss was positively associated with tacrolimus immunosuppression in univariate (P < 0.05) and multivariate analysis (P < 0.02). Patients using a hearing aid received tacrolimus more frequently than cyclosporine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, subjective hearing impairment is frequent in patients after OLT and contributes to post-OLT morbidity. Calcineurin inhibitor-related neurotoxicity appears as a possible mechanism. Further prospective investigations with objective hearing tests are necessary to confirm these results and to evaluate the role of immunosuppression. Liver Transpl, 2006. ? 2006 AASLD.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT? ??It is well known that tobramycin given as an once daily dose according to the usual recommendations needs therapeutic drug monitoring by measurement of peak and trough concentrations. In the literature, there are only few published studies on the population pharmacokinetics of once daily tobramycin in critically ill patients. Glomerular filtration rate and bodyweight were identified as covariates contributing to the inter-individual variability in the disposition of aminoglycosides. The study, by Peris-Marti et?al. [24], only evaluated the pharmacodynamic effectiveness of a 4?mg?kg?1 dose of tobramycin given once daily in critically ill patients. The authors concluded with a simulation showing that for a theoretical MIC of 1 or 2?mg?l?1, a 7?mg?kg?1 dose was required. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS? ??Our results confirm the high variability of tobramycin disposition in intensive care patients and consequently the possible lack of effectiveness. ??By using a population pharmacokinetic approach, two explicative covariates (height and Cockcroft creatinine clearance) added to a two-compartment model with proportional error, explained much of the inter-individual variability of tobramycin disposition in the critically ill patient population. ??In a median ICU patient, simulations were performed at various dosage regimens and peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Drug monitoring is required to manage efficacy and toxicity. AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate the disposition of tobramycin (TOB) in critically ill patients (ICU) by a population pharmacokinetic approach, to determine the covariates involved, and to simulate tobramycin dosage regimens. METHODS Forty-nine adult ICU patients received TOB (5?mg?kg?1) once daily. NonMem modelling was performed on 32 patients. The 17 other patients were used for the qualification process by normalized prediction distribution error. Then Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were performed. RESULTS A two-compartment model with a proportional error best fitted the data. TOB total clearance (CLTOB) was significantly correlated with Cockcroft creatinine clearance (COCK) and height. TOB clearance was 4.8 ± 1.9?l?h?1 (range 1.22?8.95), the volume of distribution of the central compartment was 24.7 ± 3.7?l (range 17.34?32.83) and that of the peripheral compartment and the inter-compartmental clearance were 30.6?l and 4.74?l?h?1, respectively. Only 29% of the patients presented a target AUC between 80 and 125?mg?l?1?h and 61% were lower than 80?mg?l?1?h. After considering COCK and height, MCS showed that only 50% of the population could achieve the target AUC for the 375 and 400?mg dosages. CONCLUSION Even after taking into account COCK and height, for strains with an MIC ≤ 1?mg?l?1, MCS doses evidenced that peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Combination therapy in addition to drug monitoring are required to manage efficacy and toxicity.

AB  - Abstract:? Melatonin reportedly exerts beneficial effects to attenuate multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in septic shock. Heatstroke resembles septic shock in many aspects. Thus, this study was performed on the anesthetized rats by using heat exposure to induce heatstroke-associated MODS. We evaluated the effect of melatonin, a versatile molecule synthesized in the pineal gland and in many organs, in heatstroke rats and showed that melatonin (0.2?5.0?mg/kg of body weight, i.v., immediately after the start of heat stress) significantly (i) attenuated hyperthermia, hypotension and hypothalamic ischemia and hypoxia, (ii) reduced plasma index of the toxic oxidizing radicals like nitric oxide metabolites and hydroxyl radicals, (iii) diminished plasma index of hepatic and renal dysfunction like creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase, (iv) attenuated plasma systemic inflammation response molecules like soluble intercellular and lesion molecule-1, E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1?, and IL-6, (v) promoted plasma levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, (vi) reduced an index of infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the lung like myeloperoxidase activity, and (vii) promoted the survival time to fourfold compared with the heatstroke alone group. Thus, melatonin could be a novel agent for the treatment of heatstroke animals or patients in the early stage.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.
