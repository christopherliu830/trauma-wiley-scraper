AB  - Abstract This is a case of a 51-year-old female with difficult-to-control hypertension and a 3-cm renal artery aneurysm. Successful exclusion of this was performed using a prefabricated stent graft. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of a prefabricated covered stent for this indication.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on cellulitis of the lower leg, and on the clinically important questions on its management. It discusses about etiology, clinical features, incidence/prevalence, importance and prognosis and diagnostic tests of cellulitis. The clinically important questions are related to the factors that predispose to lower-leg cellulitis, the best antibiotic treatment regimen of cellulitis, the factors that are associated with or predict short-term morbidity, severe disease, or mortality, the long-term complications of cellulitis, and prophylaxis work. The long-term consequences of cellulitis are particularly seen in patients with more severe episodes of infection. Long-term complications include chronic edema of the lower extremity, which has also been identified as a risk factor for the development of cellulitis.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the neurologic deficits associated with profound hyponatremia in 2 critically ill foals. Series summary: A 4-month-old Thoroughbred colt and an 11-day-old Paint filly presented for acute diarrhea and depression. Severe neurologic deficits including blindness and head pressing were noted upon initial examination along with marked hyponatremia observed on biochemistry profile. Aggressive intravenous sodium replacement increased the serum sodium concentration to subnormal values with concurrent resolution of neurologic deficits. Intensive monitoring and fluid therapy were continued; the Thoroughbred colt was euthanized due to lack of response to the primary disease while the Paint filly was discharged clinically healthy without further complications. New or unique information provided: Mild hyponatremia (122?132?mEq/L) is a common clinicopathologic finding in equine medicine associated with a variety of diseases. The vast majority of horses with mild hyponatremia do not demonstrate direct clinical manifestations as a result of low serum sodium concentration. However, when severe acute hyponatremia occurs (<122?mEq/L), such as with acute enterocolitis, subtle to profound neurologic deficits may be observed and immediate and rapid treatment as well as serial evaluations of serum sodium concentration are warranted. Significant, and potentially permanent, neurologic deficits can occur if water balance and tonicity are not properly addressed. The cases presented here describe additional cases of a previously published disease in foals, acute hyponatremia and associated neurologic deficits, and describe the microscopic examination of the central nervous system in one foal that did not survive.

AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy providing nutrients to individuals with impaired intestinal tract function and enteral access challenges. It is one of the most complex prescriptions written routinely in the hospital and home care settings. This article is to aid the nutrition support clinician in the safe provision of PN, including selecting appropriate patients for PN, vascular access, development of a PN admixture, appropriate therapy monitoring, recognition of preparation options, and awareness of preparation and stability concerns.

AB  - Abstract The first known posttransplantation pregnancy was in 1958 in a renal transplant recipient who had received a kidney from her identical twin sister. The first known posttransplantation pregnancy in a liver transplant recipient was in 1978. Information available from female kidney transplant recipients helped in the decision making involved in the management of this case, as well as those that followed. Over the last 20 years, issues specific to liver transplantation and pregnancy have been identified. Similar to the kidney transplant recipient population, when prepregnancy recipient graft function is stable and adequate, pregnancy appears to be well tolerated. Also similar to kidney transplant recipients, there has been no evidence of a specific malformation pattern among the children, and although prematurity and low birth weight occur, overall newborn outcomes have been favorable. Pregnancy in the setting of recurrent liver disease, such as recurrent hepatitis C, poses a potential problem among liver transplant recipients, as well as the possible adverse effects of immunosuppression on maternal kidney function. Also of significance, peripartum graft deterioration has more severe consequences in this transplant recipient population. Therefore, pregnancy must be considered carefully in this transplant recipient group. Since 1991, the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR) has studied the safety of pregnancy outcomes in solid-organ transplant recipients. The purpose of this review is to catalog studies in the literature, as well as to present current data from the registry with management guidelines.

AB  - Alemtuzumab was used as an induction agent in 205 renal transplant recipients undergoing 207 living donor renal transplants. All donor kidneys were recovered laparoscopically. Postoperatively, patients were treated with tacrolimus monotherapy, and immunosuppression was weaned when possible. Forty-seven recipients of living donor renal transplants prior to the induction era who received conventional triple drug immunosuppression without antibody induction served as historic controls. The mean follow-up was 493 days in the alemtuzumab group and 2101 days in the historic control group. Actuarial 1-year patient and graft survival were 98.6% and 98.1% in the alemtuzumab group, compared to 93.6% and 91.5% in the control group, respectively. The incidence of acute cellular rejection (ACR) at 1 year was 6.8% in the alemtuzumab group and 17.0% (p < 0.05) in the historic control group. Most (81.3%) episodes of ACR in the alemtuzumab group were Banff 1 (a or b) and were sensitive to steroid pulses for the treatment of rejection. There was no cytomegalovirus disease or infection. The incidence of delayed graft function was 0%, and the incidence of posttransplant insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was 0.5%. This study represents the largest series to date of live donor renal transplant recipients undergoing alemtuzumab induction, and confirms the short-term safety and efficacy of this approach.
