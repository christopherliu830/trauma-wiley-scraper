AB  - This special issue highlights the emerging needs and challenges associated with care and treatment management of perinatally HIV-infected children who are surviving into adolescence. The articles in this special issue discuss various issues related to the well-being of HIV-infected children and adolescents, including heart, kidney, lung, bone and mental health as well as their epidemiology, metabolism and neurodevelopment. The topics covered in this special issue are current in light of the scarcity of information available related to children with long-term exposure to HIV and multiple antiretrovirals as they transition to adolescence and further into adulthood. Understanding the complexities around the management of antiretroviral therapy in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, who are moving to adult care, and identifying the special needs of these youth is essential for ensuring long and productive lives for this growing population. The special issue is part of the International AIDS Society's ?Collaborative Initiative on Paediatric HIV Education and Research? (CIPHER), supported through an unrestricted educational grant from ViiV Healthcare's Paediatric Innovation Seed Fund.(Published: 18 June 2013)Citation: Journal of the International AIDS Society 2013, 16:18778 http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/18778 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.16.1.18778 http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/pages/view/thematicadolescents

AB  - Background:? Cardiovascular complications due to atherosclerosis (AS) are the major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Inflammation may play an important role in the development of AS. Several studies have demonstrated the association of acute-phase proteins and cytokines with AS in the general population and in HD patients. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of study was to compare serum levels inflammatory and anti-inflammatory indicators in HD patients according to the presence or absence of AS. Methods:? Thirty-three HD patients were enrolled. AS was defined as the detection of plaques by Doppler ultrasonography. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of plaques. Serum levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The factors for AS such as age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and HD duration were also evaluated. Results:? We found that the patients with AS had significantly higher hs-CRP and lower IL-10. Blood pressure values were also increased in patients with AS. Additionally, there was an increased correlation between CRP and IL-10. Conclusions:? AS(+) patients undergoing HD had low serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high serum levels of hs-CRP. These results may suggest that the limitation of anti-inflammatory response in atherosclerotic uremic patients is a triggering or contributing factor for AS.

AB  - Introduction:? The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) has established target hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11?12?g/dL for all dialysis patients. For patients who leave an inpatient hospitalization with an Hb under this target, it is hypothesized that several factors contribute to the length of time required to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL after hospitalization. Objective:? To identify factors contributing to a decreased likelihood of reaching this target Hb. Methods:? Using the first hospitalization of patients who initiated HD in 1999 and who were regularly treated with EPO, we identified those with a mean Hb of less than 11?g/dL on EPO claims during the same month as their index hospitalization. Patients were then followed up to see how long it took them to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL, censored at death, re-hospitalization, a switch of modality, or suspension of EPO treatment. Results:? A total of 6050 HD patients were identified. 3 months after hospitalization, 70% had achieved 11?g/dL, and 12% had been censored. For the remaining patients who eventually reached 11?g/dL, the average number of additional months required was 2.69 (SE of 0.09). From proportional hazards regression on the time (in months) to achieving an Hb of 11?g/dL, factors that significantly decreased the likelihood of reaching a target Hb included: a diagnosis on the index hospitalization of CHF or hepatic disease, a low Hb prior to the hospitalization, a high dose of EPO prior to the hospitalization, and a longer hospital stay. Conclusions:? Patients with anemia after hospitalization are at high risk of both persistent anemia and rehospitalization. It is important to address patient comorbidities, to ensure adequate medication usage, and to monitor patient progress to prevent hospitalizations and potential impact on Hb levels.

AB  - Clinical manifestation of overt vascular disease may be preceded for years by endothelial dysfunction. Objective:? This study was undertaken to evaluate endothelial function in ESRD patients and correlation between endothelial function and clinical and biochemical parameters. Methods:? 32 stable ESRD patients (male?:?female?=?16?:?16, average age: 55.2?±?13.0) on hemodialysis were included. A 10-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to image the brachial artery. Brachial artery diameter was measured, and reactive hyperemia was induced by inflation to 250?mmHg for 5?min and then deflation of a pneumatic cuff. After release of the cuff, brachial artery diameter was measured. Results:? In the entire study population and non-diabetic group, the %FMD (% flow-mediated dilatation, % change of brachial artery diameter between before and after cuff inflation) did not show any significant correlation with duration of dialysis, age, hypertension, albumin, CRP, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, the %FMD of diabetic patients was lower than that of non-diabetics. Among the patients with diabetes, the group of patients with FMD of <5.2% showed significant lower serum albumin and significantly higher ln(CRP) levels compared to the group of patients with FMD ≥5.2%. The %FMD showed significant positive correlation with serum albumin level and significant negative correlation with ln(CRP) in diabetic patients. Conclusion:? These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction, estimated by FMD, was significantly more prominent in diabetic ESRD, especially with low serum albumin and high CRP levels.

AB  - Background:? Daily hemodialysis (DHD) markedly ameliorates cardiovascular instability (CVI) and discomfort (DIS) during dialysis, but patients continue to have some of these problems during DHD. We studied what contributed to these problems during 4445 DHD in 23 patients. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR), maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP), and a subjective score of patients' overall evaluation of the quality of dialysis (OEQ), adding a score of 14 symptoms (0 best, 40 worst). Independent variables were ultrapure dialysate and biocompatible dialysis (UP) (1626 dialyses) vs. conventional dialysis (CONV) (2819 dialyses), ultrafiltration (Uf) as percentage of body weight (BW), pre?post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1 kg?BW?1), and target??post-dialysis BW (Ta-Po BW). Relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased by 1.6?±?13/min; MAX BP fall was 25?±?20?mmHg; OV BP fall was 13?±?22?mmHg; OEQ?=?0.6 ±?1.2. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=??BUN???0.12?+?Ta-Po BW?????1.8?+?K/V???1.1???5 r?=?0.13, p?<?0.0001 MAX BP?=?CONV???8?+?T???0.2???Ta-Po BW ?????6?+?Uf???2.7??13 r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001 OV BP?=?CONV???11?+?Uf???4???Ta-Po BW ????4?+??BUN???0.3???9 r?=?0.35, p?<?0.0001 OEQ?=?K/V???0.3???Ta-Po BW???0.1???0.2 r?=?0.20, p?<?0.0001 Conclusion:? To minimize drop in BP and hypotensive crashes, use of ultrapure dialysate and a biocompatible membrane (UP) was by far the most important factor, followed by slowing dialysis. To avoid post-dialysis tachycardia and discomfort during dialysis, slow dialysis was most important. Overall, ?fast? dialysis and use of ?impure? regular dialysate appear to be the major dialysis factors causing CV instability and discomfort during daily hemodialysis.

AB  - Starting any new program, especially one without a proven track record, raises questions about cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Purpose:? This research investigated how long patients should be expected to remain as daily/nocturnal hemodialysis patients in order to justify the initial investment in sending them home. Methods:? Costs for 10 short-hour daily (SHD) and 12 slow nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) were compared with the savings incurred by switching those patients from conventional hemodialysis (CHD). One-time expenses were divided by net savings to determine the minimum length of time the patients should be expected to remain at home on these modalities. Results:? One-time training, installation, and home equipment expenses were comparable for the SHD and NHD patients. NHD patients without monitoring noticed that these costs recovered in 1 year. NHD patients with monitoring took approximately 16 months to recover these costs, while initial SHD costs were offset in 20 months. Conclusions:? Patients selected for home NHD and SHD should be expected to be able to remain at home for at least 12?20 months. Subsequent investigation indicates that these costs and time periods may be further reduced.

AB  - Many synthetic polymeric membranes have been widely used for blood purification therapies. Among them polyester polymer alloy (PEPA) membrane shows unique blood compatibility and filtration characteristics. Objective:? To evaluate blood compatibility and filtration characteristics of 3 different PEPA membranes, including FLX (PEPA only), FDX (PEPA with polyvinylpyrrolidone, (PVP) as a hydrophilic agent), and FDY (PEPA with PVP) that has larger pore diameter. Methods:? Ultrafilters with 3 PEPA membranes (FLX, FDX, FDY, Nikkiso, Tokyo) were compared with those with polysulfone (PS; NK-PS, Nikkiso, Tokyo) for blood compatibility in vivo. Also, ultrafilters with PEPA, PS, and cellulose triacetate (CTA; FB-110GA, Nipro, Osaka) membranes were also investigated for filtration characteristics of albumin in aqueous in vitro. Results:? FDY, the latest version of the three PEPA, showed excellent small changes in C5a concentration during the treatment right after switching from PS membrane, leaving no significant changes in other biocompatible indices. First 60?min of the time course of s.c. for albumin were shown below taken under aqueous low albumin concentration, i.e., 2.42???10?3?kg/dm3. The time-dependent patterns were totally different from each other in 5 filters. Generally speaking, PS takes a peak value 20?40?min after starting the experiment, depending on the flow conditions. Since PEPA is a hydrophobic material, it showed high s.c. for albumin in FLX (PEPA with no PVP) and never reached plateau. With a hydrophilic agent (PVP), the s.c. greatly reduced in FDX and showed little time-dependent change. By enlarging the pore diameter in FDY, the s.c. increased in accordance with the enlargement. Conclusion:? Newly developed PEPA with PVP has excellent blood compatibility and has unique separation characteristics for albumin.

AB  - A decrease in hepatitis C viral load in HD patients along HD sessions has been described. It has also been proposed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation by HD could have some protective effect in hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease outcome. Aims:? (i) Measurement of HCV viral load variation and quantitation of HGF stimulation in CKD patients (HCV+ and HCV?) on HD, along the HD session. (ii) Study whether albumin HD (MARS) decreases HCV viral load and stimulates HGF, compared to HD sessions. Methods:? We performed two MARS and two HD sessions in vitro by using an extracorporeal circuit with blood bag contaminated with HCV serum with a known HCV viral load. (We used only a single blood bag for each testing.) In vivo we performed three MARS sessions. The total number of treatments was 6 in 2 patients (3 treatments each) and one HD session in 2 HCV+ patients and 5 HCV? patients (included in HD program in our center), taking samples at the start of the following HD session, to compare the results with those obtained in vitro. We took samples at the beginning, middle, and at the end of MARS sessions in vivo and in vitro and starting (15?min) and at the end and before starting the following HD session in vivo. (The interval between 2 HD sessions in HCV+ patients was 2 days.) We determined HCV viral load using Amplicor (Roche) and HGF using ELISA (R 15?min, 1537; final, 1981 HD in vitro: start, 476; 15?min, 677; final, 1236 HD in vivo: start, 2808.57; ?15?min, >8000; final, ??2605.28; ?start the following session, 2299.5 MARS in vivo: HGF starting (first session, 4633; second session, ??4390; third session, 4775); at 4?h (first session, 5443; second session, 4167; third session, 5178); final (first session, 4477; second session, 6167; third session, 5078). Conclusions:? MARS and HD sessions decreased HCV viral load and stimulated HGF both in vitro and in vivo. It is necessary to confirm these results because it could offer protective effect for HCV chronic liver disease outcome. HD seems to be the best option for patients with HCV hepatopathy. On the other hand, patients with liver disease who need to be treated with MARS could obtain not only a good clearance of toxin binding to albumin, but also the positive effects described.

AB  - Healthy nutritional status is crucial for obtaining favorable hemodialysis (HD) and transplantation results in chronic renal failure (CRF), because there is a high incidence of malnutrition in these patients. In addition, there is a remarkable loss of amino acids (AAs) during HD. Purpose:? This study examined changes in the serum AA profiles of pre- and post-HD in order to plan a strategy for providing nutritional support to patients on HD. Method:? Twenty-nine stable male patients on HD were enrolled in this study. The criteria for patient selection were urine output less than 200?mL/day, 3 times HD a week, and HD treatment for more than 12 months. Results:? Total plasma AA concentrations of pre- and post-HD were 2948.4?±?543.1 and 2279.2?±?400.8?mol/L, the difference being highly significant (p?<?0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in the level of essential AAs (EAAs, 774.4?±?163.8 vs. 643.4?±?142.5??mol/L, p?<?0.0005) and non-EAAs (2019.0?±?411.7 vs. 1539.6?±?278.3 ?mol/L, p?<?0.0001) after HD. The ratio of the EAAs to the non-EAAs increased after HD (0.39?±?0.07 vs. 0.42?±?0.07??mol/L). The level of branched chain AAs (BCAAs) of pre- and post-HD was 323.3?±?73.7 vs. 286.7?±?71.2??mol/L and that of aromatic AAs (AAAs) was 180.9?±?56.2 vs. 137.5?±?42.6??mol/L (p?<?0.0005), and the BCCA to AAA ratio increased after HD (1.8?±?0.41 vs. 2.2?±?0.57??mol/L, p?=?0.01). Among the abnormal AAs which appear in CRF, the concentrations of ?-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, 1-methyl histidine, phophoserine, and taurine decreased significantly after HD. Conclusion:? Patients revealed a large loss of AAs including abnormal-appearing AAs during HD. The ratios of EAA to non-EAA and BCAA to AAA increase significantly, which indicates the beneficial effect of HD on the metabolic recovery of the AA profile. But replacing AAs, especially EAAs with high BCAAs, is essential for maintaining nutritional status to compensate the significant loss of AAs during HD.
