AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the causes of cardiac tamponade in children undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Method Patients who presented with other complaints but were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade based on clinical and echocardiographic findings between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Electrocardiography, telecardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Pericardiocentesis was performed percutaneously under continuous blood pressure and rhythm monitoring with echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Pericardial fluid was analyzed on hemography and biochemistry. Results Fourteen patients (six boys, eight girls; median age, 7 years) underwent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. At presentation, 78% had dyspnea, 56% chest pain, and 49% fever. All had cardiomegaly, and their cardiothoracic index was 0.56?0.72. Also, all patients had sinus tachycardia; 78%, low QRS voltage; 70%, ST-T changes; and 50% QRS alternans. On echocardiography the widest diameter of pericardial effusion was between 12?mm and 36?mm depth around the heart. The pericardial fluid was purulent in one, serohemorrhagic in seven, serofibrinous in two, and serous in four cases. Pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful in two patients, who underwent open surgical drainage, with no complications. Based on pericardial fluid characteristics and additional tests, cardiac tamponade was caused by an infection in five patients, hypothyroidism in two, familial Mediterranean fever in two, malignancy in one, acute rheumatic fever in one, collagen tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) in one, catheter placement-associated damage in one, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in one patient. Conclusion Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in children have varied causes, and early treatment is life saving.

AB  - Abstract There is an increasing need for novel biomarkers that enable better diagnostic and prognostic stratification of patients with suspected infection. A proprotein convertase enzyme FURIN is upregulated upon immune cell activation, and it promotes infectivity by cleaving and activating pathogens. In this study, we determined FURIN levels in plasma using ELISA from 537 patients that were admitted to emergency room with suspected infection. Patients were sorted to high- and low-level FURIN groups with a cut-off level of 370 pg/ml. The study cohort included five diagnostic groups: Group 1, no systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS, n = 59 patients); Group 2, bacterial infection without SIRS (n = 67); Group 3, SIRS, but no bacterial infection (n = 308); Group 4, sepsis without organ failure (n = 308); and Group 5, severe sepsis (n = 49). Statistically significant associations were not found between the plasma level of FURIN and the prevalence of sepsis (P = 0.957), diagnostic group of a patient (P = 0.737) or the bacteria in blood culture (P = 0.499). Additionally, the concentration of FURIN did not predict the severity or case fatality of the infectious disease. However, statistically significant associations were found between high plasma level of FURIN and diagnosed rheumatic disease (P < 0.001) as well as with the prevalence of non-smokers (P = 0.034). Thus, albeit the plasma level of FURIN does not predict the severity of infectious disease, it may be of use in the diagnostics of autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia and poor uremia control are established cardiovascular risk factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with impaired endothelial dependent and independent vasodilation (EDV and EIV). Nocturnal hemodialysis [6???8?h/week] augments dialysis dose and offers normal phosphate (Pi) balance. We hypothesized that NHD would restore EDV (endothelial function) and EIV (vascular smooth muscle cell function) by simultaneously improving uremia and Pi control. 2 groups of ESRD patients (mean age 41?±?2 years) stratified according to their baseline plasma Pi levels (normal Pi <1.8?mM, high Pi >1.8?mM) were studied. Dialysis dose (Kt/V per session), plasma Pi, blood pressure (BP) and brachial artery responses to reactive hyperemia (EDV), and sublingual nitroglycerin (EIV) were examined before, 1 and 2 months after conversion from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) [3???4?h/week] to NHD. After 2 months, NHD increased dialysis dose (from 1.24?±?0.06 to 2.04?±?0.08; p?=?0.02) and lowered BP (from 140?±?5/82?±?3 to 119?±?1/71?±?3, p?=?0.01) in all patients. In patients with adequate Pi control during CHD, EDV was normalized after 1 month of NHD. In contrast, in the high Pi group, 1 month of NHD was sufficient to reduce plasma phosphate levels, but 2 months of NHD was required for EDV to improve. Variables Normal Pi (n=10) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2months) High Pi (n=8) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2 months) Pi (mM) ?1.44?±?0.09 1.08?±?0.07* 1.14?±?0.11* 2.52?±?0.3 1.40?±?0.17* 1.26?±?0.05* EDV (%) ?3.4?±?2.7 7.5?±?1.9* 7.6?±?1.3* ?1.7?±?1.3 0.37?±?1.6? ?8.8?±?1.2* EIV (%) ?8.2?±?4.8 10.3?±?2.0 15.1?±?2.0* 5.1?±?1.1 ?6.6?±?0.8? 16.9?±?1.7* * p?<?0.05 from values during CHD. ? p?<?0.05 between the normal and high Pi groups. Correction of uremia without normalization of plasma Pi is insufficient to improve EDV. The time course over which this improvement in vascular responsiveness occurs is delayed in hyperphosphatemic patients, suggesting that improvement in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function requires restoration of normal intracellular Pi balance.

AB  - Background:? Hemodialysis is often complicated by cardiovascular instability (CVI). We studied factors contributing to this problem during 720 hemodialyses (HDs) in 20 patients; 480 dialyses were 6/week and 240 were 3/week. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR) and maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP). Independent variables were dialyses/week (DIAL), ultrafiltration (Uf), % of body weight (BW), pre-post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1?kg?1 BW), target-postdialysis BW (Ta-Po BW), Kt/V, ?PO4, ?bicarbonate, ?potassium, ?BUN, an ?unphysiology index? summing up changes in electrolytes, and BUN and BW during dialysis (UPI). The relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased 0.5?±?11/min; MAX BP fall was 23?±?17?mmHg; OV BP fall was 12?±?19?mmHg. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=?38???DIAL???4?+?T???0.1?+?Uf???1.8?+?PO4 ??1.8???UPI??0.2???K/V???2, r?=?0.30, p?<?0.0001; MAX BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+??PO4???2.6?+?11, r?=?0.34, p?<?0.0001; OV BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+?PO4???2.7 +?1, r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001. Conclusion:? To prevent BP fall and tachycardia during hemodialysis, the most important factor to decrease is unphysiology, i.e., the oscillations in electrolytes, fluid spaces, and osmolality that occur during dialysis. The best way to do this is to dialyze patients daily. An unexpected finding worthy of further investigation was the large detrimental influence of ?PO4 on CVI.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of serological and molecular markers of hepatitis (A?E) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in hemodialysis (HD) patients of central Greece. Methods:? 370 patients (246 males, 60?±?14?years) attending the renal units (RUs) of central Greece (n?=?5) were tested for anti-HAV IgG, hepatitis B virus markers, anti-HCV, anti-HEV, and anti-HTLV-I/II with ELISA. In 131 casual samples, regardless of anti-HCV status, a sensitive, qualitative HCV-RNA assay (Versant?, Bayer) based on transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) was applied. Results:? Previous HBV infection (anti-HBc) was found in 48% and current HBV infection in 5.5% (HbsAg) of the patients. Anti-HAV was detected in 94% while anti-HDV and anti-HTLV were negative. Anti-HCV prevalence was 23% varying from 11 to 36% in the different RUs. Frequency of anti-HEV (4.1%) was also highly varying (1.4?9.8%). There was no association between the infection markers and age, sex, or history of transfusion. Anti-HCV correlated with duration of HD. HCV-RNA was detected in 44/131 samples. In 15 cases results of anti-HCV and TMA were contradicting. Two anti-HCV negative samples were HCV-RNA positive (2.3%). Conclusion:? In RUs of central Greece, a high prevalence of HCV infection was found, associated with the duration of HD. The high prevalence of anti-HEV found in 1 RU must be investigated further. In some of anti-HCV-negative patients viremia was detected. This result indicates that a considerable number of HCV infections are serologically occult. HCV-RNA testing, regardless of the anti-HCV status, has to be considered seriously in HD patients.

AB  - Purpose:? Quality of life (QoL) is a well-recognized important measure of therapy outcome, as it reflects what patients perceive as their health condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the QoL in patients on HD and to find the factors that mainly affect it. Patients and Methods:? We studied 70 patients on HD (38 male, age 57.86?±?14.63 years) with the use of kidney disease quality of life short form. Physical health (PH), mental health (MH), kidney disease issues (KDIs), and patient satisfaction (PS) were assessed, as well as Khan comorbidity index, adequacy of dialysis, nutrition, and epidemiologic and laboratory data. Results:? PH was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), serum albumin (Salb) (p?<?0005), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001), Hb (p?<?0.01), and CRP (p?<?0.01). MH was significantly correlated to comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), Salb (p?=?0002), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001) and Hb (p?<?0.01). KDI score was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), and Hb (p?<?0.05). The acceptance of the method was significantly lower in patients with AVF dysfunction (p?<?0005). As much as 44.3% of patients presented inadequate compliance to dietary and fluid restrictions. Conclusion:? Frequent QoL assessment in patients on HD is a useful tool for professionals involved in patients' care. Older age, long time on HD, malnutrition, elevated CRP, and comorbid conditions are correlated to lower QoL scores.
