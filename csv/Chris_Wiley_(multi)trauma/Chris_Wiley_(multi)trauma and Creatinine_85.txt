AB  - Serum level of nitrite plus nitrate (NO2 plus NO3), endothelin-1 (Et-1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been estimated in 20 patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment in a trial to explain the hypotension occurring in some of these patients. According to the incidence of hypotension, patients were divided into GI (n?=?10) hypotension prone patients and GII (n?=?10) hypotension resistant patients (normotensive). Clinical examination with measurement of systolic and mean arterial blood pressure was performed in all cases before and after hemodialysis (HD) settings. After HD, GI showed significant increase in the serum levels of (NO2 plus NO3), IL-1, and TNF-α, whereas a significant decrease in serum Et-1 level was noticed. GII showed no significant change in serum level of the 4 parameters mentioned above. In hypotensive patients, there was a significant positive correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and the duration of dialysis, and a significant negative correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and post dialysis systolic blood pressure, also between IL-1 and Et-1. From the previous results, it could be concluded that the vascular endothelial factors studied (NO and Et-1) together with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α contribute to the development of HD-induced hypotension in ESRF subjects which is evidenced by: (1) the coupling of decrease of blood pressure and increase in NO2 plus NO3 level after HD in group I; (2) Et-1, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor, showed a significant decrease postdialysis; and (3) levels of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) (which are potent NO inducers) were found to be significantly increased postdialysis in group I.

AB  - Kinetics of urea extraction during a single dialysis session in children are unknown, because analysis of solutes in dialysate is difficult due to their extreme dilution. >Objective:? A novel urea monitor of the Gambro Company might be of help in studying urea kinetics also in children. Methods:? We studied 107 urea kinetics in 5 adolescents aged 13?19 years, weighing 26?58?kg, and looked for influences of membrane size, blood flow, and duration of one dialysis session. Urea measurement applies to the change of electric dialysate conductivity due to ionization because of urea splitting by urease. Bicarbonate dialysis regimen was 4?5?h each, 3 times a week, using polysulfone high-flux dialyzers (Fresenius F60 or F80, depending on body size). Results:? Average 4-h urea Kt/V values for F60 (n?=?85) were 1.69±0.53 and for F80 (n?=?21) 1.63±0.25, extracted urea mass was 16.0±5.4?g and 32.5±5.4?g, respectively (p?<?0.05); Kt/V urea results for blood flows of 180?220?mL/min were 1.36±0.52 and for <180?mL/min 1.10±0.43; extracted urea mass was 17.3±8.0 and 11.7±4.9?g, respectively (p?<?0.05). Total average urea extraction ratio after 2?h of dialysis (n?=?107) was 64.8±5.6%. Extraction ratio during the 4th h of dialysis was only 15.3±4.1% and during the 5th h not more than 9.0±3.6% of total urea extraction. Conclusion:? Kinetics of urea extraction helps understanding dialysis processes in children. Adapting the size of the dialyzer according to body size raises urea extraction and maintains urea clearance Kt/V at the desired quality level. An inadequate blood flow lowers both urea extraction and urea clearance Kt/V. Prolonging dialysis beyond 4?h is, at least in concern of urea kinetic modelling, a rather ineffective means. We speculate that children with blood flow problems should be dialysed more often.

AB  - Heparin is almost universally used as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis. Rare but serious side effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anaphylaxis, and these may lead to significant mortality and morbidity if left unrecognized. We are reporting a patient who developed HIT followed by an anaphylactoid reaction. This 8-year-old girl with Joubert's syndrome developed end-stage renal disease secondary to nephronophthisis. She had a Permacath double-lumen hemodialysis catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein and was started on hemodialysis using an Asahi B10 65 Dialyzer on 1/28/03. The platelet count at that time was 246???103/mL. Beef lung heparin was used for anticoagulation. She was admitted for living related donor renal transplant on 2/10/03 but was found to be thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 49???103/mL. The transplant was postponed, a sepsis work-up was performed, and she was started on antibiotics pending culture results. Hemodialysis was continued with heparin anticoagulation, and despite an improvement in the platelet count she had an acute anaphylactoid reaction 2 days later. The reaction occurred 20?min after starting her hemodialysis treatment and presented as acute onset of bronchospasm, agitation, and chest discomfort. She improved with nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous epinephrine. A review of her records revealed that she had received 6 hemodialysis treatments. The platelet count on 2/3/03, after 3 hemodialysis treatments, had been 242???103/mL and on 2/8/03 after 5 treatments the platelet count was 72???103/mL. HIT with anaphylaxis was suspected. Heparin was discontinued and the platelet count had returned to normal within 2 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive heparin-associated antibody test. While HIT is recognized as a complication in 1?5% of patients treated with heparin and has been well described in the literature, we could only find 2 reported cases of heparin-induced anaphylaxis and in both cases there was accompanying thrombocytopenia. This patient further illustrates a possible linkage between these two phenomena. HIT is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialysis and continued exposure to heparin may induce anaphylaxis.

AB  - Quality control of dialysis treatment has received wide attention since inadequate dialysis dose was an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Each 0.1 decrease in Kt/V less than 1.2 is estimated to increase the relative risk of death by 5?7%. A higher Kt/V can be achieved by increasing treatment time, using a larger dialyzer or increasing blood or dialysate flow rates. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to know, using online conductivity monitor (OCM) routinely, whether a certain subgroup of patients is being treated inadequately. 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFI and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Inadequate dialysis dose was considered at OCM Kt/V less than 1.2. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Watson volume (Wv) to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The OCM Kt/V weekly was inversely related to Wv (r?=??0.833, p?<?0.001). 20.8% of our patients are at risk of inadequate dialysis dose, and it reflects our current practice of dialysis prescription. All of them are anuric young men with a Wv?>?40?L. Specific efforts are required to deliver an adequate dialysis dose in this kind of patients. This can be achieved by altering dialysis frequency, increasing membrane surface, and/or increasing dialysis flow. OCM Kt/V device permits a daily dialysis dose delivery and, consequently, an individualized prescription. Prospective studies are required to establish whether adequate dialysis dose in patients with Wv?>?40?L may further improve their survival.

AB  - More frequent dialysis is thought to be associated with increased heparin requirements; however, limited data are available which compare heparin requirements of conventional to daily dialysis. Objectives:? To determine differences in heparin dose during conventional thrice-weekly dialysis (CHD) compared to daily hemodialysis (DHD). Methods:? All patients within the daily home hemodialysis at the Northwest Kidney Centers were evaluated for heparin dose both pre- and post initiation of daily hemodialysis. Patients on DHD received an initial bolus of heparin, without a continuous heparin drip, and supplemental heparin midway through the dialysis run as needed to maintain adequate activated clotting times (ACTs). CHD patients received a heparin bolus, followed by initiation of heparin drip as needed to maintain adequate ACTs. Results:? Of the 1117 patients who dialyze at the NKC, 55% were Caucasian, 21% African-American, 20% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 35% were of other ethnicity. The majority of patients were greater than 60 years (56%), while 36% ranged from 40?60 years and 13% ranged from 20?40 years. Male patients constituted 54% of patients. Diabetes was the primary cause of renal disease (36%), followed by hypertension (21%) and glomerular disease (18%). Of those patients in the home hemodialysis program (n?=?45), 10 patients started daily home hemodialysis using the Aksys daily home hemodialysis system. Of those, the majority was male (100%), Caucasian (78.8%) with an average age of 46.7?±?18 years. Glomerulonephritis was the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (40%), while the percentages of other diseases were similar [Alport's syndrome (20%), hypertension (20%) and diabetes (10%)]. Compared to initial DHD heparin requirements (10,111?±?2219 units), CHD heparin dose requirements (6833?±?2715 units) were significantly lower (p?=?0.045); however, total heparin needs were similar between groups (10,166?±?4380 units vs. 10,778?±?2959 units) (p?=?0.324). Conclusion:? Although patients initiating DHD have greater initial heparin requirements than when on CHD, total heparin doses remain similar to those required on conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Greater initial heparin doses required during short daily dialysis appear safe compared to those of conventional dialysis.

AB  - Bacteremia (B) is a well-known complication of an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). Although prophylactic measures such as topical and catheter lock antibiotics have been demonstrated to decrease the risk of B in hemodialysis (HD) in patients with a CVC, there are concerns about the development of resistance to these agents when used for long periods of time. Objective:? We wondered if we could limit the use of these agents by identifying the period when B was most common after CVC placement. Method: We prospectively noted all patients with a CVC who developed B in any of our 3 units in CT, U.S.A.; 62 episodes of B occurred between 1/1/03 and 9/18/03. 35% of all of the HD patients had a CVC for access during the study period. Results: Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 22 (35.5%) episodes; Gram-negative organisms for 21 (33.8%) and other staphylococcal species for 14 (22.6%). The other 3 episodes were other Gram-positive organisms and 6 patients developed B with more than 1 organism. 3 (4.8%) patients expired while being treated for the B. The average time to onset of B was 96?±?98 CVC days with a range of 1?365 days. There was no difference in time to onset based on organism. 43.5% of the episodes of B occurred less than 60 days after the CVC was inserted, but 27.4% occurred greater than 100 days after CVC insertion. Conclusion:? The time to onset of CVC-related B was variable among the patients developing B in this study. Preventative strategies aimed at reducing the risk of B in patients with a CVC must be used for the life of the CVC.

AB  - Purpose:? Nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHHD, 6?7 times weekly 6?9?h) results in better clinical outcome than conventional 3 times weekly hemodialysis. A good training program for patient and partner is a prequisite for success. We developed a training course for patients and partners. Methods:? Since December 2001, we trained 20 patients and their partners to perform NHHD in 2 succeeding groups. The first group, consisting of 15 patients and their partners, started a NHHD pilot study. During this pilot study, we improved the training course. The second group of 5 were trained with this improved program. All 5 participants were home hemodialysis patients for over 1 month before starting the NHHD course. First, they learned how to handle the single needle system. Then, they performed single needle hemodialysis for 2 weeks at home. This was followed by an in-center NHHD training, consisting of 4 conventional day-time and 3 long (8?h) nocturnal dialysis treatments. Main targets during this training period are to learn to deal with safety precautions, online monitoring, and special machine features, and to check biochemistry and heparinization during long dialysis. 1 month after the training we evaluated the course with all participants. Results:? For 9 of 15 couples in the first group, the training appeared to be exhausting. Stress factors were an overloaded program and too little experience with several new skills including needle technique before starting NHHD. The second group started the NHHD training 2 weeks after the single needle training. This second group was pleased with the training protocol. Conclusion:? The training course for NHHD should not be overloaded. Patients need time to learn new skills before starting NHHD.

AB  - It is unlikely that there is a solitary hospital-based dialysis unit that can claim an unlimited amount of available chronic spots. Many units, in fact, constantly face a problem of overcrowding, long patient waiting lists, and ongoing shortages of nurses trained in highly specialized areas such as dialysis. In addition, conventional dialysis does not afford the best outcomes to patients with lifestyle, fluid control, hypotension, or hypertension issues. Objective:? We developed an in-hospital nocturnal program with the goal of solving some of these issues related to wait lists, overcrowding, and shortages of trained hemodialysis nurses. Method:? In the first year, a four-bed room was converted into a 4 station unit. Nurses from the 24 bed in-patient Nephrology/Urology/Ophthalmology unit were trained to perform hemodialysis. Stable, hospitalized dialysis patients or in-center dialysis patients were selected if they met criteria drawn up by the medical director. Staffing for the unit was established at 3?:?1 or 4?:?1 patient to nurse ratio. Support staff included a hemodialysis-trained ward nurse with an assignment of 5?6 hospitalized patients. Back-up support included assistance with trouble-shooting and break coverage for the nocturnal nurse. Results:? We currently have 12 nurses from the ward trained to do hemodialysis. The nocturnal unit has been operating 3 nights/week, with plans to expand to 6 nights/week within the year. We have 3 patients on the program with plans to increase to 6?8 patients as more nurses are trained. Initiation of hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis has led to the opening of in-center dialysis spots as well as shortening wait periods for patients in the Pre-Renal Clinic, awaiting initiation of chronic dialysis. This model has also provided the in-center dialysis unit with a greater pool of skilled hemodialysis nurses to draw from during shortages. Anecdotal reports from patients indicate that they feel much better, and 1 patient no longer requires antihypertensives for their blood pressure control. Conclusion:? We conclude that hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis is a novel and extremely viable solution for many of the issues facing dialysis units today.

AB  - Introduction:? In 2001 our Renal Dialysis Unit underwent a major renovation to five stations. The new space and funding allowed for acquisition of new state-of-the-art hemodialysis machines. We describe our experience with the Gambro Phoenix with Diascan and Exalis. Prior to the move an evaluation was undertaken. Criteria for selection with a scoring tool were utilized to rate machine performance for use in children. The decision for the Gambro Phoenix machine was based on: the performance rated highly due to ease of set up; large viewing touch screen; compatibility with existing equipment; benefits of online clearance monitoring (Diascan); network data management system (Exalis) and the future availability of blood volume monitoring (Hemoscan). Our program was the first center to dialyze a pediatric patient on the Phoenix machine in Canada. Patients and results:? 13 patients (age 2?23 years) were hemodialyzed between May 2002 and September 2003 for periods of 2?week to 16 months, greater than 5000?h of dialysis time. The move was not uneventful. During the first months of operation issues such as inadequate electrical supply for the new machines, reverse osmosis (RO) pump failure, leaks, and no emergency power to the RO were prevalent. The new software also exposed glitches. Subsequent Phoenix use proceeded uneventfully. Staff were able to problem solve easily with clinical and technical support from Gambro Canada. Education for the online clearance monitoring, Diascan and Exalis, was necessary. No major problems with dialysis were encountered. The benefits and reliability of Diascan have been previously described (Lindsay RM, Sternby J, Semin Dial. 2001; 14:300). Diascan readings provided real-time measurement of sodium (Na), which correlated well with laboratory values. Automatic readouts of Kt/V allowed for monitoring of dialysis adequacy which was consistent with calculated percent reduction in urea (PRU). At this point, use of the Phoenix has been demonstrated to work well in a pediatric facility.

AB  - The mortality and morbidity of hemodialysis patients is, to a large extent, determined by demographics and by existing comorbidities, but it is obvious that variations in dialysis dose have substantial effects. Using eKt/V, 1.2 monthly comparisons are recommended by European guidelines, but they assume that dose is maintained during all monthly sessions. Because of dialysis-related problems like hypotension, reduction of blood flow, dialysis time, microclotting of the dialyzer, and vascular access problems, the delivered dose may vary from session to session. New developed devices based on online conductivity clearance reflect the electrolyte clearance and, thus, clearance of urea. The aim of this prospective study was to show the variability of dialysis dose. 24 anuric patients were studied during 3 months: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with online conductivity monitor (OCM) and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Each patient was subjected to OCM on regular sessions during 3 months, and blood Kt/V samples were taken on midweek day, once a month. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation with other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The conductivity-based OCM provides an accurate tool to monitor the dose and control of each hemodialysis session and adds to the efficiency of current dialysis adequacy monitoring. OCM device requires little maintenance, and no extra effort is needed. Monthly Kt/V does not reflect the variability of each session. Further studies are necessary to evaluate its influence on morbidity and mortality. ? Descriptives ?

AB  - Cirrhosis (Cir) is often associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Egyptian patients on regular hemodialysis (RHD). This is largely attributed to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and concomitant Hepatitis C viral infection. As the liver has a major role in vitamin D3 activation, we designed this study to envisage the impact of Cir on renal osteodystrophy (ROD). It included 130 consecutive age- and gender-matched subjects in 4 categories. Group I: 39 patients (34 male and 5 female; mean age 48.8 years) with Cir normal renal function; group II: 37 patients (30 male and 7 female; mean age 49.0 years) with CRF and normal liver function, on RHD for a mean duration of 6?±?3.9 years; group III: 41 patients (30 male and 11 female; mean age 50.7 years) with CRF and concomitant Cir, stable on RHD for a mean duration of 7.0?±?4.0 years; and group IV: 16 normal volunteers (13 male and 3 female; mean age 46.3 years). The prevalence of diabetes as well as previous infection with schistosomiasis was similar in all patient groups and that of HCV infection was alike in groups I and III. In all subjects, conventional parameters of liver and renal function were tested; in addition to measurement of serum total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphate, total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), parathormone (PTH), 5-hydroxycholecalciferol (5HD), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25HD), Cross Laps (CXL) as a marker of bone resorption, and aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) as a measure of bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by either Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Computerized Tomography (CT). Group II patients displayed the typical CRF profile comprising hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases, high PTH and 25HD, low 1,25HD, increased PINP as well as CXL, and generally decreased BMD. Cir (Group III) significantly (p value at least <0.5) modified this profile in several aspects: it checked hypocalcemia (mean 8.8 vs. 7.9?mg/dL in groups II and III, respectively), hyperphosphatemia (5.15 vs. 4.9?mg/dL), and the elevation of B-ALP (62 vs. 30.5??g/L) and PTH (89 vs. 78?pg/mL). It lowered the serum level of 25HD (18.7 vs. 13.7?ng/mL), augmented the deficiency of 1,25HD (13.4 vs. 8.0?pg/mL), did not appreciably affect the increase in bone formation (PINP 77.9 vs. 75.5?ng/mL), but ameliorated its excessive resorption (CXL 21?860 vs. 30?328?pmol/L) noticed in group II. This was associated with amelioration of the dialysis-associated osteopenia (70 vs. 33.5%) and increased incidence of osteosclerosis (30 vs. 61%), as measured by bone mineral density. Conclusion:? Our data indicate that Cir ameliorates ROD through decreased bone resorption. This is associated with better tolerance to 1,25HD deficiency, which initiates the cascade of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and increased bone resorption in CRF. Such tolerance may reflect upregulation of vitamin D receptors as a consequence of the humoral perturbation supervening in Cir, involving IGF-1, estrogens, or other vitamin D metabolites as 24,25 HD.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Valproic acid toxicity is not infrequent and is difficult to treat, as there is no specific antidote. In the past, this drug was considered unremovable by extracorporeal methods because of the highly protein bound state (90?95%). However, recent reports suggest that the toxicokinetics of valproate vary considerably from the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels, and at higher concentrations protein-binding sites become saturated. The drug's relatively low molecular weight (144?Da), small volume of distribution (0.13?0.23?L/kg), and saturable protein binding render it potentially amenable to extracorporeal removal, but published experience is scant and there are only a few reported instances in which patients were successfully treated with extracorporeal methods. Here we report the case of a patient with serious valproate toxicity treated with simultaneous ?in series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. A 35-year-old homeless male presented to the emergency department after ingesting 120 pills of valproic acid. Initial valproic acid level was 59?µg/mL. Urine drug screen was negative and serum chemistries including LFTs were normal. He was treated with activated charcoal and admitted to the intensive care unit. 4 h later, he developed respiratory failure and became hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequently, the valproic acid level was found to be 553?µg/mL and a decision was made to employ extracorporeal methods for drug removal. ?In series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were done for 4?h and simultaneous blood samples for measurement of valproic acid levels were obtained as blood entered the hemoperfusion column (arterial) and as it exited the hemodialysis membrane (venous). Extraction ratio, whole blood, and plasma clearances were calculated and they compared substantially with the published data. The above measures decreased valproate levels from 572.6 (pre-dialysis level) to 203.2?µg/mL. This was followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for 18?h, which sustained the drug removal and prevented significant post-dialytic rebound. This is the first reported instance in which these three methods were administered together successfully in the management of valproic acid toxicity.

AB  - Plasma fibrinogen is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disturbances, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with elevated causes of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. That is the reason to look for the causes of increased CRP levels in CRF and haemodialysis (HD). The study tries to find whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consistent factor for CRP elevation in CRF and/or in HD patients, when a dialysis-induced IL-6 synthesis may occur, as IL-6 has been claimed as a responsible factor for production of some acute phase proteins like CRP. CRP [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, limit 0.1?µg/L], IL-6 (ELISA, Medgenix, Brussels, Belgium), and fibrinogen (photometric technique) were tested in 45 stable predialytic CRF patients (mean age 48?±?7 years) and in 50 stable HD patients (mean age 62?±?15). In CRF patients, a positive correlation was found between plasma fibrinogen (mean 356?±?167?mg/dL) and CRP (r?=?0.51, p?<?0.01) and between fibrinogen and proteinuria (r?=?0.32, p?<?0.01), but no correlation was found between CRP and IL-6. In HD patients, a high positive correlation was registered between CRP (mean 6.93?±?5.88?mg/L) and IL-6 (mean 9.4?±?10.6?pg/mL) (r?=?0.84, p?<?0.001) and between CRP and fibrinogen (mean 325?±?110?mg/dL) (r?=?0.59, p?<?0.001). The study suggests that, in HD patients, one of the factors stimulating hepatic production of CRP is probably IL-6, which is synthesized by the dialysis-related, activated macrophages. In predialytic patients, the bacterial products in dialysate and their effect on macrophages are absent and there is no correlation between CRP and IL-6.

AB  - The purpose of the poster was to demonstrate how Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing is utilized daily within the multicultural pediatric population at the hospital for sick children. Methods:? Within this diverse and challenging population, the hemodialysis nurse is constantly challenged to ensure that the nursing care provided to the patient is reflective and meeting the needs of our pediatric population and their families. Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing has provided an avenue to ensure that the many cultures of our clients are maintained and respected. A case study will be used to show the integration of Leininger's theory. Resources for supporting the cultural values of the hemodialysis patient will also be identified. Conclusion:? The use of a transcultural nursing model enhances the quality and effectiveness of the patient care provider for the pediatric hemodialysis patient at the hospital for sick children. Utilization of a transcultural nursing model ensures that the patients and their families are respected and supported for their diverse backgrounds by the hemodialysis nurse. The hemodialysis nurses are providing quality nursing care which reflects the needs and concerns of a multicultural population.

AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.

AB  - Background and Purpose:? Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in plasma rises by ultrafiltration during hemodialysis, and it consequently causes plasma refilling in which water moves from interstitial tissue to capillary space. Although hemodynamic stability is one of the important factors for good dialysis outcome, no informative and convenient indicators are available other than monitoring of blood pressure. Thus, we measured COP during hemodialysis whether COP can be used as an indicator for the hemodynamic status in comparison with hematocrit (Ht). Plasma osmolality, ultrafiltration volume, and the alteration of blood pressure were also measured to examine whether COP is associated with them. Method:? Sixteen patients hospitalized in this hospital were examined. Amongst them, 10 patients underwent both dialysis and ultrafiltration, while 4 patients received only dialysis and 2 patients were with ultrafiltration only by extracorporeal ultrafiltration method. Ultrafiltration was performed with constant speed to the dry weight for 4?h. The measurements of COP, plasma osmolality, Ht levels, and blood pressure were performed at 30?min (12.5% of the total water removal), 1?h (25%), 2?h (50%), and 3?h (75%) after the start of hemodialysis and also at the end of dialysis (100%). Result:? COP markedly rose by 26.0% (±13.3%) in the patients who received both dialysis and ultrafiltration, whereas Ht rose by only 13.6% (±5.21%). And the curve for COP increase was sigmoid shape, whereas that for Ht showed linear change. On the other hand, in the patients whose Ht levels showed low values, the curves for both COP and Ht showed similar pattern. Conclusion:? These results suggest that COP is a more sensitive indicator to be monitored for the hemodynamic status than Ht during hemodialysis.

AB  - A high mortality rate after hip arthroplasty has been reported in hemodialysis patients; however, there has been no previous study on predictors of mortality after hip arthroplasty so far. Objectives:? The purpose of the present study was to identify any risk factors associated with early death in hemodialysis patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. Methods:? We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients on hemodialysis who underwent hip arthroplasty between 1994 and 2001. The average age was 60 years, and the average hemodialysis duration was 116 months at the time of operation. Body mass index (BMI), operating time, and total blood loss were reviewed. Serum levels of albumin (Alb), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured preoperatively. Results:? Of these 34 patients, 9 died (26%). There were 2 perioperative deaths and 7 during follow-up period between 2 and 19 months. No significant difference was found with respect to patient age, hemodialysis duration, Alb, Ca, P, Alp, operating time, and total blood loss. Patients with lower BMI and PTH levels had an earlier mortality than patients with higher BMI and PTH levels (p?<?0.05 and p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? We conclude that despite an intensive care directed to our hemodialysis patients, the incidence of early death after hip arthroplasty is still high. If low BMI and serum levels of low PTH were detected before operation, we should pay special attention to early mortality after hip arthroplasty.
