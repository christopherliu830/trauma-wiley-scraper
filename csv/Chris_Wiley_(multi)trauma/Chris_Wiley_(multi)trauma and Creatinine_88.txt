AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) frequently occurs in hemodialysis (HD) patients. But, clinical characteristics of UGIB in HD patients are not well reported yet. Objective:? This study was designed to compare the clinical characteristics of UGIB between HD patients and normal population with intact renal function. Methods:? This study enrolled 24 HD patients with UGIB. Age- and sex-matched 26 patients with UGIB and normal renal function were selected as control group during the same period. Of the cases with UGIB, esophageal variceal bleedings due to liver cirrhosis were excluded in this study. We investigated the results of treatment and UGIB-associated mortality for 3 months after the event and then compared previous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Sx), endoscopic findings, treatment results, and mortality between HD patients and control. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. HD patients (n?=?24) Control (n?=?26) p value Age (years) 60±11 61±11 0.702 Sex [male/female (%)] 62.5/37.5 53.8/46.2 0.536 Previous GI Sx ??[asymptomatic/??symptomatic (%)] 33.3/66.7 65.3/34.7 0.024 Endoscopic diagnosis ??[vascular ectasia/others (%)] 45.8/54.2 15.3/84.7 0.020 Primary treatment ??[endoscopic/medical (%)] 70.8/29.2 61.5/38.5 0.488 Results of treatment ?Success/rebleeding (%) 75.0/25.0 92.4/7.6 0.095 ?Patient survival/UGIB- ??related death (%) 83.3/16.7 100/0 0.046 Conclusion:? Previous gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent in HD patients than normal population with intact renal function. In contrast, HD patients had higher incidence of vascular ectasia and mortality than normal population with intact renal function.

AB  - Survival has been defined as an index of adequacy of dialysis. These hard data are the basis for comparing results obtained by different schedules or policies. The aim of the study was to assess mortality rate recorded within a system of tailored dialysis (1?6 dialysis per week in out-of-hospital settings: home hemodialysis, self- and limited care dialysis). Data recorded in a single center (1998?2003) were compared with data gathered in the Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation in the whole Region (1998?2000). Methods:? Out-of-hospital dialysis unit is active since 1971, in which a new program integrating self- and limited care and home dialysis started since 1998. Patients:? Incident dialysis patients starting renal replacement therapy within the program and all further patients starting dialysis in the Region in the same period were compared in an historical prospective cohort study. Results:? 55 patients in the Unit and further 1443 patients in the whole Region started RRT since 1998. Main features of 55 patients were 32 males 23 females; median age 51 years, range 20?76; 72.7% displaying at least 1 comorbid factor. Throughout the period gross mortality rate was 4/125 patient-years in the Center. Kaplan?Meier curves showed a 1-year survival of 100% vs. 91%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region, and a 2-year survival of 95.5% vs. 76.6%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region (p?=?0.001). The main demographic features were remarkably different in both settings (for the whole Region median age 66 years, range 2.2?101, at least 1 comorbidity in 56.9% of patients). In an attempt to correct for the different baseline characteristics, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The whole model resulted in statistically significant value (p?=?0.000) and an increasing mortality risk resulted for age at starting dialysis, diabetes, and collagenopathy. In conclusion, tailored, high-efficiency dialysis policy may allow superior survival results. A longer follow up is needed to confirm our approach; in larger cohorts, the finding of a low mortality rate in a relatively young population with high comorbidity may underline the need to review our current concepts on dialysis adequacy.

AB  - One of the main symptoms of terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. One of the best applicable methods correcting anemia is using recombinant human erythropoietin preparation. Using recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of events had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patient had refraction to erythropoietin, which has spurred the search for new efficient methods correcting anemia. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of the laser on erythropoiesis and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency. In the course of the study, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocytes in blood, and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) were determined. At the beginning of the treatment, all hematological parameters 5 and 15 days after marrow stimulation were defined. 15 days after marrow stimulation with laser, increasing amounts of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were observed. The initial erythrocyte count was 2.22?±?0.1???1012/L, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/L and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During the laser treatment, erythrocyte count increased up to 2.9?±?0.8???1012/L, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/L and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3% (p?<?0005).

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula

AB  - Background:? Hemodialyzers can be used once or reused after treatment with chemicals or hot water. SU results in infusion of plastic compounds, particularly phthalic acid metabolites, into patients and chemical reuse releases formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or peracetic acid into the blood during dialysis. Methods:? We studied the increase in pulse rate (PR) and fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and patients' subjective overall quality evaluation (OE) of dialysis (1 worst, 5 best) during 3706 daily dialyses in 23 patients. Fall in blood pressure and rise in PR during dialysis and overall quality evaluation were compared as patients changed from SU or chemical reuse to hot water reuse. During SU and chemical reuse, dialysis time was shorter (121 vs. 148?min), urea clearance higher (241 vs. 175?ml/min) but ultrafiltration lower (1.5 vs. 1.7?kg/dialysis) than during hot water reuse. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. Methods n Systolic BP Diastolic BP PR OE CRU ??98 ?30?±?19 ?17?±?21 ???4?±?4 3.8?±?0.4 SU 2443 ?17?±?21 ??6?±?13 ???2?±?13 4.0?±?0.7 HWR 1165 ??8?±?21 ??1?±?11 ?0.2?±?12 4.2?±?0.7 All comparisons were of SU and chemical reuse to hot water reuse, p?<?0.0001. The results were the same whether cellulosic or polysulfone membranes were used. Hot water reuse, up to 25 times, did not result in changes in urea clearance, albumin leakage or Kuf, and ?-2-microglobulin reduction rates declined by only 10% over 15 reuses. Conclusion:? Hot water reuse results in the most comfortable dialysis and the best cardiovascular stability, with less decline in blood pressure and less tachycardia, when compared to chemical reuse or SU of dialyzers.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HCV on two markers of systemic inflammation, serum CRP, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HD patients. Methods:? The study included 118 HD patients (47% males, age 47?±?13 years, 9% diabetics) who were treated by on standard HD for at least 6 months. The patients were divided in two groups, depending on the presence (HCV+) or absence (HCV?) of serum antibodies against HCV. Serum albumin (S-Alb), plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), IL-6, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured, and the values were compared with 22 healthy controls. Results:? The median of hsCRP, IL-6, and the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio were: 3.5 vs. 2.1?mg/L, p?<?0.05; 4.3 vs. 0.9?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001; and 0.8 vs. 2.7?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001 for patients and controls, respectively. Age, gender, S-Alb, IL-6, and hsCRP did not differ between the HCV+ and HCV? patients. However, HCV+ patients had higher ALT (29?±?21 vs. 21?±?25?UI/L) and had been a longer time on HD (6.1?±?3.0 vs. 4.0?±?2.0 years) (p?<?0.0001), respectively. Moreover, HCV+ patients had a significantly lower median hsCRP/IL-6 ratio (0.7 vs. 0.9; p?<?0.05) as compared to the HCV group. Conclusion:? The finding that the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio was lower in HCV+ patients than in HCV? patients suggests that hsCRP may be a less useful marker of inflammation in HCV+ patients and that a different cut-off value for hsCRP may be required to define inflammation in HD patients.

AB  - Objective:? To have 1 nurse successfully train 2 patients at a time for nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) within a 7?10 week time period. Methods:? Over the past 6 years, Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. has evolved its NHHD program from 1 nurse training 1 patient during an average 6 week period to training 2 patients in a 7?10 week period. Patients came either from our in-center population or directly from internal medicine. Our pre-evaluation procedures and manual were revised. Patients were pre-evaluated for literacy, manual dexterity, strength, hearing and visual deficits, substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and compliance before being accepted into the program. A home visit was made to evaluate their environment, family interactions, and water source. Our training manual was rewritten to fifth grade level. Every patient was given index cards printed in 20 size font with step-by-step procedures for machine setup, put-on and takeoff, re-circulation, and power failure. Patients were dialyzed 4 days/week to improve cognitive function and ?dialyzed the bucket? 1 day, thus training 5 days/week. One nurse trained 2 patients, staggering their start dates 2 weeks apart to allow for both individual and group teaching. Fistula or IJ catheter was used for access. Patients were trained alone or with a partner. In the last week of training, patients were dialyzed for 7?h and were expected to complete all procedures independently. Results:? From March 2003 to August 2003, 6 patients were trained for NHHD. 2 patients finished training in 7 weeks, 2 in 9 weeks, and 2 in 10 weeks. Conclusion:? One nurse can successfully train 2 patients at a time for NHHD in a 7?10 week time period at a decreased cost to dialysis provider.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) patients are often inconvenienced when intravenous iron preparations are administered. Formerly, these patients received their medication in the clinic on an off-dialysis day or during in-center hemodialysis (HD). For the last 2 years, 5 patients in our HHD program have been receiving intravenous ferric gluconate during their routine HD session. Procedure:? All patients were trained in the proper administration of ferric gluconate in-center. No test dose was administered. Ferric gluconate was infused via the heparin infusion pump on their HD machine at a rate of 31.25?mg/h. Doses were of either 62.5?mg or 125?mg per session. K/DOQI guidelines for intravenous iron use were adhered to. TSATs greater than 25%, ferritin greater than 100?ng/mL and less than 800?ng/mL, and hemoglobin between 11 and 12?g% were the goals of therapy. Both loading doses (8 doses during sequential HD sessions) and maintenance doses every week or every other week were employed. Results:? Over the last 2 years, 223 doses were administered at home. No serious reactions occurred during the course of therapy. One patient experienced minor nausea and vomiting during one dose, which was thought to be possibly related to the iron infusion. This patient subsequently received ferric gluconate again without difficulty. Conclusion:? Ferric gluconate can be safely administered at home during HHD.

AB  - Purpose:? Several studies have showed that nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHD, 6 times weekly 6?8?h) results in a better outcome. How do patients and their partners experience this very intensive treatment that has a great impact on daily life? Methods:? We followed a cohort of 12 patients (11 male, 1 female, mean age 46.8?±?9.4 years, time for renal replacement 11.3?±?9.4 years) and their partners during a year after starting NHD, using questionnaires and interviews and the SF-36. Results:? Both the physical and the mental components of the SF-36 showed an improvement in all aspects (p?<?0.05), even in this small group. All couples considered NHD a tremendous improvement over routine thrice weekly dialysis. The drawbacks (such as daily routine and the intrusion of the treatment in bed) are outweighed by the advantages (such as better clinical condition, less fatigue, less uremic symptoms, better quality of life, more time, and free diet). Following are a few comments on NHD: ?NHD is a difference of day and night,??NHD gave me independence,??Since I do NHD, I do aerobics,??I am becoming too fat now!,??My husband now is much faster than I am when we walk or ride the bicycle,??There is no reason now why I won't live long,??I got an excellent, but demanding new job, which is possible thanks to NHD,??Being a good team is a prerequisite for success,??Don't expect too much. You will remain a chronic patient,??Become confident with ?conventional? home hemodialysis first before you start NHD.? Conclusion:? NHD results in a tremendous improvement of quality of life. However, patients and partners need active support.

AB  - Increased radial artery wall thickness (RAWT) is considered to be associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as well as coronary artery atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, exact measurement of RAWT by noninvasive method before the operation is very important. Objective:? This study was designed to evaluate accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 21 hemodialysis patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation for the first time. We measured RAWT (intima-media thickness) using high-resolution Doppler ultrasonography at the wrist before the AVF operation. We obtained specimens of the radial artery during the AVF operation and then measured RAWT by histologic examination. Results:? Mean age of the patients was 60?±?13 years and the number of females was 7 (33.3%). Mean values of RAWT measured by Doppler ultrasonography and histologic examination were 485?±?93??m (300?700??m) and 426?±?106??m (300?700??m), respectively. The value of RAWT of Doppler sonographic measurement well correlated with that of histologic measurement (r?=?0.800, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that Doppler ultrasonography is an effective tool in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients before AVF operation.

AB  - The influence of dialysis prescription on outcome is well established. Hemodialysis dose has been shown to have a distinct impact upon the morbidity and mortality rate in patients on regular treatment therapy. Hence, adequacy of dialysis should be guaranteed. New devices based in online conductivity measures have been developed to achieve an adequate dialysis dose. The aim of this study was to compare online conductivity monitor (OCM) with dialysis dose standard methods (Daugirdas Kt/V). 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. Each patient was subjected to OCM on midweek day, during 3 consecutive weeks on the same day that blood Kt/V samples were taken as well. Each patient got 3 OCM measurements and Kt/V samples. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level.

Also, OCM allows for an individualized dialysis dose. Furthers studies are required to evaluate its influence on patients' evolution.

AB  - Daily hemofiltration (D-HF) is a new treatment modality that shows unique solute removal characteristics and possibly provides high quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Objective:? To evaluate solute-removal characteristics of D-HF by kinetic modeling analysis. Methods:? Five HD patients with normal 4?h???3 times/week were switched to D-HF (2?h???6 times/week). Ultrafiltration rates (QF) or small solute clearances were approximately 100?mL/min. All the necessary kinetic parameters were determined from patients' physical data and HD portion of the clinical measurements. The two-compartment kinetic model predicted the concentration changes after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Results:? Concentrations of small solutes such as urea?nitrogen (UN) increased, whereas that of ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG) decreased after switching from normal HD to D-HF (Figure?1). Predicted solute concentrations for UN as well as ?2-MG correlated well with the clinical results. The model predicted that QF?=?140?mL/min may be required for time-averaged concentration (TAC) of UN to be unchanged. The model also predicted that the 7-times/week D-HF may not increase the TAC of UN very much even after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Conclusion:? D-HF is suitable for removing larger solutes but may not be good enough for removing small solutes. A 7-day treatment (7 times/week) may greatly improve the solute removal capacity of the so-called daily treatment (6 times/week) not only for larger solutes but also for small solutes.

AB  - Abstract: Scedosporium species are increasingly isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Scedosporium infections are generally resistant to multiple antifungals, and Scedosporium prolificans is particularly resistant to all single antifungal agents currently in use with in vitro testing. We report here a long-term renal transplant recipient who developed isolated S. prolificans septic monoarthritis and probable osteomyelitis. The infection was successfully treated with a combination of voriconazole and terbinafine in addition to joint washout but did not require radical surgery. This combination has been shown to have synergistic in vitro effect, and anecdotal in vivo success has also been reported recently. We also review the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of S. prolificans infection in patients with solid organ transplantation.
