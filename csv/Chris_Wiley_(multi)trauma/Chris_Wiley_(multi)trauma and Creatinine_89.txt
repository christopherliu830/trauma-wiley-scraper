AB  - Abstract: Scedosporium species are increasingly isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Scedosporium infections are generally resistant to multiple antifungals, and Scedosporium prolificans is particularly resistant to all single antifungal agents currently in use with in vitro testing. We report here a long-term renal transplant recipient who developed isolated S. prolificans septic monoarthritis and probable osteomyelitis. The infection was successfully treated with a combination of voriconazole and terbinafine in addition to joint washout but did not require radical surgery. This combination has been shown to have synergistic in vitro effect, and anecdotal in vivo success has also been reported recently. We also review the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of S. prolificans infection in patients with solid organ transplantation.

AB  - Abstract:? Nitric oxide (NO) may aggravate neuronal damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesized that NO produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) accelerates secondary damage to spinal tissue, which may be reversed by the neuroprotectant, melatonin. This study investigated the effects of combination therapy with melatonin (10?mg/kg) and exercise (10?m/min) on recovery from SCI caused by contusion. We examined locomotor recovery, iNOS gene expression, autophagic and apoptotic signaling, including Beclin-1, LC3, p53 and IKKα protein expression and histological alterations in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Melatonin in combination with exercise resulted in significantly increased hindlimb movement (P?<?0.05), a reduced level of iNOS mRNA (P?<?0.05) and more motor neurons in the ventral horn, versus control SCI and SCI plus exercise alone, with no effect on the other signaling molecules examined. This study shows that combined therapy with melatonin and exercise reduces the degree of secondary damage associated with SCI in rats and supports the possible use of melatonin in combination with exercise to reduce the side effects related to exercise-induced fatigue and impairment.

AB  - Summary Oncology treatments can cause significant toxicities, which may be life-threatening, significantly impact on patients' quality of life or necessitate changes to their treatment. This chapter provides guidance on the most common side effects of treatment, including diarrhoea, vomiting, rashes, myelosuppression, neuropathy and mucositis. Some toxicities occur acutely, whereas others (e.g. osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction and infertility) are longer-term complications of treatment. In addition, the underlying cancer itself can lead to a number of potential complications (e.g. bowel obstruction, renal failure and biliary obstruction) which may result in emergency hospital admission. Patients require careful assessment and management, particularly as in some cases it can be difficult to determine the underlying cause. For example, fatigue, anorexia, breathlessness, confusion and thromboembolism may be caused by both cancer and its treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY Donation criteria have been becoming more flexible over the years. Currently, the only absolute exclusion criteria are human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), uncontrolled tumor disease and bacterial or viral infections. Clinical conditions dictate organ viability criteria: biochemical, morphological and functional, that must be fulfilled by the donors and their organs in order to focus the decision on which donor organs can be used. These criteria attempt to assure that the transplanted organs function after the extraction, transformation, implantation and reperfusion process without transmitting any infectious or tumour disease. In recent years, the gross and microscopic appearance has become one of the fundamental criteria for selection of potentially viable organs. At present, there is no age limit for hepatic and renal donation; the principal contra-indication is chronic organ damage. The use of each organ must be decided individually after a profound analysis of all the viability criteria, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the implant of a certain organ for the recipient.

AB  - Summary Acute liver failure (ALF) is a medical emergency. Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), an artificial liver support system, can partly compensate for the detoxifying function of the liver by removing toxins from blood. To analyze the efficacy of MARS treatment, the outcomes of 113 ALF patients, treated with MARS between 2001 and 2007, were compared with a historical control group of 46 ALF patients treated without MARS between 1995 and 2001. Overall survival of transplanted patients was 94% in the MARS group and 77% in the control group (P?=?0.06). Without transplantation, survival was 66% and 40% (P?=?0.03), respectively. However, the etiological distribution of ALF differed significantly between the groups. In ALF patients with unknown etiology, groups were comparable at baseline; 91% and 69% of transplanted patients survived the MARS and control groups and the native liver recovered in 20% and 8% of the patients, respectively. Of the originally nonencephalopathic patients of unknown etiology, 36% underwent liver transplantation in the MARS group compared to 100% in the control group. Interpretation of the results was difficult in toxic etiology patients on account of differing baseline statuses. MARS treatment might partly explain the trend toward increased survival of ALF patients with unknown etiology.

AB  - Abstract Background Non-invasive fibrosis markers can distinguish between liver fibrosis stages in lieu of liver biopsy or imaging elastography. Aims To develop a sensitive, non-invasive, freely-available algorithm that differentiates between individual liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Methods Chronic HCV patients (n = 355) at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt, with liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage (METAVIR), were tested for preselected fibrosis markers. A novel multistage stepwise fibrosis classification algorithm (FibroSteps) was developed using random forest analysis for biomarker selection, and logistic regression for modelling. FibroSteps predicted fibrosis stage using four steps: Step 1 distinguished no(F0)/mild fibrosis(F1) vs. moderate(F2)/severe fibrosis(F3)/cirrhosis(F4); Step 2a distinguished F0 vs. F1; Step 2b distinguished F2 vs. F3/F4; and Step 3 distinguished F3 vs. F4. FibroSteps was developed using a randomly-selected training set (n = 234) and evaluated using the remaining patients (n = 118) as a validation set. Results Hyaluronic Acid, TGF-?1, α2-macroglobulin, MMP-2, Apolipoprotein-A1, Urea, MMP-1, alpha-fetoprotein, haptoglobin, RBCs, haemoglobin and TIMP-1 were selected into the models, which had areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.973, 0.923 (Step 1); 0.943, 0.872 (Step 2a); 0.916, 0.883 (Step 2b) and 0.944, 0.946 (Step 3), in the training and validation sets respectively. The final classification had accuracies of 94.9% (95% CI: 91.3?97.4%) and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.9?94.6%) for the training and validation sets respectively. Conclusions FibroSteps, a freely available, non-invasive liver fibrosis classification, is accurate and can assist clinicians in making prognostic and therapeutic decisions. The statistical code for FibroSteps using R software is provided in the supplementary materials.

AB  - Abstract BK disease is an opportunistic infection in organ transplant recipients and patients with other cellular immunodeficiencies. To the best of our knowledge, we report the second case of BK meningoencephalitis associated with nephropathy in a kidney transplant recipient. A 15-yr-old boy underwent a cadaveric kidney transplant without complications; however, 11 wk after the transplantation, he was admitted to the hospital for graft dysfunction and cytopenia, which were confirmed by BK nephropathy (plasma viral replication and histological evidence). Four days after his hospital admission, he developed a high-grade fever and headache. CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis with a positive PCR for BK virus. Reduction in immunosuppression and supportive care conducting cycles of immunoglobulin and cidofovir were successful in treating the patient. BK meningoencephalitis should be considered in kidney transplant recipients who present with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis.
