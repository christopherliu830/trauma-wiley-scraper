AB  - Abstract Deoxynivalenol (DON, also known as vomitoxin) is a common mycotoxin found worldwide, especially in contaminated food. DON is toxic to a variety of cells and tissues in humans. Three kinds of conjugated products (DON-3-glucuronide, DON-15-glucuronide and DON-7-glucuronide) can be found as major metabolites in human urine. Females and males show different patterns of exposure levels, and human exposure to DON also shows some geographical differences because of different DON levels in cereal-based foods, food intake habits and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression. Specifically, the C12, 13-deepoxy metabolite was found predominantly in French adults but was rarely detected in UK adults. However, a cohort of Spanish individuals demonstrated even lower DON levels than the levels in the UK populations, whereas a very high DON exposure level was detected in South Africa and Linxian, China. Recent publications have further indicated that DON could be detected in the urine of pregnant women from different countries, which suggests that there is a potential risk to both mothers and foetuses. Additionally, phytochemicals have been shown to be less toxic to cells and laboratory animals in research studies and may also be used as food additives for reducing the toxic effects of DON. In this review, we provide global information on DON metabolism, human exposure and gender differences in humans. Also, control strategies for this mycotoxin are discussed.

AB  - Successful treatment and prevention of kidney disease in dogs requires a multi-dimensional approach to identify and eliminate causes or exacerbating factors, provide professional evaluation on a regular basis and implement a comprehensive treatment programme when necessary. Over the years, many therapeutic and preventive interventions have been developed or advocated for chronic kidney disease in dogs, but evidence of efficacy or effectiveness is often lacking or highly variable. Accordingly, the main objective of this systematic review was to identify and critically appraise the evidence supporting various aspects of managing canine chronic kidney disease.

AB  - New-onset diabetes after liver transplantation (NODALT) is a frequent complication with an unfavorable outcome. We previously demonstrated a crucial link between donor graft genetics and the risk of NODALT. We selected 15 matched pairs of NODALT and non-NODALT liver recipients using propensity score matching analysis. The donor liver tissues were tested for the expression of 10 microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating human hepatic glucose homeostasis. The biological functions of potential target genes were predicted using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Both miR-103 and miR-181a were significantly highly expressed in the NODALT group as compared to the non-NODALT group. The predicted target genes (e.g. Irs2, Pik3r1, Akt2, and Gsk3b) were involved in glucose import and the insulin signaling pathway. We also observed dysregulation of miRNAs (e.g. let-7, miR-26b, miR-145, and miR-183) in cultured human hepatocytes treated with tacrolimus or high glucose, the two independent risk factors of NODALT identified in this cohort. The hepatic miRNA profiles altered by tacrolimus or hyperglycemia were associated with insulin resistance and glucose homeostatic imbalance as revealed by enrichment analysis. The disease susceptibility miRNA expressive pattern could be imported directly from the donor and consolidated by the transplant factors.

AB  - Pedalling during hemodialysis (HD) has been shown to increase solute clearance in a previous study. In the present study, we aimed to test whether an easy to perform exercise program, not requiring a special device, could yield similar outcomes. Fifteen HD patients with the mean age of 48.4?±?3.8 years were enrolled into the study. Patients with significant access recirculation (>10%), moderate to severe coronary artery disease, moderate to severe heart failure, severe chronic obstructive lung disease, and history of lower extremity surgery during last three month period were excluded. All patients were studied on two consecutive HD sessions with identical prescriptions. At the first session, standard HD was applied without exercise, whereas in the second session lower extremity exercise of 30 minutes duration was added. Reduction rates and rebound for urea, creatinine, and potassium and Kt/V were calculated. Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied in analysis and p?<?0.05 was accepted as significance level. All patients completed the study. When both sessions were compared, mean arterial blood pressure (97?±?3?mmHg vs 120?±?4?mmHg, p?<?0.001) and heart rate (77?±?1 beats/min vs 92?±?3 beats/min, p?<?0.001) were higher in the exercise group. On the other hand, urea reduction rates, rebound values of urea, creatinine, and potassium were similar in both groups. Conclusion:?In the study, we did not observe any changes in solute rebound and clearance with the exercise. Shorter duration of the exercise may be the explanation of failure to achieve desired outcomes. Increasing patients? tolerance and fitness levels by means of steadily increasing exercise programs may be of help. Additionally, mode of exercise may also be responsible for different outcomes.

AB  - Background? Continued haemorrhage remains a major cause of mortality in massively transfused patients, many of whom develop coagulopathy. When reviewing transfusion practice for these patients at our hospital, more than 10% received a suboptimal transfusion therapy and survivors had a higher platelet count than non-survivors. We therefore speculated whether the blood bank could improve its service and hence improve the outcome. Methods? The blood bank introduced monitoring the delivery of blood products and contacted the clinician provided there was an imbalance in the transfusion practice. For massively bleeding patients, transfusion packages, encompassing 5 red blood cells, 5 fresh frozen plasma and 2 platelet concentrates was introduced to improve haemostatic competence. The thrombelastograph (TEG) was implemented, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy. Results The fraction of suboptimally transfused patients declined from > 10% to < 3%. The transfusion package administered intraoperatively to patients operated for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in decreased postoperative transfusion requirements and improved 30-day survival (66% vs. 44%) compared to controls. ?Only performing TEG in patients with a significant bleeding as judged by the anaesthetist reduces the number of analyses by ~85%, whereas those patients with coagulopathy remain identified. The TEG showed 97% predictability in identifying a surgical cause of bleeding in postoperative patients. Ten percent of the massively bleeding trauma patients had hyperfibrinolysis as the major cause of bleeding, whereas 45% were hypercoagulable. Conclusion? The initiatives from the blood bank has improved the transfusion practice and, hence, survival in massively transfused patients at our hospital.

AB  - Abstract Coronary angiography (CA) is the gold standard evaluation of coronary artery disease in potential multi-organ donors. This use of iodinated contrast media could lead to contrast-induced acute kidney injury and consequently to delayed graft function (DGF). All patients in France who received a kidney from a 45-70-year-old donor without medical contraindication for cardiac donation and with at least one cardiovascular risk factor were included. Recipients of preemptive kidney transplant or multi-organ transplant, or who died within the first 8 days post-transplantation were excluded. Data were obtained from CRISTAL database. From March 2012 to June 2014, 892 kidneys from 483 donors were transplanted. DGF was reported in 38.9% of the 375 kidney recipients grafted with a kidney from the 217 donors who had CA and in 45.5% of the 440 kidney recipients who received a kidney from the 257 donors without CA. Multivariate analysis showed that CA or repeated injection of iodinated contrast media did not influence the risk of DGF. CA did not increase the risk of primary non-function, the duration of DGF or post-transplantation hospital stay and did not affect the graft function at 1 year. Evaluation of potential multi-organ donors with CA does not affect kidney graft outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Rhabdomyolysis in deceased donors usually causes acute renal failure (ARF), which may be considered a contraindication for kidney transplantation. From January 2012 to December 2016, 30 kidneys from 15 deceased donors with severe rhabdomyolysis and ARF were accepted for transplantation at our center. The peak serum creatinine (SCr) kinase, myoglobin, and SCr of the these donors were 15 569±8597 U/L, 37 092±42 100 ?g/L, and 422±167 ?mol/L, respectively. Two donors received continuous renal replacement therapy due to anuria. Six kidneys exhibited a discolored appearance (from brown to glossy black) due to myoglobin casts. The kidney transplant results from the donors with rhabdomyolysis donors were compared with those of 90 renal grafts from standard criteria donors (SCD). The estimated glomerular filtration rate at 2 years was similar between kidney transplants from donors with rhabdomyolysis and SCD (70.3±14.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 72.3±15.1 mL/min/1.73 m2). We conclude that excellent graft function can be achieved from kidneys donors with ARF caused by rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Although individual immunosuppression regimens vary, most patients are maintained on multi-drug regimens. As anticipated, metabolic, infectious, oncologic, and psychosocial complications have been reported in VCA recipients. The relatively few number of cases performed to date and the absence of uniformity in the reporting of results hinder the establishment of the long-term outcomes of VCAs. This chapter aims to review the reported outcomes and highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities available in this emerging field of transplantation.

DHS is a severe idiosyncratic adverse reaction with multi-organ involvement. However, acute necrotic hepatitis requiring an emergent LT is rare. Herein, we report a case of 12-yr-old girl who suffered from fulminant hepatitis and multi-organ failure due to DHS for PPD. She was saved by emergent LDLT. A high index of suspicion and rapid diagnosis are necessary not to miss this potentially lethal but rare disease.

Reye's syndrome is most common in children and rarely occurs in adults. Case presentation A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with disturbance of consciousness and respiratory failure. She had taken ibuprofen for headache. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V3M5 on admission. The laboratory findings revealed acute liver failure with prothrombin time ? international normalized ratio of 3.16, aspartate aminotransferase 12,548 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 5,725 IU/L, and blood ammonia 102 ?g/dL. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighed images of globus pallidus. We diagnosed the patient with RS induced by influenza A and use of ibuprofen. The patient received supportive care in the intensive care unit and her clinical outcome was favorable. Conclusion Ibuprofen might be a risk factor for RS.

AB  - Abstract In 2015, 2409 active candidates aged 12 years or older were added to the lung transplant waiting list; 2072 transplants were performed, the most of any year. The median waiting time for candidates listed in 2015 was 3.4 months; the shortest waiting time was for diagnosis group D. Despite the highest recorded transplant rate of 157 per 100 waitlist years, waitlist mortality continued a steady decade-long rise to a high of 16.5 deaths per 100 waitlist years. Measures of short- and long-term survival showed no trend toward improved overall survival in the past 5 years, except that 6-month death rates decreased from 9.4% in 2005 to 7.9% in 2014. At 5 years posttransplant, 55.5% of recipients remained alive. In 2015, 23 new child (ages 0?11 years) candidates were added to the list; 17 transplants were performed. Incidence of death was 6.1% at 6 months and 8.2% at 1 year for transplants in 2013?2014. Important policy changes will affect access to transplant. In February 2015, OPTN implemented a comprehensive revision of the lung allocation score to better reflect mortality risk. Broader geographic sharing of donor lungs for pediatric candidates and allowance for selected transplants across blood types for candidates aged younger than 2 years have been approved and are expected to improve pediatric access to transplant. The impact of these changes on lung transplant trends will be observed in the coming years.

AB  - Summary Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30?40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury. It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal surgery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modifiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

AB  - Objective Disruption to endochondral ossification leads to delayed and irregular bone formation and can result in a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders known as osteochondrodysplasias. These genetic disorders arise through disturbances in the complex processes of skeletal growth causing development of unsightly skeletal deformities. Methods? Each syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of detailed clinical and radiographic assessment. Lower limb deformities were the prime presenting feature. Results Here are presented three patients with diverse genetic syndromes, namely Wolcott?Rallison syndrome (WRS), Kniest dysplasia (KD) and Desbuquois dysplasia (DS). Genetic testing was performed in the patients with WRS and DS. The diagnosis of KD was made purely on a clinical and radiographic basis. Variable orthopaedic interventions to realign these patients' lower limbs were implemented with the aim of improving their balance and gait. Conclusions The aim of this paper is twofold. The first part is to outline the importance of diagnosing the causes of various skeletal abnormalities in patients with osteochondrodysplasias by phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The second part is to demonstrate our techniques for surgical corrections in patients with joint laxity and malalignment and show how far techniques for growth modulation, re-alignment and ligament reconstruction have advanced.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC), the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppressive agents, plays a crucial role in new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT). Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the ? cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC-induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/AKT and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (eg, PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (odds ratio = 2.692, P = .023, n = 135). Integrating grafts? CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs 0.79, P = .048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces ?hematogenous diabetes? via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Owner informed consent was obtained for all horses in the study.
