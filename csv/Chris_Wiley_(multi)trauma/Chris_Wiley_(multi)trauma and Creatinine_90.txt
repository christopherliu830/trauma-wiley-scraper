AB  - Abstract For patients with ischaemic heart disease, remote ischaemic conditioning may offer an innovative, non-invasive and virtually cost-free therapy for protecting the myocardium against the detrimental effects of acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury, preserving cardiac function and improving clinical outcomes. The intriguing phenomenon of remote ischaemic conditioning was first discovered over 20 years ago, when it was shown that the heart could be rendered resistant to acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury by applying one or more cycles of brief ischaemia and reperfusion to an organ or tissue away from the heart ? initially termed ?cardioprotection at a distance?. Subsequent pre-clinical and then clinical studies made the important discovery that remote ischaemic conditioning could be elicited non-invasively, by inducing brief ischaemia and reperfusion to the upper or lower limb using a cuff. The actual mechanism underlying remote ischaemic conditioning cardioprotection remains unclear, although a neuro-hormonal pathway has been implicated. Since its initial discovery in 1993, the first proof-of-concept clinical studies of remote ischaemic conditioning followed in 2006, and now multicentre clinical outcome studies are underway. In this review article, we explore the potential mechanisms underlying this academic curiosity, and assess the success of its application in the clinical setting.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries an increasing incidence rate worldwide and increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as the medical expenses during the post-AKI course. The Taiwan Consortium for Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKs) has thus launched a nationwide epidemiology and prognosis of dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (NEP-AKI-D) study, which prospectively enrols critically ill patients with AKI. Through thoroughly evaluating the risk and prognostic factors of AKI, we hope to lower the incidence of AKI and ESRD from the perspective of AKI-ESRD interaction. Methods The CAKs includes 30 hospitals which distribute widely through the four geographical regions (north, middle, south, and east) of Taiwan, and have a 1:1 ratio of medical centres to regional hospitals in each region. The NEP-AKI-D study enrols intensive care unit-based AKI patients who receive dialysis in the four seasonal sampled months (October 2014, along with January, April, and July 2015) in the included hospitals. The collected data include demographic information, pertaining laboratory results, dialysis settings and patient outcomes. The data are uploaded in a centre website and will be audited by on-site principal investigators, computer logic gates, and the CAKs staffs. The outcomes of interest are in-hospital mortality, dialysis-dependency and readmission rate within 90 days after discharge. Conclusion The NEP-AKI-D study enrols a large number of representative AKI patients throughout Taiwan. The results of the current study are expected to provide more insight into the risk and prognostic factors of AKI and further attenuated further chronic kidney disease transition.

AB  - Summary Oncology treatments can cause significant toxicities, which may be life-threatening, significantly impact on patients' quality of life or necessitate changes to their treatment. This chapter provides guidance on the most common side effects of treatment, including diarrhoea, vomiting, rashes, myelosuppression, neuropathy and mucositis. Some toxicities occur acutely, whereas others (e.g. osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction and infertility) are longer-term complications of treatment. In addition, the underlying cancer itself can lead to a number of potential complications (e.g. bowel obstruction, renal failure and biliary obstruction) which may result in emergency hospital admission. Patients require careful assessment and management, particularly as in some cases it can be difficult to determine the underlying cause. For example, fatigue, anorexia, breathlessness, confusion and thromboembolism may be caused by both cancer and its treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background Non-invasive fibrosis markers can distinguish between liver fibrosis stages in lieu of liver biopsy or imaging elastography. Aims To develop a sensitive, non-invasive, freely-available algorithm that differentiates between individual liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Methods Chronic HCV patients (n = 355) at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt, with liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage (METAVIR), were tested for preselected fibrosis markers. A novel multistage stepwise fibrosis classification algorithm (FibroSteps) was developed using random forest analysis for biomarker selection, and logistic regression for modelling. FibroSteps predicted fibrosis stage using four steps: Step 1 distinguished no(F0)/mild fibrosis(F1) vs. moderate(F2)/severe fibrosis(F3)/cirrhosis(F4); Step 2a distinguished F0 vs. F1; Step 2b distinguished F2 vs. F3/F4; and Step 3 distinguished F3 vs. F4. FibroSteps was developed using a randomly-selected training set (n = 234) and evaluated using the remaining patients (n = 118) as a validation set. Results Hyaluronic Acid, TGF-?1, α2-macroglobulin, MMP-2, Apolipoprotein-A1, Urea, MMP-1, alpha-fetoprotein, haptoglobin, RBCs, haemoglobin and TIMP-1 were selected into the models, which had areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.973, 0.923 (Step 1); 0.943, 0.872 (Step 2a); 0.916, 0.883 (Step 2b) and 0.944, 0.946 (Step 3), in the training and validation sets respectively. The final classification had accuracies of 94.9% (95% CI: 91.3?97.4%) and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.9?94.6%) for the training and validation sets respectively. Conclusions FibroSteps, a freely available, non-invasive liver fibrosis classification, is accurate and can assist clinicians in making prognostic and therapeutic decisions. The statistical code for FibroSteps using R software is provided in the supplementary materials.

AB  - The article presents studies performed before, during and after a marathon run (42 195 m) in a 32-year-old man who underwent a bilateral lung transplantation because of end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) 15 months prior to the race. Before the run his FEV1 was 81% predicted, compared with 19% predicted before the operation, and his maximal oxygen uptake was 31.9 ml/kg?1/min?1. He completed the New York City Marathon 1998 without major problems in 7 h 8 min 50s. Pulmonary tests, biochemical changes and endocrine responses indicated transient changes, mostly as expected in healthy marathon runners. The case demonstrates that physiological trainability and psychological will power following a successful bilateral lung transplantation can transform a chronically ill CF patient into a robust marathon runner.
