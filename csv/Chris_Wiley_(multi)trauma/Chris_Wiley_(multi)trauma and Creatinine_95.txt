Clancy, 3 Anna Janss, and 4 Benjamin Eidelman ( 1 Division of Neurology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ; 3 Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ; and 4 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL ) This symposium will address advances in clinical management and translational research regarding acute provoked seizures and chronic epilepsy in children with complex medical conditions, such as congenital heart disease, oncological disorders, and organ transplantation. These medical conditions are all complicated by acute provoked seizures and chronic epilepsy, involve treatment with medications with complex interactions with anti-epileptic drugs, and provide opportunities for translational research. The goals of the symposium are: 1)? Understand the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of acute provoked seizures in children with congenital heart disease, CNS and non-CNS neoplasms, and organ transplantation. 2)? Understand the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of chronic epilepsy in these patients, including interactions between anti-epileptic drugs and anti-arrhythmic drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunosuppressive agents. 3)? Recognize opportunities for translational research in this area, including neuro-protection, pharmacology and immunology.

AB  - Summary Objective Fracture risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance is increased, despite relatively preserved bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and composite indices of femoral neck strength in Koreans. Design A population-based, cross-sectional study from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Participants About 1243 men and 1433 women Measurements Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Femoral neck width and axis length were measured from hip dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and combined with BMD, weight and height to calculate composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load: compression (CSI), bending (BSI) and impact strength indices (ISI). Results HOMA-IR showed an inverse relationship with CSI, BSI and ISI in both genders before and after adjusting for confounders (P < 0·001?0·029). CSI was more strongly associated with HOMA-IR than BSI and/or ISI in both genders (P < 0·001?0·013). When men were stratified according to HOMA-IR quartiles, all strength indices decreased as the quartile increased, after adjusting for all potential confounders (P for trend <0·001?0·001), whereas CSI and ISI did in women (P for trend = 0·012 and 0·002, respectively). Fasting insulin levels, but not glucose levels, were negatively associated with all strength indices regardless of confounders (P < 0·001?0·044). Conclusions Insulin resistance is associated with low femoral neck strength, particularly against the compressive load. These findings suggest a better approach to evaluate bone health in insulin-resistant individuals.

All rights reserved Abstract: Superficial fungal infections are fairly prevalent in transplant recipients and the incidence increases with more intense graft-conserving immunosuppressive therapy. Majocchi's granuloma is a deep folliculitis caused by dermatophytes that involves deeper layers of the dermis. Only a few case reports of the condition have been documented in transplant recipients. After an extensive review of the medical literature, 21 cases were retrieved and are summarized here, together with a new case that occurred in a recent heart transplant recipient from our institution. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Majocchi's granuloma in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, with special focus on potential risk factors, offending pathogens, clinical presentation, therapeutic approaches, and outcome. General observations are presented emphasizing the relevance of close clinical and dermatologic follow-up in high-risk SOT patients with specific comments regarding treatment regimens and outcomes.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.
