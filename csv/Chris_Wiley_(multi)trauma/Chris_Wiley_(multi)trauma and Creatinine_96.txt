AB  - Early graft function is a major determinant of long-term outcomes after renal transplantation. Recently, recipient diabetes was identified as a risk factor for poor initial graft function in living donor renal transplantation. To further explore this association, we performed a paired analysis of deceased donor renal transplants from January 1994 to December 2005. A total of 25,523 transplant pairs were analyzed via conditional logistic regression. Diabetic recipients were older (53.16 vs. 46.75 years, p < 0.01), had a lower average panel reactive antibody (12% vs. 15%, p < 0.01) and fewer prior transplants (0.07 vs. 0.12, p < 0.01). Recipient diabetes, age, male gender, African American race, elevated peak panel reactive antibody and increased cold ischemia time were independent risk factors for delayed graft function. Specifically, diabetic recipients had increased risk of DGF on univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23?1.42, p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis confirmed this association but the risk differed by recipient gender; with diabetes having a greater effect in women (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.45?1.91, p < 0.01) compared to men (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.15?1.43, p < 0.01). It is unknown whether the deleterious impact of recipient diabetes on graft function after renal transplantation results from perioperative hyperglycemia or the chronic sequelae of diabetes.

Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

AB  - Introduction In ICU the need for acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) associates with high mortality and risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but there are limited long-term data. We investigated these outcomes and their risk factors. Methods Retrospective analysis of all adult patients admitted to a general, university hospital ICU 2005?2012, excluding chronic dialysis patients. ESRD was defined as need of RRT > 90 days or kidney transplant. Results Of 5766 patients included, 1004 (16%) received acute RRT; their 30-day mortality was 42% vs. 16% for those not requiring acute RRT (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.13 (0.96?1.32)). The 90-day mortality was 55% for patients receiving acute RRT vs. 22% for those who did not (adjusted HR 1.32 (1.15?1.51)) and 1-year mortality was 63% vs. 30%, respectively, (adjusted HR 1.31 (1.16?1.48)). The 7-year risk of ESRD for ICU patients surviving 90 days was 10% for patients who received acute RRT vs. 0.5% among those who did not (adjusted HR 5.9 (2.9?12.4)). Independent risk factors for ESRD included pre-existing kidney disease, pre-existing peripheral vascular disease and use of acute RRT in ICU. Conclusions The need of acute RRT was associated with markedly increased long term risk of death and ESRD; in contrast its use was not associated with 30-day mortality. In addition to acute RRT, decreased kidney function and peripheral vascular disease before ICU admission were risk factors for ESRD. It seems warranted offering medical follow-up to patients after acute RRT in ICU.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of supplemental arginine with nutritional support in the presence of sepsis, eighty-eight gastrostomized female Hartley guinea pigs were implanted with osmotic pumps effusing an Eschericia coli/Staphylococcus aureus mixture. Animals were randomized and infused for two weeks with isocaloric and isovolumetric diets containing 0%, 2%, 4%, or 6% supplemental arginine as arginine hydrochloride. Survival was 12/22 (54%) in 0%, 9/22 (41%) in 2% and 4%, and 2/22 (9%) in 6%. Analysis by chi-square test of independence was significant (p = 0.0141) with 6% survival lower than the others. Median survival was 11 days in 0%, 8 days in 2% and 6%, and 9 days in 4%. Median survival was longer in 0% than in 2% or 6% (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA: p = 0.02). Nitrogen balance was significantly lower in 6% compared to 0% on days 2 through 10, and lower than 2% and 4% on days 6 and 9. Nitrogen balance was higher in 0% than in 2% on days 4, 6, 10, and 13. Serum albumin and C3 were lower in all experimental groups than normal controls (ANOVA: p = 0.01). Comparison of liver, spleen, adrenals, gastrocnemius, and carcass weights, cell-mediated immunity as determined by contact sensitivity to DNFB, and transferrin showed no significant differences. There was a positive dose-response effect seen amongst the experimental groups for the amino acids arginine, ornithine, and citrulline in relation to the amount of supplemental arginine. This study suggests that dietary arginine supplementation does not enhance survival in a guinea pig model of established peritonitis. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 14:237?244, 1990)

AB  - Abstract Objective: This report describes the perioperative management of a dog with a right adrenal pheochromocytoma that presented with acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension. Additionally, a summary of pheochromocytoma and the idiosyncrasies of perioperative management of a pheochromocytoma are provided. Summary: A 7-year old male, neutered, Dalmation was presented for acute collapse, abdominal pain and tachycardia. Physical examination findings were consistent with hypoperfusion concurrent with multiple cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound revealed retroperitoneal effusion and a right adrenal mass intimately associated with the caudal vena cava. Incomplete right adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed a pheochromocytoma. Unique information provided: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first definitive report of acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage as the initial clinical manifestation of histologically confirmed adrenal pheochromocytoma in the dog.
