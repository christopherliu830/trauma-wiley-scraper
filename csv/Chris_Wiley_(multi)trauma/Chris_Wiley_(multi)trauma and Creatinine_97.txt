AB  - Carl E. Stafstrom*, Douglas Nordli?, Andrew Lux? and Lionel Carmant??*Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI; ?Neurology, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL; ?Pediatric Neurology, British Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, United Kingdom and ?Pediatric Neurology, Ste-Justine Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada Summary: Infantile spasms is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood that poses unique challenges for the clinician. An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.

AB  - The influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms on transplanted kidney outcome is not well understood. The aim of this one-centre study was to analyse the association between tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, interferon-? (IFN-?) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) genotypes and the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and 5-year kidney graft loss. Genotyping was performed in 199 subsequent kidney graft recipients from deceased donors without induction therapy based on polymerase chain reaction method using sequence-specific primers for TNF-α (-308A/G), IL-10 (-1082A/G, -819T/C and -592A/C), IL-6 (-174G/C), IFN-? (+874T/A) and TGF-?1 (in codons 10T/C and 25G/C). Genotypes were grouped according to the strength of cytokine expression. During a 5-year follow-up period, 14 patients died with functioning graft and 33 developed graft failure. The analysed polymorphisms were not associated with the incidence of DGF. The frequency of early episodes of AR was significantly associated only with TGF-?1 genotype. There was an association between -174G/C IL-6 gene polymorphism and the death-censored kidney graft survival. The risk of graft loss during 5-year follow-up period was greater by 57% for GG or GC (higher IL-6 production) than for CC carriers. None of the other analysed polymorphisms significantly influenced both patients and kidney graft survival, also in the analysis of the subgroup with human leucocyte antigen-DR mismatch. -174G/C IL-6 genotype of the kidney graft recipient could modulate the rate of graft excretory function deterioration and the risk of graft loss by influencing their constitutional expression.

AB  - Abstract Acute deterioration of patients with cirrhosis manifests as multiple organ failure requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Precipitating events may be viral hepatitis, typically in Asia, and drug or alcoholic hepatitis and variceal hemorrhage in the West. Patients with cirrhosis in the intensive care unit have a high mortality, and each admission is associated with a mean charge of US $116,200. Prognosis is determined by the number of organs failing (sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score), the presence of infection, and the degree of liver dysfunction (Child-Turcotte-Pugh or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores). The most common organ failing is the kidney; sepsis is associated with further deterioration in liver function by compromise of the microcirculation. Care of these critically ill patients with impending multiple organ failure requires a team approach with expertise in both hepatology and critical care. Treatment is aimed at preventing further deterioration in liver function, reversing precipitating factors, and supporting failing organs. Liver transplantation is required in selected patients to improve survival and quality of life. Treatment is futile in some patients, but it is difficult to identify these patients a priori. Artificial and bioartificial liver support systems have thus far not demonstrated significant survival benefit in these patients. (HEPATOLOGY 2011)

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.

AB  - Since the introduction of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV has become a chronic disease, with infected people in high-income countries approaching similar life expectancy to the general population. As this population ages, an increasing number of people with HIV are living with age-, treatment-, and disease-related comorbidities. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol abuse, and substance misuse have a role in age-related comorbidity. Some degree of immune dysfunction is suggested by the presence of markers of immune activation/inflammation despite effective suppression of HIV replication. Cumulative exposure to some antiretroviral drugs contributes to HIV-associated comorbidities, with risk increasing with age. Specifically, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir are associated with renal impairment, and TDF is known to cause loss of bone mineral density. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) was developed to improve on the safety profile of TDF, while maintaining its efficacy. TAF has better stability in plasma, and higher intracellular accumulation of tenofovir diphosphate in target cells, which has resulted in improved antiviral activity at lower doses with improved renal and bone safety. TAF has been studied extensively in randomized clinical trials and real-world studies. TAF-based regimens are recommended over TDF-containing regimens for the improved safety profile.

AB  - A technique for placement of a long-term arterial catheter that the author developed was used in 20 canine patients. The catheter was used for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. The technique involved the following steps post-sedation and placement of a local anesthetic: 1 Clipping and prepping of the medial aspect of the distal tibia and proximal metatarsal region; 2 Incision over the medial tibial malleolus just caudal to the cranial tibial muscle-tendon; 3 Blunt dissection of the space just caudal to the cranial tibialis tendon; 4 Isolation of the cranial tibial artery and loop placement proximally and distally; 5 Placement of a 3 Fr. polyurethane 4?8?cm catheter using a Seldinger wire technique; 6 Placement of a suture in the periosteium of the distal tibia and anchoring of the catheter with this suture; 7 Closure of the skin incision with sutures or staples; 8 Bandage application to hold the catheter in place. The entire surgical procedure was done using sterile technique. The catheter was able to be kept in place and working for up to 9 days (averaged 4 days). This compared favorably retrospectively over dorsalis pedis catheters that lasted only a maximum of 4 days. (average 1.5 days). Because of the size of the catheter (3 Fr.) it provided improved waveforms over that observed with the dorsalis pedis catheter (22?g) and its occlusion rate was very low (2 in 20). The cranial tibial artery catheter was found to be particularly effective because the catheter was able to be inserted several cm up the artery and the catheter was able to be anchored well. No major complications were observed with this technique. Because of its effectiveness it is recommended to be used routinely over femoral artery and dorsal pedis artery catheters.
