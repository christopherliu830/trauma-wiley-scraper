AB  - An 8-year-old Pêga breed donkey that presented with a history of persistent enlargement of the right leg was diagnosed with a rhabdomyosarcoma by surgical exploration and biopsy. The tumoral mass involved the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh. At presentation, the donkey was extremely painful and reluctant to walk. Initial physical examination showed a heart rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and a rectal temperature of 100.2°F. Venous blood was collected for a CBC and biochemistry. Postoperative care included antibiotic (potassium penicillin and gentamicin) and anti-inflammatory (phenylbutazone and dexamethasone). The donkey was very painful in the immediate postoperative period and developed dehiscence of the incision. It was unable to bear weight on the affected limb, very reluctant to walk, and lying down in sternal recumbency most of the time. Heart and respiratory rates ranged from 60 to 90 and 20 to 32, respectively. Because of the poor prognosis, euthanasia was indicated but the owner decided to keep the donkey alive to try semen collection. In order to improve life quality and making the semen collection possible, the anti-inflammatory therapy was stopped and an analgesic therapy with epidural opioids was selected. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was inserted in the first intercoccygeal space through an epidural Huber point needle. With the purpose of reaching the lumbosacral area, 20?cm of the catheter was advanced cranially from the needle tip. During 3 days, a combination of morphine (0.1?mg/kg) and tramadol (0.5?mg/kg) was administered daily with a total volume of 20?ml. During the first 24 hours after the first administration, heart rate ranged from 62 to 64 and respiratory rate from 20 to 24. It was not observed to have any adverse effect. The donkey improved during treatment standing most of the time and eating better. It was easier to hand walk, although it was not completely able to bear weight in the affected limb. Even during treatment, the donkey reacted intensely when the surgical area in the caudal aspect of the thigh was manipulated. On the forth day, it tried to copulate and semen was successfully collected by manipulation of the penis. As the semen was not classified as good enough to be frozen, the donkey was euthanatized. On post-mortem examination, the position of the catheter in the epidural canal was observed and 20?ml of methylene blue solution injected through the catheter before euthanasia. It was enough to totally stain the segment of epidural canal from the first intercoccygeal space to the lumbosacral joint. The opioid epidural analgesic therapy reported here was considered to be efficient to treat the painful condition of the donkey, but it was not able to completely abolish the pain.

AB  - Abstract Many parameters currently used for the pre-transplant assessment of liver allografts, are not reliable enough in predicting the likelihood of early graft dysfunction or non-function. It is generally accepted that bile secretion is a sign of hepatic function post-transplant and that bile flow shows a close linear relationship to the secretion of bile acids (?apparent choleretic activity?). We have studied bile flow, biliary bile acid concentrations and composition and measured apparent choleretic activity from hepatic bile collected with a new technique under controlled conditions at the time of retrieval from 18 donor livers. More than three samples were collected from each of 13 donors and a total of 65 samples of hepatic bile were analysed. Of these, ten showed typical apparent choleretic activity with a positive slope in the regression line analysis (correlation coefficient of 0.9), validating our collection technique.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Clostridium tetani infection is uncommon in dogs and cats. Up to this point in time just single case reports have been published in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of 13 dogs and one cat affected with Clostridium tetani. The medical records of the last ten year were reviewed. Dogs and cats that were identified as being infected with Clostridium tetani on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and/or bacterial culture from infected wounds were eligible for study inclusion. Thirteen dogs and one cat met the criteria for study inclusion. Six different breeds and mix-breed dogs were affected, German Shepherd dogs (n=4, 29%) and Labrador retriever (n=3, 21%) were the most frequently affected breeds. Observed clinical complications were ventricular aspiration pneumonia (n=7), laryngeal spasm (n=6), hypersalivation (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=3), and third degree AV block (n=1). Median days from onset of clinical signs until first signs of improvement were 10 days (range: 9?12 days). Median hospitalisation time was 18 days (range: 14?22 days). Six animals showed full recovery and 8 animals died or were euthanized. Death was associated with acute onset of ventricular tachycardia in 2 dogs, 1 dog died with non-responsive third degree AV-block, 3 dogs died after developing aspiration pneumonia, and 1 dog died of unknown causes.

AB  - The Rescue Glide Sked provides a practical means of moving a recumbent, non-ambulatory or injured horse from the site of an accident. Horses with serious injuries, displaying severe malnutrition or neurological symptoms, can be easily moved out of a stall or even down a trail to a horse ambulance for transport to a veterinary facility. It is a specialty cut piece of 8?? 4? recycled polypropylene with tie-down straps and steel attachment points for winch loading into an equine ambulance. A horse must be fully sedated during transport on the rescue glide to prevent further injury to itself or rescuers. Moving a recumbent horse is very difficult due to the weight of the animal, often causing damage to the head and eyes, and with many safety concerns for the rescuers (struggling, kicking). It may take 8 to 10 people to move a horse just a few feet, especially uphill or on high friction surfaces. Benefits of the Rescue Glide include that the plastic reduces the friction of the weight of the animal on the ground surface, so fewer people are needed to move the animal. The tough resilient plastic is flexible so it goes easily over obstacles such as logs, roots, or through ditches. It folds up around the animal's body to get through a standard stall door or tight spaces as might be encountered on a trail. The Glide may be attached to a winch, ropes pulled by human rescuers, or even vehicle (ATV, car, etc.) The practical use of the Rescue Glide has been demonstrated in numerous situations including severe limb injuries, neurological compromise, geriatric, recumbent/unable to rise, severe neglect/malnutrition, and recovery/removal of dead large animals. The equipment has been used at race tracks and riding competition events for transport of animals into ambulances, as well as by veterinary rescue response teams in trail riding accidents, pasture accidents, and severe trailer injuries. The Rescue Glide, in conjunction with an equine ambulance trailer, provides a safe and suitable means of transport of large animals to veterinary facilities and should be a part of the equine practitioner's emergency equipment.

AB  - The primary classes of drugs used for pain control in horses include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), the alpha-2 agonists, and the opiates, but each of these drug classes has significant adverse effects. Ketamine hydrochloride is a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the spinal cord and has been used in both dogs and humans to provide analgesia. The purpose of this study was to identify a safe administration rate for a continuous infusion of ketamine to awake horses and describe the clinical effects of this infusion. Six horses were administered a continuous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a low dose (0.4?mg/kg/hr) and high dose (0.8?mg/kg/hr). Each infusion took place over 6 hours and the horses were monitored during infusion as well as for the 6 hours post-infusion. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, activity level, and analgesic thresholds. Both the low dose and high dose rates were tolerated well by all horses with no signs of excitation or discomfort. Post-infusion heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased as compared to pre-infusion values (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) A significant increase in analgesic threshold was not identified. Subanesthetic infusions of ketamine to awake horses appear to be well tolerated and cause only mild changes in clinical parameters. Further research is needed to evaluate the analgesic potential of these infusions.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate whether ECG changes induced by hyperkalemia correspond with previously described changes. Design: Prospective Animals: Eighteen dogs and 22 cats with serum potassium levels >5.5?mEq/L as the result of various disease processes. Procedure: Once hyperkalemia was documented, the following data were collected: ECG (n=40), total magnesium (mg/dl) (n=18), total calcium (mg/dl) (n=31), and venous blood gas (n=20). Animals were divided into 5 groups based on expected ECG's changes associated with hyperkalemia (mEq/L): Group 1- 5.5?6.5; Group 2- 6.6?7.0; Group 3- 7.1?8.5; Group 4- 8.6?10.0; Group 5- >10.0. ECG's were interpreted to determine if the rate, rhythm and changes in the P-QRS-T complex were similar to those previously reported. Results: Twelve ECGs demonstrated changes previously described, while 28 did not: Group 1 (n=7)- 1/7; Group 2 (n=2)- 0/2; Group 3 (n=14)- 4/14; Group 4 (n=6)- 3/6; Group 5 (n=11)- 4/11. Many ECG abnormalities not previously described were also identified such as atrioventricular dissociation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Blood gas analysis revealed acidemia (19/20) with severe acidemia (pH<7.2) in the majority (16/19). Hypocalcemia was documented (5/13) and most of these patents (4/5) were in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia was documented in the majority of patients (10/18), though not in one particular group. Clinical Implications: It is difficult to establish typical ECG changes in patients with hyperkalemia, which represents a departure from the historical description. Hypocalcemia may be involved with ECG changes and arrhythmias in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia causes electrocardiographic abnormalities similar to those described with hyperkalemia and therefore does not explain the results of this study. There likely are complex interactions with electrolytes and acid base abnormalities that affect ECG formation.

AB  - Objective: To determine the amount of time required to reach the highest concentrations of oxygen at the patient's face and to determine what these highest concentrations of oxygen were with various non-invasive methods of providing supplemental oxygen using a commercial oxygen content analyzer. Procedure: Three healthy cats and 3 healthy dogs were each individually given supplemental oxygen by 6 different means, each done at 2 rates (5?L and 15?L per minute). The methods tested were: 1) Plastic sheet over conventional cage door (PSCD); 2) Blow-by where the tubing delivering the oxygen was held 8?cm from the face (BB); 3) Large plastic bag covering the patient (BAG); 4) Anesthesia induction chamber (AIC); 5) Synder oxygen cage (SOC); and 6) Crowe Oxygen E-Collar (COC). Prior to the testing, the commercial oxygen content analyzer (Mini-Ox) was calibrated. Results: Significant repeatable differences were consistently observed between the 6 methods of oxygen delivery. Results of both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rates consistently indicated that the highest oxygen concentrations were achieved with the anesthesia induction chamber and large plastic bag with oxygen concentrations reaching approximately 95% and 90%, respectively between 5 to 15?min. The BAG method had the advantage of allowing additional room for patient manipulation and the ability to place intravenous catheters while continuing to give supplemental oxygen. The plastic sheet covering a conventional cage door provided oxygen concentrations of 50% and 60% at 15 and 45?min, respectively. The Crowe Oxygen E-Collar achieved oxygen concentrations of 70% in 1.5?min. Blow-by was found to be the simplest method. It increased FiO2 to 40% within 2?min. The Synder oxygen cage was able to achieve 45% oxygen concentration within 30?min with an oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min. It was able to achieve 60% at 45?min (similar to the plastic bag on the cage). Conclusion: The order of effectiveness of providing non-invasive oxygen supplementation, from the highest to the lowest concentrations, was AIC, BAG, COC, PSCD, SOC, and BB. The fastest to the slowest increases in oxygen concentrations followed the same order at both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rate and they were BB, COC, AIC, BAG, PSCD, and SOC. SOC was the most inefficient means of providing oxygen while AIC, BAG and COC were the most efficient.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish reference values of respiratory mechanics and diffusion capacity in awake llamas for the interpretation and diagnosis of respiratory disease in critically ill camelids. The following procedures were performed in 10 healthy adult llamas (2?9 years; 100?204?kg): Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography and Pneumotachography (RIP) for the assessment of thoraco-abdominal synchrony and airflow obstruction (Hoffman, J Appl Physiol 2001;91: 2767?75), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and functional residual capacity (FRC) via helium dilution, esophageal balloon-pneumotachography to determine pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn), as well as Monofrequency Forced Oscillatory Mechanics (FOM) (Young, J Appl Physiol 1994;76:2467?72) to establish respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at the oscillatory frequencies of 1,2,3,5 and 7?Hz. RIP was further performed in 3 camelid patients to determine the cause of respiratory failure. The results of conventional lung mechanics, FOM (1?Hz), DLCO and FRC in healthy llamas are listed in the table below. Rrs at 1?Hz (closest to breathing frequency) was positively correlated with RL (P=.05). The calculated mean resonant frequency was 3.37 (+/?0.68) Hz. RIP results showed a peak difference between plethysmographic flow (V'sum) and nasal flow (V'n) of 2.61 (+/?1.02) during expiration (PEsf), and 2.48 (+/?1.04) during inspiration (PIsf). The area difference between V'sum and V'n was 0.05 (+/?0.14) and 0.05 (+/?.04) during the first 25% of expiration (SFEx) and inspiration (SFIx), respectively. Noninvasive evaluation of respiratory mechanics in clinical patients was essential to establish severity, type and progression of respiratory disease, especially in camelids presenting for upper airway obstruction, pulmonary disease or thoraco-abdominal asynchrony.

AB  - It has been recognized that a percentage of clone calves suffer from persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN). It has been proposed by some investigators that an imbalance between vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin (ET-1) and vasodilators (such as NO) are involved in the genesis of the problem. Additionally, some clone calves and human infants are refractory to more traditional therapy or require prolonged treatment for PPHN and these patients appear to have increased smooth muscle in their pulmonary small resistance vessels suggesting chronicity. ET-1 is a known mitogen of vascular smooth muscle. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate ET-1 concentrations in the blood of clone, the blood of their surrogate dams and in fetal fluids to investigate the utility of using these fluids for prepartum evaluation of the clone. Blood was collected from calves and their surrogates at the time of delivery into heparin tubes; the plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen until assayed. Fetal fluid samples were also obtained and frozen. Endothelin-1 concentration was determined using a commercially available RIA. Oxygen-dependent calves were those calves requiring, at a minimum, intranasal oxygen insufflation at rates of 5 or more L/min to maintain SPO2 values of >90%. Samples were obtained from a total of 40 calves; 13 calves were considered to be oxygen dependent and 27 calves were deemed non-oxygen dependent. Plasma ET-1 concentrations tended to be larger in oxygen-dependent calves (2-sample T test; p=0.16). Fetal fluid ET-1 concentration was significantly larger in the oxygen-dependent group (2-sample T test; p=0.0003). No difference between groups was detected in ET-1 measured in the blood of the surrogates; however, maternal blood ET-1 concentration was weakly but significantly correlated with fetal fluid ET-1 concentration overall (Correlation=0.456; p=0.007) and the correlation was stronger within the oxygen dependent group (Correlation 0.780; p=0.002). These data suggest that ET-1 may play a role in pulmonary function abnormalities in clone calves in the immediate post-partum period.
