AB  - Abstract??? Maxillofacial injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and demand meticulously planned treatment. The aim of this present multi-center study was to evaluate the occurrence of dento-alveolar and maxillofacial injuries over a 5-year period. A retrospective cohort study of data from the Israel Trauma Registry was conducted for the years 2000?2004. The registry includes all trauma patients admitted and hospitalized due to an injury. Of the 111?010 hospitalized trauma patients, 5886 (5.3%) were diagnosed with maxillofacial or dental injuries. The main causes of injuries for hospitalized trauma patients were falls (48.1%) and motor vehicle accidents (25.2%), while the major causes of facial and dental injuries were vehicle accidents (39.6%, 56.8%, respectively) and falls (32.1%, 26.7%, respectively). High-risk age groups for dental and facial trauma were 10?18?years and 19?28?years, respectively, while for other trauma, ages for the greatest risk ranged from 0 to 9?years and over 59?years. Males were injured two to three times more frequently than females. A better understanding of the etiology of maxillofacial and dental injuries and identifying the high-risk groups should lead to appropriate prevention programs and treatment methods.

AB  - Abstract Time-out protocols have reportedly improved team dynamics and patients? safety in various clinical settings ? particularly in the operating room. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a Trauma Care checklist, which outlines steps to follow immediately after the primary and secondary surveys and prior to the team leaving the patient. The WHO Trauma Care checklist's main perceived benefit is the prompting of clinicians to complete trauma admissions as per evidence-based guidelines. The WHO Trauma Care checklist, while likely to be successful in reducing errors of omission related to hospital admission, may be limited in its ability to reduce errors that occur in the initial 30 min of trauma reception ? when most of the life-saving decisions are made. To address this limitation a Trauma Team Time-out protocol is proposed for initial trauma resuscitation, targeting the critical first 30 min of hospital reception.

AB  - calleja p., aitken l.m.  (b) conduits and barriers to information transfer in trauma care and related settings; and (c) interventions that have an impact on information communication at handover and beyond. Background.? Information transfer is integral to effective trauma care, and communication breakdown results in important challenges to this. However, evidence of adequacy of structures and processes to ensure transfer of patient information through the acute phase of trauma care is limited. Data sources.? Papers were sourced from a search of 12 online databases and scanning references from relevant papers for 1990?2009. Review methods.? The review was conducted according to the University of York?s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Studies were included if they concerned issues that influenced information transfer for patients in healthcare settings. Results.? Forty-five research papers, four literature reviews and one policy statement were found to be relevant to parts of the topic, but not all of it. The main issues emerging concerned the impact of communication breakdown in some form, and included communication issues within trauma team processes, lack of structure and clarity during handovers including missing, irrelevant and inaccurate information, distractions and poorly documented care. Conclusion.? Many factors influence information transfer but are poorly identified in relation to trauma care. The measurement of information transfer, which is integral to patient handover, has not been the focus of research to date. Nonetheless, documented patient information is considered evidence of care and a resource that affects continuing care.

AB  - Abstract Objectives A multidisciplinary approach that emphasised improved triage, early pelvic binder application, early administration of blood and blood products, adherence to algorithmic pathways, screening with focused sonography (FAST), early computed tomography scanning with contrast angiography, angio-embolisation and early operative intervention by specialist pelvic surgeons was implemented in the last decade to improve outcomes after pelvic trauma. The manuscript evaluated the effect of this multi-faceted change over a 12-year period. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing patients presenting with serious pelvic injury in 2002 to those presenting in 2013. The primary exposure and comparator variables were the year of presentation and the primary outcome variable was mortality at hospital discharge. Potential confounders were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results There were 1213 patients with a serious pelvic injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale?â‰¥3), increasing from 51 in 2002 to 156 in 2013. Demographics, injury severity and presenting clinical characteristics were similar between the two time periods. There was a statistically significant difference in mortality from 20% in 2002 to 7.7% in 2013 (P?=?0.02). The association between the primary exposure variable of being injured in 2013 and mortality remained statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio 0.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.02?0.60) when adjusted for potential clinically important confounders. Conclusions Multi-faceted interventions directed at the spectrum of trauma resuscitation from pre-hospital care to definitive surgical management were associated with significant reduction in mortality of patients with severe pelvic injury from 2002 to 2013. This demonstrates the effectiveness of an integrated, inclusive trauma system in achieving improved outcomes.

Physical examination findings included tachycardia, tachypnea, and hind limb paresis in a laterally recumbent patient. Radiographs, laboratory evaluation, and abdominocentesis revealed the presence of hemoperitoneum, blunt hepatic trauma, pneumothorax, and a small abdominal hernia. The ferret was treated with resuscitative fluids, thoracocentesis, abdominal counterpressure, and blood transfusion. This is the first case report of multi-systemic trauma in a ferret. The ferret made a complete recovery and was discharged to the referring veterinarian three days after presentation. (Vet. Emerg. Crit. Care, 10:13?18, 2000)

AB  - Background Young children are at particular risk for injury. Ten per cent to twenty-five per cent develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no empirically supported preventive interventions exist. Therefore, this study evaluated the efficacy of a standardised targeted preventive intervention for PTSD in young injured children. Methods Injured children (1?6Â years) were enrolled in a multi-site parallel-group superiority prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Australia and Switzerland. Screening for PTSD risk occurred 6?8Â days postaccident. Parents of children who screened ?high-risk? were randomised to a 2-session CBT-based intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Primary outcomes were PTSD symptom (PTSS) severity, and secondary outcomes were PTSD diagnosis, functional impairment and behavioural difficulties at 3 and 6 months postinjury using blinded assessments. Trials were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000325606) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02088814). Trial status is complete. Results One hundred and thirty-three children screened ?high-risk? were assigned to intervention (nÂ =Â 62) or TAU (nÂ =Â 71). Multilevel intention-to-treat analyses revealed a significant intervention effect on PTSS severity over time (bÂ =Â 60.06, 95% CI: 21.30?98.56). At 3 months, intervention children (MÂ =Â 11.02, SDÂ =Â 10.42, range 0?47) showed an accelerated reduction in PTSS severity scores compared to control children (MÂ =Â 17.30, SDÂ =Â 13.94, range 0?52; mean difference ?6.97, 95% CI: ?14.02 to 0.08, p adj.Â =Â .055, dÂ =Â 0.51). On secondary outcomes, multilevel analyses revealed significant treatment effects for PTSD diagnosis, functional impairment and behavioural difficulties. Conclusions This multi-site RCT provides promising preliminary evidence for the efficacy of a targeted preventive intervention for accelerating recovery from PTSS in young injured children. This has important clinical implications for the psychological support provided to young children and parents during the acute period following a single-event trauma.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the potential linkage between social organization and trauma in a sample of cercopithecids from Cameroon. Skeletal trauma is described in a museum collection of eight sympatric monkey species. Macroscopic analysis was carried out on a total of 139 complete skeletons of mangabeys, colobines and guenons. Species in multi-male groups were found to have higher fracture frequencies than those in uni-male groups. These higher frequencies may be related to intra-specific male?male aggression; however, similarities in fracture patterning between males and females in multi-male groups suggest that other factors may be involved. Although fracture etiology may not be identified with certainty, this study suggests that predation may indirectly be a cause of traumatic injuries in those species of cercopithecid monkeys displaying multi-male social organizations. The data presented also highlight the utility of museum collections as an additional resource in analyses of primate behavior, demonstrating that behavioral information does not die when the animal does.

AB  - Abstract Few studies have prospectively analysed the delivery of care in trauma patients. This study undertook a prospective analysis of performance and consistency of care at a Level 1 trauma centre. A 3-month prospective study was undertaken of all admitted trauma patients at Liverpool Hospital. Data were collected on patient demographics, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), length of hospital stay, patient outcome and cause of death. Delivery of care was evaluated using 30 performance indicators and assessment of errors. Two hundred and thirty-six consecutive major trauma patients were studied. 73.3% were male, mean age 39 years. The main mechanism of injury was road trauma in 46.2%. Mean ISS was 12 and 64 patients had an ISS â‰¥16. Error-free care was delivered in 145/236 (61.4%). There were 145 errors in 91 patients (38.6%). Errors in judgement and delays in diagnosis accounted for 56/145 (38.6%) and 48/145 (33.1%), respectively. Errors occurred most commonly in the Emergency Department (ED) (48.3%), and trainees from all specialties were responsible for 67.5% of errors. There were 25 near misses detected. Three patients developed major sequelae or complications from errors. One of 13 deaths was deemed potentially preventable. This study has shown that while 61.4% of admitted trauma patients receive optimal care, errors are frequent, resulting in a spectrum of outcomes from near misses to death. The majority of errors result from the activity of unsupervised trainees and relate to errors in judgement and delays in diagnosis. Clearly, there is room for improvement of the delivery of trauma care.

Multi-traumatized refugees in outpatient clinics have high prevalence of PTSD, DESNOS, comorbid depression and anxiety disorders. A more severe symptomatology was found in patients diagnosed with both PTSD and DESNOS, than in those diagnosed with only PTSD. Higher rates of unemployment, weak social network and weak social integration were also prevalent in these outpatients, and related to increased psychiatric comorbidity and severity of symptoms. Further research may clarify the existence of a cumulative relationship between pre-resettlement traumas and post-resettlement stressors in the mental health of refugees, which in turn may help to improve therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) at this Major Trauma Centre; to determine independent predictors of multi-region injury; and to evaluate the accuracy of the decision to perform WBCT in detecting multi-region injury. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single Major Trauma Centre in New South Wales, Australia. All adult patients who triggered trauma team activation and required an initial CT scan were studied. Primary outcome was the presence of multi-region injury. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to derive a prediction model for the need for WBCT based on our primary outcome. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the accuracy of the derived model and the clinical decision to perform WBCT. Results Six hundred and sixty patients were studied. WBCT scanning rate was 9.3% of all trauma activations. Of the patients who underwent WBCT, 31/98 (32.0%) had multi-region injury compared with 31/562 (5.5%) who underwent selective CT scanning (P < 0.001). Predictors of multi-region injuries were GCS <9 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3?7.0, P = 0.01), full trauma activation (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5?5.3, P = 0.001), fall >5?m (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8?13.4, P = 0.003) and pedal cyclist (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2?7.5, P = 0.02). Area under ROC curve for the clinical decision to perform WBCT was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63?0.76) compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67?0.80) for the prediction model. Conclusion The decision to perform WBCT scans in trauma should be at the discretion of the treating clinician. Applying a prediction rule would increase the number of WBCT scans performed without improving overall accuracy.

AB  - Objectives To investigate whether implementing a geriatric resuscitation protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement is associated with lower mortality through the early recognition of occult hypoperfusion (OH). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level I trauma center. Participants All hemodynamically stable individuals with blunt trauma aged 65 and older admitted to the Level I trauma center from October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011 (nÂ =Â 1,998). Measurements Mortality over time (according to quarter) was analyzed using an adjusted logarithmic regression model stratified according to the presence of OH. OH was defined as lactate of 2.5Â mM or greater. Results Overall mortality was 3.9% (nÂ =Â 78). Admission venous lactate was collected in 73.5% of participants, of whom 20.5% had OH (nÂ =Â 301). In participants with OH, a significant decrease in mortality was observed over time (adjusted coefficient of determination (R2)Â =Â 0.66, PÂ =Â .002). A smaller yet significant decrease in mortality rates in participants with normal perfusion status was also observed (adjusted R2Â =Â 0.55, PÂ =Â .01). Conclusion Early identification and treatment of OH in elderly adults with trauma using venous lactate-guided therapy coupled with early trauma surgeon involvement was associated with significantly lower mortality. A protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement should be followed to improve the care of elderly adults with trauma.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques in the diagnosis of arterial root lesions (ARL) in order to improve the understanding and diagnostic accuracy of ARL. We retrospectively analyzed the MSCT imaging findings of 1546 patients. MSCT parameters included the aortic valve annulus level, sinuses of Valsalva level, a sinotubular junction level, ascending aorta, effective diameter, aortic wall thickness, coronary artery height, and coronary sinus depth. The specific measurement method used was curved planar reformation. MSCT found 93 cases of aortic valve disease (AVD). The diagnostic accuracy of MSCT for AVD was 91.7% (33/36). MSCT found 95 cases of acute aortic syndrome involving the aortic root, 71 of which were Stanford type A-aortic dissection (AD), 22 cases of Stanford type A-interstitial hematoma (IHM), and two cases of penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU). MSCT diagnosed Stanford type A-AD, Stanford type A-IHM, and PAU had a specificity of 99.8% and a sensitivity of 98.9%. In conclusion, MSCT enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques can accurately display the aortic root and adjacent structures, with clear positioning and high diagnostic accuracy, which can provide important basis for clinical diagnosis, preoperative localization, and postoperative follow-up.

AB  - Summary? In this selective study, 59% of the patients had a renal injury (laceration, rupture or pedicle injury). A normal IVU excluded significant renal injury after blunt trauma. Renal angiography was more accurate than ultrasonography or computed tomography in determining the extent of the injury. A retroperitoneal haematoma found during laparotomy should be explored if significant renal trauma cannot be excluded. Renal salvage after rupture or pedicle injury should be attempted in stable patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report summative data from the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) registry. Design Multi-institutional veterinary trauma registry data report. Setting VetCOT identified veterinary trauma centers (VTCs). Animals Dogs and cats with evidence of trauma presented to VTCs with data entered in the VetCOT registry September 1, 2013?March 31, 2017. Interventions VetCOT created a standardized data collection methodology for dog and cat trauma. Data were input to a web-based data capture system (REDCap) by data entry personnel trained in data software use and operational definitions of data variables. Data on demographics, trauma type (blunt vs penetrating), preadmission care, hospitalization and intensive care requirement, trauma severity assessment at presentation (eg, modified Glasgow coma scale and animal trauma triage score), key laboratory parameters, necessity for surgical intervention, and case outcome were collected. Summary descriptive data for each species are reported. Measurements and Main Results Twenty-nine VTCs in North America, Europe, and Australia contributed information from 17,335 dog and 3,425 cat trauma cases during the 42-month reporting period. A large majority of cases presented directly to the VTC after injury (80.4% dogs and 78.1% cats). Blunt trauma was the most common source for injury in cats (56.7%); penetrating trauma was the most common source for injury in dogs (52.3%). Note that 43.8% of dogs and 36.2% of cats were reported to have surgery performed. The proportion surviving to discharge was 92.0% (dogs) and 82.5% (cats). Conclusions The VetCOT registry proved to be a powerful resource for collection of a large dataset on trauma in dogs and cats seen at VTCs. While overall survival to discharge was quite high, further evaluation of data on subsets of injury types, patient assessment parameters, interventions, and associated outcome are warranted.

AB  - The orbit is made up of seven bones, of which, the inferior wall is most vulnerable to injury and the lateral wall, the least common. In assessing facial trauma, it is crucial to include a comprehensive examination and to manage the orbital fractures accordingly. Orbital floor fracture may present with enophthalmos, diplopia and inferior orbital neuropathy. The infra-orbital rim may show a step-off deformity. Full ophthalmologic evaluation is important to rule out optic nerve neuropathy, retinal bleed, and corneal abrasion. Fracture extending to the superior orbital fissure is known as the superior orbital fissure syndrome, often presented with third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves dysfunction. Orbital roof fracture may involve the frontal lobe and frontal sinus. Fracture involving the naso-orbital ethmoid complex may present with CSF leak, diplopia, displaced medial canthus and nasal fracture. High-resolution 1.5mm CT scans is most useful in the aid of diagnosis in addition to tomography. Displaced fractures should be corrected surgically before bony union. Two examples of complex orbital fractures will be presented, illustrating the importance of a multi-surgical team approach to achieve the optimum results.

AB  - We report four cases of occult pneumothorax in patients who had suffered blunt trauma. In each case supine chest X-rays failed to diagnose an anterior pneumothorax. Subsequent spiral computerised tomography scans of the chest showed anterior pneumothoraces in all cases. In two of the cases anterior pneumothoraces were present in spite of a chest drain having been placed in the pleural cavity. We recommend the insertion of anteriorly positioned chest drains to relieve pneumothoraces in severely injured trauma patients.

AB  - Background:? We investigated (1) the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in treatment-seeking subjects with substance use dependence (SUD), (2) the association between comorbid PTSD and the severity and course of addiction and psychopathology, and (3) this association in patients with subsyndromal PTSD, and in trauma exposure without PTSD. Methods:? In this cross-sectional study, 459 subjects in 14 German addiction treatment centers participated with alcohol-dependence (A) in 39.7%, drug-dependence (D) in 33.6%, or both (AD) 26.8%. The diagnostic measures included the International Diagnostic Checklists (IDCL), Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Associations between independent characteristics and outcomes were analysed by univariate and multivariate statistics. Results:? 25.3% of the subjects had PTSD confirmed by both IDCL and PDS with higher rates in the AD (34.1%) and D (29.9%) groups compared with group A (15.4%, p?<?0.001). In 22.8%, PTSD was subsyndromal (either IDCL or PDS positive) without significant differences between SUD groups, and 18.3% met PTSD trauma criteria A without PTSD (exposure). After controlling for SUD and gender, trauma subgroups significantly differed regarding the onset of alcohol-related symptoms (p?<?0.02), numbers of previous admissions (p?<?0.03), severity of SUD (p?<?0.001), current craving (p?<?0.02), and psychopathology (p?<?0.001). We observed the worst outcome in PTSD, while trauma exposure had no effects. Conclusions:? The prevalence of PTSD is higher in drug than in alcohol dependence. The more strictly PTSD is diagnosed (by interviewer and questionnaire) the more clearly are associations with characteristics of SUD. PTSD seems to be an independent risk factor for an unfavorable outcome of SUD.

AB  - Trauma is an important health problem. With the anticipated decline in communicable diseases and nutritional problems in the next millennium, trauma might replace communicable diseases as a problem and rank second only to non-communicable diseases. Trauma is a surgical disease and a general surgeon?s leadership is imperative to the success of regional trauma systems. Designation of trauma centres would improve patient outcomes, increase surgeons? experience and reduce costs in health care. The success of the Advanced Trauma Life Support Programme has shown how the input of surgeons can change the concept of our care for trauma victims. The lack of local trauma data has limited our appraisal to intellectual guessing. To objectively appraise local demand, a territory-wide major trauma outcome study should be conducted in Hong Kong.
