AB  - Abstract Non Violent Resistance (NVR) aims to change family relationships, when children and young people show violent, aggressive or self-destructive behaviour. Trauma in multi-stressed families necessitates an adaptation of the original NVR approach in order to meet these clients' specific therapeutic needs when child violence arises. The author has developed such an adaptation. This article gives an overview of the larger system aspect of the adapted NVR model, illustrating how NVR core principles are applied to help family members develop a sense of safety within the larger system, so the nuclear family itself can become a safe and supportive recovery environment. Practitioner points By differentiating between interaction patterns, parents identify safe supporters within the larger system to help develop effective responses to harmful child behaviour Therapeutic conversation centres parents? own formulation of their support needs, in order to regain their voice and experience personal agency Effective resistance to problem behaviour grows by engaging other adults in ways that facilitate parents? access to internal and interpersonal resources

PY  - 1992
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but well recognized clinical entity which most often occurs on the trunk, perineum or legs following surgery or trauma. The condition is much less common in the head and neck and it is particularly uncommon in the midface/periorbital region. In almost all the cases occurring in the neck the condition follows obvious dental or oropharyngeal sepsis and in all the cases of the scalp there is a history of previous surgery or trauma. However, necrotizing fasciitis of the midface/periorbital region may lack any obvious traumatic aetiology or may follow relatively minor trauma. The diagnosis in these cases may not be suspected and treatment may be delayed with fatal consequences. Treatment by wide excision of all affected skin can lead to disastrous cosmetic consequences in facial disease and it is suggested that disease control can be achieved by raising wide based skin flaps with excision of the underlying necrotic tissue. The flaps are then returned onto normal muscle with much improved cosmetic results. This paper discusses the diagnosis and treatment of patients with necrotizing fasciitis of the face which has arisen without significant trauma.

AB  - Abstract Definitions of multi-impulsivity and sample characteristics between studies of impulsivity vary widely leading to inconsistent results. Outcome data was examined to assess the comparative response of multi-impulsive and non multi-impulsive bulimic patients to a supervised self-help CBT programme. Multi-impulsivity was defined as the presence of two or more impulsive behaviours in the last 2 months in addition to bulimia nervosa as reported with the Multi-Impulsivity Scale. Multi-impulsive patients reported similar levels of bulimic behaviours but higher levels of depression at pre-treatment. They achieved similar levels of change by the end of treatment. However, despite improvements, their levels of depressive symptoms remain high and bulimic symptoms subclinical and may be at higher risk of relapse.

AB  - Summary Almost half of the nail pathology is due to onychomycosis, but as the nail has a limited repertoire of clinical expressions, many nail conditions may mimic onychomycosis. Its differential diagnosis should be known in order to avoid useless or even potentially toxic treatments. Clinical features of the most common type of onychomycosis, namely distal subungual lateral onychomycosis (DSLO), are subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and yellowish discoloration of the nail plate. In psoriasis involving the distal matrix, the incorporation of parakeratotic cells in the nail plate may result in leukonychia, which should be distinguished from superficial white onychomycosis (SWO). In some special features of proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), the nail exhibits one or several white transverse lines. Total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO) is a long-standing condition where the nail was contaminated and became progressively dystrophic. Clinical examination and a thorough history of patients are usually sufficient for establishing the right diagnosis.

AB  - Summary This chapter considers the various injuries that occur to the hard and soft intraoral tissues and the options that are available to treat those injuries on an immediate, midterm, and long-term basis. It discusses the equipment needed to develop a pitch-side emergency dental kit, for any dentist or associated professional who may be able to give immediate relief and treatment to an injured athlete. Trauma to the supporting structures of the teeth can be classified as: concussion, lateral luxation, subluxation, intrusion, extrusion, and avulsion. The chapter outlines the types of root fracture commonly seen, looks at the response of the tissues to root fractures, and discusses the treatment options following a root fracture. It deals with the splinting techniques that provide support for traumatized teeth during the initial healing phase. Prolonged use of a splint can result in ankylosis of the tooth, which may be transient unless the injury to the cementum is extensive.

AB  - Abstract Individuals with a history of trauma, particularly maltreatment, often have accurate memories for trauma-related events. This does not mean that trauma never adversely affects autobiographical memory performance; indeed, some individuals with a trauma history reveal deficits in their memory performance while others at times show memory advantages over individuals without a trauma history. We posit here that individual differences in memory may be related in part to the emotion dysregulation and psychopathology resulting from the trauma and in part to the nature of the event to be recalled. In this chapter, we focus on the scientific literature on child maltreatment, trauma-related psychopathology, and memory from a developmental psychopathology perspective. We summarize relevant theory and research on memory development, trauma-related psychopathology symptoms, and psychophysiological and neuroscience processes relevant to child maltreatment. We also review behavioral studies on childhood trauma and autobiographical memory development. We discuss the translation of such research into clinical and legal practice. We conclude with future directions for research, with the hope of moving this crucial area of study forward to spawn new insights.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine, within the first-year post?head and neck cancer (HNC) diagnosis, the contribution of past and upon HNC psychiatric diagnoses (ie, substance use disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder) to the extent (ie, cumulated dose) of opioid prescription. Methods Prospective longitudinal study of 223 consecutive adults (on 313 approached; 72% participation) newly diagnosed (<2 weeks) with a first occurrence of primary HNC, including Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV disorders, validated psychometric measures, and medical chart reviews. Opioid doses were translated into standardized morphine milligram equivalents (MME) using CDC guidelines. A model of variables was tested using multiple linear regression. Results Fifty-five percent (123/223) of patients received opioids at some point during the first 12 months post?HNC diagnosis, 37.7% (84/223) upon HNC diagnosis (pre-treatment), 40.8% (91/223) during treatments, and 31.4% (70/223) post-treatment. The multiple linear regression indicated that an AD (P = 0.04) upon HNC diagnosis in early stage contributes to cumulated MME dose in the first year post?HNC diagnosis. Conclusion This study underlines how anxiety has important repercussions on the management of pain and illustrates the importance of screening for AD upon HNC diagnosis to allow for early prophylactic treatment and support.

AB  - Background: Most studies on trauma and trauma systems have been conducted in the United States. We aimed to describe the factors predicting mortality in European trauma patients, with focus on triage. Methods: We prospectively registered all trauma patients in Eastern Denmark over 12 consecutive months. We analysed the flow of trauma patients through the system, the time spent at different locations, and we assessed the risk factors of mortality. Results: We included 2875 trauma patients, of whom 158 (5.5%) died before arrival at the hospital. Most patients (75.3%) were brought to local hospitals and patients primarily (n=82) or secondarily triaged (n=203) to the level I trauma centre were the most severely injured. Secondarily transferred patients spent a median of 150?min in the local hospital before transfer to the level I trauma centre and 48?min on transportation. Severe injury with an injury severity score >15 was seen in 345 patients, of whom 118 stayed at the local hospital. They had a significantly higher mortality than 116 of those secondarily transferred [45/118, 38.1% vs. 11/116, 9.7% (P<0.0001)]. Mortality within 30 days was 4.3% in admitted patients, and significant risk factors of death were violence [odds ratio (OR)=5.72], unconsciousness (OR=4.87), hypotension (OR=4.96), injury severity score >15 (OR=27.42), and age. Conclusions: Around 50% of all trauma deaths occurred at the scene. Increased survival of severely injured patients may be achieved by early transfer to highly specialised care.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives.? The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the circulation is approximately 10- to 50- fold higher than B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). We sought to compare the accuracy of midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) measured with a novel sandwich immunoassay with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) in the diagnosis of heart failure. Design.? The diagnosis of heart failure was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists using all available clinical data (including BNP levels) in 287 consecutive patients presenting with dyspnoea to the emergency department (ED). MRproANP and NTproBNP levels were determined at presentation in a blinded fashion. Results.? Heart failure was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 154 patients (54%). Median MRproANP was significantly higher in patients with heart failure as compared to patients with other causes of dyspnoea (400 vs. 92?pmol?L?1, P?<?0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of MRproANP was very high with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 and was comparable with that of NTproBNP (0.92, P?=?0.791). Moreover, MRproANP provided incremental diagnostic information to BNP and NTproBNP in patients presenting with BNP levels in the grey zone between 100 and 500?pg?mL?1. Conclusion.? Midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide is as accurate in the diagnosis of heart failure as NTproBNP. MRproANP seems to provide incremental information on top of BNP or NT-proBNP in some subgroups and should be further investigated in other studies.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the correlation between dental injuries and the pattern of maxillofacial fractures. The correlation with age, gender, trauma mechanism and type of maxillofacial fracture was also investigated. Materials and methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 1131 patients with facial fractures were registered. Of these, 473 presented with associated dental trauma. The information and data collected and analyzed included: age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of facial fracture, type of dental injury, and the relationship between dental injury and facial fracture. Results Dental injury was sustained by 473 patients (41.8%), with a total of 2215 injured teeth. Of the 2215 injured teeth, 1191 (53.8%) were in the maxilla and 1024 (46.2%) in the mandible. Fall from a height had the highest risk of dental injuries (OR = 4.145, P = 0.002). The central incisor was the most injured tooth for both the maxilla (388, 36.2%) and mandible (284, 27.7%). The most common type of dental injury was avulsion (1070, 47.4%). More anterior teeth in the maxilla were of crown fracture, avulsion, and intrusion than that in the mandible, whereas more anterior teeth in the mandible were of subluxation and concussion than that in the maxilla. Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (OR = 2.817, P < 0.001), only 0.236-fold risk in patients who sustained only mandible angle fracture (P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence of dental trauma is significantly related to the pattern and position of the maxillofacial fractures.

AB  - Summary Teeth have two regions where trauma can cause irreparable damage: the dental pulp and periodontium. The classification of the injury type, and signs and symptoms may not fully indicate the true extent of the injury, which may be multi-factorial. Exposure or near exposure of the pulp in the mouth and damage to the neurovascular bundle can result in one of several different outcomes for the dental pulp. The rate of pulp necrosis with a number of different injuries varies with age and the stage of tooth development. Endodontic treatment would only be commenced if there were signs and symptoms of an endodontic infection. A thorough history and examination are necessary to not only reveal the full extent of injuries to the teeth and jaws, but also to exclude more serious injuries, such as concussion and neck injuries, which may need urgent medical care.

AB  - Summary The important role of molar teeth in the dentition mainly consists in their contribution to mastication, because they carry a considerable part of the occlusal load. This chapter reveals how the posterior position of molars makes them less accessible for cleaning, whether it may be self-performed or carried out by a dental professional. This fact, combined with the unique anatomy of molars, poses a challenge for all dentists focusing on molar retention. The evolution of more than one root sets molars apart from the rest of the dentition: in multi-rooted teeth the enamel organ expands with projections of Hertwig's root sheath. Aetiological factors interact with the anatomical factors and may lead to periodontal destruction and attachment loss in molars, and thus result in a furcation defect. It can be concluded that special care needs to be taken when placing restorations, and overhangs need to be diagnosed and removed as early as possible.

AB  - In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients suffering from the psychological effects of trauma. This paper outlines various theoretical models of psychological trauma, selected because they can specifically encompass both the external aetiology (i.e. the traumatic event) and also explain (to a greater or lesser extent) the enormous range of reactions to that event. These models are critically discussed in terms of their implications for counselling practice, and as guides to further research. Examples are given of ways in which the author has drawn on different theoretical frameworks to inform her own therapeutic practice in work with people experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Abstract??? Maxillofacial and dental injuries are not uncommon. These injuries may cause morbidity and demand meticulously planned treatment. Part 1 of this study focused on the incidence of general trauma injuries, as well as facial or dental trauma. The aim of part 2 is to evaluate the severity and location of the dento-alveolar and maxillofacial injuries over 5?years. A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on data from the Israel National Trauma Registry. Patients admitted and hospitalized due to trauma injuries during the years 2000?2004, totaled 111?010 in which 5886 (5.3%) were maxillofacial or dental injuries. Most of these injuries were traffic-related (54.5%), followed by events at home (18.7%). Facial injuries combined with injuries to other organs involved occurred in 3721 (63.2%) of the patients. Most minor injuries were noted when no other organs were involved, while severe injuries were more common when multiple organs were involved. More than 25% of facial injuries required surgery. Meticulous epidemiologic studies are needed to support the leading role, extent, and severity of maxillofacial trauma.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Healthcare professionals who provide services in the immediate or long-term aftermath of traumatic events need to understand the nature and frequency of traumatic events in the lives of women. However, research on trauma exposure in women has only recently begun to assess events other than intimate partner and sexual violence and has not supported direct statistical comparison of cross-national and cross-cultural data. The purpose of this descriptive, correlational study was to describe and compare trauma exposure prevalence and type in community-based samples of women in the United States, Colombia, and Hong Kong. Design Women were recruited through posted notices at community health sites, snowball sampling, and online advertisements (N = 576). The Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (total score range 0 to 30) was used to determine the type and prevalence of trauma exposure. Data were collected by native language members of the research team. Methods Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and trauma exposure for the total sample and each community-based sample (location). Between-location differences were tested using Fisher's exact tests for categorical measures and general linear models with pairwise a posteriori least squares t-test for continuous measures. Responses to open-ended questions were translated and categorized. Findings Over 99% of women in the total sample reported at least one traumatic life event. The mean number of traumatic life events per participant was 7, ranging from 0 to 24. Although there was consistency in the most commonly reported trauma exposures across locations, the rates of specific events often differed. Conclusions Historical, political, geographic, and cultural factors may explain differences in trauma exposure among women in the four locations studied. Clinical Relevance This study offers relevant knowledge for providers in diverse locations who provide services to women who have experienced traumatic events and provides evidence for the need for future research to further enhance knowledge of trauma exposure among women, and on the effects of trauma in women's lives.

AB  - Abstract In current clinical practice, a differential diagnosis of severe localized periodontal lesions is rarely made; such lesions are considered to be manifestations of periodontitis caused by specific microbes from the commensal oral flora. However, deep seated lesions of the periodontium which are in communication with the alveolar crest, are well documented periodontal consequences of pulpal pathoses and can mimic the signs and symptoms of ?periodontitis?. The very low incidence of tooth-threatening periodontal disease in ancient and modern man is revealed when differential diagnoses are used in the examination of alveolar defects in anthropological materials and when epidemiological studies use more appropriate indices. However, no periodontal index to date has incorporated a differential diagnosis between gingival and pulpal causes of alveolar bone loss. The gingival and periodontal signs of severe localized periodontal lesions are reviewed and the imprecise nature of current clinical diagnostic tests (radiography, ?pulp testing?, darkfield microscopy, bleeding on probing, periodontal probing) is discussed. None of these tests is able to detect disease activity and cannot be used to predict future patterns of disease behaviour. However, the commonly held belief that the tests are accurate has resulted in most severe periodontal lesions being falsely labelled as periodontitis. Failure to carry out differential diagnosis of severe periodontal lesions has resulted in the instigation of periodontal therapy for many lesions of non-gingival origin. Whenever severe localized lesions of the periodontium are detected, the differential diagnosis between pulpal and periodontal origins should be made. The results of diagnostic tests in current use should be interpreted with extreme caution; clinicians are left to exercise their judgment based on consideration of all the available evidence.

AB  - Abstract Background Complex regional pain syndrome is a painful and disabling post-traumatic primary pain disorder. Acute and chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) are major clinical challenges. In Europe, progress is hampered by significant heterogeneity in clinical practice. We sought to establish standards for the diagnosis and management of CRPS. Methods The European Pain Federation established a pan-European task force of experts in CRPS who followed a four-stage consensus challenge process to produce mandatory quality standards worded as grammatically imperative (must-do) statements. Results We developed 17 standards in 8 areas of care. There are 2 standards in diagnosis, 1 in multidisciplinary care, 1 in assessment, 3 for care pathways, 1 in information and education, 4 in pain management, 3 in physical rehabilitation and 2 on distress management. The standards are presented and summarized, and their generation and consequences were discussed. Also presented are domains of practice for which no agreement on a standard could be reached. Areas of research needed to improve the validity and uptake of these standards are discussed. Conclusion The European Pain Federation task force present 17 standards of the diagnosis and management of CRPS for use in Europe. These are considered achievable for most countries and aspirational for a minority of countries depending on their healthcare resource and structures. Significance This position statement summarizes expert opinion on acceptable standards for CRPS care in Europe.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.
