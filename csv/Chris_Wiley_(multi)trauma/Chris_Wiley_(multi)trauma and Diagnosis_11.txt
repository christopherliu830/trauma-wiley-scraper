AB  - Objective:? Little is known about the relationship of assaultive trauma to clinical and functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder. Method:? We assessed trauma histories in a cohort of 109 first-admission bipolar patients with psychosis using structured interviews and medical records. Assaultive trauma included rape, physical attacks, and physical threats. Outcome was assessed using standardized ratings. Results:? Forty percent reported a history of assaultive trauma, mostly in childhood (≤16?years). Exposed patients were more symptomatic at each follow-up than unexposed. Sixteen percent of exposed patients remitted after one episode compared with 38.5% of the non-exposed. Patients exposed as adults were the most symptomatic at 6?months, while patients exposed in childhood were the most symptomatic at 24?months. Conclusion:? Our findings supported the salient role of trauma history as a risk factor for poor course in severe bipolar disorder. Given the high prevalence of such exposure, clinical awareness in first-admission psychotic bipolar patients is critical.

AB  - Summary Interpretation of cervical radiographs can be challenging due to the complex anatomy and superimposition of osseous structures on either side of the vertebrae. This report describes the investigation of neck pain in a Thoroughbred gelding following a traumatic fall. Several imaging modalities were used to demonstrate the presence of a fracture of the left cranial articular process of the fourth cervical vertebra (C4), including nuclear scintigraphy, ultrasonography, oblique radiographic projections and a novel cineradiographic technique. Oblique radiographs were superior to standard lateral-lateral radiographs in both the diagnosis and for monitoring the progression of healing of the articular process fracture in this case.

AB  - ABSTRACT ? The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is purely a clinical diagnosis. The most common types of diagnostic error are a failure either to recognize the early, or unusual symptoms, or to differentiate other tremors and extrapyramidal syndromes from Parkinson's disease. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is increasing. This has resulted from the reduction of the excess mortality by levodopa treatment. In the near future, there will be more older parkinsonian patients with a more prolonged duration of the disease.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to compare the value of high-resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of nasal fractures. Methods. Facial CT and HRUS examinations performed on 140 consecutive patients (103 male and 37 female; age range, 2?74 years; mean, 26 years) with nasal trauma between October 2004 and April 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. Sonograms were obtained with a hockey stick probe (15?7 MHz linear array transducer). All patients also underwent facial CT and conventional radiography. The nasal fracture detection rates for HRUS, CT, and conventional radiography were compared with the clinical and surgical diagnosis. Nasal fractures were classified into high- and low-grade groups according to severity. They were also compared with the CT findings of all 280 lateral nasal bones and with HRUS findings as the reference standard. Results. The accuracy rates for HRUS, CT, and conventional radiography in detecting nasal fractures were 100%, 92.1%, and 78.6%, respectively. Compared with HRUS, CT revealed only 196 of 233 lateral nasal bone fractures; its accuracy was 80%. In high-grade fractures, the accuracy of CT was 87%, but it decreased to 68% in low-grade fractures. Conclusions. Compared with HRUS, CT had lower accuracy, especially in low-grade nasal fractures. Thus, HRUS is a reliable diagnostic tool for the evaluation of nasal fractures.

AB  - Objectives To analyse the contemporary management of renal injuries in a UK major trauma centre and to evaluate the utility and value of re-imaging. Patients and methods The prospectively maintained ?Trauma Audit and Research Network? database was interrogated to identify patients with urinary tract injuries between January 2014 and December 2017. Patients? records and imaging were reviewed to identify injury grades, interventions, outcomes, and follow-up. Results Renal injury was identified in 90 patients (79 males and 11 females). The mean (sd; range) age was 35.5 (17.4; 1.5?94) years. Most of the renal traumas were caused by blunt mechanisms (74%). The overall severity of injuries was: 18 (20%) Grade I, 19 (21%) Grade II, 27 (30%) Grade III, 22 (24%) Grade IV, and four (4%) Grade V. Most patients (84%) were managed conservatively. Early intervention (<24 h) was performed in 14 patients (16%) for renal injuries. Most of these patients were managed by interventional radiology techniques (nine of 14). Only two patients required an emergency nephrectomy, both of whom died from extensive polytrauma. In all, 19 patients underwent laparotomy for other injuries and did not require renal exploration. The overall 30-day mortality was 13%. Re-imaging was performed in 66% of patients at an average time of 3.4 days from initial scan. The majority of re-imaging was planned (49 patients) and 12% of these scans demonstrated a relevant finding (urinoma, pseudoaneurysm) that altered management in three of the 49 patients (6.1%). Conclusion Non-operative management is the mainstay for all grades of injury. Haemodynamic instability and persistent urine leak are primary indications for intervention. Open surgical management is uncommon. Repeat imaging after injury is advocated for stable patients with high-grade renal injuries (Grade III?V), although more research is needed to determine the optimal timing.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purposes of this study were to investigate the occurrence and patterns of dental trauma in patients with single mandibular fracture and to evaluate the relationships between dental injury and fracture site of mandible. Materials and Methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 869 patients with mandibular fractures were registered. Only the patients with single mandibular fracture were included. The information and data collected included age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of mandibular fracture, and type of dental injury. Results Single mandibular fractures were sustained in 294 (33.8%) patients. Of these, 43.5% (128 patients) presented with associated dental injuries (509 injured teeth). The patients' male/female ratio was 2.46:1 (91 males and 37 females). Patients in 30?39 year age group possessed the highest risk of suffering dental trauma (odds ratio = 2.004, P = 0.014). Road traffic accidents were the most common mechanism of injury (54, 42.2%). Lower-anterior teeth were more often injured in patients with symphysis fracture (P < 0.001), and patients with condylar fracture more frequently sustained upper-posterior teeth injury (P < 0.001). Lower-posterior teeth injury was mostly found in patients with mandibular body fracture (P < 0.001) or angle fracture (P < 0.001). Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (odds ratio = 3.283, P < 0.001), and the risk was only 0.193-fold in patients who sustained only mandible angle fractures (odds ratio = 0.193, P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence and type of dental injury were significantly related to the fracture site of mandible.

AB  - Abstract:? Impaired declarative memory performance and smaller hippocampal volume have been observed in young and middle-aged adults with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These alterations may put trauma survivors with PTSD at greater risk for cognitive decline in later life. This article focuses on the emerging literature on neuropsychological impairment in aging trauma survivors, in particular, elderly combat veterans and survivors of the Holocaust. In veterans and in Holocaust survivors, PTSD was associated with substantial impairments in learning, free and cued recall, and recognition memory compared to the respective nonexposed subjects; however, in neither group was PTSD associated with impaired retention or ?rapid forgetting.? Additionally, PTSD was not associated with smaller right or left hippocampal volume in either cohort. PTSD is associated with considerable cognitive burden with age. Longitudinal studies of older subjects are warranted to examine whether PTSD is associated with accelerated aging or progressive memory loss.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma is an irreversible pathology which after occurrence is characterized by life long debilitating effects. The objective of the study was to measure the prevalence of trauma in anterior permanent teeth among children and associations with independent variables. A total of 453 5th and 6th grade Arab Eastern Jerusalem schoolchildren participated. Trauma, incisal overjet and lip competence were measured by one examiner in the schools. Reasons and location of trauma were assessed by telephone interviews with the parents. The total prevalence of dental trauma was 33.8%. Severe trauma prevalence (involving dentine) was 12.6%. Severe trauma was more prevalent among boys (OR?=?2.03, P?=?0.026); children with lip incompetence (OR?=?2.71, P?=?0.001); and those with an overjet of 4mm or more (OR?=?3.73, P?<?0.001). The main reported causes for dental trauma were falling (29.1%), sports (16.4%), violence (20%) and playing (20%). According to the parents? reports, more fall-related injuries were reported at home, more sport injuries at school, more ?playing? injuries ?outside? (P?<?0.001). Combination of results with a previous study among Jewish schoolchildren demonstrated: severe dental trauma was related to overjet (OR?=?1.73, P?=?0.002), lip incompetence (OR?=?2.19, P?<?0.001), gender (OR for males?=?1.54, P?=?0.005), but not to ethnicity (Arab or Jewish). The reasons for trauma observed in this study were potentially preventable. A community effort should therefore be pursued, with the aim of educating sports teachers, teachers, health personnel and schoolchildren regarding awareness of dental trauma prevention, with emphasis on utilizing mouthguards and early orthodontic intervention, when financially possible.

AB  - Abstract Counselling the parents following a diagnosis of fetal congenital heart disease (CHD) is as important a task for the fetal cardiologist, as the skill involved in achieving an accurate diagnosis. The counsellor will base prognosis not only on the diagnosis itself but also on the security of diagnosis, the stage in gestation and potential for change, the association with extracardiac malformations and the known results of treatment. Depending on the gestational age and legal situation the counsellor is operating in, termination of pregnancy may be one of the options to consider and one that should always be raised in discussion. Thus, the parents may be in the position of making a crucial decision concerning the management of the pregnancy on the basis of the information received, so it is vital that the counsellor is truly able to communicate with them, whatever be their level of understanding.

AB  - Abstract Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is defined as a diagnosis made by a radiologist who takes into account the output of a computerized analysis of a medical image. There are in general two different types of CAD schemes: one to locate suspicious regions in the image, computer-aided detection (CADe) and another to classify a suspicious region into one of two or more classes, computer-aided diagnosis (CADx). The goal of CAD is to improve the performance of radiologists, to reduce variation within and between radiologists, and to make radiologists more efficient. This article describes motivation for developing CAD, the basic principles, current issues in CAD research, and future areas for development.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test whether postnatal psychological distress in parents of babies with congenital malformations is reduced by prenatal diagnosis. Methods A prospective observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted at two Norwegian hospitals. We included 293 parents of babies with congenital malformations (prenatal detection rate: 36.5%) referred for neonatal surgery and 249 parents of healthy babies (comparison group). Parental psychological responses were assessed on three postnatal occasions by psychometric instruments (GHQ-28, STAI-X1, and IES). Results Significantly increased psychological distress (GHQ-28) was reported by parents who received prenatal diagnosis as compared to postnatal diagnosis; acutely 28.9 versus 24.4, P = 0.006 (comparison group: 19.6); at 6 weeks 26.8 versus 21.5, P < 0.001 (comparison group: 17.7); and at 6 months 22.6 versus 18.7, P = 0.015 (comparison group: 16.6). Mothers consistently reported higher levels of distress than fathers. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that prenatal diagnosis and being a mother significantly predicted severity of acute psychological distress. At 6 weeks and 6 months, mortality and associated anomalies were significant independent predictors of psychological distress. Conclusion Controlling for other covariates, we found that prenatal diagnosis of congenital malformations was a significant independent predictor of acute parental psychological distress after birth.

AB  - Abstract:? Until the late 1960s, splenectomy was routinely performed in children who had sustained blunt splenic injury. There was based on the ability to perform splenectomy without obvious consequence; the cited 90?100% mortality for splenic trauma and the possibility of delayed rupture of the spleen. In contrast, contemporary findings in immunology and surgery demonstrated that non-operative management was not only feasible but desirable in view of the potential for overwhelming post-plenectomy infection. The history of universal splenectomy following blunt splenic trauma has been reviewed and we outline the findings that have resulted in the current standard of non-operative management following blunt splenic trauma.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - Although uncommon, and despite the modern in diagnostic tools and therapeutic alternatives, retrohepatic and main hepatic veins injury remains associated with high mortality rate. Preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, and bullet trajectory may be a helpful sign in penetrating trauma patients. Patients and Methods? Hospital records of patients sustaining retroheptic vena cava (RHVC) injury were retrospectively reviewed as to diagnosis, associated injuries, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcome, last ten years. Results? Eight male, 17 to 45 (mean 27.5) years-old patients sustaining RHVC injury were reviewed. Mean trauma indexes for the 8 cases were: ISS 36.6, RTS 7.55 and TRISS 89.0; and for the group who died: ISS 41.6, RTS 7.18, and TRISS 80.5. Two patients had sustained blunt trauma (one died), and six had penetrating injuries (two died). The injury diagnosis was achieved during surgery in all cases. A transfixing RHV injury occurred in 4 (50% of the) patients, and was found in all the 3 patients who died. An atriocaval shunt was employed in four patients, 3 of them had with transfixing injury with two deaths. The number of associated injuries was higher in the patients who died. Overall mortality rate was 37.5%. Comments? Despite advances in image diagnosis, injuries to RHVC are frequently diagnosed during surgery. Tangential injuries were managed with direct approach and sutures, and to control blending in transfixing injuries, were managed with atriocaval shunts, before suture. Conclusion? Despite improvements in its diagnosis and management, RHVC injuries remain with a high mortality rate, mainly when transfixing, and associated with numerous associated injuries.

Roughly half (53%) said they had never forgotten the traumatic events. Two smaller groups described a mixture of continuous and delayed recall (17%) or a period of complete amnesia followed by delayed recall (16%). Patients with and without delayed recall did not differ significantly in the proportions reporting corroboration of their memories from other sources. Idiosyncratic, trauma-specific reminders and recent life crises were most commonly cited as precipitants to delayed recall. A previous psychotherapy was cited as a factor in a minority (28%) of cases. By contrast, intrusion of new memories after a period of amnesia was frequently cited as a factor leading to the decision to seek psychotherapy. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the role of psychotherapy in the process of recovering traumatic memories.

AB  - Malnutrition is common among hospitalized patients in the United States, and its coded prevalence is increasing. Malnutrition is known to be associated with increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Although national data indicate that the number of malnutrition diagnoses among hospital discharges has been steadily rising, an in-depth examination of the demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients has not been conducted. We examined data from the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), the most recent nationally-representative data describing U.S. hospital discharges. Using ICD-9 codes, we constructed a composite variable indicating a diagnosis of malnutrition. Based on our definition, 3.2% of all U.S. hospital discharges in 2010 had this diagnosis. Relative to patients without a malnutrition diagnosis, those with the diagnosis were older, had longer lengths of stay and incurred higher costs. These patients were more likely to have 27 of 29 comorbidities assessed in HCUP. Finally, discharge to home care was twice as common among malnourished patients, and a discharge of death was more than 5 times as common among patients with a malnutrition diagnosis. Taken together, these nationally representative, cross-sectional data indicate that hospitalized patients discharged with a diagnosis of malnutrition are older and sicker and their inpatient care is more expensive than their counterparts without this diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.
