AB  - Traumatic injury and its sequelae remain a major, unrecognized public health problem in North America. Traumatic injury is the principal cause of death in patients aged 1-44 years and the overall leading cause of life-years lost in the United States. Recognizing this, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in conjunction with other federal agencies, organized a conference in June 2000 to discuss the basic and clinical research needs that could lead to improved outcomes following cardiopulmonary or post injury resuscitation. The Post Resuscitative and Initial Utility of Life Saving Efforts (PULSE) Workshop resulted and eight work groups were established to focus on various aspects, including organ systems, pharmacology, epidemiology, and trauma. The Trauma Work Group recommendations are presented in this article. Despite the recognition of improved survival and outcome through advancements in trauma systems and trauma care, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support ratio for trauma research is only 0.10, compared with 1.65 for cancer research and a remarkable 3.51 for AIDS and HIV infection research. The successful federal HIV research program has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality over the last ten years at a cost of $1.4 billion per year. A coordinated trauma research program should aim to replicate the success achieved by such programs; however, a centralized federal ?home? for trauma research does not exist. Consequently, the existing limited research support is derived from NIH institutes in addition to other federal and state agencies. This report serves to describe some of the obstacles and outline various strategies and priorities for basic science, clinical, and translational trauma resuscitation research.

AB  - Abstract Aims Functional asymmetry of pelvic floor innervation has been shown to exist in healthy subjects, and has been proposed to be a predictor of increased risk for fecal incontinence in case of trauma. However, this remains to be shown for different clinical conditions such as traumatic childbirth. Methods A conventional surface EMG system was used to assess the innervation of the external anal sphincter. A symmetry index was used to define the relative EMG amplitude asymmetry of the external anal sphincter between 0 (symmetric) and 1 (asymmetric). Three cohorts were studied: 40 nulliparous women in the third trimester (Study 1), 15 primiparous women within 6 months following vaginal delivery without clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (Study 2), and 50 women after childbirth-related third or fourth degree perineal tear 6?12 months postpartum (Study 3). Furthermore, all women underwent conventional anorectal manometry. Results Sixteen or forty nulliparous women reported signs of fecal incontinence; however, relative asymmetry was not correlated to symptom severity (P?=?0.345), and not to manometric measures (Study 1). In Study 2, Women who had suffered clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (P?=?0.07) tended to have a stronger association between incontinence and asymmetry. In Study 3, 19/50 women reported moderate to severe incontinence. Asymmetry and symptom severity were significantly correlated (P?<?0.001). Patients with incontinence had a significantly higher asymmetry score than their continent counterparts. Conclusion Functional asymmetry of anal sphincter innervation is significantly associated with incontinence symptoms, but only after childbirth-related sphincter injuries and therefore, should be regarded as an additional risk factor.

AB  - Abstract Objective Women veterans have a higher prevalence of chronic pain relative to men. One hypothesis is that differential combat and traumatic sexual experiences and attenuated levels of social support between men and women may differentially contribute to the development and perpetuation of pain. This investigation examined [1] gender differences in trauma, social support, and family conflict among veterans with chronic pain, and [2] whether trauma, social support, and family conflict were differentially associated with pain severity, pain interference, and depressive symptom severity as a function of gender. Methods Participants included 460 veterans (56% female) who served in support of recent conflicts, and who endorsed pain lasting 3 months or longer. Participants completed a baseline survey during participation in a longitudinal investigation. Self-report measures included pain severity, pain interference, depressive symptom severity, exposure to traumatic life events, emotional and tangible support, and family conflict. Results Relative to men, women veterans reporting chronic pain evidenced higher rates of childhood interpersonal trauma (51% vs 34%; P?<?0.001) and military sexual trauma (54% vs 3%; P?<?0.001), along with lower levels of combat exposure (10.00 vs 16.85, P?<?0.001). Gender was found to be a moderator of the association of marital status, combat exposure, childhood interpersonal trauma, and family conflict with pain interference. It also moderated family conflict in the prediction of depressive symptoms. Conclusions Results underscore the potential importance of developing and testing gender specific models of chronic pain that consider the relative roles of trauma, social support, and family conflict.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion of Immunological Origin (RSAI) is currently diagnosed by the occurrence of 2?3 consecutive miscarriages of unknown origin. The psychological trauma incurred by these events is a serious ailment which may be potentially avoided if a method of analysis is derived which may forecast these events and in turn prevent them from occurring. This review intends to examine studies of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) which use laboratory diagnosis and also studies of RSA that do not use laboratory diagnosis. We believe that when laboratory results are incorporated into the diagnosis of RSA/RSAI that treatment is highly successful whereas the absence of laboratory results severely hinders the effectiveness of treatment. It is worth noting that correlating treatment versus outcome is imprudent because of the multiple variables involved in patient cases. It is not imprudent, however, to say that incorporation of laboratory data is essential when diagnosing RSA/RSAI.

AB  - Abstract This article considers the ways in which the concept of volume is deployed to create and sustain surgical expertise. Drawing on research at a large plastic and orthopedic surgery hospital in Tamil Nadu, India, I explore the ways in which a steady supply of trauma is converted into medical expertise, reputation, and care. Volume functions as a key metric by which this conversion takes place. This hospital is particularly well known for its cutting-edge treatment of severe trauma, and, while some Indian hospitals have used their combination of low cost and high expertise to attract foreign patients for medical tourism, this hospital has converted its supply of trauma patients into surgical expertise that brings foreign surgeons there to learn. This article therefore also considers the role of visiting foreign doctors in this form of clinical tourism.

AB  - Summary Viscoelastic assays such as TEG? and ROTEM? are increasingly used to guide transfusion of blood products. The EXTEM assay maximum clot firmness (MCF) is a ROTEM measure available after 25?29 min used to guide early decisions. EXTEM A10, the clot firmness at 10 min, is an accepted early surrogate, but investigators differ on whether A5, the clot firmness at 5 min, is acceptable. We re-examined this in a retrospective observational analysis of 1146 trauma patients in one centre who had ROTEM data recorded. A5 and A10 both correlated well with maximum clot firmness, with Pearson coefficients of r = 0.92 and r = 0.96, respectively. The correlations of A5, A10 and maximum clot firmness with requirement for massive transfusion were all similarly high, with c-stats of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.90, respectively. The correlations with mortality were also similar but weaker, with c-stats of 0.67, 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. Using a previously validated cut-off of A5 < 35 mm to predict massive transfusion gave a sensitivity of 95%, specificity 83%, positive predictive value 9.3% and negative predictive value 100%. Using a value of A5 < 29 mm, for a pragmatic positive predictive value of 20%, gave a sensitivity of 67%, specificity 95% and negative predictive value 99%. Whether aiming for a high sensitivity or a strong predictive value, A5 was non-inferior to A10 and actually missed fewer cases needing massive transfusion. A5 has similar utility to both A10 and maximum clot firmness as an early measure of clot firmness, and a low A5 value is strongly predictive of the need for massive transfusion.

Due to the poor goodness of fit of the two-factor model and the post hoc EFA resulting in a one-factor model, our data do not support the findings of Aparicio et al. (2013). Further, the findings suggest the VTS is an acceptable measure of vicarious trauma, as demonstrated by the high internal consistency and the single-factor loading.

This case report describes a gelding that presented for weight loss, increased respiratory rate and effort and chronic intermittent epistaxis. During post mortem examination diffuse eosinophilic granulomatous lesions were identified in the lung and liver, leading to a diagnosis of MEED. Veno-occlusive pulmonary remodelling was also discovered, believed to be the cause of the chronic epistaxis and a result of the pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic granulomas.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims:? There is a paucity of literature regarding the clinical profile of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in children. The aims of this retrospective study were to determine the etiology and clinical presentation, and to present our experience in diagnosing CP in children in China. Methods:? Clinical data of children who were treated for CP at Changhai Hospital from January 1997 to August 2006 were reviewed. Results:? A total of 427 CP patients presented to our center. There were 42 (9.8%) children with CP, including 21 males and 21 females, with a mean age of 11.7?years at the first onset. The main etiological factor was idiopathic (73.8%). Of the patients, 78.5% had episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain and 54.8% had multiple (≥?4) episodes. The mean duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis was 41.6?months and a definite diagnosis was not made until 2?years later in 57.1% of these patients. The positive rates of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for detecting ductal changes and intraductal stones or pancreatic calcification were 51.4% and 45.4%, 71.4% and 87.5%, 80.0% and 61.5%, respectively. Conclusion:? The main etiological factor of Chinese children with CP is idiopathic. The main symptom in these patients is multiple episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain, which often lead to a delay in the definite diagnosis. CT and MRCP (or MRI) should be used as the first investigation in the evaluation of these cases.

AB  - Abstract Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is one of the main inherited coagulation disorders. It is caused by a deficiency and/or a dysfunction of the von Willebrand factor (VWF), a fundamental multimeric glycoprotein involved in the hemostasis process. Correct detection of the disease is not an easy task because the disease manifests itself in many variants and a high intra-subject variability is observed. For these reasons, the diagnostic clinical trials typically rely on a 24-h sampling protocol, which makes the overall test long, stressful, and costly. Using a new pharmacokinetic model derived from Galvanin et al.'s 2014 study, this study aims at i) assessing the theoretical possibility to perform a shorter clinical test and ii) proposing a set of model-based diagnostic methods as a support for the clinical team. A preliminary information analysis is performed in order to understand which sampling instants are more informative for model identification. This allowed us to propose a novel, 8-h diagnostic protocol, which is still able to ensure model identifiability. Three alternative diagnostic methods are then proposed based on this short-length clinical protocol. One of them directly uses the pharmacokinetic model, whereas the other two are based on the use of three indices (two pharmacokinetic indices, namely clearance, total VWF released, and as third index the basal multimer ratio) to formulate the diagnosis problem as a classification one. The classification problem is then solved using K-nearest neighbours and linear discriminant analysis. Results show the theoretical feasibility of a VWD diagnosis based on a shorter protocol.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - Abstract Mycotic keratitis (an infection of the cornea) is an important ocular infection, especially in young male outdoor workers. There are two frequent presentations: keratitis due to filamentous fungi (Fusarium, Aspergillus, phaeohyphomycetes and Scedosporium apiospermum are frequent causes) and keratitis due to yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans and other Candida species). In the former, trauma is usually the sole predisposing factor, although previous use of corticosteroids and contact lens wear are gaining importance as risk factors; in the latter, there is usually some systemic or local (ocular) defect. The clinical presentation and clinical features may suggest a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis; increasingly, in vivo (non-invasive) imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography) are also being used for diagnosis. However, microbiological investigations, particularly direct microscopic examination and culture of corneal scrape or biopsy material, still form the cornerstone of diagnosis. In recent years, the PCR has gained prominence as a diagnostic aid for mycotic keratitis, being used to complement microbiological methods; more importantly, this molecular method permits rapid specific identification of the aetiological agent. Although various antifungal compounds have been used for therapy, management of this condition (particularly if deep lesions occur) continues to be problematic; topical natamycin and, increasingly, voriconazole (given by various routes) are key therapeutic agents. Therapeutic surgery, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, is needed when medical therapy fails. Increased awareness of the importance of this condition is likely to spur future research initiatives.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims:? Hepatitis?C virus (HCV) diagnosis causes significant psychological stress and anxiety. We thought it would be important to illustrate the anxiety caused by HCV diagnosis in patients from the developing world. Methods:? This study was conducted at the Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, between February 2004 and April 2004. All patients who were recently diagnosed with HCV (those who tested positive to anti-HCV and HCV polymerase chain reaction) were given a questionnaire that compared stress due to HCV infection with four other variables, including death of a close family member, divorce, loss of source of income and move to another city. We also analyzed the anxiety level among these patients using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results:? We studied 98 patients and 100 healthy controls. Thirty-one (31.63%) patients who were diagnosed with HCV presented only with fatigue. Sixty-three (64.28%) patients admitted that diagnosis of HCV interfered with their daily life in some way. Among the newly diagnosed cases, 48 (48.97%) patients had moderate to severe anxiety (BAI Class B and C). Multi-logistic regression analysis showed that anxiety was related to HCV-related stress (P?<?0.002) and self-perceived severity of disease (P?<?0.001). HCV diagnosis was significantly more stressful than divorce (59.87 vs 70.95; P?<?0.013), loss of source of income (50.52 vs 70.80; P?<?0.001), and a move to another city (28.32 vs 70.80; P?<?0.001). Conclusions:? Diagnosis with HCV is reported to be more stressful than divorce, loss of source of income and a move to another city.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often referred to as the great masquerader, and remains a diagnostic challenge in daily practice due to its mostly unspecific clinical presentation. Diagnostic algorithms are needed to assist clinical assessment and optimise the use of investigations, especially under emergency conditions. Nuclear medicine ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy has long been the imaging mainstay for the diagnosis of PE. Venous thromboembolism is not directly visualised but, rather, its effects on perfusion and ventilation. This necessitates the need for probability criteria, categorised as high, intermediate, low or very low probability, and normal. Spiral computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) emerged in the 1990s as a new diagnostic technique. CTPA has become the gold standard for the radiological assessment of a clinically suspected PE in daily practice. Special attention should be given to the clinical impact of incidental and subsegmental emboli.

AB  - This report describes the epidemiology of pedestrian injury in four inner metropolitan local government areas of Sydney. These data were obtained from the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales. The spectrum of injury and clinical outcome was defined in patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 admitted from the study area, during a 1 year period, to the four inner metropolitan teaching hospitals. The incidence of pedestrian death was 3.3 times the state average of 32/106/year. An average of 235 pedestrians, injured in the study area, were hospitalized each year during the period 1987?89. On average 24 pedestrians died each year, seven at the scene and 17 in hospital. Fifty patients (ISS > 15) were admitted to the four teaching hospitals during a 1 year period 1990?91. Forty-five were adults and five children. Multiplicity of injury was seen in 68% of patients. The pelvis and lower extremities were involved in 70%, the head in 66% and chest in 42%. The hospital mortality rate was 30% with five patients dying on the first day from blood loss and nine dying during subsequent days from head injury. This study has important implications for trauma service development. Successful clinical management of the severely injured pedestrian requires close co-operation between pre-hospital and hospital care providers. An integrated hospital trauma team response is mandatory to ensure appropriate management of what is often a shocked, hypoxic. head-injured patient.

AB  - Background Practice guidelines for childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) recommend trauma-focused psychotherapies, mainly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a brief trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment for PTSD in adults, but with few well-designed trials involving children and adolescents. Methods We conducted a single-blind, randomized trial with three arms (n = 103): EMDR (n = 43), Cognitive Behavior Writing Therapy (CBWT; n = 42), and wait-list (WL; n = 18). WL participants were randomly reallocated to CBWT or EMDR after 6 weeks; follow-ups were conducted at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. Participants were treatment-seeking youth (aged 8?18 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD (or subthreshold PTSD) tied to a single trauma, who received up to six sessions of EMDR or CBWT lasting maximally 45 min each. Results Both treatments were well-tolerated and relative to WL yielded large, intent-to-treat effect sizes for the primary outcomes at posttreatment: PTSD symptoms (EMDR: d = 1.27; CBWT: d = 1.24). At posttreatment 92.5% of EMDR, and 90.2% of CBWT no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. All gains were maintained at follow-up. Compared to WL, small to large (range d = 0.39?1.03) intent-to-treat effect sizes were obtained at posttreatment for negative trauma-related appraisals, anxiety, depression, and behavior problems with these gains being maintained at follow-up. Gains were attained with significantly less therapist contact time for EMDR than CBWT (mean = 4.1 sessions/140 min vs. 5.4 sessions/227 min). Conclusions EMDR and CBWT are brief, trauma-focused treatments that yielded equally large remission rates for PTSD and reductions in the severity of PTSD and comorbid difficulties in children and adolescents seeking treatment for PTSD tied to a single event. Further trials of both treatments with PTSD tied to multiple traumas are warranted.
