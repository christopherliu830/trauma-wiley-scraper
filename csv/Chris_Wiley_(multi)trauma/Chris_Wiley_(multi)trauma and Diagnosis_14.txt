AB  - Summary.? The most serious site of bleeding for patients with haemophilia is the central nervous system. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in patients with haemophilia can occur spontaneously or following mild head trauma however no guidelines exist for the approach to these patients. The goal of this review was to determine the utility of screening computed tomography (CT) of the head for patients with haemophilia who experience head trauma and to determine if the use of clinical criteria could allow a selective approach to radiographic imaging. In a retrospective study we reviewed the management of head trauma in a cohort of paediatric patients with haemophilia in a single institution. The cohort included males, ages birth to 18?years with haemophilia A or B who were followed at the haemophilia treatment center at The Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia from 1994 to 2005. Between the years of 1994 and 2005, 97 patients were evaluated for head trauma for a total of 374 emergency department visits. There were 295 head CT scans performed to identify 9 (3%) episodes of intracranial bleeding. Fifty-six per cent of the patients with intracranial bleeding had no clinical signs or symptoms. The clinical outcome was excellent in all cases with no deaths or reported morbidity. In this cohort, a lack of symptoms and a normal neurological exam did not exclude ICH, especially in patients with severe haemophilia who were evaluated soon after a mild head trauma event suggesting the utility of early head CT imaging.

AB  - Abstract Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a systems-focused philosophy of service delivery based upon principles of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety and trustworthiness that recognizes the pervasive impact of trauma across the human experience. In a grassroots effort, one organization developed an innovative, trauma-informed day program to meet the needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who were recently deinstitutionalized. The present study is intended to provide an initial conceptualization and preliminary assessment of TIC within IDD services in order to understand its impact among individuals and staff. The study sought to answer the following questions: Has the program's culture been stable over time? How have individuals? behaviors changed over time? What have been the experiences of the program's staff members with TIC? Through a mixed methods design, secondary data analysis and semi structured staff interviews were used to assess the impact of TIC. Findings revealed an initial strong presence of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety, and trustworthiness within the program's culture, with non significant changes at follow-up. Significant reductions were noted in overall challenging behavior, aggression, and PRN medication usage; while non significant changes were noted in physical interventions with the exception of ?other? interventions (i.e., least restrictive) which significantly increased. Three major categories emerged from the qualitative data (making a difference, recognizing progress and compromising factors), illuminating staff satisfaction with work experiences, individuals? progress, and factors that challenged fidelity to TIC. The study provides a preliminary conceptualization and evidence for the efficacy of the integration of TIC into IDD services despite methodological limitations and concerns regarding the use of physical interventions. Directions for future research are presented.

AB  - Abstract Treatment techniques for psychic trauma in children are as yet at a very preliminary stage. No generally accepted research study has established one certain technique as standard. Possibilities for treatment of childhood post-traumatic stress disorders cluster into family, group, and individual treatments. Among the individual treatment modalities available, play therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, and medication hold the most promise. A combination of several of these treatments would, in most cases, be the best program available today.

AB  - Summary The restoration of a tooth or teeth damaged by trauma can be challenging. The hydrophobic dimethacrylate monomer or its derivations, such as urethane dimethacrylate (UMDA) form the basis of modern day composite resins. Other components include inhibitors, to prevent premature resin polymerisation and colour stabilizers. The reattachment approach can be used for both uncomplicated and complicated crown fractures. The concept of working from final form is crucial to allow the clinician to carefully control the composite build-up. The key to an aesthetic Class IV build-up can be broken down into four elements: shape, shade, surface texture, and polishing. The chapter presents the clinical sequence followed in the tooth restoration. Final bonding of the porcelain restoration can then be carried out to optimise the enamel, by etching for 30 seconds, washing, and drying thoroughly before applying bond and curing.

AB  - Abstract Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease confirmed at postmortem. Those at highest risk are professional athletes who participate in contact sports and military personnel who are exposed to repetitive blast events. All neuropathologically confirmed CTE cases, to date, have had a history of repetitive head impacts. This suggests that repetitive head impacts may be necessary for the initiation of the pathogenetic cascade that, in some cases, leads to CTE. Importantly, while all CTE appears to result from repetitive brain trauma, not all repetitive brain trauma results in CTE. Magnetic resonance imaging has great potential for understanding better the underlying mechanisms of repetitive brain trauma. In this review, we provide an overview of advanced imaging techniques currently used to investigate brain anomalies. We also provide an overview of neuroimaging findings in those exposed to repetitive head impacts in the acute/subacute and chronic phase of injury and in more neurodegenerative phases of injury, as well as in military personnel exposed to repetitive head impacts. Finally, we discuss future directions for research that will likely lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms separating those who recover from repetitive brain trauma vs. those who go on to develop CTE.

AB  - Abstract Over the past decades, laser use in medicine has expanded from its initial application as a light-based scalpel to a plethora of clinical uses, ranging from surgical treatment through composite polymerization, dental ablation, vision correction, and skin resurfacing to diverse diagnostic modalities. Recently, the concept of light-based diagnostics and therapy has come under investigation. Low light intensities are used to excite endogenous or exogenous fluorophores, some of which have characteristic fluorescence emissions in pathological tissues. Thus, premalignancy and malignancy potentially can be detected and diagnosed. Photosensitized superficial lesions can subsequently be destroyed selectively by using higher intensities of laser light. The application of fluorescence emission-based detection and diagnosis of precancer and cancer is reviewed, based on its application to the oral cavity?the author's primary anatomical area of expertise. This approach is justified as the same principles apply throughout the human body; to any area accessible to the clinician either directly or by some sort of fiber-optic probe. J. Cell. Biochem.

AB  - Summary Clinicians know from experience that adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) are at risk for sub-optimal parental attachments and maltreatment from within and outside of the family. Until now, thinking about attachment in this population has been broad brush and has lacked a coherent conceptual framework to understand the role attachment plays in clinical problems. This has been largely due to a lack of reliable and valid attachment assessments for this population. This chapter addresses these issues using the first direct developmental adult attachment assessment that has demonstrated face and conceptual validity for this population: the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System. The chapter outlines some basic tenets of attachment theory as it pertains to trauma, including how trauma is related to mourning. It provides two case examples that exemplify the most common form of pathological mourning in the sample: unresolved chronic mourning.

AB  - Abstract Periodontal diseases have been recognized and treated for at least 5000?years. Clinicians have recognized for many years that there are apparent differences in the presentation of periodontal diseases and have attempted to classify these diseases. Systems of classifications of disease have arisen allowing clinicians to develop structures which can be used to identify diseases in relation to aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment. It allows us to organize effective treatment of our patients? diseases. Once a disease has been diagnosed and classified, the aetiology of the condition and appropriate evidence-based treatment is suggested to the clinician. Common systems of classification also allow effective communication between health care professionals using a common language. Early attempts at classification were made on the basis of the clinical characteristics of the diseases or on theories of their aetiology. These attempts were unsupported by any evidence base. As scientific knowledge expanded, conventional pathology formed the basis of classification. More recently, this has been followed by systems of classification based upon our knowledge of the various periodontal infections and the host response to them. Classification of periodontal diseases has, however, proved problematic. Over much of the last century clinicians and researchers have grappled with the problem and have assembled periodically to review or develop the classification of the various forms of periodontal disease as research has expanded our knowledge of these diseases. This has resulted in frequent revisions and changes. A classification, however, should not be regarded as a permanent structure. It must be adaptable to change and evolve with the development of new knowledge. It is expected that systems of classification will change over time. This review examines the past and present classifications of the periodontal diseases.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background There is some evidence that antisocial individuals, including young delinquents, are significantly more likely than people in the general population to incur a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Extant studies are hampered by methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of control for confounding effects, and use of single sites and may lack representativeness. Hypothesis The hypothesis for this study is that young offenders with a history of TBI will not only be at higher risk of impulsivity and negative emotionality than their non-injured peers but also that those with TBI will have had more previous victimisation experiences. Methods Data from two sites (Philadelphia, PA and Phoenix, AZ) in a substantial longitudinal, prospective study ? the Pathways to Desistance Study ? were used to compare young people (average age 16?years) who reported TBI with those who did not. Independent variables were behavioural, criminogenic and psychosocial measures. Results Male youths were about twice as likely as young females to report TBI. Such injury was associated with higher impulsivity and negative emotion ratings, even after allowing for potentially confounding factors, including sex. In addition, TBI was independently associated with self-reported experience of victimisation. Conclusions/implications This extends the generalisability of earlier suggestions of a relationship between TBI and offending, and various factors thought likely to mediate the relationship. The implications are, thus, that it is likely to be of practical value to screen young people who get into the criminal justice system for a history of TBI, and thus to allow for more specific tailoring of interventions to reduce the range of associated problems, including likely reoffending.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic experiences are common and linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet the mechanisms underlying these relationships is less well understood. Few studies have examined trauma exposure and its relation to autonomic influence over cardiac function, a potential pathway linking trauma exposure to CVD risk. Investigating autonomic influence over cardiac function during both wake and sleep is critical, given particular links of sleep autonomic function to cardiovascular health. Among midlife women, we tested whether trauma exposure would be related to lower high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), an index of vagal influence over cardiac function, during wake and sleep. Three hundred and one nonsmoking midlife women completed physical measures, a 24-hr electrocardiogram, actigraphy sleep measurement, and questionnaires about trauma (Brief Trauma Questionnaire), childhood abuse (Child Trauma Questionnaire [CTQ]), mood, demographics, and medical/psychiatric history. Relations between trauma and HF-HRV were assessed in linear mixed effects models adjusting for covariates (age, race, education, body mass index, blood pressure, psychiatric history, medication use, sleep, mood, childhood abuse history). Results indicated that most women had experienced trauma. Any trauma exposure as well as a greater number of traumatic experiences were associated with lower HF-HRV during wake and particularly during sleep. Relations were not accounted for by covariates. Among midlife women, trauma exposure was related to lower HF-HRV during wake and sleep. Trauma may have an important impact on vagal influence over the heart, particularly during sleep. Decreased vagal influence over cardiac function may be a key mechanism by which trauma is associated with CVD risk.

AB  - Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine pancreas in both dogs and cats. Ante-mortem diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis can be challenging. The clinical picture of dogs and cats with pancreatitis varies greatly (from very mild to severe or even fatal) and is characterised by non-specific findings. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis should always be performed in dogs and cats suspected of having pancreatitis, although findings are not-specific for pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase activities and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations have no or only limited clinical value for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in either dogs or cats. Conversely, serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration is currently considered to be the clinicopathological test of choice for the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis. Abdominal radiography is a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of other diseases that may cause similar clinical signs to those of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but this depends largely on the clinician's experience. Histopathological examination of the pancreas is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatitis, but it is not without limitations. In clinical practice, a combination of careful evaluation of the animal's history, serum PLI concentration and abdominal ultrasonography, together with pancreatic cytology or histopathology when indicated or possible, is considered to be the most practical and reliable means for an accurate diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatitis compared with other diagnostic modalities.

AB  - Objectives The current study examined shame in a clinical sample recovering from a first episode of psychosis by focusing on the contribution of different types of shame to post-psychotic trauma while controlling for current affective symptoms. Design The study used a cross-sectional correlational design. Method Fifty individuals who met the criteria for a psychotic disorder whose acute psychotic symptoms were in remission completed measures of internal and external shame associated with psychosis, general shame, post-psychotic trauma, and depression. Results Post-psychotic trauma symptoms were correlated with internal and external shame associated with psychosis and general shame. However, the relation between post-psychotic trauma and external shame associated with psychosis remained after controlling for general shame and current affective symptoms. In addition, internal shame had a stronger association with depression. Thus, internal and external shame due to psychosis had different associations with different types of post-psychotic emotional dysfunction. Conclusions The results support the importance of assessing shame as a multi-faceted construct and suggest that assessing shame directly associated with mental illness is a worthwhile endeavour. Practitioner Points Assessing different types of shame following psychosis can inform assessments, formulations, and interventions with post-psychotic trauma. Our results support the application of Compassionate Mind Therapy to psychosis. However, we did not assess self-criticism or self-reassurance. We also did not investigate the relation between specific psychotic symptoms and different types of shame.

AB  - Summary We conducted a multicentre study of 1844 patients from 42 Spanish intensive care units, and analysed the clinical characteristics of brain death, the use of ancillary testing, and the clinical decisions taken after the diagnosis of brain death. The main cause of brain death was intracerebral haemorrhage (769/1844, 42%), followed by traumatic brain injury (343/1844, 19%) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (257/1844, 14%). The diagnosis of brain death was made rapidly (50% in the first 24 h). Of those patients who went on to die, the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was ≤ 8/15 in 1146/1261 (91%) of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, traumatic brain injury or anoxic encephalopathy; the Hunt and Hess Scale was 4?5 in 207/251 (83%) of patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage; and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was ≥ 15 in 114/129 (89%) of patients with strokes. Brain death was diagnosed exclusively by clinical examination in 92/1844 (5%) of cases. Electroencephalography was the most frequently used ancillary test (1303/1752, 70.7%), followed by transcranial Doppler (652/1752, 37%). Organ donation took place in 70% of patients (1291/1844), with medical unsuitability (267/553, 48%) and family refusal (244/553, 13%) the main reasons for loss of potential donors. All life-sustaining measures were withdrawn in 413/553 of non-donors (75%).

AB  - Objective. To report our experience in the assessment of splenic trauma with contrast-coded sonography and a second-generation contrast medium. Methods. From January to May 2002, 120 patients were studied with sonography for suspected splenic trauma. Twenty-five were selected for further imaging because of sonographic findings positive for splenic injury, findings positive for peritoneal fluid only, indeterminate findings, and negative findings with high clinical or laboratory suspicion. These patients underwent contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography. Results. Among the 25 patients studied, 6 had no spleen trauma at initial and follow-up evaluation. One patient had a hypoperfused spleen without parenchymal damage, and 18 had splenic injuries; these 19 patients were considered positive. Hemoperitoneum was identified by sonography, contrast-enhanced sonography, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography in 74% of the 19 positive cases. Perisplenic clots were recognized in 58% of the cases by computed tomography and in 42% by baseline and enhanced sonography. Splenic infarctions were found in 11% of cases by contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography; none was found by unenhanced sonography. Parenchymal traumatic lesions were identified in 12 of 18 patients with splenic injuries by unenhanced sonography, in 17 cases by contrast-enhanced sonography, and in all 18 cases by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. A minimal splenic lesion was found in the single patient with a false-negative contrast-enhanced sonographic finding. Contrast-enhanced sonography correlated appreciably better than unenhanced sonography in detecting injuries and in estimating their extent. Findings undetectable on unenhanced sonography were also noted: splenic hypoperfusion in 11% of positive cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography, contrast medium pooling in 21% of cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography, and contrast extravasation in 11% of cases on computed tomography and 5% on contrast-enhanced sonography. Conclusions. Contrast-enhanced sonography is a promising tool in the assessment of splenic trauma. In institutions where sonography is used as the initial procedure, this technique may increase its effectiveness.

AB  - Clinical practice in dystonia has greatly evolved in recent years; a synthetic review on patient management is provided here. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures or both. A recent classification has innovated clinical practice and serves as guidance for clinical assessment: Axis I describes clinical features, whereas Axis II indicates etiology. Dystonia presents with different syndromic aggregations with varied somatic involvement and some common features. There are five recognizable physical signs of dystonia: two main signs (dystonic postures and movements) and three additional signs (gestes antagonistes or tricks, mirror dystonia and overflow dystonia). There is still no validation of diagnostic criteria for the different dystonia syndromes, and many cases with mild phenomenology remain undiagnosed. Patients with dystonia also present non-motor features that are variably combined with the movement disorder. The features of the most common inherited and acquired dystonia syndromes are reviewed here. There is clear evidence of genetic?environmental interaction in the determinism of dystonia. The diagnostic process is guided by clinical examination and based on specific laboratory examinations. Symptomatic treatments are available for dystonia: botulinum neurotoxin injections are the primary choice for most focal dystonia syndromes; deep brain stimulation is useful in some generalized and non-generalized syndromes. Additional treatment strategies are currently being assessed.

AB  - Abstract Background/Methods? During the development of Diagnostic Criteria for Psychiatric Disorders for Use with Adults with Learning Disabilities[DC-LD] a literature review of diagnostic issues in anxiety disorders in adults with intellectual disability (ID) was undertaken using electronic and hand searching of journals. Results? Relevant general concepts in the general population are reviewed briefly before those related specifically to adults with ID. The literature relating to the diagnosis of specific anxiety disorders is reviewed, although with the exception of obsessive compulsive disorder this consists mainly of case reports. Difficulties in the use of diagnostic systems developed for the general population for the diagnosis of anxiety disorders in adults with ID are frequently commented upon. Conclusions? It is concluded that anxiety disorders are well recognized in adults with ID, although their prevalence is uncertain, and that the use of modified diagnostic criteria may aid further research in this area.
