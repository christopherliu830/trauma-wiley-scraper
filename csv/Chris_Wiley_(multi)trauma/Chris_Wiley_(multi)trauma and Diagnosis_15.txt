AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Patients with co-occurring substance use and other mental disorders are vulnerable to crime victimization, yet no evidence-based preventive interventions exist. Our aim was to test the efficacy of a new intervention, Self-wise, Other-wise, Streetwise training (SOS training), to prevent victimization in these dual-diagnosis patients as an add-on to care as usual. Design Multi-site single-blind parallel randomized controlled trial. Setting Three sites within one psychiatric service in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants Adult in-patients and out-patients with dual diagnosis (n = 250), who were predominantly male (70.4%), aged on average 42.1 years, and diagnosed with 3.7 DSM-IV disorders. Intervention and comparator Care as usual, consisting of pharmacotherapy combined with individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy and/or supportive counselling (n = 125) was compared with care as usual plus SOS training: a 6-week, 12-session manualized group training focused on enhancing emotion regulation skills, conflict resolution skills and street skills (n = 125). Measurements Victimization was assessed with the Safety Monitor, the Dutch equivalent of the International Crime Victims Survey, in a face-to-face assessment. The primary outcome measure was treatment response (yes/no), with ?yes? defined as reporting at least a 50% reduction in the number of past-year victimization incidents at the 14-month follow-up compared with baseline. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Findings The proportion of participants achieving treatment response for total victimization was 54.0% in the control group and 67.6% in the experimental group, a significant difference [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02?3.11, P = 0.042]. Treatment response for violent victimization was achieved by 68.7% of the control group and 79.3% of the experimental group (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 0.91?3.34, P = 0.092). With a Bayes factor of 2.26, this result was inconclusive. Conclusions Among dual-diagnosis patients, care as usual plus Self-wise, Other-wise, Streetwise training was more effective in preventing victimization than care as usual alone.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies showing the overall impact of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) on the treatment of critically ill patients in a general intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: A prospective observational study on the effects of MDCT on the treatment of patients in a 12-bed medical?surgical ICU in a university hospital providing tertiary care. Results: During the 9-month study period, there were 343 admissions with ICU length of stay longer than 48?h. Of these patients, 64 (19%) had had inconclusive findings with other modalities of radiological imaging, and they underwent altogether 82 MDCT examinations. Fifty examinations (61%) resulted in a change of treatment. The changes included 22 surgical interventions, 16 percutaneous or paranasal interventions, 15 changes of antimicrobial therapy, three withdrawals of active treatment, and four other changes of treatment. Eight patients underwent two and one patient underwent three changes of treatment. Twenty examinations (24%) were regarded as otherwise necessary for clinical decision-making, although no change in the treatment was indicated. Twelve examinations (15%) failed to provide any additional information relevant to the patient's treatment. Conclusion: Sixty-one percent of the MDCT examinations led to a change of treatment, and 24% of them otherwise contributed to or supported clinical decision-making, suggesting that MDCT examination is helpful in the case of general ICU patients, with inconclusive findings with other imaging modalities.

AB  - Summary.? Lack of detailed natural history and outcomes data for neonates and toddlers with haemophilia hampers the provision of optimal management of the disorder. We report an analysis of prospective data collected from 580 neonates and toddlers aged 0?2 years with haemophilia enrolled in the Universal Data Collection (UDC) surveillance project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This study focuses on a cohort of babies with haemophilia whose diagnosis was established before the age of two. The mode of delivery, type and severity of haemophilia, onset and timing of haemorrhages, site(s) of bleeding, provision of prophylaxis with coagulation factor replacement therapy, and the role played by the federally funded Haemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) in the management of these infants with haemophilia were evaluated. Seventy-five per cent of haemophilic infants were diagnosed early, in the first month of life, especially those with a family history or whose mothers were known carriers; infants of maternal carriers were more likely to be delivered by C-section. Involvement of an HTC prior to delivery resulted in avoidance of the use of assisted deliveries with vacuum and forceps. Bleeding from the circumcision site was the most common haemorrhagic complication, followed by intra- and extra-cranial haemorrhages and bleeding from heel stick blood sampling. Eight per cent of the infants were administered factor concentrate within 24 h of birth; more than half were treated to prevent bleeding. This study highlights the significant rate and the sites of initial bleeding unique to very young children with haemophilia and underscores the need for research to identify optimal evidence-based recommendations for their management.

AB  - Working with survivors of trauma is mostly challenging, exhausting, long-term and often ?messy?, when interventions that ?should? work, don't, or the unexpected arises. Nevertheless, explanations that speak to recovery from trauma more and more rely on neurobiological concepts to account for any positive change. Combining the family systems approach of Murray Bowen and recent research on the brain and trauma, post trauma symptoms are viewed as part of the ?family emotional process? even when traumatic events have emanated from outside the family system itself. Variations in responses to trauma, including dissociation and self-harm are discussed in relation to chronic anxiety and ?differentiation of self?.

AB  - Abstract This Case report illustrates the importance of coordinating various dental specialties in the successful treatment of the traumatized patient. The patient sustained multiple traumatic injuries to the anterior maxilla in the primary and permanent dentition stages of development. Orthodontic considerations involved in this case included an unerupted maxillary right central incisor with dilaceration of its root, severe malocclusion, and compromised esthetics. Endodontic concerns were directed toward the traumatized primary and permanent maxillary incisors with subsequent devitalization of the maxillary right permanent central incisor and calcification of the maxillary left permanent incisor. Oral surgery, oral pathology and general dentistry were also involved throughout the course of treatment.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Trauma involving the dentoalveolar region is a frequent occurrence which can result in the fracturing and displacement of teeth, crushing and/or fracturing of bone and soft tissue injuries including contusions, abrasions and lacerations. This review describes the assessment of patients with these injuries, not in a didactic sense by repeating excellent already published classifications and treatment options, but by addressing questions that arise during assessment. It covers trauma first aid, examination of the patient, factors that affect treatment planning decisions, and the importance of communicating treatment options and prognosis to traumatized patients.

AB  - A taxonomy of alcohol problem involvement is proposed which encompasses categorical and dimensional approaches to classification. It is argued that contemporary nosology such as that described in DSM or ICD cannot, in principle, yield discrete categories containing homogeneous membership. Nor does current classification and diagnosis yield sufficient specific information necessary for effective treatment. These limitations are not resolvable by additional empirical research; rather, as discussed herein, a new conceptual framework and focus are required. The proposed new taxonomy comprises the first step in developing a comprehensive and clinically useful method for characterizing the alcohol consuming population.

AB  - There have not been dramatic changes in trauma management in recent years. Nevertheless, there are noteworthy developments that might eventually change both paradigms of trauma systems and clinical management. In the present study, organizational aspects of mass casualty scenarios and what we have learned from the experiences of military doctors are examined. Then, the perennial theme of fluid resuscitation; when, what and how much to give, is examined. The management of bleeding and minimization of allogeneic blood transfusions raise the topics of recombinant factor?VIIa and oxygen carrying blood substitutes. Finally, an aspect of intensive care management that is very topical, that of immunonutrition and the modulation of sepsis in intensive care, is examined.

AB  - Summary Isolated angiokeratomas are common benign cutaneous lesions, generally deemed unworthy of further investigation. In contrast, diffuse angiokeratomas should alert the physician to a possible diagnosis of Fabry disease, a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by α-galactosidase deficiency. Glycosphingolipids accumulate in cells throughout the body resulting in progressive multi-organ failure. Difficulties are encountered when trying to interpret the significance of angiokeratomas because they may also occur in other lysosomal storage disorders and rarely in an isolated manner in Fabry disease. We present an algorithm for the classification of angiokeratomas which might prove useful for the diagnosis and management of Fabry disease. Assessment of the clinical features and location of the lesions, personal and family history, skin biopsy, dermoscopy and electron microscopy imaging are sequential steps in the diagnostic process. Assessing the deficiency of α-galactosidase enzyme activity is essential to confirm the diagnosis in males, while mutation analysis is always needed in females. Potentially this algorithm can change the current approach to patients when Fabry disease is suspected, thus improving the diagnostic strategy and management of this disorder. It remains to be decided whether the use of an algorithm might reduce the number of genetic consultations. As evidence has shown the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in halting progression of the disease before the onset of irreversible organ damage, it is advisable to aim at an early diagnosis in order to achieve timely initiation of effective treatment with benefits for patients and appropriate use of medical resources.

The stratified sample of study was composed of 5562 children. The prevalence of recurrent headache was 49.2% (2739 of 5562) and the prevalence of current headache was 31.3% (859 of 2739). TTH was more common than migraine (24.7% vs. 10.4%). The most sensitive headache characteristic for migraine was ?severity of pain? and the most sensitive definitive symptom is ?duration of headache? in children with TTH. IHS-based symptom definition criteria are highly beneficial in diagnosis of childhood headache, if used together with detailed clinical assessment.

AB  - Background and objectives:? Surveillance cultures may improve the prediction of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and empirical antibiotic selection. This study examined the utility and patient safety of blind, non-protected, low-volume mini-bronchial lavage (BM-BAL) surveillance cultures in predicting VAP. Methodology:? A prospective, cohort study was performed in a large general intensive care unit. BM-BALs were collected within 12?h of admission then thrice weekly. Each BM-BAL was screened by Gram staining for intracellular organisms and then quantitatively cultured. VAP was diagnosed using the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score. The concordance for isolates from the BM-BAL was assessed against concurrently collected endotracheal aspirates (EA). Results:? Four hundred and twelve patients requiring a minimum of 48?h of mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Fifty patients developed 58 episodes of VAP. Concordant pathogens were found in 85% of BM-BAL specimens collected 2?days prior to VAP onset. Their antibiograms were stable over the preceding 4?days. The isolation of pathogens with colony counts ≥104?cfu/mL from BM-BAL performed 2?days prior to the clinical onset of VAP had a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 50%, positive predictive value of 31% and a negative predictive value of 93% for predicting the development of VAP. BM-BAL WCC, quantification of bacterial growth and the percentage of intracellular organisms were not helpful in predicting VAP diagnosis. Conclusions:? BM-BAL surveillance cultures are well tolerated and useful in predicting the pathogens and their antibiograms causing VAP. Diagnostic specimen collection at the time of VAP onset is still required as surveillance cultures may be negative even one day prior to VAP onset.

AB  - A 4-year-old German shorthaired pointer presented with collapse and hematochezia. Radiographs showed gas and fluid-distended small intestines and loss of serosal detail. Ultrasound examination showed hypomotile, fluid-distended small intestines, and thrombosed jejunal veins. Multiphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed and showed a CT ?whirl sign,? an important but nonspecific sign of intestinal volvulus in human patients. At surgery, the majority of the small intestine was entangled in the volvulus and showed black discoloration. The patient was euthanized. Postmortem evaluation yielded a diagnosis of jejunoileal mesenteric volvulus secondary to a congenital omphalomesenteric duct remnant.

AB  - Abstract Rational. The concept of epilepsy syndromes, introduced in 1989, was defined as ?clusters of signs and symptoms customarily occurring together?. Definition of epilepsy syndromes based on electro-clinical features facilitated clinical practice and, whenever possible, clinical research in homogeneous groups of patients with epilepsies. Progress in the fields of neuroimaging and genetics made it rapidly clear that, although crucial, the electro-clinical description of epilepsy syndromes was not sufficient to allow much needed development of targeted therapies and a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of seizures. The 2017 ILAE position paper on Classification of the Epilepsies recognized that ?as a critical tool for the practicing clinician, epilepsy classification must be relevant and dynamic to changes in thinking?. The concept of ?epilepsy syndromes? evolved, incorporating issues related to aetiologies and comorbidities. A comprehensive update (and revision where necessary) of the EEG diagnostic criteria in the light of the 2017 revised terminology and concepts was deemed necessary. Methods. The work was commissioned by the Neurophysiology Task Force of the ILAE Committee on the Diagnostic Methods. Diagnostic criteria and recording procedures were developed by group consensus, reached through an ?informal?, internal decision-making process. Each working group member was allocated a number of syndromes, and a standard structured template was used. International literature was extensively reviewed. Results. We developed a simple diagnostic system that is applicable to all epilepsy syndromes which allows the physician (i) to rate the strength of EEG diagnosis (degree of diagnostic certainty) by weighting EEG findings in relation to the available clinical information or the specific clinical question, and ii) to suggest further EEG diagnostics where conclusive diagnostic evidence is lacking. We also propose a system of syndrome-specific recording protocols that, used with the relevant clinical presentation or specific clinical question, may maximize activation of epileptic discharges and ultimately help with standardization of EEG recording across departments, worldwide. Because recording methodology also depends on available resources, a two-tier system was developed to embrace clinical EEG services in resource-limited and industrialized countries. A clinical practice statement for each of the epilepsy syndromes discussed underscores the crucial role of the clinical information with regards to both the optimization of the EEG recording and mainly its meaningful interpretation. Part I covers Genetic (Idiopathic) generalized epilepsies and syndromes, Reflex epilepsies, structural and genetic focal (lobar) syndromes and Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsies [Published with educational EEG plates on www.epilepticdisorders.com].

AB  - Abstract The concept of focus [Skinner, W., 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Business Review 52 (3), 113?121], notably operationalized in manufacturing entities like cells and focused factories, has also been adopted by the health care industry. Examples include patient-focused care systems and product/service lines. Despite its longevity, there is a paucity of studies analyzing the focus concept and its link to performance, especially in health care. This research is aimed at enhancing our understanding of how a focus-based approach to organization redesign in health care affects processes and practices, and what operational, clinical, and financial outcomes result from such a change. The research setting is a single case site within a large medical center for which costs for trauma care used to exceed income. Using a structured framework, we document the design and operation of this physically and organizationally integrated Level I trauma care center and compare it to its preceding operation. Its pre- and post-conversion performance is analyzed using symmetric event windows covering three-year periods before and after the focused hospital unit (FHU) was established. Under a sizable increase in workload, we find no change in mortality, moderate improvement in length of stay, and a large improvement in net operating margins. Surprisingly, the latter stem not from reductions in cost but in sharply increased hospital reimbursements. Previous studies of hospital restructuring involving focused patient populations have not conclusively supported a positive link between focus and outcomes. However, this investigation of a specific FHU suggests, conceptually as well as quantitatively, that focus can be an attractive element in health care system design.
