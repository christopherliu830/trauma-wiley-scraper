AB  - Abstract Little is known about the relation between acculturation and socioecological contexts of migrants with a personal trauma history living in the community. This study represents an extension of our previous work and aimed to unpack the perceived neighborhood ethnic density (ED) effect and examine the moderating role of ED on the acculturation?adjustment relation in a community sample of migrants with trauma (N?=?99) from developing countries residing in Montreal, Canada. ED was protective against general psychological distress but did not predict posttraumatic symptoms. The ED effect was mediated via degree of acculturation to the French?Canadian mainstream cultural context, rather than heritage acculturation, social support, or discrimination. Moreover, protective effects of French?Canadian mainstream acculturation for depressive symptoms and life satisfaction were found under high but not low ED conditions. Similarities and differences with our previous research as well as theoretical and prevention implications are discussed from a person?environment interaction perspective.

AB  - Background It is unknown how traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One potential mechanism is via alteration of fear-learning processes that could affect responses to trauma memories and cues. We utilized a prospective, longitudinal design to determine if TBI is associated with altered fear learning and extinction, and if fear processing mediates effects of TBI on PTSD symptom change. Methods Eight hundred fifty two active-duty Marines and Navy Corpsmen were assessed before and after deployment. Assessments included TBI history, PTSD symptoms, combat trauma and deployment stress, and a fear-potentiated startle task of fear acquisition and extinction. Startle response and self-reported expectancy and anxiety served as measures of fear conditioning, and PTSD symptoms were measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Results Individuals endorsing ?multiple hit? exposure (both deployment TBI and a prior TBI) showed the strongest fear acquisition and highest fear expression compared to groups without multiple hits. Extinction did not differ across groups. Endorsing a deployment TBI was associated with higher anxiety to the fear cue compared to those without deployment TBI. The association of deployment TBI with increased postdeployment PTSD symptoms was mediated by postdeployment fear expression when recent prior-TBI exposure was included as a moderator. TBI associations with increased response to threat cues and PTSD symptoms remained when controlling for deployment trauma and postdeployment PTSD diagnosis. Conclusions Deployment TBI, and multiple-hit TBI in particular, are associated with increases in conditioned fear learning and expression that may contribute to risk for developing PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Young children are disproportionately exposed to interpersonal trauma (maltreatment, witnessing intimate partner violence [IPV]) and appear particularly susceptible to negative sequelae. Little is known about the factors influencing vulnerability to traumatic stress responses and other negative outcomes in early life. This study examined associations among interpersonal trauma exposure, sociodemographic risk, developmental competence, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 200 children assessed from birth to first grade via standardized observations, record reviews, and maternal and teacher interviews. More severe PTSD symptoms were predicted by greater trauma exposure (r = .43), greater sociodemographic risk (r = .22), and lower developmental competence (rs = ?.31 and ?.54 for preschool and school-age developmental competence, respectively). Developmental competence partially mediated the association between trauma exposure and symptoms. Trauma exposure fully mediated the association between sociodemographic risk and symptoms. Neither sociodemographic risk nor developmental competence moderated trauma exposure effects on symptoms. The findings suggest that (a) exposure to maltreatment and IPV has additive effects on posttraumatic stress risk in early life, (b) associations between sociodemographic adversity and poor mental health may be attributable to increased trauma exposure in disadvantaged populations, and (c) early exposures have a negative cascade effect on developmental competence and mental health.

AB  - Aim:? To analyse medical and witness evidence collected during investigations of infant abusive head trauma with a view to (i) isolating cases where a functional time limit could be established and (ii) examining those cases for evidence of the onset of neurological symptoms. Methods:? A retrospective study was undertaken of severe infant abusive head trauma cases investigated by the Queensland Police Service over a 10-year period. In cases where sufficient reliable (non-perpetrator) evidence was available, a functional time limit was documented. Those files were then examined for further medical, witness or perpetrator evidence of the infant victim?s response to the assault. Results:? A functional time limit was established in 16 of 52 cases (31%). In 11 of the 16 cases there was evidence of an immediate neurological response on the part of the victim. Conclusion:? The study suggests that the period between assault and onset of symptoms in infant abusive head trauma is brief, particularly in cases of an acute deterioration where proximate medical intervention is required. In those cases with sufficient evidence of the victim?s condition post-injury, the symptoms presented without delay.

AB  - ABSTRACT Symptoms of vicarious trauma, coping strategies, and prevention suggestions were investigated with 105 judges. Participants completed a self-report measure developed for this study. The majority of judges (63%) reported one or more symptoms that they identified as work-related vicarious trauma experiences. Female judges reported more symptoms, as did judges with seven or more years of experience. In addition, female judges were more likely to report internalizing difficulties, while judges with more experience reported higher levels of externalizing/hostility symptoms. Coping and prevention strategies were multi-domain (i.e., personal, professional, and societal) and underscored the need for greater awareness and support for judges.

AB  - Abstract The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among U.S. veterans deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan necessitates the need for comprehensive assessment and treatment strategies. This study investigated the utility of a combat-related PTSD symptom provocation paradigm to elicit unique neurological responses across three groups: combat veterans with PTSD, combat veterans without PTSD, and nonmilitary participants without PTSD. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) the results indicated that combat veterans with PTSD demonstrated significant activation to a trauma-related sound compared with nonmilitary personnel, channel 14: d = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.28, 1.76]; channel 15: d = 1.30, 95% CI [0.53, 2.06]; and combat veterans without PTSD, channel 14: d = 0.87, 95% CI [0.14, 1.59]. Specifically, this increased neural activation was approximately located in the right medial superior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9/10), an area associated with experiencing negative or threatening stimuli and emotional detachment. There were no differences across the groups for nontrauma-related sounds. Results were less clear with respect to a combat-related odor. These results suggest a specific neurophysiological response to trauma-related cues and, if replicated, may offer a biomarker for combat-related PTSD. Such a response could provide incremental validity over diagnostic assessments alone and assist in planning and monitoring of treatment outcome.

In one case, the tics were accompanied by marked obsessive-compulsive behavior. All patients were involved in motor vehicle accidents resulting in closed craniocerebral trauma. The latency of onset between head trauma and the movement disorder varied between 1 day and a few months. Magnetic resonance imaging, which was performed in all three patients, did not detect any structural lesions of the basal ganglia or the brainstem. Extensive bifrontal leukoencephalopathy was found in one patient who suffered severe head trauma.

AB  - Purpose? Decision making in the management of combined major skeletal and soft tissue trauma to the lower limb is a complex process made more difficult by the uncertainty surrounding outcomes. The aim of this study is to review and present our experience with flap reconstruction of traumatic lower limb defects, with particular reference to in-hospital complications and outcomes related to timing, choice of flap and pre-existing complications. Methodology? Retrospective review of all lower limb flap reconstructions performed by the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit at the Alfred Hospital (largest trauma centre in Australasia) from 1 July 2001 to 20 October 2005 (51 month period). Results? Sixty-four patients had 83 flap reconstructions (35 free, 48 local) of 70 separate lower limb injuries. Twenty-seven flaps (32.5%) developed soft tissue infections and 16 fixation devices (25.8%) were complicated by deep metal infection. There were 6 (12.5%) local flap partial necrosis and 4 (11.4%) free flap failures. Three patients underwent secondary amputation during their initial admission. Thorough wound debridement and internal skeletal fixation were followed by earlier soft tissue coverage and lower deep metal infection rates. Limbs in which flaps were performed after Day 5 were more likely to develop deep metal infection (p?=?0.04) and suffer free flap failure or local flap partial necrosis (p?=?0.02). Conclusion? The current study presented our experience with flap reconstructions of complex lower limb injuries at a major trauma centre. Thorough wound debridement, internal fixation and early soft tissue coverage (within 5 days of injury) is associated with lower infection rates and optimal outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aims to establish current practice among Australasian emergency physicians and trainees on several aspects of the investigation of suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Methods An electronic questionnaire (SurveyMonkeyTM) was distributed to emergency physicians and trainees by email through the ACEM. Survey recipients were asked about demographics, followed by a series of questions relating to the investigation of SAH. Results There were 878 survey respondents (response rate 24%). Our data showed that 47.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that a CT brain within 6?h of headache onset is sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of SAH. For a CT performed within 12?h of ictus, 14.4% were satisfied that SAH could be excluded. After a negative CT scan, for further investigation of SAH, 88% of respondents preferred lumbar puncture to CT angiography. For detection of xanthochromia in the cerebrospinal fluid, 57.7% of respondents felt that spectrophotometry (vs visual inspection) is necessary to accurately diagnose SAH. Conclusions A range of information was collected regarding the investigation of suspected SAH. We report significant differences in the diagnostic approach of Australasian emergency physicians and trainees to this condition, in particular the utility of CT within 6?h for exclusion of SAH.

The discussion here is framed particularly in the context of intelligibility and interpretability of speech in cross-cultural communication through world Englishes and the wide-ranging negative reactions to people who speak English with a foreign accent.

AB  - Summary After relative neglect in the age of melancholy during the 1970s and 1980s, there has been a renaissance of bipolar disorder during the last decade of the 20thcentury. The new bipolar era has also witnessed the development of innovative pharmacological and psychosocial interventions specifically geared for this disorder. The signs and symptoms of the classical cyclical illness are unmistakable. However, the illness may begin insidiously with manifestations of a subthreshold or disturbances of a temperamental nature buried in early childhood or adolescence. As the primary aim of this chapter is to review the current body of research evidence and clinical experience in the diagnosis and classification of bipolar disorder, there will be no attempt to exhaustively review comorbidity. The latter will be limited to the most disputed clinical boundaries of bipolar disorder.

AB  - Abstract Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort. Results indicate a genome-wide significant association between total AUDIT score and rs1433375 [N = 1036, P = 2.61 ? 10?8 (dominant model), P = 7.76 ? 10?8 (additive model)], an intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism located 323 kb upstream of the sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) at 4q28. rs1433375 was also significant in a meta-analysis of two similar, but independent, cohorts (N = 1394, P = 0.0004), the Marine Resiliency Study and Systems Biology PTSD Biomarkers Consortium. Functional analysis indicated that rs1433375 was associated with SCLT1 gene expression and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Together, findings suggest a role for sodium channel regulation and cerebellar functioning in alcohol use behavior. Identifying mechanisms underlying risk for problematic alcohol use in trauma-exposed populations is critical for future treatment and prevention efforts.

AB  - Abstract Background Supported self-management (SSM) is a recognized approach for people with long-term conditions but, despite the prevalence of unmet needs, little is known about its role for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Objectives To codesign an SSM intervention with people with TBI and evaluate feasibility of implementation through multidisciplinary staff across a trauma pathway. Setting and participants People who had previously been admitted to a Major Trauma Centre following TBI and family members participated in a series of codesign activities. Staff attended SSM workshops and used the intervention with patients in acute and rehabilitation settings. Methods We used Normalization Process Theory constructs to guide and interpret implementation. Knowledge, beliefs and confidence of staff in SSM were assessed through pre- and post-training questionnaires, and staff, patients' and families' experiences were explored through semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, and clinical measures were mapped against a matched sample. Results Codesigned resources were created and used within an SSM approach for which 110 staff participated in training. Evaluation demonstrated significant differences in staff SSM confidence and skills, following training. Qualitative evaluation revealed adoption by staff, and patients' and families' experiences of using the resources. Challenges included reaching staff across complex pathways to achieve collective implementation. Conclusion This is the first project to demonstrate feasibility of SSM for people after TBI starting in an acute trauma setting. Through an open approach to codesign with a marginalized group, the SSM resources were valued by them and held meaning and relevance for staff.

AB  - Summary The effect of patient-controlled analgesia during the emergency phase of care on the prevalence of persistent pain is unkown. We studied individuals with traumatic injuries or abdominal pain 6 months after hospital admission via the emergency department using an opportunistic observational study design. This was conducted using postal questionnaires that were sent to participants recruited to the multi-centre pain solutions in the emergency setting study. Patients with prior chronic pain states or opioid use were not studied. Questionnaires included the EQ5D, the Brief Pain Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Overall, 141 out of 286 (49% 95%CI 44?56%) patients were included in this follow-up study. Participants presenting with trauma were more likely to develop persistent pain than those presenting with abdominal pain, 45 out of 64 (70%) vs. 24 out of 77 (31%); 95%CI 24?54%, p < 0.001. There were no statistically significant associations between persistent pain and analgesic modality during hospital admission, age or sex. Across both abdominal pain and traumatic injury groups, participants with persistent pain had lower EQ5D mobility scores, worse overall health and higher anxiety and depression scores (p < 0.05). In the abdominal pain group, 13 out of 50 (26%) patients using patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 11 out of 27 (41%) of those with usual treatment; 95%CI for difference (control ? patient-controlled analgesia) ?8 to 39%, p = 0.183. Acute pain scores at the time of hospital admission were higher in participants who developed persistent pain; 95%CI 0.7?23.6, p = 0.039. For traumatic pain, 25 out of 35 (71%) patients given patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 20 out of 29 (69%) patients with usual treatment; 95%CI ?30 to 24%, p = 0.830. Persistent pain is common 6 months after hospital admission, particularly following trauma. The study findings suggest that it may be possible to reduce persistent pain (at least in patients with abdominal pain) by delivering better acute pain management. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Context? Reflective practice has been suggested to be an important instrument in improving clinical judgement and developing medical expertise. Empirical evidence supporting this suggestion, however, is absent. This paper reports on an experiment conducted to study the effects of reflective practice on diagnostic accuracy. Methods? Participants were 42 internal medicine residents in hospitals in 2 states in the northeast of Brazil. They diagnosed 16 clinical cases. The experiment employed a repeated measures design, with 2 independent variables: the complexity of clinical cases (simple or complex), and the reasoning approach induced to diagnose the case (participants were instructed to diagnose each case either through pattern recognition or reflective reasoning). The dependent variable was the accuracy of the diagnosis provided for each case. All participants participated in each of the 2 levels of both independent variables. Results? A main effect of case complexity emerged. There was no statistically significant main effect of reflective practice. However, a significant interaction effect was found between case complexity and mode of processing (F[1,41]?=?4.48, P?<?0.05), indicating that although reflective practice did not make a difference to accuracy of diagnosis in simple cases, it had a positive effect when diagnosing complex cases. Conclusions? Reflective practice had a positive effect on diagnosis of complex, unusual cases. Non-analytical reasoning was shown to be as effective as reflective reasoning for diagnosing routine clinical cases. Findings support the idea that reflective practice may particularly improve diagnoses in situations of uncertainty and uniqueness, reducing diagnostic errors.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the strengths and weaknesses of the radiological investigations used to investigate suspected abusive head trauma in children. Advice is offered regarding investigations that might reasonably be used in different clinical scenarios. Common misunderstandings, controversies and pitfalls that may arise if radiological findings are misinterpreted are discussed. The forensic significance of these findings is examined, with particular reference to estimates of time of injury and the range of possible explanations for these findings (e.g., the presence of extra-axial fluid around the brain). Forensic practitioners and radiologists are cautioned to avoid over-confidence regarding estimates of time of injury on the basis of fluid densities. Consideration must be given to minimizing confirmatory bias. The authors recommend that radiologists specifically mention in their reports the range of possible explanations for forensically important findings.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The clinical spectrum of electrical injury ranges from the absence of any external physical signs to severe multiple trauma. Reported neuropsychiatric sequelae can vary from vague complaints, which may seem unrelated to the injury in their occurrence over time or by their apparent severity, to sequelae consistent with brain injury accompanying an electrical trauma. In this report, a case study and discussion are presented on the management and coordination of postacute care of an electrical trauma survivor. Expertise and a multi-disciplinary team are essential to cohesive patient care. Patient monitoring for progressive changes and prompt intervention are needed to address the potential difficulties experienced by trauma survivors as they rehabilitate to return to their work and their activities of daily living.

AB  - Objective To assess the association between parental post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and offspring PTSD and its specificity for other disorders in a non-clinical epidemiological cohort of Australian Vietnam veterans, their partners and their sons and daughters. Method Veterans were interviewed twice, in 1992?1994 and 2005?2006; partners were interviewed in 2006?2007, and their offspring in 2012?2014. A total of 125 sons and 168 daughters were interviewed from 197 families, 137 of which also included partners who were the mothers of the children. Statistical analysis used multi-level modelling to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals while controlling for clustering effects within families. Parent PTSD diagnoses were examined for associations with offspring trauma exposure, PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses. Results Veteran PTSD increased the risk of PTSD and no other disorder in both sons and daughters; partner PTSD did not. Veteran depression was also a risk factor for sons? PTSD, and alcohol disorder was linked to alcohol dependence in sons and PTSD in daughters, but not when controlling for veteran PTSD. Conclusion We conclude that PTSD in a Vietnam veteran father increases the risk specifically for PTSD in his sons and daughters.
