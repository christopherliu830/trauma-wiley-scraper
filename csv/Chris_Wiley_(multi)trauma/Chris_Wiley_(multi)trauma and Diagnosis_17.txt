AB  - Abstract Penetrating thoracic trauma is relatively uncommon when compared to other types of veterinary trauma, although prompt identification and emergency evaluation are necessary as injuries may be life-threatening. Emergency triage (see Chapter 2) is prudent to ensure patient stabilization prior to pursuing additional diagnostics. Surgical exploration is likely indicated, particularly in cases of gunshot wounds or when patient comfort or stability is compromised by the degree of the injury. Resolution of hypovolemic shock, improving respiratory function, and analgesia are the key aspects of emergency room stabilization. Hemothorax and pneumothorax are common and thoracocentesis can be an important part of management of these patients. Outcome with treatment is generally fair to good, depending on the cause of the wound; however, particular situations (high-velocity gunshot wounds) have been shown to have a worse prognosis.

AB  - SUMMARY One hundred and ninety-five magnetic resonance (MR) images (1.5 Tesla) of 167 patients with neurological impairment following spinal trauma were reviewed. Acute cord injury produces central haemorrhagic necrosis that extends transversely and longitudinally with time and increased injury severity. Oedoma is more homogeneous, extensive and dominant in minimal lesions. Magnetic resonance appearances correlate with neurological status and outcome. Patients with MR evidence of cord blood had severe clinical lesions and failed to show useful clinical improvement. Patients with homogeneous ?oedema?improved to useful function. Lesion signal inhomogeneity relates to a worse prognosis. The clinical level correlates closely with cord blood or signal in homogeneity but imprecisely with homogeneous oedema. Disc herniations require differentiation from epidural blood and venous engorgement, which are prominent with bone displacement. Magnetic resonance is recommended in incomplete cord syndromes and in cord injuries with no apparent fracture, particularly if clinically deteriorating. Chronic injury consists of cavitation, extensive gliosis, cord atrophy and leptomeningeal fibrosis. Progressive myelopathy may result from cystic or non-cystic intramedullary lesions. Cord cysts are common and cyst fluid signal should closely follow cerebrospinal fluid. Turbulent cyst fluid motion is commoner in larger cysts and may predict those cysts more prone to propagate. Progressive syrinxes show typical appearances, usually with transverse septa. Atrophy and propagating syrinxes usually take years to develop. Leptomeningeal cysts and spinal stenosis caused by bone displacement and accelerated adjacent disc disease may cause late deterioration. In progressive myelopathy following injury, surgically drainable cysts are clearly differentiable from cord gliosis and atrophy.

AB  - Acute bacterial infection of the central nervous system requires rapid and adequate management. Etiological diagnosis is hence crucial. Moreover, the epidemic threat of certain bacteria necessitates a reliable characterization of the involved bacterial strains to follow the spread of epidemic strains. Conventional identification and characterization of etiological agents are basically based on culture and identification of bacterial markers most frequently by serological assays. Molecular identification and characterization of bacteria have been employed. They provide more reliable analysis of bacterial isolates. Molecular methods for non-culture diagnosis of bacterial infections have recently been developed. In many cases, the molecular assays have decreased the identification time of positive cultures and rescued detection of pathogens in culture-negative clinical samples.

AB  - Abstract Previous research has indicated a link between trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and aggression. The aim of this meta-analysis was to integrate previous findings with a focus on women. Six databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles. Random-effects models and meta-regressions were calculated. K = 15 studies were included, indicating small to medium effects (Cohen's d = 0.44 for traumatic events and d = 0.60 for PTSD). For traumatic events, timing effects were found. Methodological differences in types of summary statistics used in the studies yielded significant results. These findings provide further evidence for important associations between traumatic stress and the risk of aggression in women. Considering the devastating impact that this violence can have on an entire community, early interventions are key.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Sonographers of a large, metropolitan health service were trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma in preparation for a potential mass casualty incident. Given the prior ultrasound experience of this cohort, the suitability of an abbreviated credentialing pathway based upon that required for emergency physicians was evaluated. Method A training and credentialing process to teach extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma was planned for sonographers. The model was based upon existing credentialing requirements for emergency physicians. The project was undertaken in two stages, using a ?train the trainer? approach. The initial stage trained and credentialed a group of senior sonographer trainers. This group then supported the training and credentialing of the wider sonographer cohort. Results Twenty-eight qualified sonographers were successfully trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma scanning. Practical competency assessment demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Image interpretation assessment results also demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Conclusion An abbreviated model is suitable for the training and credentialing of sonographers in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma, given their pre-existing ultrasound skills and knowledge.

AB  - Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single-center pediatric LT cohort (2000-2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height-for-age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride?rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non-CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow-up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Infratentorial tumour site and health-related quality of life (HRQL) 1 month after diagnosis have been shown to predict HRQL 1 year after diagnosis in children with brain tumours. This study aimed to identify additional early child-related determinants of parent- and child-report HRQL. Methods Longitudinal prospective study. Semi-structured interviews took place approximately 1 and 12 months after diagnosis. HRQL was measured using the self- and parent-report Pediatric Quality of Life Scales (PedsQL 4.0) Total Scale Score and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) multi-attribute utility function. Child variables included performance and verbal IQ, general memory, selective attention executive function, behaviour problems, adaptive behaviour, symptoms of depression and anxiety and event related anxiety. Univariate analyses were used to identify potential early predictors of HRQL. Regression analysis was then used to identify the most important determinants of HRQL at 1 year. Results Thirty-five patients completed the 12-month interviews. Multivariate analysis showed infratentorial tumour site remained an important determinant of HRQL 1 year after diagnosis. Infratentorial tumour site and selective attention at 1 month generally best predicted poor self- and parent-report HRQL at 12 months. Adaptive behaviour and performance IQ may be important. Conclusion Selective attention and infratentorial tumour site are most important in predicting both parent- and self-report HRQL at 1 year after diagnosis. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. Cognitive remediation or/and pharmacological intervention, particularly aimed at children with infratentorial tumours may improve attention and subsequently HRQL and both merit further investigation.

AB  - Childhood traumas are associated with suicidal behavior but this aspect has not been examined in relation to schizophrenia. In this study, 50 chronic schizophrenic patients who had attempted suicide were compared with 50 chronic schizophrenic patients who had never attempted suicide for their scores on the 34-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). It was found that schizophrenics who had attempted suicide reported significantly higher CTQ scores for emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect than schizophrenics who had never attempted suicide. Therefore, childhood trauma may be a risk factor predisposing schizophrenic patients to attempt suicide.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Summary Renal injuries are mostly managed conservatively. Operative intervention with view of kidney salvage is possible. However, nephrectomy may be the only option to control life-threatening haemorrhage. During the conservative period, it is extremely important to keep patients under close monitoring because this will allow early identification of patients who will require surgical intervention. Ureteral injuries are relatively rare and mostly iatrogenic. Management of the ureteral injuries depends level of injury, severity, and on time (early or late) of recognition of the injury. Careful assessment (cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram) and appropriate imaging computed tomography urogram or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) are essential to select most suitable method of repair of ureteral injury.

AB  - In this article, I explore the reluctance of Japanese ob-gyns to discuss prenatal diagnosis (PND) tests with pregnant women. The analysis focuses on the culturally specific ways in which ob-gyns formulate their cautiousness and criticism toward PND while invoking a local moral economy. Analyzing ob-gyns' accounts, I show how the ambiguities of PND are constituted in a specific moment in Japanese culture, history, disability politics, and national reproductive policies and are formulated through local paradigms of thinking about pregnant women, their fetuses, and the process of becoming a person in Japanese society. Finally, I show how PND in Japan is pushed to a ?back-stage? realm in which the diagnosis for fetal anomalies is practiced in secrecy.

AB  - Objective? To determine whether the introduction of multi-professional simulation training was associated with improvements in the management of cord prolapse, in particular, the diagnosis?delivery interval (DDI). Design? Retrospective cohort study. Setting? Large tertiary maternity unit within a University Hospital in the United Kingdom. Sample? All cases of cord prolapse with informative case record: 34 pre-training, 28 post-training. Methods? Review of hospital notes and software system entries; comparison of quality of management for umbilical cord prolapse pre-training (1993?99) and post-training (2001?07). Main outcome measures? Diagnosis?delivery interval; proportion of caesarean section (CS) in whom actions were taken to reduce cord compression; type of anaesthesia for CS births; rate of low (<7) 5-minute Apgar scores; rate of admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (if birthweight >2500?g). Results? After training, there was a statistically significant reduction in median DDI from 25 to 14.5?minutes (P?<?0.001). Post-training, there was also a statistically significant increase in the proportion of CS where recommended actions had been performed (from 34.78 to 82.35%, P?=?0.003). There was a nonsignificant increase in the use of spinal anaesthesia for CS, from 8.70 to 17.65%, and a nonsignificant reduction in the rate of low Apgar scores from 6.45 to 0% and in the rate of admission to NICU from 38.46 to 22.22%. Conclusions? The introduction of annual training, in accordance with national recommendations, was associated with improved management of cord prolapse. Future studies could assess whether this improved management translates into better outcomes for babies and their mothers.

Streetworkers are often exposed to violence and its aftermath, though little is known about the specific types of trauma to which streetworkers are exposed. Methods This study seeks to explore this question via in-depth, semistructured interviews with 37 streetworkers from a large city in the United States. Results The qualitative results revealed that the streetworkers in this sample experienced a range of types of trauma. Streetworkers were less likely to be directly exposed to traumatic events in the context of their jobs, yet were more likely to witness, learn about, or experience repeated exposure to aversive details of traumatic events. Conclusions Despite their exposure to trauma, very few participants described seeking psychological treatment, self-care, or new vocation. We discuss our findings and make recommendations to bolster support for streetworkers.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, disabling psychiatric disorder prevalent among civilian and military personnel in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). Current trauma-focused psychotherapies may place high emotional demands and lengthy treatment commitment that may hinder successful treatment completion for some patients. Accelerated resolution therapy (ART) is an emerging trauma-focused psychotherapy that is briefer than most current treatments. Materials and Methods This review describes the ART clinical protocol and theoretical underpinnings, its relationship to current treatments and formal established treatment guidelines and empirical research data. Also presented are new subgroup data for the use of ART among clients with PTSD and concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), and among US Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel with extensive combat-related trauma exposure. Treatment response was defined as ≥10-point reduction on the 17-item PCL-M (PTSD Checklist). Results In subgroup analyses, mean treatment with ART consisted of approximately four sessions. Among 202 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates (assuming no response for non-completers) by TBI status were as follows: no TBI (58.1%, n = 105), mild TBI (60.4%, n = 48), moderate/severe TBI (46.9%, n = 49). Among 141 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates by SOF status were as follows: non-SOF (54.3%, n = 116), SOF (60.0%, n = 25). Conclusion The ART protocol aligns closely with established first-line trauma-focused psychotherapies and clinical guidelines. It appears to provide frequent clinical relief of symptoms of PTSD in an average of four sessions among military personnel with challenging clinical presentations, including concomitant TBI and extensive operational combat-related trauma.

AB  - The role of the nurse within the multi-professional rehabilitation team Aim of the study/paper.?To identify the contribution of the nurse within the multi-professional rehabilitation team. Background.?The requirement for nurses to work effectively within the multi-professional rehabilitation team is increasingly important with the higher incidence of chronic disease, growing numbers of older people and enhanced survival from major trauma. Methods.?A 2-year qualitative investigation was undertaken centred on three contrasting condition case studies (fractured neck of femur, rheumatoid arthritis and stroke). Clients were theoretically sampled, with their ?rehabilitation pathway? through different services providing the window through which the nurse?s contribution was explored. Multiple methods and points of data collection were used, including observation, face to face interviews (clients, carers and staff) and record review. To enhance generalisability, a series of national expert workshops were undertaken with four groups: users, carers and carers? organizations; nurses; members of the multi-professional team; and educationalists. Findings.?Six interlinked roles for the nurse were identified: assessment, co-ordination and communication, technical and physical care, therapy integration and therapy carry-on, emotional support, and involving the family. Of particular significance is the creation of a supportive environment for rehabilitation to occur. Some nurses undertook aspects of all of these roles at any one time while others were only involved in one or two areas. While nurses expressed a desire to integrate therapy into their care delivery, the actual achievement of this goal was variable. Conclusions.?Key elements of the nurse?s contribution within rehabilitation should aim to maximize client choice to enhance independent living in the client?s future environment. At a nursing educational policy level the nurse needs to have a full understanding of the principles and models of rehabilitation. At a practice level, the nurse?s role must be valued and recognized, by nurses themselves and other team members.

AB  - Abstract Objective. Assessment of apolipoprotein E genotype, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in different types of dementia. Subjects. 102 consecutive referrals to an old age psychiatry service based at Manchester were classified according to clinical criteria based on ICD 10. Results. Thirty-seven were considered to have Alzheimer's disease, 16 multi-infarct dementia and 33 to be free from dementia. Sixteen patients, in whom a definitive diagnosis could not be reached or sufficient information was not available, were excluded from the study. There was an increase in the prevalence of the Apo E4 allele in both Alzheimer's disease (?2=3.82, p<0.05) and multi-infarct dementia (?2=1.93, p<0.16) by Wald tests compared to individuals without dementia. The increased prevalence of the E4 Allele in multi-infarct dementia was not related to serum lipid levels. Conclusion. The hypothesis that the onset of multi-infarct dementia may be precipitated by E4's mediation of higher serum cholesterol levels is not supported by the present study. ? 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary A leg ulcer is a symptom and the treating physician needs to find out its origin by differential diagnostic approaches and procedures. The correct diagnosis leads to a specific therapy that ideally accelerates the healing of the ulceration. Identifying the pathogenesis of a leg ulcer is the first and main step towards healing. Although vascular diseases are the major causes of leg ulcers, one needs to consider, in addition to venous and arterial disorders, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic and neoplastic causes. The simple truth that one can only make a diagnosis that was considered holds particularly true in leg ulcers. The differential diagnostic considerations presented here appear in the daily routine of a dermatologist and the article provides help in diagnostic approaches and therapeutic decisions.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Dental trauma in school populations has a high frequency and school teachers are often close to the place where such injuries occur. However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia. Materials and Methods A multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management. Results The response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers? education level. Conclusions The knowledge of school teachers in Colombia about emergency dental trauma management is inadequate. The findings strongly suggest a need for an education strategy with the involvement of the government, dentistry schools and private organizations.
