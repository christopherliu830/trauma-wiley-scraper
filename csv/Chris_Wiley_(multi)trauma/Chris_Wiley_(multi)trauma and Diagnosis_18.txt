AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Dental trauma in school populations has a high frequency and school teachers are often close to the place where such injuries occur. However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia. Materials and Methods A multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management. Results The response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers? education level. Conclusions The knowledge of school teachers in Colombia about emergency dental trauma management is inadequate. The findings strongly suggest a need for an education strategy with the involvement of the government, dentistry schools and private organizations.

AB  - Summary In the current study, we investigated whether suppression can produce an amplified memory for a traumatic experience. Participants viewed a distressing film depicting a multi-fatality car accident. We broke the film down into several short clips, some of which were removed. After viewing the film, we instructed participants to (i) suppress and monitor film-related thoughts, (ii) think freely and monitor film-related thoughts or (iii) just think freely. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a recognition test. Memory distortion was comparable across conditions; however, suppression and monitoring of trauma-related thoughts removed the typical bias to falsely remember the most critical and traumatic clips of the film over the least critical clips. Our data suggest that suppression may be effective in reducing trauma-related cognitions and, therefore, does not predict a more ?amplified? memory for trauma. Instead, suppression and thought monitoring encourage an unbiased, although inaccurate, memory for trauma.Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This report describes the use of the gamma camera in the investigation of suspected liver damage in trauma. Liver scanning is the only simple, safe, non-operative method available for obtaining a multi-dimensional picture of the presence and extent of liver disruption. The application of the gamma camera and liver-specific technetium-99m radiopharmaceuticals has reduced the test time to minutes.

AB  - Abstract Objective Since the initial description of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in the early 1900s, classification of this disease has been in flux. The goal of this manuscript is to review the existing literature and to revisit definitions and diagnostic criteria for AgP. Study analysis An extensive literature search was performed that included databases from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Of 4930 articles reviewed, 4737 were eliminated. Criteria for elimination included; age > 30 years old, abstracts, review articles, absence of controls, fewer than; a) 200 subjects for genetic studies, and b) 20 subjects for other studies. Studies satisfying the entrance criteria were included in tables developed for AgP (localized and generalized), in areas related to epidemiology, microbial, host and genetic analyses. The highest rank was given to studies that were; a) case controlled or cohort, b) assessed at more than one time-point, c) assessed for more than one factor (microbial or host), and at multiple sites. Results Epidemiologic studies provided insight into ethnic and societal factors affecting AgP. DNA analysis of microbes showed some consistency but significant variability. Host factor analysis was less consistent. Many genetic studies were conducted but few had either sufficient power or looked at multiple genes in AgP. Conclusions Conflicting data resulted for several reasons; 1) the classification was too broad, 2) the disease (AgP) was not studied from its inception, at differing time points (temporal), and at different locations (topographic). New technologic advances coupled with a more delimiting definition of disease will allow for genetic, host and microbial factor analyses in an unbiased manner. As such we predict that progress can be made in identifying a robust group of genetic, host, and microbial risk-markers associated with periodontal disease that can improve diagnostic capability in disease associated with juveniles, adolescents, and post-adolescent individuals.

AB  - Abstract Use of ceiling-mounted radiographic equipment in an emergency room for management of the multiply injured patient is described. The protocol of the Advanced Trauma and Life Support manual is followed and three plain radiographs (lateral cervical spine, anteroposterior views of the chest and pelvis) are obtained by the radiographers, who are members of the trauma team. Abnormalities were diagnosed on 7 per cent of the cervical radiographs, 31 per cent of the chest and 28 per cent of the pelvis in 108 patients during the first year of use. With full integration of the radiographers into the trauma team these three initial films are obtained within 10 min. Subsequent films can be taken of skeletal injuries found clinically or incidentally on the first three plain radiographs. It is recommended that all emergency rooms should have a ceiling-mounted radiographic unit with an automatic daylight processor to provide the best service for patients with major trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To explore Australian psychologists' perspectives on the psychological treatment of complex posttraumatic stress disorder in young women aged 18?25?years with a history of childhood maltreatment. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 psychologists from Melbourne, Australia experienced in the provision of psychological services to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment. Data were analysed thematically. Results Two overarching themes revealed the significance of (a) the need for psychologists to establish trust with young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in the therapy context and (b) the development of trust within young women's intra and interpersonal relationships as a baseline for further growth and recovery, which is facilitated by the trust which develops within the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion Qualitative studies of this kind provide valuable insight into the experiences and opinions of psychologists who provide treatment to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in their daily psychological practices. This study revealed that according to psychologist?participants, the development and facilitation of trust and the ability to trust others is a central goal of psychological treatment for young women with complex trauma.

AB  - Objective. To understand the experiences that people with early psychosis are adjusting to and their perceived barriers to recovery. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants. Grounded Theory was applied to the design and analysis. Sampling and coding ceased when saturation of the data was reached. Respondent validation was sought from participants. Results. A theoretical model was developed using Strauss and Corbin's (1998) framework. A core category of distress was elicited, which was evident in all participants? accounts of their recovery. Overall six main categories were identified and it was proposed that individuals were adjusting to the distress of past experiences, uncertainty, a challenged identity, being in a psychiatric system, the reaction of others and social disadvantage. Conclusions. Recovery from the distress and trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single experience or set of symptoms. The results are discussed in relation to trauma, developmental, and social inequality frameworks. Specific implications for clinical practice include incorporating the findings within formulations, developing interventions that focus on trauma, identity, and uncertainty as well as addressing the social and systemic issues identified. Practitioner Points ?? Recovery from early psychosis is multi-faceted. Psychological formulations should seek to consider individual, social, and systemic factors influencing an individual's distress to more fully conceptualize what an individual's adjustment to early psychosis may involve. ?? Services and wider systems should consider iatrogenic processes, which may contribute to and maintain the distress experienced by those with early psychosis. ?? Education programmes that look to contextualize psychosis within a meaningful framework may help to develop understanding within wider society where a lack of knowledge and understanding serves to reinforce an individual's sense of exclusion and difference.

AB  - Summary Inherited bleeding disorders affect between 1 in 1000 individuals for the most common disorder, von Willebrand Disease, to only 8 reported cases worldwide of alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency. Those with an identifiable abnormality can be divided into disorders of coagulation factors (87%), platelet count and function (8%) and the fibrinolytic system (3%). Of the patients registered in the UK with a bleeding disorder, the remaining 2% are unclassifiable. In addition to bleeding symptoms, patients with an inherited bleeding disorder can manifest other abnormalities, making an accurate and complete diagnosis that reflects the underlying molecular pathology important. Although some inherited bleeding disorders can still be easily diagnosed through a combination of careful clinical assessment and laboratory assays of varying degrees of complexity, there are many where conventional approaches are inadequate. Improvements in phenotyping assays have enhanced our diagnostic armoury but genotyping now offers the most accurate and complete diagnosis for some of these conditions. The advent of next generation sequencing technology has meant that many genes can now be analysed routinely in clinical practice. Here, we discuss the different diagnostic tools currently available for inherited bleeding disorders and suggest that genotyping should be incorporated at an early stage in the diagnostic pathway.

AB  - The members of many professional and occupational groups (e.g., emergency services, social services, psychology, and financial sector) can become affected by traumatic events occurring in the workplace. Currently, a range of methodologies and assessment instruments are used in the study of this area, making comparison between studies difficult, and raising issues relating to the validity and reliability of the instruments. Existing research in this area is also hampered by it being predominantly cross-sectional in nature. This paper discusses the issues that need to be dealt with in order to put the study of work-related psychological trauma on a firm theoretical foundation. The issues canvassed include establishing assessment instruments using sound psychometric principles: the need for normative data: the methodological implications of longitudinal, multi-wave research design; and evaluating change.

This paper systematically reviewed the literature on how trauma-focused CBTs have been applied and adapted cross-culturally. Method A systematic review of studies that discuss the process of cultural adaptation of trauma-focused CBTs. Results Seventeen papers were included and varied in the comprehensiveness of the adaptation process. Two studies stated that a theoretical framework was followed. Almost one-third of the studies did not report whether local stakeholders were involved in the process of application. Fifteen studies examined the efficacy of the adaptations and the results were positive, but the methodology and quality varied. Conclusion There are inconsistencies in how trauma-focused CBTs are culturally adapted. A systematic approach to the transportation of such therapies would enable greater investigation into the necessity and efficacy of such adaptations.

AB  - Background Echinococcosis is an uncommonly encountered zoonotic disease caused by the taeniid Echinococcus. The only endemic species in Australia, Echinococcus granulosus, forms cysts in the liver in 70% of cases. The aim of this study was to review the literature to provide an evidence-based narrative update on the diagnosis and management of hepatic cystic echinococcosis in Australia. Methods We reviewed the literature, utilizing multiple research databases and citation tracking. Original research and review articles examining the diagnosis and management of hydatid disease in adults, published prior to 2016 and in the English language were included in our review. Results Ultrasound is the gold-standard screening test, whilst computed tomography has a role in emergency presentations and screening for multi-organ involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred second-line imaging and better demonstrates biliary involvement. Medical therapy or PAIR (percutaneous aspiration, irrigation with scolicide and re-aspiration) may be appropriate in selected cases; however, surgery remains the definitive treatment for active, large (>5 cm), symptomatic or complicated cysts. A variety of surgical techniques have been described, including conservative, radical and minimally invasive procedures. There is currently no consensus approach; surgical modality should be tailored to patient factors, relevant anatomy, local facilities and surgeons? expertise. Conclusion Diagnosis and therapy in hepatic hydatid cysts have been significantly advanced by imaging, interventional radiology and surgical approaches in recent years. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for large, active, complicated or symptomatic hepatic hydatid cysts.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatized refugees with comorbid pain report more severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respond less well to PTSD-focused treatments and exhibit greater disability. A mutually maintaining relationship may exist between pain and PTSD, that may be partly accounted for by depression, but no prior studies have tested this assumption in traumatized refugees. Method Self-report measures of pain, PTSD, depression, disability, pain catastrophizing (PC) and trauma-related beliefs (TRBs) were administered to 197 refugees referred to the Danish Institute Against Torture (DIGNITY) prior to treatment. The contribution of pain, depression, PC, and TRBs to the overall variance in PTSD severity was examined. We also examined whether the relationship between pain and PTSD was mediated by PC and TRBs, after controlling for depression. Results Depression, pain severity, PC and TRBs together accounted for 66% of the overall variance in PTSD, with depression being the primary contributor (57%). In univariate tests, both PC and TRBs significantly mediated the relationship between pain interference/severity and PTSD. However, after controlling for depression only PC mediated this relationship. Conclusions Negative beliefs about pain and the trauma made small, but additive contributions to the relationship between pain and PTSD severity, after controlling for depression. Longitudinal studies with refugees, involving tests of more complex mutual maintenance models, are warranted. Significance After controlling for symptoms of depression, pain catastrophizing and negative trauma-related beliefs partly mediated the relationship between pain and PTSD in tortured refugees. The results suggest that all three variables are important in a mutual mediation model of pain and PTSD, and as targets for treatment, in traumatized refugees.

The present study sought to determine whether addicted and non-addicted schizophrenic patients are impaired differentially on the executive abilities of working memory and multi-tasking which are relevant for maintaining abstinence. Design? Comparisons of executive performance in clinical and control groups. Setting? In-patient setting. Participants? The cognitive profile of schizophrenic patients with and without comorbid substance abuse disorder was compared with that of patients suffering from major depression or alcoholism and healthy participants. Measurements? A range of cognitive tasks was used to assess: (i) the ability to update continuously context information in working memory and to use it for action selection; and (ii) the capacity to divide attention between different sensory input channels and to coordinate verbal and manual responses. Findings? Single-diagnosis schizophrenic patients showed pronounced impairments on measures of online maintenance and use of context information. Their ability to coordinate different sensory input channels (divided attention) was also impaired. Addicted schizophrenics showed evidence of impaired sensory input management and of reduced context sensitivity, when age differences were controlled. Conclusions? The present study indicates severe working memory and multi-tasking deficits in schizophrenia which are, however, not exacerbated by comorbid addiction.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) is a serious and life-threatening condition. Many diagnostic procedures and tests are being used to detect the site of bleeding with different success rates. The aim of our study is to prospectively evaluate accuracy of 64-slice multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) in the diagnosis of lower AGIB. Methods: Between September 2007 and January 2009, patients with presumed lower AGIB were referred to the radiology department of our institution for 64-slice MDCT examination as part of the investigation for the lower AGIB. Any abnormalities to account for bleeding, such as tumours, bowel wall enhancement and increased intraluminal density, were recorded. Results: Out of 139 patients with AGIB that were admitted to our casualty department, 27 patients (19 men and 8 women) in the age range of 24?88?years (mean age, 56?years) were suspected to have lower AGIB. Sixty-four-slice MDCT was performed and considered positive for bleeding in 19 (70%) cases, and in all the cases, the bleeding source was indentified in the arterial phase, showing a focal dense wall enhancement in 8 (42%) cases, circumferential wall enhancement in 4 (22%) cases and progressive increasing intraluminal density in 7 (36%) cases. The venous phase scan showed increased dispersion of the contrast within the lumen as an additional clue for active extravasation in 15 (79%) out of the 19 cases. Delayed 5-min scanning showed the same findings as venous phase in all the 19 positive cases and failed to depict any additional findings in the eight cases that were negative on arterial or venous phases. Conclusion: The study supports the high accuracy of 64-slice MDCT in locating the site of AGIB in patients thought to have a distal source of bleeding. Its accuracy in clinically proximal bleeding is not clear from this study, but MDCT is capable of showing such sources.

AB  - Abstract Of all patients in a hospital environment, trauma patients may be particularly at risk for developing (device-related) pressure ulcers (PUs), because of their traumatic injuries, immobility, and exposure to immobilizing and medical devices. Studies on device-related PUs are scarce. With this study, the incidence and characteristics of PUs and the proportion of PUs that are related to devices in adult trauma patients with suspected spinal injury were described. From January?December 2013, 254 trauma patients were visited every 2 days for skin assessment. The overall incidence of PUs was 28·3% (n = 72/254 patients). The incidence of device-related PUs was 20·1% (n = 51), and 13% (n = 33) developed solely device-related PUs. We observed 145 PUs in total of which 60·7% were related to devices (88/145). Device-related PUs were detected 16 different locations on the front and back of the body. These results show that the incidence of PUs and the proportion of device-related PUs is very high in trauma patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Cystoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of urological problems in man. Until recently its use in dogs was limited to rigid endoscopy in the bitch. With modern flexible fibre-optic instruments the majority of male dogs can also be examined without the need for surgical intervention. This paper describes the techniques used and the cystoscopic findings in a series of 38 clinical cases. In 24 of these, abnormal findings were present permitting a diagnosis to be made or confirmed. The potential for this technique as a diagnostic procedure is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To determine if clinically defined multi-impulsive bulimia (MIB) can be validated using an empirical classification approach. Method: One hundred and twenty-five women who met DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa were interviewed and completed a two-week EMA protocol. Participants who reported at least three highly impulsive behaviors were compared to participants who did not report such impulsive behavior. Also, Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted to determine if the MIB classification could be replicated empirically. Results: LCA produced a two-class solution consistent with the traditional clinical approach to MIB classification. In both approaches, MIB was associated with higher levels of anxiety disorders, child abuse, and daily self-damaging behaviors than the non-MIB class. Conclusion: Clinical classification of MIB was empirically supported through LCA. Although the classes failed to differ in bulimic behavior, MIB appears to represent a group of bulimic individuals with significant trauma histories and associated psychopathology. ? 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical features, imaging and angiographic findings of thirty four patients with cranial dural arteriovenous malformations and fistulae are presented in four groups. Group 1 ? Seven patients with anterior cavernous malformations, predominant superior ophthalmic vein drainage, and symptoms and signs of carotico-cavernous fistula. Group 2 ? Twelve patients with malformations of the superior petrosal, transverse and sigmoid sinus regions, presenting predominantly with bruit. Group 3 ? Seven patients with malformations of the basal sinuses and prominent cortical venous drainage, presenting with intracranial haemorrhage, headache and impaired cortical function. Intracranial haemorrhage never occured in the absence of cortical venous drainage. Group 4 ? Eight patients with infrequent manifestations. Group 1 and 2 patients are readily recognized and diagnosed. Group 3 and 4 patients are often misdiagnosed. Treatment modalities comprised embolisation therapy, surgical excision, and carotid compression. Twenty patients were treated by one or more of these modalities with a successful outcome in thirteen patients. Group 1 patients are the most amenable to trans-arterial embolisation. Carotid compression as the sole modality of treatment was successful in four patients. Unless the fistula is successfully closed, Group 3 patients and patients who present with cervical or thoracic myelopathy carry a grave prognosis. There is need for greater radiologist awareness of Group 3 and the rarer presentations, particularly myelopathy. With the exception of one patient, the morphological features of our cases are consistent with the now-accepted view that these lesions are acquired arterio-venous fistulae and not congential malformations.

AB  - The two leading causes of urinary incontinence in dogs are ureteral ectopia in juveniles and urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence in adults. While the accuracy of diagnosis of ectopic ureters has improved due to increased use of CT and/or cystoscopy, the diagnosis of urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence largely remains one of exclusion. New treatment options have been developed for both conditions, which have reduced morbidity and mortality, although the rate of long-term urinary continence has not significantly improved for either and neither has our understanding of the pathophysiology behind these failures. This review provides updates on the management of both of these conditions, with discussion of controversial areas and thoughts for future directions.
