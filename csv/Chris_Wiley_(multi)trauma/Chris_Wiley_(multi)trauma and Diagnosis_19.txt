AB  - Objectives To examine transitions that individuals with dementia experience longitudinally and to identify points of care when transitions are highest and the factors that contribute to those transitions. Design Population-based 10-year retrospective cohort study from 2000 to 2011. Setting General community. Participants All individuals aged 65 and older newly diagnosed with dementia in British Columbia, Canada. Measurements The frequency and timing of transitions over 10 years, participant characteristics associated with greater number of transitions, and the influence of recommended dementia care and high-quality primary care on number of transitions. Results Individuals experience a spike in transitions during the year of diagnosis, driven primarily by hospitalizations, despite accounting for end of life or newly moving to a long-term care facility (LTCF). This occurs regardless of survival time or care location. Regardless of survival time, individuals not in LTCFs experience a marked increase in hospitalizations in the year before and the year of death, often exceeding hospitalizations in the year of diagnosis. Receipt of recommended dementia care and receipt of high-quality primary care were independently associated with fewer transitions across care settings. Conclusion The spike in transitions in the year of diagnosis highlights a distressing period for individuals with dementia during which unwanted or unnecessary transitions might occur and suggests a useful target for interventions. There is an association between recommended dementia care and outcomes and evidence of the continued value of high-quality primary care in a complex population at a critical point when gaps in continuity are especially likely.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical features, imaging and angiographic findings of thirty four patients with cranial dural arteriovenous malformations and fistulae are presented in four groups. Group 1 ? Seven patients with anterior cavernous malformations, predominant superior ophthalmic vein drainage, and symptoms and signs of carotico-cavernous fistula. Group 2 ? Twelve patients with malformations of the superior petrosal, transverse and sigmoid sinus regions, presenting predominantly with bruit. Group 3 ? Seven patients with malformations of the basal sinuses and prominent cortical venous drainage, presenting with intracranial haemorrhage, headache and impaired cortical function. Intracranial haemorrhage never occured in the absence of cortical venous drainage. Group 4 ? Eight patients with infrequent manifestations. Group 1 and 2 patients are readily recognized and diagnosed. Group 3 and 4 patients are often misdiagnosed. Treatment modalities comprised embolisation therapy, surgical excision, and carotid compression. Twenty patients were treated by one or more of these modalities with a successful outcome in thirteen patients. Group 1 patients are the most amenable to trans-arterial embolisation. Carotid compression as the sole modality of treatment was successful in four patients. Unless the fistula is successfully closed, Group 3 patients and patients who present with cervical or thoracic myelopathy carry a grave prognosis. There is need for greater radiologist awareness of Group 3 and the rarer presentations, particularly myelopathy. With the exception of one patient, the morphological features of our cases are consistent with the now-accepted view that these lesions are acquired arterio-venous fistulae and not congential malformations.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a pilot study of a 1-year multi-modal treatment for incest survivors, incorporating individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. The treatment was designed to provide a therapeutic context in which the affective intensity and meaning originally attached to the traumatic experience could be tolerated, and in which a thoughtful, reflective construction of the impact of the trauma could be developed. PTSD symptoms decreased in all participants, with all but one no longer meeting the diagnosis at post-treatment and follow-up. Using a narrative methodology, maladaptive schemas and overwhelming affects, ?trauma themes?, were also assessed to understand the survivors' views about themselves, others and the world around them. Participants demonstrated a steady pattern of improvement in the resolution of trauma themes. A discussion of the complex posttraumatic response to incest is included, as is a brief description of the treatment.

AB  - The two leading causes of urinary incontinence in dogs are ureteral ectopia in juveniles and urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence in adults. While the accuracy of diagnosis of ectopic ureters has improved due to increased use of CT and/or cystoscopy, the diagnosis of urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence largely remains one of exclusion. New treatment options have been developed for both conditions, which have reduced morbidity and mortality, although the rate of long-term urinary continence has not significantly improved for either and neither has our understanding of the pathophysiology behind these failures. This review provides updates on the management of both of these conditions, with discussion of controversial areas and thoughts for future directions.

AB  - Abstract. This report from the first International Course on Integrated Biomarkers, Biochemical and Bioimaging Endpoints in Cardiovascular Diagnosis, Prevention, Therapy and Drug Development provides the basis for optimizing diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic information in four areas of cardiovascular medicine: primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure and stroke. Risk stratification and treatment strategies can be refined and enhanced through integration of bioimaging and biochemical markers to characterize sub-clinical and clinical atherosclerosis. For the integrative approach to be useful, each of the biomarkers must be validated and cost-effective. Clinical decision is the primary level of integration and is based on clinical evaluation and the use of a combination of bioimaging and biochemical markers. The decision to initiate preventive or therapeutic intervention must take into account the factors affecting the levels of expression of the biomarker and the potential input the biomarker has on metabolic processes or modulation of other biomarkers. The optimal approach to intervention must take into consideration the risk?benefit and cost?effectiveness ratios.

AB  - Abstract Objective The goal of the present study was to compare the diagnostic yield of weight-bearing radiographs with non-weight-bearing computed tomography (CT) scan for subtle Lisfranc (LF) injuries in the ED. Methods Retrospective analysis of patients presenting with a suspected LF injury over a 2 year period from 2016 to 2017 who had both weight-bearing bilateral foot radiographs and CT scan. Information extracted included patient demographics, radiographic findings of metatarsal fractures, fleck sign and measurements of diastasis between the medial cuneiform and second metatarsal expressed as a ratio of the uninjured side, clinical findings and treatment modality. Radiologist reports were recorded as either positive, negative or equivocal for a LF injury. Results A total of 117 patients were included with a mean age of 38?years and 54% (n?=?63) women. When initial weight-bearing radiographs were positive, 54% of subsequent CT scans were reported as either equivocal or negative. Of the patients who had a negative or equivocal weight-bearing radiograph, only 12% had a positive CT scan. The mean diastasis ratio in patients undergoing surgery was 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.41?1.65) compared to 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.07?1.16) for patients with injuries not requiring operative intervention (P?<?0.001). There was a statistically significant correlation between a positive weight-bearing radiograph and surgical treatment (R?=?0.339, P?<?0.001), and between diastasis measurements and surgical treatment (R?=?0.576, P?<?0.001). Conclusions CT provides limited benefit in the diagnosis and initial management of suspected subtle LF injuries in the ED. We advocate for the use of bilateral weight-bearing radiographs as a first-line investigation.

AB  - Objective:? This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a four-session, caregiver?child Intervention, the Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI), to prevent the development of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) provided within 30 days of exposure to a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Method:? One-hundred seventy-six 7 to 17-year-old youth were recruited through telephone screening based on report of one new distressing posttraumatic stress symptom after a PTE. Of those, 106 youth were randomly assigned to the Intervention (n = 53) or a four-session supportive Comparison condition (N = 53). Group differences in symptom severity were assessed using repeated measures with mixed effects models of intervention group, time, and the interaction of intervention and time. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess treatment condition and any subsequent traumas experienced as predictors for full and partial PTSD diagnosis at 3-month follow-up. An exploratory chi-square analysis was performed to examine the differences in PTSD symptom criteria B, C, and D at follow-up. Results:? At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, past trauma exposures and symptom severity. At follow-up, the Intervention group demonstrated significantly fewer full and partial PTSD diagnoses than the Comparison group on a standardized diagnostic measure of PTSD. Also, there was a significant group by time interaction for Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children?s Posttraumatic Stress and Anxiety Indices as the CFTSI group had significantly lower posttraumatic and anxiety scores than the Comparison group. Conclusions:? The results suggest that a caregiver?youth, brief preventative early intervention for youth exposed to a PTE is a promising approach to preventing chronic PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pancreaticoduodenal trauma (PDT) is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. In this study, contemporary trends were analysed using national data. Methods The Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 1998?2009 was queried for patients with PDT. Interventions including any operation (Any-Op) and pancreas-specific surgery (PSURG) were identified. Trends in treatment and outcomes were determined [complications, length of stay (LoS), mortality] for the Any-Op, PSURG and non-operative (Non-Op) groups. Analyses included chi-squared tests, Cochran?Armitage trend tests and logistic regression. Results A total of 27?216 patients (nationally weighted) with PDT were identified. Over time, the frequency of PDT increased by 8.3%, whereas the proportion of patients submitted to PSURG declined (from 21.7% to 19.8%; P = 0.0004) and the percentage of patients submitted to non-operative management increased (from 56.7% to 59.1%; P = 0.01). In the Non-Op group, mortality decreased from 9.7% to 8.6% (P < 0.001); morbidity and LoS remained unchanged at ?40% and ?12 days, respectively. In the PSURG group, mortality remained stable at ?15%, complications increased from 50.2% to 71.8% (P < 0.0001) and LoS remained stable at ?21 days. For all PDT patients, significant independent predictors of mortality included: the presence of combined pancreatic and duodenal injuries; penetrating trauma, and age >50 years. Having any operation (Any-Op) was associated with mortality, but PSURG was not a predictor of death. Conclusions The utilization of operations for PDT has declined without affecting mortality, but operative morbidity increased significantly over the 12 years to 2009. The development of an evidence-based approach to invasive manoeuvres and an early multidisciplinary approach involving pancreatic surgeons may improve outcomes in patients with these morbid injuries.

AB  - Abstract The sociology of diagnosis offers a vantage point from which to study health and illness, linking a number of other threads of sociological thought. While there has been a growing interest in diagnosis since Mildred Blaxter's suggestion for a sociological exploration in 1978 ? a call echoed by Brown in 1990 ? it is timely to reflect upon the way in which sociologists engage with diagnosis. Within this review essay, I first consider what it is to ?be a sociology? in general terms. I then explore the implications of this for an effective sociology of diagnosis, discussing the priorities it has recently developed as well as the directions its scholars might consider. Finally, I suggest ways in which sociologists of diagnosis could broaden their approach in order to advance their understanding of health, illness, and medicine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the experience of three highly specialized centres in the vascular evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) in teenagers, as there is little information on this topic, and although clinical guidelines support the use of vascular studies in selected cases, our experience is that vascular evaluation aimed at diagnosing organic ED is uncommon in teenagers, and most are designated as having psychogenic ED. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a retrospective multi-institutional analysis of three ED databases (1998?2003) we assessed males aged ≤19?years presenting with ED. The review of these databases focused on demographic characteristics, risk factors for ED, erectile function, results of vascular evaluation, and the causes of ED. RESULTS In all, 40 males aged 14?19?years were identified. The mean (range) duration of ED at presentation was 22.6?(4?84)?months. The major risk factors for ED were antecedent perineal trauma (37%) and penile trauma or surgery (15%). The mean (sd) International Index of Erectile Function ?erectile function? domain score was 15?(4). Information obtained by history taking was not predictive of the cause of ED. Vascular studies were performed in 62% of the patients and 48% of these patients were found to have an underlying vascular pathology; 42% of the latter group were found to be possible candidates for surgical intervention and another 16% needed further angiographic evaluation. CONCLUSION ED in teenagers should not be routinely categorized as psychogenic without an adequate vascular evaluation, as a significant percentage have abnormal erectile haemodynamics consistent with vasculogenic ED.

AB  - Abstract Our contribution to this special issue focuses on the phenomenon of intrusive trauma memory. While intrusive trauma memories can undoubtedly cause impairment, we argue that they may exist for a potentially adaptive reason. Theory and experimental research on intrusion development are reviewed and possible functions of intrusive trauma memory are explored. These functions include aiding emotional processing, preventing future harm and protecting the coherence of the self. The issue of intrusive images in other disorders than posttraumatic stress disorder is briefly addressed. This review suggests that the study of function is important for a nuanced view on the modulation of intrusive trauma memory in both experimental psychopathology and clinical treatment.

AB  - Surprisingly often in the psychoanalyses of chronically depressed patients, depression represents an unconscious attempt to psychically cope with unbearable psychic pain following severe traumatisation: dissociative states, a chronified psychic state of shock, a disappearance of emotions, an emptying of the self and the object relationships, as well as a disappearance of the psyche in the body are among the possible consequences. The treatment of these difficult groups of analysands can also frequently bring analysts to the limits of the endurable. Often related to this is the repeated danger of denying the trauma, and a re-traumatisation of the analysand in the analytic situation. The lecture discusses the fact that in comparison with other therapeutic approaches, psychoanalysis has a highly differentiated conceptualisation of the psychic determinants and the treatment of chronic depression at his disposal. However, in order to retain its creativity and innovation as a scientific discipline and to be thus perceived in the non-psychoanalytic world, it must constantly further develop its conceptualization by way of systematic and extra-clinical research ? as is witnessed in the insufficient conceptual account of severe traumatisation during the genesis of chronic depression. In this connection, several exemplary examples from extra-clinical studies in the sphere of psychotherapeutic research, neurobiology, epigenetics and embodied cognitive science will be accounted for. As will be treated in the final part of this paper, of no less importance are the conceptualizations in clinical research on psychoanalysis, which are based on meticulous, careful analyses of trauma reactivation in the transference, and understanding and working through them in the analytic relationship.

AB  - Summary.? Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background Malnutrition is a potentially remediable condition that when untreated contributes to poor health and economic outcomes. While assessment of malnutrition risk is improving, its identification rate and economic burden in Emergency Departments (EDs) is largely unknown. We sought to determine prevalence and economic burden of diagnosed malnutrition among patients presenting to United States (US) EDs. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of Healthcare Cost and Utilization (HCUP) Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) data. Malnutrition prevalence was confirmed via International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, diagnosis codes. The economic burden was assessed by comparing probability of hospitalization and the average total charges between propensity-score matched visits with and without a malnutrition diagnosis. Results Data from 238 million ED visits between 2006 and 2014 were analyzed. Over this period, the prevalence of diagnosed malnutrition increased for all demographic categories assessed. For older adults (≥ 65 years), the prevalence increased from 2.5% (2006) to 3.6% (2014). Older age, high-income community residence, Western region, urban areas, and Medicare coverage were associated with higher diagnosis prevalence. Malnutrition diagnosis was associated with a 4.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.93, 4.55) times higher odds of hospitalization and $21,892higher mean total charges (95% CI: $19,593, $24,192). Conclusion While malnutrition is currently diagnosed at a low rate in US EDs, the economic burden of malnutrition is substantial in this care setting. Given the potential for systematic malnutrition screening and treatment protocols to alleviate this burden, future research is warranted.

Methods: A total of 901 consecutive patients (aged 9?92 years old) with inducible sustained AVNRT underwent RFA of the slow pathway. All procedures were closely monitored for appearance of catheter-induced mechanical block of fast or slow pathways. Results: Catheter-induced mechanical trauma to fast and/or slow pathways was observed in 121 (13.4%) patients: 86 (71%) patients had trauma of the fast pathway, three (2.4%) had trauma of the slow pathway, and 32 (26.4%) had trauma of both pathways. Mechanical trauma lasted <1 minute in 87 (72%) patients, 1?30 minutes in 23 (19%) and >30 minutes in 11 (9%). A significantly increased procedure discontinuation rate was observed in patients with mechanical trauma as compared to those with no trauma (P < 0.0001). Young patient age (<35) was a strong predictor for the occurrence of mechanical trauma to AV nodal pathways. No significant difference between the trauma and non-trauma groups was found in respect to the number of catheters used during the procedure, the incidence of AV block, and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. Conclusions: Mechanical trauma to fast and slow pathways during ablation of AVNRT is more common than previously recognized, occurring especially in patients aged <35 years.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: We present a protocol for the non-invasive angiographic assessment of the arterial and venous cerebrovascular (CV) system by multi-slice CT. Material and Methods: Data acquisition was performed in a multi-slice CT scanner with a scan range from the carotid bifurcation to the vertex and manual scan start following i.v. administration of 120 ml iodinated contrast medium with a flow rate of 4 ml/s. This protocol was applied in 12 patients with symptoms of acute CV insuffiency. Results: In all patients, comprehensive imaging of the arteriovenous CV system was achieved including the common carotid bifurcation, the third segment of the major cerebral arteries, the dural sinus and the internal cerebral veins. Various CV pathologies, such as a territorial artery occlusion, a thrombotic obstruction of the internal carotid artery, an intracranial arteriovenous malformation and a sinus vein thrombosis, were successfully evaluated. Conclusion: Comprehensive assessment of the arteriovenous CV system is possible by the use of a single-bolus, monophasic multi-slice scan technique.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of paratracheal air cysts (PACs), their correlation with different lung diseases and their connection with the trachea by chest multi detector computed tomography (MDCT). Methods We retrospectively reviewed chest MDCT images of 8240 consecutive patients obtained from January 2010 to December 2011 with a 16-detector multi-detector CT scanner. PACs were assessed for prevalence, location, level, size and the presence of visible communication with the trachea. MDCT diagnoses were classified as normal, primary or metastatic malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and other lung diseases. We randomly selected 330 patients who had no visible PACs for the control group. We evaluated the associations between patients' demographic findings (age and sex), MDCT findings of lung and the presence of PACs. The findings of the PACs and control groups were compared. Statistical analysis used chi-squared test and Mann?Whitney U-test for evaluation. Results PACs were presented in 301 patients (4%); 204 men and 97 women, ranging in age from 14 to 91 years (median?=?57 years). There was no significant difference in the presence of PACs by age (P?>?0.05). Male subjects showed higher prevalence (P?=?0.005). Fifty PACs (16.6%) showed communication with the trachea or main bronchus. Although the relation between COPD and PACs was statistically significant (P?<?0.001), there was no relation between primary or metastatic malignancies, pneumonia and other lung diseases and PACs. Conclusion PACs are common in MDCT and should not be misdiagnosed as pneumomediastinum. It should be kept in mind that PACs may be associated with COPD.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Gastric ulceration is an important cause of morbidity in horses. Currently, gastroscopy is the only reliable antemortem method for definitive diagnosis; however, it is unsuitable as a screening test because it is expensive, invasive and time-consuming. Sucrose permeability testing represents a simple, economical, non-invasive alternative to gastroscopy for screening purposes, and the feasibility of this approach in the horse has been reported [1]. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose as a screening test for gastric ulceration. Study design Cross-sectional design. Methods One hundred and one adult horses with and without naturally occurring gastric ulcers were studied. The diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose for detection of gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min after administration of 1?g/kg bwt of sucrose via nasogastric intubation was assessed with ROC curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Sucrose concentration in blood was compared with gastroscopy as the gold standard; and sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were calculated across a range of sucrose concentrations. Cut-off values were selected manually to optimise sensitivity. Results The prevalence of gastric ulcers was 83%. The AUC?±?95% CI for blood sucrose concentration when used to distinguish between horses with and without gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min was 0.592 (0.441?0.744) and 0.615 (0.469?0.761) respectively. Sucrose concentrations of 4.70??mol/l at 45?min; and 4.57??mol/l at 90?min were selected as optimal cut-offs. Using these cut-offs, Se ranged from 64.4% to 77%; and Sp ranged from 42.9% to 50%. Conclusions Blood sucrose is neither a sensitive nor specific test for detecting gastric ulcers in adult horses with naturally occurring ulcers.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Correlate the necropsy diagnosis with the history, diagnostic findings, and clinical course of dyspneic cats with primary lung parenchymal disease. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Animals: Client-owned cats over 6 months of age hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a primary problem of respiratory distress that had pulmonary parenchymal disease on thoracic radiographs, and a complete necropsy. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Cats included were assigned into 2 groups based on the pulmonary histopathology: inflammatory (n=8) and neoplastic (n=7) disease. No statistical difference was found between the groups with regard to age, body weight, clinical signs, duration of clinical signs, physical examination findings, thoracic radiography, duration of hospitalization, treatment, and outcome. Cats with neoplasia had a statistically higher mean total white blood cell count (26.60?k/?L±10.41) than those with inflammatory lung disease (11.59?k/?L±4.49; P=0.026). Cats with bacterial or viral pulmonary disease had a significantly shorter median duration of illness (5 days, range 1?7 days) than all other cats (30 days, range 7?365 days; P=0.0042). Ultrasound guided pulmonary fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provided an accurate diagnosis in 5/5 cases. Conclusions: Forty-seven percent of cats with pulmonary parenchymal disease had neoplasia. The clinical diagnosis was difficult to obtain ante-mortem; lung FNA appeared to be the most helpful diagnostic tool in these cases.
