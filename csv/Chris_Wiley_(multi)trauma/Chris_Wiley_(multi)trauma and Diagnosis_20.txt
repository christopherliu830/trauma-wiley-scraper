AB  - Abstract Self-injurious behavior(SIB) in individuals with mental retardation is a severe behavioral disorder that has significant social and medical consequences. Although considerable research evidence indicates that SIB can be maintained by either environmental contingencies or biologic conditions, integrative diagnostic and treatment models have yet to be developed. We have piloted a bio-behavioral diagnostic and treatment model to classify and subtype cases of SIB, leading to the selection of specific behavioral or pharmacologic treatments. A functional analysis defines SIB as operant, possibly biologic, or mixed operant and possibly biologic. Subtyping within these classes is based on the delineation of specific operant functions and the clinical characteristics of the individual patient. Our preliminary research suggests that this empirical decision-making model can lead to specific treatments that are effective and that reduce the incidence of nonresponders to behavioral intervention and medication. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Dementia is an acquired disorder of the brain, designating an impairment of established mental functions due to various aetiologies, representing a decline from pre-morbid level which is severe enough to impair normal daily functioning. Classification of dementias is commonly based on individual aetiological categories, more recently molecular-pathological classifications have been proposed for degenerative dementias. This article is an attempt to provide a comprehensive, yet simplified classification of dementias following a mechanism-based approach. A systematic approach to diagnostic work-up is also proposed based on this classification.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the impact of postdischarge surveillance on surgical site infection (SSI) diagnosis. Study design Prospective enrollment with retrospective case review Sample Population Dogs and cats (n?=?1271) undergoing surgery April 2012-November 2013. Methods The medical record of each animal was reviewed and a 30-day follow-up questionnaire was sent to each pet owner. A standardized definition of SSI was used to identify all animals with SSI. The method of SSI detection was recorded as: re-presentation to the hospital, scheduled recheck, questionnaire, communication with the referring veterinarian, or a combination of the above. Results SSI was identified in 36 (2.83%) of the 1271 animals included. All SSIs were diagnosed after discharge from the hospital. Seven of the 36 animals with SSI were diagnosed at re-presentation to the hospital, 5/36 at scheduled recheck, 10/36 on questionnaire, 10/36 at re-presentation to the hospital AND on questionnaire, and 4/36 on communication with referring veterinarian. Of the diagnosed SSIs, 72.2% were documented in the medical record. Therefore, without active postdischarge surveillance, 10/36 SSIs (27.8%) would have gone unknown to surgeons at our institution. Conclusion Understanding the incidence of SSI with feedback to surgeons is an important aspect of an infection control program and has been shown to reduce SSI risks. Without active postoperative surveillance, 27.8% of SSIs would have gone unknown to surgeons. Implementing active surveillance will allow accurate reporting of incidence of SSIs in veterinary hospitals.

AB  - Abstract: The methods adopted in the appraisal of the trauma of three communities after different disasters in the South Pacific are described and discussed. The outcome affirms the need for non-indigenous clinicians to be ready to adjust their concepts and methods to suit the cultural frameworks they encounter when they are invited abroad, and for local health professionals to be ready to share their knowledge and skills with their collegues from abroad. The outcome, it is argued, should improve the quality of service provided at all stages of disaster recovery, and still enable questions to be raised about matters of fundamental concern ? such as the power of religious belief and of social justice in the process of healing. These questions were found to be of particular importance in the context of the South Pacific cultures.

AB  - Objective The identification of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among natural disaster survivors is remarkably challenging, and there are no reliable objective signatures that can be used to assist clinical diagnosis and optimize treatment. The current study aimed to establish a neurobiological signature of PTSD from the connectivity of large-scale brain networks and clarify the brain network mechanisms of PTSD. Methods We examined fifty-seven unmedicated survivors with chronic PTSD and 59 matched trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We extracted the node-to-network connectivity and obtained a feature vector with a dimensionality of 864 (108 nodes ? 8 networks) to represent each subject?s functional connectivity (FC) profile. Multivariate pattern analysis with a relevance vector machine was then used to distinguish PTSD patients from TEHCs. Results We achieved a promising diagnostic accuracy of 89.2% in distinguishing PTSD patients from TEHCs. The most heavily weighted connections for PTSD classification were among the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VIS), somatomotor network, limbic network, and dorsal attention network (DAN). The strength of the anticorrelation of FC between the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in DMN and the VIS and DAN was associated with the severity of PTSD. Conclusions This study achieved relatively high accuracy in classifying PTSD patients vs. TEHCs at the individual level. This performance demonstrates that rs-fMRI-derived multivariate classification based on large-scale brain networks can provide potential signatures both to facilitate clinical diagnosis and to clarify the underlying brain network mechanisms of PTSD caused by natural disasters.

AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.

AB  - A 24-week-old dog was presented with recurrent rectal prolapse because of colonic duplication. Colonic duplication is an extremely uncommon congenital abnormality, with only six cases reported in veterinary medicine, one diagnosed at necropsy and five after barium enema, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy either alone or in combination. In this case, these techniques failed to identify the abnormality and diagnosis was ultimately achieved via negative contrast computed tomography. The evaluation generated by the computed tomography images allowed a refined surgical approach. To the authors? knowledge, negative contrast computed tomography has not yet been reported in the veterinary literature to diagnose gastrointestinal pathologies. Colonic duplication in this case was treated by removal of the intercolonic septum via colotomy.

AB  - Abstract: Liver transplantation (LTx) in children currently offers long-term survival rates of more than 80%. Many causes for Tx failure have been identified. However, the incidence and impact of multi-organ system failure (MOSF) are, to date, unknown. Therefore, in this study the role of MOSF after LTx in children was investigated with regard to outcome. The data of 114 children (53 girls, 61 boys; median age 4.3?yr) after first LTx were evaluated retrospectively. The definition of MOSF, as used by Wilkinson et al. [Crit Care Med 1986: 14: 271?274], was modified with regard to age-adjusted values. The influence of MOSF on patient survival was investigated by Kaplan?Meier analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Thirty-one of 114 children with orthotopic LTx developed MOSF (involving two or more organs). In total, 18 children died (15.8%) during the hospitalization; 16 of these had MOSF. Mortality related to two-organ failure was 29.4% (n?=?5), to three-organ failure 78% (n?=?7), and to four-organ failure 80% (n?=?4). The highest mortality rates were observed in children with central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular failure, leading to a decreased probability of survival of 0.40 (p <?0.0001). Multi-variate analysis showed that CNS and cardiovascular failure were the most important risk factors for survival (p <?0.0001 and 0.056, respectively). Respiratory and renal failure, in univariate analysis, were significant contributors to poor survival, but had no statistically significant influence on outcome in multivariate analysis. Bone marrow insufficiency was found to have no influence on survival in either analysis. In multivariate analysis, the risk of development of MOSF was significantly increased by high numbers of transfused units of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), the absence of rejection episodes, or a high bilirubin level prior to Tx. Hence, MOSF is a major factor contributing to the death of children early after LTx. CNS and cardiovascular failure carried the highest risk for a poor outcome. Other risk factors associated with the development of MOSF were: numbers of transfused units of FFP, absence of rejection episodes, and a high pre-Tx bilirubin level.

AB  - Abstract Lipoblastomas are rare benign tumors of white fatty tissue that occur primarily in young children. Occasionally, heterogeneity of morphological appearance and histological overlap with other lipogenic tumors are described. In such cases fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of PLAG1, a gene specifically rearranged in lipoblastoma, is necessary to prevent misdiagnosis. We present a case of lipoblastoma arising in an atypical site with histological features characteristic of lipoma. The correct diagnosis was made possible on cytogenetic grounds through the identification of the characteristic PLAG1-HAS2 fusion gene, thus allowing an appropriate clinical approach.

The aim of this work was twofold: to evaluate the prevalence of different Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) diagnosis in an Italian population of subjects seeking TMD treatment in a tertiary clinic; and to compare data with those from similar studies in the literature. Participants in this study were 433 consecutive patients seeking TMD treatment at the Section of Prosthetic Dentistry, Department of Neuroscience, University of Pisa, Italy; mean age of patients was 38·8?years, with a female:male ratio of 2·6:1 (276 females, 73·2%; 101 males, 26·8%). RDC/TMD guidelines for examination were adopted to assign axis I diagnosis. The prevalence of RDC/TMD diagnoses was 38·2% (144/377) for group I disorders (muscle disorders), 52·3% (197/377) for group II disorders (disc displacements), and 52·6% (198/377) for group III disorders (arthralgia, osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis). The present investigation provided findings that, compared and integrated with literature data, can be useful to create a world-wide database, in accordance with the nature of the RDC/TMD classification system.

AB  - Abstract Our objectives are to quickly interpret symptoms of emergency patients to identify likely syndromes and to improve population-wide disease outbreak detection. We constructed a database of 248 syndromes, each syndrome having an estimated probability of producing any of 85 symptoms, with some two-way, three-way, and five-way probabilities reflecting correlations among symptoms. Using these multi-way probabilities in conjunction with an iterative proportional fitting algorithm allows estimation of full conditional probabilities. Combining these conditional probabilities with misdiagnosis error rates and incidence rates via Bayes theorem, the probability of each syndrome is estimated. We tested a prototype of computer-aided differential diagnosis (CADDY) on simulated data and on more than 100 real cases, including West Nile Virus, Q fever, SARS, anthrax, plague, tularaemia and toxic shock cases. We conclude that: (1) it is important to determine whether the unrecorded positive status of a symptom means that the status is negative or that the status is unknown; (2) inclusion of misdiagnosis error rates produces more realistic results; (3) the naive Bayes classifier, which assumes all symptoms behave independently, is slightly outperformed by CADDY, which includes available multi-symptom information on correlations; as more information regarding symptom correlations becomes available, the advantage of CADDY over the naive Bayes classifier should increase; (4) overlooking low-probability, high-consequence events is less likely if the standard output summary is augmented with a list of rare syndromes that are consistent with observed symptoms, and (5) accumulating patient-level probabilities across a larger population can aid in biosurveillance for disease outbreaks.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Effective diagnosis of equine laminitis is necessary to allow prompt instigation of palliative and therapeutic treatments, yet there has been limited work regarding diagnostic accuracy. Objectives To compare the prevalence of clinical signs in laminitis and non-laminitis lamenesses to evaluate the capabilities of discrimination for differential diagnosis. Study design Analytical epidemiological study. Methods Veterinary practitioners completed a pre-designed checklist of laminitis-associated clinical signs identified by literature review, for equine lameness of any origin. A case was defined as a horse/pony with veterinary-diagnosed, clinically apparent laminitis, attended by a participating practitioner. Associations between clinical signs and case/control status were tested by logistic regression with adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with veterinary practice as a fixed effect, and Wald P-value calculated. Multivariable analysis using graphical classification tree-based statistical models allowed comprehension of the prevalence in the data associated with particular clusters of clinical signs. Results Data were collected for 588 laminitis cases and 201 non-laminitis lamenesses. The overall prevalence of specific clinical signs ranged from 2.7% for ?sole prolapse? to 85.0% for ?lame at trot?. Differences in prevalence ranged from ?14.1% for ?lame at trot? (more common in controls) to +71.9% for ?short stilted gait at walk? (more common in cases). Five clinical signs had a difference in prevalence of greater than +50%: ?reluctance to walk?, ?short, stilted gait at walk?, ?difficulty turning?, ?shifting weight? and ?increased digital pulse?. Bilateral forelimb lameness was the best discriminator (92% of animals with this clinical sign had laminitis). The additional presence of increased digital pulses improved this to 99%. Flat/convex sole, shifting weight and short stilted gait at walk were also useful discriminators. Conclusions This is the first study to provide information aiding diagnostic hypothetico-deductive reasoning based on clinical signs to differentially diagnose laminitis from other lamenesses. Ethical animal research:?Ethical approval obtained from Royal Veterinary College. Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Project funded by World Horse Welfare. C.E. Wylie currently funded by The Margaret Giffen Charitable Trust. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract Research diagnostic interviews need to discriminate between closely related disorders in order to allow comorbidity among mental disorders to be studied reliably. Yet conventional studies of diagnostic validity generally focus on single disorders and do not examine discriminant validity. The current study examines the validity of fully-structured diagnoses of closely-related distress disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, and dysthymic disorder) in the lay-administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI) with independent clinical diagnoses based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A). The NCS-A is a national survey of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) among 10,148 adolescents. A probability sub-sample of 347 of these adolescents and their parents were administered blinded follow-up K-SADS interviews. Good concordance [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)] was found between diagnoses based on the CIDI and the K-SADS for generalized anxiety disorder (AUC?=?0.78), post-traumatic stress disorder (AUC?=?0.79), and major depressive episode/dysthymic disorder (AUC?=?0.86). Further, the CIDI was able to effectively discriminate among different types of distress disorders in the sub-sample of respondents with any distress disorder.

AB  - SUMMARY Two cases of scurvy diagnosed following presentation with a purpuric rash are presented. A 44-year-old man developed scurvy as a result of poor dietary intake of vitamin C. This occurred because of a number of factors. including poor dentition, diarrhoea, depression and benzodiazepine/narcotic dependence. A 69-year-old man with acute myeloid leukaemic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome developed mucositis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as complications of chemotherapy. This led to poor dietary intake and consequently scurvy. Both cases demonstrated specific and diagnostic cutaneous manifestations of scurvy, particularly perifollicular purpura, ecchymoses and coiled corkscrew hairs. The diagnosis was supported by specific diet history. Ascorbic acid tolerance test was used as a simple laboratory method to confirm the clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Summary The main approaches to the classification of mental disorders put forward by GPs are described, and contrasted with those suggested by psychiatrists, and adapted to the conditions of primary care. Some differences exist between the kinds of disorder seen in the two settings, especially the comorbidity with physical illness in primary care. Classifications should be derived from existing nosologies by a process of condensation and simplification, although the psychiatrist's concept of ?somatoform disorder? is a far cry from the GP's necessary concept of ?unexplained somatic symptoms?. Special problems of classification at each end of the life cycle are described, and the importance of assessing the disability associated with mental disorders. The form and structure of common mental disorders in primary care does not vary widely across countries or cultures, although inevitably there are local variations in prevalence. The sheer size of the problem in primary care necessitates special training not just for medical officers but also for all other primary care staff.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the value of different magnetic resonance sequences in the detection of brain lesions in dogs with multi-focal intracranial neurolocalised lesions and abnormal cisternal cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Methods: T2-weighted, T1-weighted, T1-weighted-Gd, FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) images of 73 dogs with multi-focal intracranial localised lesions were reviewed retrospectively. Control dogs (19) were selected on the basis of normal neurological examination, magnetic resonance images and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Two board-certified radiologists blindly reviewed the magnetic resonance images. Magnetic resonance sequence sensitivities were compared using the chi-squared test and logistic regression, accounting for clustering at the patient level. Statistical significance was set at the 5 per cent level. Results: The FLAIR sequence was found to have the highest sensitivity (84 per cent, 61 of 73), followed by T2-weighted (63 per cent, 46 of 73), T1-weighted postcontrast (62 per cent, 45 of 73) and T1-weighted (23 per cent, 17 of 73) (P<0·001). FLAIR images were 106·1 times (95 per cent confidence interval 25·2 to 447·5) more likely to correctly identify cerebrospinal fluid-positive patients than T1-weighted, 6·4 times (95 per cent confidence interval 2·2 to 18·2) than T1-weighted postcontrast and 5·8 times (95 per cent confidence interval 2·0 to 16·4) than T2-weighted. FLAIR identified 14 per cent of cases that were classified as normal based on the three others sequences. Clinical Significance: Routine use of FLAIR sequence should be encouraged in dogs undergoing a brain magnetic resonance imaging and probably more specifically in cases of suspected inflammatory brain disease.
