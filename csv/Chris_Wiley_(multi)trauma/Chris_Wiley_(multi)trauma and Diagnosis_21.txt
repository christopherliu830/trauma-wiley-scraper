AB  - Objectives To report surgical technique, intra- and post-operative complications, and short- and long-term outcome following canine hepatobiliary surgery in which exposure of intra-abdominal hepatobiliary lesions was aided by diaphragmotomy. Materials and Methods Clinical records from four multi-disciplinary UK-based small animal referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed for dogs in which diaphragmotomy was performed between January 2014 and May 2019. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery performed, diaphragmotomy technique, management of diaphragmotomy and pneumothorax, intra- and post-operative complications, short-term outcome and long-term outcome were recorded. Results Thirty-one cases were identified. The most common hepatobiliary surgeries performed alongside diaphragmotomy were single hepatic lobectomy (14/31) and cholecystectomy (11/31). The most common diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma (10/31), gall bladder mucocoele (7/31) and hepatic nodular hyperplasia (4/31). Peri-operative mortality rate was 9.7% (3/31 cases) though none of these deaths were considered attributable to diaphragmotomy. Post-operative complications were encountered in 67.9% (19/28) cases that survived the peri-operative period, of which 25.0% (7/28) suffered complications that were considered attributable or likely attributable to diaphragmotomy. These seven complications resolved following non-surgical intervention. Follow-up was available for 26 of 28 patients that survived to discharge at a median of 4-months (range 10?days to 24?months) following surgery and revealed no evidence of complications related to diaphragmotomy. Clinical Significance Diaphragmotomy appears safe and increases abdominal exposure of hepatobiliary lesions. The benefit of improved exposure must be carefully weighed up against the risks inherent in inducing pneumothorax.

AB  - Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal genodermatosis characterized by the triad of fibrofolliculomas, trichodyscomas and acrochordons. The gene for BHD was localised to chromosome 17p11.2 and a germline insertion/deletion was identified to cause premature truncation of the BHD protein, folliculin. Patients carry increased risk for developing lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal carcinoma. Prompt diagnosis is important for patient clinical management. We encountered a 41 year-old white male, otherwise healthy, with classic clinical presentation of BHD, i.e. numerous firm, smooth, whitish papules covering his face and neck, which were developed after adolescence. There is no related family history. Nine biopsies were taken during the past 5 years. The following changes are present: markedly dilated hair follicles, telangiectasia in fibrosing stroma, and melanocytic nevus cells. Diagnoses of epidermal inclusion cyst, fibrous papules, and dermal nevus were given. However, some subtle but diagnostic histopathological features for fibrofolliculoma, perifolliculafibroma, and trichodyscoma were overlooked. Correct diagnosis was reached upon review of all the biopsies. Patient is currently undergoing genetic testing and clinical workups. We present this case to update our knowledge on this rare disease, particularly the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic pitfalls, in order to avoid the delay of correct diagnosis.

AB  - Background To evaluate whether the symptoms of children and adolescents with clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) form classes consistent with the diagnostic criteria of complex PTSD (CPTSD) as proposed for the ICD-11, and to relate the emerging classes with treatment outcome of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). Methods Latent classes analysis (LCA) was used to explore the symptom profiles of the clinical baseline assessment of N = 155 children and adolescents participating in a randomized controlled trial of TF-CBT. The treatment outcomes of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and of patients with CPTSD were compared by a t-test for depended samples and a repeated-measures ANOVA. Results The LCA revealed two distinct classes: a PTSD class characterized by elevated core symptoms of PTSD (n = 62) and low symptoms of disturbances in self-organization versus a complex PTSD class with elevated PTSD core symptoms and elevated symptoms of disturbances in self-organization (n = 93). The Group ? Time interaction regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms was not significant. Pre?post effect sizes regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms were large for both groups (PTSD: d = 2.81; CPTSD: d = 1.37). For disturbances in self-organization in the CPTSD class, we found medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.40?1.16) after treatment with TF-CBT. Conclusions The results provide empirical evidence of the ICD-11 CPTSD and PTSD distinction in a clinical sample of children and adolescents. In terms of relative improvement from their respective baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms, patients with PTSD and CPTSD responded equally to TF-CBT; however, those with CPTSD ended treatment with clinically and statistically greater symptoms than those with PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated 1) trauma symptom changes following the implementation of a life skills intervention; 2) the relationship between demographic characteristics, cognitive functioning, life skill knowledge and changes in trauma symptoms; and 3) predictive factors of trauma symptoms during housing transitions. Participants (N?=?72) enrolled in intervention modules to increase residential stability (room and self-care, money management, nutrition management or safe community participation), completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, ACLS-2000 and a Practical Skills Test at baseline, post-intervention and 3 and 6 months later to examine differences in trauma symptoms and treatment outcomes. Trauma symptoms were highest at baseline and decreased significantly for most participants over time. For a subgroup of females experiencing abuse and individuals who were homeless less than 1 year, there was an increase in symptoms at 3 months post-intervention (highest rate of housing transition). This small convenience sample represents a limited geographic area. Replication of the study with larger groups for generalization, and further investigation into the specific impact of symptoms on function were recommended for future research.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of the present study was first to investigate whether both teacher-reported classroom aggression (ATT) and teachers? interaction with school shooting media (ISSM) are predictors of teachers? secondary trauma related to school shootings (STSS) and to second, consider how participation in lockdown drills may moderate these relationships. Two measures were created to understand the levels of aggression teachers report occurs in their classrooms and to understand how teachers interact with media related to school shootings. Both ISSM and ATT were associated with higher levels of STSS. Lockdown drills did not appear to interact with these relationships to either strengthen or weaken them. Considering the importance of teachers? well-being and how it influences their ability to be effective teachers, continued investigation is warranted.

AB  - Rationale Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a pancreatic disease with poor prognosis and pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal types of cancer that is symptomless in the early stage. Because the clinical and image findings of CP can overlap that of pancreatic cancer (PC) which leads to confusion in the diagnosis and treatment of PC, discovery/verification/validation of more accurate protein biomarkers to diagnose CP and PC is in urgent need. Methods The PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using the keywords: ?biomarker?, ?marker?, ?chronic pancreatitis?, ?pancreatic cancer? or ?proteomics? for highly related researches. We focused on the articles published after the year 2005 in this review. Results We introduce the background to CP and PC and summarize the diagnosis of CP and PC, analytically validated protein biomarkers, and proteomic approaches for discovery/verification/validation. The potential use of mass spectrometry (MS) in clinical diagnosis is also discussed. Conclusions Continuously improving sensitivity of MS can provide deeper proteome for new marker discovery and high reliability for protein marker verification, validation, and clinical diagnosis. The analytically validated protein markers could be considered as targeted protein biomarkers for developing a MS platform in the clinical validation process or clinical diagnosis of CP and PC.

AB  - Abstract Objective Rumination, the repetitive and recursive rehearsal of cognitive content, has been linked to depression and anxiety in physically well populations, and to post-traumatic growth (PTG) in physical illness populations. Women diagnosed with breast cancer may experience both psychological distress and PTG. As rumination may influence outcomes through distinct pathways, this study investigated the association of intrusion, brooding and instrumental subcomponents of rumination with psychological distress and PTG in the breast cancer context. Methods Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (n?=?185), mean age 55.98 years (SD?=?9.26), completed an online survey including the Multi-dimensional Rumination in Illness Scale, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, Medical Outcomes Social Support Survey, demographic and health-related questions. Results As predicted, regression analyses indicated that brooding was positively related to depression, anxiety and stress, but was also negatively related to the PTG dimensions of new possibilities and spiritual growth. Partially supporting the study hypotheses, intrusion was positively associated with stress and the PTG of relating to others and new possibilities. As hypothesised, instrumental rumination was positively associated with all five dimensions of PTG. Conclusions Rumination is a key consideration in both positive and negative psychological responses of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Associations of specific components of rumination with varying psychological outcomes suggest differential paths by which the specific subcomponents of rumination exert this influence.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounting for 80% of head injury diagnoses, recognition of individuals at risk of cognitive dysfunction remains a challenge in the acute setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential role for computerised cognitive testing as part of a complete ED head injury assessment. Methods mTBI patients (n =?36) who incurred a head injury within 24?h of presentation to the ED were compared to trauma controls (n = 20) and healthy controls (n =?20) on tests assessing reaction time, speed and attention, episodic memory, working memory and executive functioning. Testing occurred during their visit to the ED at a mean of 12?h post-injury for mTBI and 9.4?h for trauma controls. These tasks were part of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery iPad application. Healthy controls were tested in both a quiet environment and the ED to investigate the potential effects of noise and distraction on neurocognitive function. Results Reaction time was significantly slower in the mTBI group compared to trauma patients (P =?0.015) and healthy controls (P =?0.011), and deficits were also seen in working memory compared to healthy controls (P?≤?0.001) and in executive functioning (P =?0.021 and P <?0.001) compared to trauma and healthy controls. Performances in the control group did not differ between testing environments. Conclusion Computerised neurocognitive testing in the ED is feasible and can be utilised to detect deficits in cognitive performance in the mTBI population as part of a routine head injury assessment.

AB  - Aim? Whole-body multislice CT-Scanning (MSCT) has become the primary imaging device in many European and North American trauma centres. We aim to present a new standardised protocol that has lead to a markedly improved diagnostic managment in an Australian metropolitan trauma centre. Methods? Based on growing evidence in the literature the MSCT is used as the primary imaging tool in severely injured patients and is routinely performed after completion of primary and secondary survey. The routine protocol consists of a non-contrast head and cervical spine CT, followed by a contrast chest, abdomen and pelvic CT. Apart from an initial chest X-Ray, routine X-ray trauma series are not performed anymore. The criteria for this whole-body MSCT are strictly limited to patients that required trauma team activation and can be sufficiently stabilised in the emergency room. Results? This adapted diagnostic algorithm has shown to be very fast and efficient. The average duration of initial management can be reduced significantly, in addition the number of initially missed injuries is markedly reduced. Conclusions? Primary whole-body MSCT has become a valuable diagnostic tool in the emergency management of severe trauma. A strictly followed protocol has been shown to be crucial to avoid overuse, in terms of radiation as well as exposing the unstable patient to an unnecessary high risk.

AB  - Ultrasonography of a cat with diarrhoea and vomiting revealed a multi-layered, discrete linear structure within the large intestine with retention of the intestinal layers which could potentially be confused with an intestinal intussusception. The structure was ultimately expelled from the large intestine during defecation, and confirmed as a fibrinonecrotic cast. The origin of the fibrinonecrotic cast was assumed to be an intestinal pseudo-membrane formed in enteritis caused by immune suppression due to the panleukopenia virus. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasonographic description of a fibrinonecrotic cast and spontaneous passage of the colonic cast in the veterinary field.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among children in Maryland and to examine factors that influence hospital admission. Methods: Statewide mortality, hospital discharge, and ambulatory care data were used to identify all TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occurred in 1998 to children aged 0-19 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's standard case definition and protocol. Inpatient admission was modeled as a function of patient, injury, and hospital characteristics. Results: The overall incidence of pediatric TBI (i.e., ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths) in 1998 was 670/100,000. After controlling for injury severity and other factors, uninsured children were 40% less likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 0.43 to 0.82) and children with Medicaid were 90% more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 1.42 to 2.54) than were those with private insurance. The presence of a major associated injury significantly influenced the likelihood of hospitalization, especially among children with a minor (OR = 8.8) to moderate (OR = 11.6) TBI. Children who presented to a trauma center hospital were significantly more likely to be hospitalized than children treated at a non-trauma center hospital, although this varied depending on income (OR = 1.8 for high versus low) and hospital volume (OR = 2.6 for a small hospital and OR = 29.0 for a large hospital). Conclusions: After adjusting for TBI severity and the presence of associated injuries, significant differences in hospitalization rates may exist among different patient subgroups and hospitals for children who sustain TBIs.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? To determine the institution's current non-therapeutic (negative) appendicectomy rate; the frequency of clinical predictors for appendicitis in patients who underwent appendicectomy; and the utilization and accuracy of ultrasound scans (USS) and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of appendicitis. Methods:? A retrospective chart review was conducted in an adult, metropolitan teaching hospital. Patients who presented to the ED and underwent an appendicectomy over a 12-month period were analysed. Symptoms and signs predictive of appendicitis, results of USS and CT scans if performed, and histopathology findings were abstracted from patient records. Results:? Two hundred and forty patients had appendicectomies, 147 (61%) were male and the median age was 25 years (range 14?78 years). The negative appendicectomy rate was 14.3% (95% CI 9.1?21.0%) and 18.3% (95% CI 11.0?26.7%) in males and females, respectively. Abdominal pain shifting to the right iliac fossa (RIF), anorexia and RIF rebound tenderness were found more frequently in patients with positive than negative appendicectomies (P < 0.05). USS and CT scans were performed in 68 (28%) and 15 (9.5%) patients, respectively. The likelihood ratio for appendicitis in patients with a normal USS or a normal CT scan was 0.83 (95% CI 0.56?1.24) and 0.08 (95% CI 0.01?0.60), respectively. There were no false positive CT scan results. Conclusion:? Computed tomoraphy scanning should play an increasing role in the ED management of suspected appendicitis. Our negative appendicectomy rate could potentially be halved by the introduction of CT scans in the diagnostic work up of these patients.

AB  - Objectives To define a uroflowmetry-based non-invasive predictive tool for the primary diagnosis of urethral stricture disease. Methods A total of 300 male patients (150 with urethral stricture disease and 150 with benign prostatic obstruction), treated surgically between 2005 and 2015, and 75 healthy males were included in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups (75 benign prostatic obstruction patients and 75 urethral stricture disease patients in each group). A model, able to objectively differentiate between benign prostatic obstruction and urethral stricture disease, was created by use of original and hybrid uroflowmetry variables in logistic regression in group A (test group). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used for validation in group B (validation group) and to calculate cut-off values to distinguish healthy individuals from benign prostatic obstruction as a result of urethral stricture disease. Results Receiver operating characteristics area under the curve values of the created model were 0.841 (0.777?0.905) and 0.807 (0.735?0.879) in groups A and B, respectively. Optimal cut-off values were 2.2847 and 0.1182 to distinguish healthy individuals versus benign prostatic obstruction and benign prostatic obstruction versus urethral stricture disease. Conclusions A triphasic uroflowmetry-based model is able to objectively distinguish voiding patterns of healthy individuals, benign prostatic obstruction and urethral stricture disease. The probability of urethral stricture disease can be objectively calculated for each individual patient based on a non-invasive uroflowmetry test. Uroflowmetry pattern interpretation by use of statistical models could become a new standard.

AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.

AB  - Abstract Lipomatous tumors range from benign lipomas to high-grade liposarcomas. Liposarcomas are classified into five histologic subtypes: well-differentiated, dedifferentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic, which differ in outcomes and patterns of recurrence. Surgical resection is the mainstay of curative treatment; however, large, high grade liposarcomas may benefit from multimodality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. A histologic-subtype specific nomogram provides accurate survival predictions. Prospective randomized clinical trials will continue to improve our care of patients with liposarcoma. J. Surg.
