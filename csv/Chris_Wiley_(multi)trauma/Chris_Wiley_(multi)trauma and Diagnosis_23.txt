AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2011; 17: 69?79 Abstract Lyme borreliosis, caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies complex, is the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The non-specific nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic challenge and concise case definitions are essential for its satisfactory management. Lyme borreliosis is very similar in Europe and North America but the greater variety of genospecies in Europe leads to some important differences in clinical presentation. These new case definitions for European Lyme borreliosis emphasise recognition of clinical manifestations supported by relevant laboratory criteria and may be used in a clinical setting and also for epidemiological investigations.

AB  - Abstract Blunt chest trauma is a common occurrence in vehicle accident. Cardiac injuries following nonpenetrating thoracic trauma have been reported. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to coronary artery involvement is a rare but extremely serious condition for the high risk of undetected diagnosis. Blunt thoracic trauma may obscure typical chest pain associated with cardiac ischemia especially in patients with high tolerance of pain or secondary administration of analgesic drugs. We report two consecutive cases of young adults admitted to our emergency department after motorcycle accident and concomitant anterior STEMI due to occlusion of left anterior descending artery. In both cases primary percutaneous coronary intervention with a second generation drug eluting stent implantation was successfully performed. Imaging with intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography showed the mechanisms of coronary occlusion, allowing an optimal stent implantation and avoiding procedural complications in this complex setting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Orthopedic trauma, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruption, is a common source of osteoarthritis in the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive multi-planar imaging modality commonly used to evaluate hard and soft tissues of diarthrodial joints following traumatic injury. The contrast provided by generated images enables the evaluation of bone marrow lesions as well as delamination and degeneration of articular cartilage. We will provide background information about MRI signal generation and decay (T1 and T2 values), the utility of morphologic MRI, and the quantitative MRI techniques of T1?, T2, and T2* mapping, to evaluate subjects with traumatic knee injuries, such as ACL rupture. Additionally, we will provide information regarding the dGEMRIC, sodium, and gagCEST imaging techniques. Finally, the description and utility of newer post hoc analysis techniques, such as texture analysis, will be given. Continued development and refinement of these advanced MRI techniques will facilitate their clinical translation. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The personal stories that youth in juvenile facilities report to their counselors are heartbreaking because they are filled with accounts of excessive trauma resulting from neglect, physical, sexual, and emotional violence perpetrated on these children. Perry found that trauma develops from severe neglect, abuse, and living in terrorizing environments. Trauma changes the neural processing ability within the child's developing brain which can lead to hypervigilance and dysfunctional behavior. Widom found that children who had been abused or neglected as children have 30% higher arrests as a juvenile and as an adult for a violent offense.

AB  - Clinico-pathological studies have shown that the clinical diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia (MID) is even more difficult than that of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The study evaluated the significance of course characteristics for the diagnosis of MID and DAT. Course characteristics were rated when 57 demented patients were admitted to our neurogeriatric department. Diagnosis of MID and DAT, respectively, was established after a follow-up study with repeated neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological investigations. In 21 cases diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem neuropathology. MID lacked the typical course of the disease in about two thirds of patients, while most DAT patients presented with the typical course of primary degenerative dementia. Features of the ?typical? clinical course of MID (abrupt onset, stepwise deterioration) helped to exclude DAT, whereas MID could not be excluded on the basis of a history of insidious onset and gradual decline.

AB  - Abstract ? Objectives: It is not generally possible to assess diagnostic accuracy in dental surveys as no histological ?gold standards? are available, therefore examiner agreement tends to be used as a proxy for accuracy. The aim of this study was to investigate, using extracted teeth in arch models, the in vitro validity of a diagnostic system to assess caries at the D1 (enamel and dentine) and D3 (dentine) diagnostic thresholds, for epidemiological purposes. Method: Two groups of 10 dental examiners trained in the use of the Dundee Selectable Threshold Method for caries diagnosis (DSTM) each examined (on two occasions) 160 extracted permanent molar and premolar teeth set in arch models in phantom heads according to the codes and criteria of the DSTM. The teeth were subsequently radiographed and sectioned to provide validation of the diagnoses. Results: Intra-examiner agreement according to the kappa statistic was substantial. In general terms the results of the in vitro validation exercise demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity values at the D1 diagnostic threshold than were found at the D3 diagnostic threshold with a consequent loss of specificity. Conclusions: The results of this in vitro validation exercise demonstrate that at the D1 diagnostic threshold the sensitivity of the DSTM was greater than at the D3 threshold indicating no loss of diagnostic accuracy at the D1 threshold.

AB  - A cat with a history of seizures and clinical suspicion of forebrain disorder underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the left temporal lobe. The mass was surgically removed, and cytological, histological and immunohistochemical examinations documented the presence of Toxoplasma gondii. A definitive diagnosis of an intracranial T gondii granuloma was made. The cat was treated with clindamycin and phenobarbital and the seizures did not recur. After 10 months, a second magnetic resonance imaging showed severe brain atrophy, but T gondii granuloma recurrence was not noted. Twenty-one months after surgery, the cat?s condition deteriorated, and another magnetic resonance imaging showed a presumptive recurrence of T gondii granuloma. In cats, T gondii granuloma must be considered as a differential diagnosis even when only a single intracranial mass is present. Cytology and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in making a definitive diagnosis and to follow the evolution of the lesion.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are life-threatening complications in trauma patients. Despite the implantation of a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv ECMO), sufficient oxygenation (arterial SaO2?>?90%) is not always achieved. The additive use of high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) and ECMO in the critical phase after trauma could prevent the occurrence of life-threatening hypoxaemia and multi-organ failure. We report on a 26-year-old female (Injury Severity Score 29) who had multiple injuries as follows: an unstable pelvic fracture, a blunt abdominal trauma, a blunt trauma of the left thigh, and a thoracic injury. Three days after admission, the patient developed fulminant ARDS (Murray lung injury score of 11 and Horovitz- Index <80?mmHg), and vv ECMO therapy was initiated. The Horovitz- Index was <80?mm Hg, and the lung compliance was minimal. With HFOV, almost complete recruitment of the lung was achieved, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was significantly reduced. The pelvic fracture was treated non-operatively. The HFOV was terminated after 3 days, and the ECMO was stopped after 19 days.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sporadic measurement of serum triglycerides in depressed and inappetant clinically ill horses revealed severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible evidence of lipaemia on several occasions, leading to the inclusion of serum triglyceride concentrations in the routine serum biochemistry evaluation of our hospital. Since then, more cases have been identified and treated for hypertriglyceridaemia, raising questions about the prevalence, predisposing factors and significance of these findings. Hypotheses: 1) Severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible opacity of the serum occurs more commonly in clinically ill and inappetant horses than previously described and 2) appropriate treatment using i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition would decrease serum triglycerides to normal limits and might result in improved appetite and attitude of the patient. Methods: The laboratory computer database from 2000 and 2001 was searched for increased serum triglycerides (>5.65 mmol/l) in any horse breed, ponies and miniature breeds excluded. Data analysed included subject details, diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, treatment, response to treatment and outcome. Results: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in 13 horses, with serum triglyceride concentrations 6.17?18.29 mmol/l, while none showed visible lipaemia. All horses had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and all but one had an increased serum creatinine concentration. Treatment with i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition resulted in decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Conclusions: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in inappetant and clinically ill horses without evidence of serum opacity more commonly than previously described. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose horses to hypertriglyceridaemia, while the increased creatinine concentration might be a predisposing factor or result of the condition. Horses identified in our study readily responded to treatment and appetite and attitude improved coincident with decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Potential relevance: Hypertriglyceridaemia could perpetuate inappetance and depression in clinically ill horses and potentially predispose to fatty infiltration of the liver and other organ systems.

AB  - Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MR technique that depicts and quantifies magnetic susceptibility sources. Mapping iron, the dominant susceptibility source in the brain, has many important clinical applications. Herein, we review QSM applications in the diagnosis, medical management, and surgical treatment of disease. To assist in early disease diagnosis, QSM can identify elevated iron levels in the motor cortex of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, in the globus pallidus, putamen, and caudate of Huntington's disease patients, and in the basal ganglia of Wilson's disease patients. Additionally, QSM can distinguish between hemorrhage and calcification, which could prove useful in tumor subclassification, and can measure microbleeds in traumatic brain injury patients. In guiding medical management, QSM can be used to monitor iron chelation therapy in PD patients, to monitor smoldering inflammation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions after the blood?brain barrier (BBB) seals, to monitor active inflammation of MS lesions before the BBB seals without using gadolinium, and to monitor hematoma volume in intracerebral hemorrhage. QSM can also guide neurosurgical treatment. Neurosurgeons require accurate depiction of the subthalamic nucleus, a tiny deep gray matter nucleus, prior to inserting deep brain stimulation electrodes into the brains of PD patients. QSM is arguably the best imaging tool for depiction of the subthalamic nucleus. Finally, we discuss future directions, including bone QSM, cardiac QSM, and using QSM to map cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Controversy exists as to the utility of the MMPI in diagnosing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies of an empirically developed PTSD Subscale for the MMPI have had conflicting results. In this study 84 MMPI clinical and research scales, including the PTSD Subscale, of 234 Vietnam War veterans (+PTSD = 117, -PTSD = 117) were compared to determine the clinical usefulness of the scales for differential diagnosis of PTSD. The veterans were all inpatients applying for admission to a PTSD treatment program. The MMPI clinical profile for PTSD was corroborated, though it had little statistically significant difference than the average profile of the -PTSD group. The PTSD Subscale was slightly better than chance in classifying veterans. A number of research scales were found to be as or more accurate than the PTSD Subscale in terms of true hit rates.

As a consequence of these functions, it is very liable to injury and to degenerative changes, with diseases of the spinal column being far more common than diseases of the spinal cord. Despite the focus of this article being on diseases resulting in an emergency spinal presentation, it is worth remembering that any chronic compressive spinal cord disease can present acutely due to ongoing vascular and contusive injuries to the spinal cord. This article will focus only on the common diseases requiring emergency management.

This involves ensuring the patient is clean, free from infection and less likely to acquire infection during surgery. Actions needed during surgery to reduce the chances of infection may include: hand decontamination; incise drapes; sterile gowns; gloves; antiseptic skin preparation; patient temperature; patient oxygenation; perfusion during surgery; and wound irrigation. Postoperative patients who suffer from infection following surgery need to be monitored and treated urgently to prevent further issues with their health and well-being. Patients who have infections before surgery need to be treated to prevent further problems. Postoperative infections must be treated urgently by using antibiotics to cover the range of possible pathogens. To support the patient, recovery practitioners needs training and understanding of the methods used to care for wounds.
