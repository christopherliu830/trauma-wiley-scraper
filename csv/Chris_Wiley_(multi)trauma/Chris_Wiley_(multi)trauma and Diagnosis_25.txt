AB  - Abstract Although existing research suggests that certain childhood traumas such as childhood sexual abuse are associated with interpersonal (e.g., marital) difficulties in adulthood, there has been limited research on interpersonal sequelae of other types of traumas. In addition, the association between childhood traumas and interpersonal outcomes has often been limited to a particular outcome such as divorce, and existing studies have rarely controlled for the co-occurrence of other traumas when evaluating interpersonal outcomes. The current study sought to evaluate the associations between 7 childhood traumas and 2 marital outcomes?marital disruption (i.e., divorce and separation) and marital satisfaction?in a large, national probability sample. Results from univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that (a) probability of marital disruption was higher among people who during childhood had experienced physical abuse, rape, or serious physical attack or assault; and (b) current marital satisfaction was lower among people who during childhood had experienced rape or sexual molestation. Results support the importance of childhood traumas in predicting 2 important marital outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to provide insight into survivor-reported negative and positive consequences of cancer during adolescence 10 years after diagnosis and compare these with consequences reported 3 and 4 years after diagnosis. Methods Three, 4, and 10 years after diagnosis, survivors of adolescent cancer were interviewed about negative and positive consequences due to their cancer experience. Manifest content analysis was used to identify categories of reported consequences. Categories of consequences 10 years after diagnosis were compared with consequences reported 3 and 4 years after diagnosis. Results Seven categories of negative consequences were identified: bodily concerns, existential thoughts about loss and life (new at 10 years), psychological problems, difficulties interacting with others, health worries (new), fertility concerns (new), and frustrations about health care (new); and six categories of positive consequences: positive view of life, positive view of self, compassion for others (new), close relationships, gained knowledge about disease and health care, and financial gains. Consistent with previous time points, bodily concerns were reported most often. The majority of survivors (n?=?22) reported both negative and positive consequences of their former disease. Few reported only negative (n?=?2) or only positive consequences (n?=?4). Conclusions Ten years after diagnosis, most survivors reported both negative and positive consequences. New themes, relevant to young adulthood and long-term survival, were identified. Health care professionals treating young adult survivors may anticipate and address problems regarding physical health, fertility, and health care but may also reinforce positive affect by addressing survivors' positive views of life, sense of self, and close relationships. ? 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Renovascular disease is a common but complex disorder, the most common causes of which are fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. Clinically, it can present as asymptomatic renal artery stenosis, renovascular hypertension, or ischemic nephropathy. Assessing the clinical index of suspicion remains essential in determining an appropriate diagnostic strategy. For diagnosis in patients with suspected fibromuscular disease, it may be reasonable to proceed directly to renal angiography; however, for most patients with suspected atherosclerotic disease, there are a number of noninvasive tests available that can aid in decision making. The choice of the most appropriate initial test should be based on patient characteristics, clinical presentation, and local expertise. Treatment options include medical, surgical, or percutaneous approaches. Generally, in patients with fibromuscular disease, percutaneous intervention provides durable improvement or cure of hypertension. In patients with atherosclerotic disease, the data are less consistent, and there does appear to be a group of patients who will respond well to medical management alone. As technology advances, the diagnostic and treatment paradigms will continue to evolve.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values according to the different b values. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was acquired. We evaluated 74 patients (M:F = 43:31, mean age of 44 years) who underwent 3.0 Tesla knee MR with DWI because of the possibility of ACL tear due to trauma. Region of interest measurements were performed. We (two radiologists) measured the signals of the DWI and derived ADC values on the oblique sagittal DWI with b values of 0, 600, and 1000. The diagnostic accuracies of the conventional MR image and each DWI with an ADC value with a different b value were evaluated. The CNR and ADC values were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The diagnostic performances of the various imaging methods were evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for differentiating between normal and ACL injury as determined by the use of conventional MRI with additional DWIs with McNemar test. The arthroscopic or clinical findings were used as the reference standard. Results The mean CNRs of ligament tears with b values of 600 and 1000 were significantly higher than those of normal ligament (22 versus 7 and 9 versus 4, P value < 0.05). The sensitivities and the accuracies of the DWI were significantly lower than the conventional MRIs (P value < 0.001). Conclusions: The CNRs of the torn ACL with each b value (600 and 1000) were significantly higher those of than normal ligament, although the ADC values of the torn ligament were not different from normal ligament. Addition of the DWI to the conventional MRI did not improve diagnostic performance. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:1116?1122.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study examined the relationship between sexual trauma and eating disorder behavior, taking into account the effects of developmental stage of the victim and the effects of multiple sexual assaults. Method Four groups of adult women took part in this study. Subjects were either victims of childhood sexual abuse, victims of rape in adulthood, victims of both childhood sexual abuse and rape, and controls who were not traumatized sexually. All subjects were assessed with semistructured interviews and self-report inventories that assessed eating disorder behavior, general psychopathology, and impulsivity. Results Victims of childhood sexual abuse differed from controls on measures of eating disorder behavior and individuals who had experienced both childhood sexual abuse and rape in adulthood were most likely to display eating disorder-related psychopathology. Victims of childhood sexual abuse also distinguished themselves with high levels of eating disorder behavior plus multiple forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. Discussion This study provides additional support for the association between childhood sexual abuse and eating disorder behavior. Childhood sexual abuse may be particularly linked to the presence of binge eating behavior and several other forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. ? 2001 by John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract: A pure electroporation injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent osmotic swelling of the tissue. The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile (water) protons and a restricted (protein) proton pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this injury. Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the transverse magnetic relaxation time (T2) in MRIs of healthy and electrically injured tissue. In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the MRI contrast, the degree of structural alteration of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane pores), and edema. The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle tissues, in that edema will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract This unit discusses an approach to identifying a genetic etiology in an individual with nonsyndromic hearing loss. The unit begins with a discussion of the decision-making process that can be used to determine whether specific genes and/or a large gene panel should be used for molecular diagnosis of a patient presenting with nonsyndromic hearing loss. Next, two protocols are presented: (1) a full gene-sequencing assay to identify mutations in the GJB2 gene (encoding connexin 26), the most common cause of congenital hearing loss, and (2) an assay to detect the presence of the GJB6-D13S1830 deletion, a 342-kb deletion that causes hearing loss in homozygosity or in combination with a single GJB2 mutation. Finally, the unit ends with a strategy for determining the clinical significance of the test results, which can be challenging given the extensive genetic heterogeneity associated with hearing loss.

AB  - Compelling evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation play a role in stress regulation and in the etiologic basis of stress related disorders such as Post traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Here we describe the purpose and methods of an international consortium that was developed to study the role of epigenetics in PTSD. Inspired by the approach used in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we brought together investigators representing seven cohorts with a collective sample size of N?=?1147 that included detailed information on trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and genome-wide DNA methylation data. The objective of this consortium is to increase the analytical sample size by pooling data and combining expertise so that DNA methylation patterns associated with PTSD can be identified. Several quality control and analytical pipelines were evaluated for their control of genomic inflation and technical artifacts with a joint analysis procedure established to derive comparable data over the cohorts for meta-analysis. We propose methods to deal with ancestry population stratification and type I error inflation and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying robust error estimates. To evaluate our pipeline, we report results from an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of age, which is a well-characterized phenotype with known epigenetic associations. Overall, while EWAS are highly complex and subject to similar challenges as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we demonstrate that an epigenetic meta-analysis with a relatively modest sample size can be well-powered to identify epigenetic associations. Our pipeline can be used as a framework for consortium efforts for EWAS.

It affects the entire process of care, both for the clinicians involved in the patient's care and for the blood bank, given the consequences and complications of transfusions. This article will highlight the pathophysiology leading to the need for massive transfusion and provide some modern surgical approaches to decrease the transfusion requirement and lessen its effect on the individual patient. Practical suggestions for a massive transfusion protocol, based on our experience and the available literature will be provided. Finally the article will examine the complications of a massive transfusion and outline the steps in the prevention and management of these complications.

AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.

AB  - Abstract The effectiveness of a locally developed trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) program for maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was examined across different therapists in a child protection clinic setting. An earlier phase of the research piloting the program had provided promising results. This second phase involved two studies evaluating the completed TF-CBT manual delivered by (a) the developer and (b) other therapists. A single-case multiple-baseline design was used to demonstrate the controlling effects of the treatment on PTSD symptoms and child coping. Eight 9?13-year-old abused children with PTSD were treated. Positive outcomes support the effectiveness of the TF-CBT program delivered by both the developer and other therapists. The study design and methodology were robust enough to confirm empirically the clinically beneficial effects and potential for this new program. It was also apparent, however, from study limitations, including missing data for some patients, that there are a number of challenges in carrying out such research in a busy child protection service setting with multiply-abused patients. This paper considers implications and ways forward for engaging in empirically supported practice as well as future development and research.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the demographic information of dogs referred for investigation of fever, to determine the usefulness of various diagnostic investigations and to assess the effect of treatment before referral on the presence of fever at referral, the duration of the investigation and the ability to reach a final diagnosis. Methods: The clinical records of 66 dogs, in which fever was part of the clinical signs documented by the referring veterinary surgeon, were reviewed. The effects of treatment 24 hours before referral on temperature at initial consultation and on time to diagnosis were evaluated. The effect of body temperature at initial consultation on cost and on time to diagnosis was also determined. The effect of insurance on costs incurred was assessed. The utility of different diagnostic investigations was recorded, and cases were classified according to the final diagnosis. Results: Only 34·8 per cent of dogs were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease, with most frequent diagnoses being steroid-responsive meningitis and polyarthritis. Treatment 24 hours before referral significantly increased the time to diagnosis (P=0·004) and affected the presence of fever at referral (P=0·006). Insurance status did not significantly affect cost incurred by the owner. Clinical Significance: This study documents a high incidence of immune-mediated disease in dogs referred for investigation of fever. It also documents a higher incidence of inflammatory central nervous system disease in febrile dogs than that reported previously. Of the diagnostic modalities employed in the majority of cases, radiography, cytology and bacteriological and fungal cultures (fluids/tissues) were the most useful. It is suggested that treatment is withdrawn or withheld before commencing diagnostic investigation of fever.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - Staphylococcus intermedius has been the predominant coagulase-positive Staphylococcus isolated from canine skin and mucosae and the most commonly reported staphylococcal pathogen in small animal practice for the last 35 years. Although microbiological tests have historically indicated variability in biochemical characteristics amongst S. intermedius isolates from animals, an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy for clinical purposes was readily achievable with routine phenotypic testing. However, three recent developments have changed our understanding of the term ?S. intermedius? and have challenged veterinary bacteriologists to ensure correct species identification of pathogenic staphylococci from small animals. First, the increasing recognition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in small animal practice and its human health implications demand accurate species identification. Secondly, the application of molecular techniques to analysis of staphylococcal isolates has led to a revised taxonomy and canine isolates of S. intermedius being re-named S. pseudintermedius. Thirdly, the recent, rapid emergence of meticillin- and multi-drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has become a major therapeutic challenge in veterinary practice worldwide, including the UK. This article discusses the background of the recent taxonomic changes within the genus Staphylococcus and reviews the key features of MRSP and its implications for day-to-day laboratory diagnosis and small animal practice.

AB  - Abstract We report the case of an ultimately successful liver transplant recipient whose post-transplant course was complicated by the early development of multiple abscesses in the graft. Post-transplant cholangiography identified multiple shear injuries to the second and third order intrahepatic bile ducts, originating from blunt trauma to the donor liver. Treatment was non-operative following recent reports of the successful management of intrahepatic bile duct injury in the stable trauma patient. This discussion adds to the limited literature available on the transplantation of injured donor livers, despite this being a relatively common practice. Further experience is needed in determining the appropriate criteria for the use of traumatized donor livers. Cholangiography carried out on the back table may help to determine if such injured livers are suitable for transplantation.

AB  - In January of 1995 a massive earthquake struck the city of Kobe, Japan. This article examines how this event became an opportunity for extending global networks of the science and medicine of trauma. The article is based on ethnographic research in Kobe and Los Angeles with psychiatrists who responded to the earthquake in its immediate aftermath. Three aspects of the process are examined: 1) changes in psychiatric institutions that were ongoing at the time of the earthquake, 2) the place of psychiatry in Japanese cultural self-criticism, and 3) the particular technologies for identifying and treating trauma. Globalization in this case cannot be seen as an imposition of Western cultural forms, but rather an ongoing process that reproduces differences between cultures as particular elements travel between them.

AB  - Summary Despite our growing knowledge of spermatogenesis and sperm function, the treatment options for male infertility remain limited. Semen analysis remains the cornerstone in evaluating male fertility. Men with abnormal semen analysis should undergo appropriate clinical work-up. First, lifestyle and potentially interfering female factors should be corrected. Then, whenever an evidence-based therapy is available, any specific cause interfering with sperm output or function should be treated. Finally, although they are not evidence-based, assisted reproductive techniques can be used to alleviate long-standing male infertility
