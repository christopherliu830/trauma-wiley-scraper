AB  - Summary The classification of mental disorders has improved greatly in the last decade of the 20th century and now provides a reliable operational tool. Both the ICD and DSM classifications have greatly facilitated practice, teaching and research by providing better delineation of the syndromes. The absence of aetiological information, linked to brain physiology that could serve as the basis of independent definitional variables, has, however, limited the understanding of mental illness and has been a stumbling block to the development of better classifications. The use of a universal classification for differing cultures has also raised concerns about a lack of sensitivity to local diversity, especially as human behaviour is not always context-free. Given these limitations, and the expectations of scientific advances in the field of genetics, neurobiology, and cultural studies, we should be able to build better classifications based on an international consensus informed by evidence-based research.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract The potential effects of maternal trauma on mother?infant interaction remain insufficiently studied empirically. This study examined the effects of the September 11, 2001, trauma on mother?infant interaction in mothers who were pregnant and widowed on 9/11, and their infants aged 4?6 months. Split-screen videotaped interaction was coded on a one-second basis for infant gaze, facial affect, and vocal affect; and mother gaze, facial affect, and touch. We examined the temporal dynamics of communication: self-contingency and interactive contingency of behavior by time-series methods. We documented heightened maternal and infant efforts at engagement in the 9/11 (vs. control) dyads. Both partners had difficulty tolerating moments of looking away as well as moments of negative behavior patterns. Heightened efforts to maintain a positive visual engagement may be adaptive and a potential source of resilience, but these patterns may also carry risk: working too hard to make it work. A vigilant, hyper-contingent, high-arousal engagement was the central mode of the interpersonal transmission of the trauma to these infants, with implications for intervention.

AB  - Background? Flail chest in thoracic trauma is associated with significant complications and carries high morbidity and mortality. At present there is no standardized management plan for flail chest. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors affecting morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in the hospital. Methods? We evaluated all patients admitted to our trauma centre between January 2002 and December 2004. Age, presence of pneumothorax, trauma severity score (ISS), length of stay, lung contusion and deaths were recorded. Results? There were 100 patients with a mean age of 52 (SD 19.8, range 17?90). The median length of stay was 17 days, and the average ISS score was 30 (SD 13.2). 74% had flail chest and lung contusion, 2 patients had pneumothorax, and 7 (7%) patients died 3 (5.4%) patients with 1?4 fractured ribs died, compared with 4 (8.9%) patients with 5 or more fractured ribs (p?=?0.70, Fisher?s exact test). The mean ISS score was 32.3 (SD 19.5) for those who died compared with 29.8 (SD 12.7) in those who did not die (p?=?0.63, t-test). There was a moderate positive correlation between ISS score and length of stay (r?=?0.36, p?=?0.0002, Pearson correlation coefficient). Conclusion? ISS score was found to be a moderate potential predictor on outcome regarding length of stay in the hospital. There is an apparent increased risk of death with more fractured ribs and therefore a standadised surgical management plan for ribs fixation may reduce the risk of death in this patient group.

AB  - Summary Despite our growing knowledge of spermatogenesis and sperm function, the treatment options for male infertility remain limited. Semen analysis remains the cornerstone in evaluating male fertility. Men with abnormal semen analysis should undergo appropriate clinical work-up. First, lifestyle and potentially interfering female factors should be corrected. Then, whenever an evidence-based therapy is available, any specific cause interfering with sperm output or function should be treated. Finally, although they are not evidence-based, assisted reproductive techniques can be used to alleviate long-standing male infertility

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - The differential diagnosis of adnexal masses still represents a challenge. The main goal is to determine whether a given mass is malignant or benign, in order to establish the best therapautical approach. When a clinician face to a woman diagnosed as having an adnexal tumor several parameters may be used to determine the nature of the mass, such as patient's age, menopausal status, clinical complaints, physical examination, tumor's sonographic and Doppler features and serum tumor markers. When these data are collected may be difficult to interpret them all together and the clinician has to rely in one or two of them to predict the diagnosis and to decide the management strategy, guided many times by own experience or strict protocols. A possible solution to this question may be the use of computer modelling. This means the use of statistical or mathematical models developed, using computer aid, to predict adnexal malignancy. Currently, there are two methods that may be used: Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis (MLRA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Both techniques allow to calculate the probability of a particular event has occurred, in this case a mass to be malignant or benign. By computer modelling, actual independent predictors parameters are identified and may be used combined and simultaneously to predict malignancy. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, being MLRA the statistical technique of choice and ANN a potential newer alternative to MLRA. Several studies have been published using one or both technique to predict adnexal malignancy. The results of these studies are encouraging showing a high diagnostic performance. All studies comparing MLRA to ANN showed the latter seems to be superior. However, it should be taken into account that most of these models have not tested prospectively.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Intracavernosal injection (ICI) of a vasoactive agent has been an important part of the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) since its initial description by Virag in 1982. Aim To review the literature and summarize the use of ICI and its role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of ED. Methods Literature review. Main Outcome Measure To define the role of ICI's utility in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of ED. Results When used in conjunction with color penile Doppler ultrasound for ED evaluation and diagnosis, ICI helps to detect penile vascular abnormalities and allows for differentiation between the multiple vasculogenic causes of impotence, thus helping clinicians to select the optimal treatment modality for each patient. Patients utilizing ICI continue to report high efficacy and satisfaction rates relative to other treatment options despite ICI's designation as a second-line therapy since the introduction of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in 1998. In recent years, ICI has also become an important part of penile rehabilitation programs following radical prostatectomy, as regular use of ICI is thought to increase the rate at which patients experience return of spontaneous erection through preservation of penile tissue integrity and prevention of corporeal smooth muscle atrophy. Conclusions ICI of vasoactive agents remains an important tool in treating and diagnosing ED, with high patient satisfaction and efficacy rates. However, the dropout rate for ICI therapy remains relatively high, and it may be associated with priapism, ecchymoses, hematoma formation, and penile fibrosis. Patients should be educated on the benefits and limitations of ICI therapy prior to beginning treatment in order to minimize dropout rates. Additional studies are necessary to better understand the possible long-term benefits of ICI therapy and how to most effectively structure the penile rehabilitation program after radical prostatectomy.

AB  - Aim? Genetic testing in the epilepsies is becoming an increasingly accessible clinical tool. Mutations in the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit (SCN1A) gene are most notably associated with Dravet syndrome. This is the first study to assess the impact of SCN1A testing on patient management from both carer and physician perspectives. Method? Participants were identified prospectively from referrals to the Epilepsy Genetics Service in Glasgow and contacted via their referring clinicians. Questionnaires exploring the consequences of SCN1A genetic testing for each case were sent to carers and physicians. Results? Of the 244 individuals contacted, 182 (75%) carried a SCN1A mutation. Carers of 187 (77%) patients responded (90 females, 97 males; mean age at referral 4y 10mo; interquartile range 9y 1mo). Of those participants whose children tested positive for a mutation, 87% reported that genetic testing was helpful, leading to treatment changes resulting in fewer seizures and improved access to therapies and respite care. Out of 187 physicians, 163 responded (87%), of whom 48% reported that a positive test facilitated diagnosis earlier than with clinical and electroencephalography data alone. It prevented additional investigations in 67% of patients, altered treatment approach in 69%, influenced medication choice in 74%, and, through medication change, improved seizure control in 42%. Interpretation? In addition to confirming a clinical diagnosis, a positive SCN1A test result influenced treatment choice and assisted in accessing additional therapies, especially in the very young.

A questionnaire was designed and was given to physicians working in medical colleges or as residents in advanced training programs in medicine in Pondicherry, India. The questionnaire contained a clinical situation of tooth avulsion and various treatment options. Only 5.5% of the medical professionals knew about reimplantation and none knew that the patients? mouth was the best transport medium. 90% of them accepted that they had no knowledge on dental trauma management. As the physicians get an opportunity to attend a case of dental trauma in emergency or private practice, it is vital that they possess sufficient knowledge on primary management of tooth avulsion, before referring to dentists.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes to bed configuration and patient mix on nurses? workload in a single ward. Design Multi-method case study. Method The study was undertaken in an acute 28-bed ward in a tertiary referral public hospital in Queensland, Australia. Ward-level administrative data were obtained for a 2-year period, 12 months before bed configuration changes in October 2015 and 12 months after. These data included patient activity (bed occupancy, transfers, length of stay and casemix) and nurse staffing (budgeted and actual staffing levels, employment status and skillmix). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ward nurses (N = 17) to explore the impact of the bed configuration changes on their workload. Results Administrative data showed that the bed configuration changes resulted in more complex and dependent patients, increased patient transfers and greater variability in casemix. The interview data found these changes to patient complexity and activity intensified workloads, which were further increased by staffing decisions that resulted in greater reliance on temporary staff. Conclusion Hospitals already possess the data and expert knowledge needed to improve staffing and bed management decisions without the need for additional, costly workload systems. Impact Determining appropriate nurse staffing in light of the complexities and variation of patient needs at the ward level remains a challenge. This study identified increases in patient complexity, dependency, variability and churn that increased workload. Staffing grew but hidden factors associated with temporary staffing and skillmix further intensified nurses? workload. Harnessing existing data and the expertise and experience of nursing unit managers (NUMs) would help staff wards more efficiently and effectively, providing reasonable workloads and appropriate skillmix that can enhance the safety and quality of patient care. To facilitate this, NUMs need access to accurate, timely, data and authority in staffing and bed management decisions.

AB  - Reliable, clinically useful, and globally applicable diagnostic classification of mental disorders is an essential foundation for global mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) is nearing completion of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The present study assessed inter-diagnostician reliability of mental disorders accounting for the greatest proportion of global disease burden and the highest levels of service utilization ? schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically associated with stress ? among adult patients presenting for treatment at 28 participating centers in 13 countries. A concurrent joint-rater design was used, focusing specifically on whether two clinicians, relying on the same clinical information, agreed on the diagnosis when separately applying the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. A total of 1,806 patients were assessed by 339 clinicians in the local language. Intraclass kappa coefficients for diagnoses weighted by site and study prevalence ranged from 0.45 (dysthymic disorder) to 0.88 (social anxiety disorder) and would be considered moderate to almost perfect for all diagnoses. Overall, the reliability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines was superior to that previously reported for equivalent ICD-10 guidelines. These data provide support for the suitability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for implementation at a global level. The findings will inform further revision of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines prior to their publication and the development of programs to support professional training and implementation of the ICD-11 by WHO member states.

AB  - Abstract Surgical site infections (SSI) are infectious complications that manifest at the incision site of a surgical patient, and are the result of a combination of host, pathogen, and environmental factors resulting in the establishment of infection. Because of the high prevalence of cruciate ligament rupture, and the popularity of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO), more studies have focused on this procedure than on any other stifle procedure. Extracapsular techniques for cruciate ligament stabilization have generally been associated with a lesser risk of infection. Even though SSI can occur up to a year postoperatively, most infections are diagnosed within the first couple of months after surgery. Radiographic signs of infection are generally mild and non-specific unless the infection is severe and chronic. Infections associated with the implant that develops after bone consolidation is often treated by implant removal, followed by a short course of antibiotics.
