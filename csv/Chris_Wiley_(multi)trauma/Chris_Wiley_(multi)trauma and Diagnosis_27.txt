AB  - Reliable, clinically useful, and globally applicable diagnostic classification of mental disorders is an essential foundation for global mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) is nearing completion of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The present study assessed inter-diagnostician reliability of mental disorders accounting for the greatest proportion of global disease burden and the highest levels of service utilization ? schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically associated with stress ? among adult patients presenting for treatment at 28 participating centers in 13 countries. A concurrent joint-rater design was used, focusing specifically on whether two clinicians, relying on the same clinical information, agreed on the diagnosis when separately applying the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. A total of 1,806 patients were assessed by 339 clinicians in the local language. Intraclass kappa coefficients for diagnoses weighted by site and study prevalence ranged from 0.45 (dysthymic disorder) to 0.88 (social anxiety disorder) and would be considered moderate to almost perfect for all diagnoses. Overall, the reliability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines was superior to that previously reported for equivalent ICD-10 guidelines. These data provide support for the suitability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for implementation at a global level. The findings will inform further revision of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines prior to their publication and the development of programs to support professional training and implementation of the ICD-11 by WHO member states.

AB  - Summary Vertebral fracture is usually the first osteoporotic fracture to occur and also the most common osteoporotic fracture, being present in 15% of women aged 50-59 years. Despite the clear clinical importance of vertebral fractures, they remain underdiagnosed in clinical practice. Good technique in performing spinal radiographs and a high level of observer experience in image interpretation are key to the reliable diagnosis of vertebral fractures. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) is being utilized increasingly for vertebral fracture identification. Density and structural parameters obtained by volumetric quantitative computed tomography (vQCT) can predict vertebral compressive strength ex vivo, and these parameters, together with nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) can also be applicable in vivo. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect minor acute or subacute vertebral fracture or re-fracture, determine fracture age, and distinguish between osteoporotic and neoplastic fracture with greater sensitivity than other imaging techniques.

AB  - Comparisons of skeletal data on diet, disease, and trauma in elite and non-elite population samples from Mississippian sites throughout the Southeast have yielded a variety of patterns, some contradictory and some paralleling expectations based upon ethnohistoric accounts of elite sumptuary behaviors. Although trace element analyses of human bone from Alabama and Tennessee sites suggest that elites ate relatively more meat than their presumed social inferiors, non-elite health does not seem particularly compromised. The high prevalence of trauma in elite males at Chucalissa may reflect the role of warfare in male status advancement. The lords of the Southeast and their families may have been in effect ?overnourished? relative to everyone else, but probably not to the extent of historically documented African and Polynesian chiefly lineages whose literally weighty embodiment of superior social status impressed visiting travellers and ethnographers alike.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the aetiological associations, neurological sequelae and role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in term newborn infants with seizures. Methods Cohort study of infants ≥37 weeks' gestation delivered in a tertiary level centre, prospectively identified and followed longitudinally for 18?24 months. Results An underlying aetiology was found in 95% of the 77 infants identified with seizures (3.0/1000 live births). The most common diagnosis was hypoxic?ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) (65%), followed by neonatal stroke (12%). Nine infants died, 28 of the 68 survivors developed neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), and 15 had recurrent seizures in the first 2 years, with both outcomes more likely in those with a diagnosis other than HIE. Abnormal MRI findings were found in 45 of the 70 infants imaged. The absence of major cerebral lesions was highly predictive of a normal neurological outcome. Conclusion We report the first cohort of term infants with seizures fully investigated by MRI. The universal use of MRI enabled a cause to be identified in 95% of cases. The probability of having NDI or recurrence of seizures was extremely low with absence of major cerebral lesions on MRI. This study demonstrates the added value of MRI for diagnosis of aetiology and the prediction of neurological outcome.

AB  - Abstract? Denture stomatitis is a common recurring problem of the denture wearers. The aetiology of the disease includes infection, trauma and probably a defect in the host defence mechanism. Current thinking suggests an interplay of most of these factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. The extent of interplay of these factors is still a controversy. Candida albicans has been implicated as the causative organism. However, in the light of recent research it is debatable if it is the only causative organism. Recently, cases resistant to antifungal therapy have been reported. In such cases other micro-organisms have been isolated. At the moment, comprehensive management includes meticulous denture hygiene together with anti-fungal or antibacterial therapy and correction of denture faults.

AB  - Summary.? Physiotherapy and radiography of the joints are standard diagnostic strategies for assessment of haemophilic arthropathy. The use of ultrasonography as an adjunct tool for early diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy may optimize factor replacement therapy. The objective of this study was to compare costs and effectiveness of physiotherapy, radiography and ultrasonography (intervention strategy, IS) with physiotherapy and radiography alone (standard care strategy, SCS) for diagnosing soft tissue and osteocartilaginous changes in haemophilic joints. We retrospectively compared costs and effectiveness of IS vs. SCS in knees, ankles and elbows of 31 children (age range, 4?17?years) with haemophilia A (n?=?30) or B (n?=?1) (IS, n?=?11; SS, N?=?20). Direct health care costs were measured from the provincial health care perspective. Effectiveness was measured by false-negative (FN) rates in each study arm by comparing presence or absence of abnormalities of physiotherapy and imaging exams to the reference standard measure (MRI). In scenario 1, all diagnostic tests matched with MRI. In scenario 2, at least one diagnostic test matched with MRI. The IS was more costly [incremental cost/100 patients, Canadian (CND) $4987] and more effective (incremental effectiveness, FNs/100 patients for scenario 1, ?4.09, and for scenario 2, ?41) for both scenarios. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for scenario 1 and for scenario 2 were CND$1166 and CDN$116 per FN result averted per 100 patients, respectively. In conclusion, in the short-term, the incorporation of ultrasonography in a test set for diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy substantially improved the diagnostic performance of this test set, however at an increased cost.

AB  - Abstract Oral Cavity. Most carcinomas in situ of the oral cavity present as red or pink lesions that do not have a keratinized surface. Scrapings of such lesions readily disclose abnormal squamous cells diagnostic of cancer. Scrapings of the keratinized white lesions (so-called leukoplakia) are of no diagnostic value. Dentists, who are most likely to uncover precancerous lesions, are apparently not aware of the diagnostic options based on simple scrape smears. The method is also applicable to follow-up of patients with treated cancer of the oral cavity. Esophagus. Cytologic evaluation of esophageal cancer, initially by washings and subsequently by brushings under endoscopic control, is an established method of diagnosis. The diagnostic results are very good in symptomatic cancer patients and have an accuracy reaching 85?90%. Unfortunately the results of treatment of advanced lesions are very poor, with 5-year survival of only about 5%. Serious efforts at detection of early esophageal cancer started in China in the 1960s, using an abrasive balloon technique which was applied to asymptomatic populations in high risk areas such as Linxian in the Henan province of Central China. The Chinese investigators reported the finding of numerous precancerous lesions of the esophagus classified as carcinoma in situ and as dysplasia. Surgical resection of some of the precursor lesions apparently resulted in a significant drop in the rate of invasive carcinoma, although the statistical results were not convincingly presented. The balloon technique has been tested by us and by others in South Africa and in Transkei, confirming its efficacy in the diagnosis of early esophageal cancer. Peripheral Lung. Sputum and bronchial brush cytology may uncover bronchogenic carcinoma in situ and early invasive cancers located in the primary or secondary bronchi. Small, peripheral lung lesions usually do not shed cells in sputum or brushings, and their discovery is usually based on roentgenologic finding. The identity of such lesions can be confirmed in most cases by a transcutaneous aspiration. Most of the peripheral malignant lesions are small adenocarcinomas or epidermoid carcinomas, both resectable by routine surgical procedures. Less commonly, oat cell carcinomas may be observed and these lesions should not be treated by surgery. Benign lesions such as granulomatous inflammation and fungal infections may also be identified by aspiration techniques. The prognosis of the resectable carcinomas varies with their size and the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases. Most importantly perhaps, many of these peripheral lesions occur in non-smokers or former smokers, slowly replacing in frequency the classical squamous bronchogenic carcinomas observed in smokers. It is clear that the optimal targets for chemoprevention are the oral and esophageal precursor lesions.

AB  - Abstract Clinical diagnosis of autoinflammatory diseases requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and clinching molecular evidence to substantiate the diagnosis. This is more so in populations with low prevalence of these disorders. In this report, we describe the case of a young man from India with recurrent fever and persistent arthritis. The patient's forefathers were of Egyptian ancestry who practiced consanguinity. Molecular genetic analysis using whole-exome sequencing suggested the presence of variants c.443A>T:p.E148V and c.442G>C:p.E148Q in the MEFV gene, earlier independently shown to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in a compound heterozygous state. The variants were further confirmed by capillary sequencing. This report also highlights the application of whole exome sequencing to delineate the allelic differences in the variants apart from serving as a quick genetic screening approach for autoinflammatory diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a compound heterozygosity for the two well-characterized variants associated with atypical FMF in a patient.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe case mix variation among institutions, and report adverse event rates in congenital cardiac catheterization by case type. Background: Reported adverse event rates for patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization vary considerably, due to non-comparable standards of data inclusion, and highly variable case mix. Methods: The Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Outcomes Project (C3PO) has been capturing case characteristics and adverse events (AE) for all cardiac catheterizations performed at six pediatric institutions. Validity and completeness of data were independently audited. Results: Between 2/1/07 and 4/30/08, 3855 cases (670 biopsy, 1037 diagnostic, and 2148 interventional) were recorded, median number of cases per site 480 (308 to 1526). General anesthesia was used in 70% of cases (28 to 99%), and 22% of cases (15 to 26%) were non-electively or emergently performed. Three institutions performed a higher proportion of interventions during a case, 72 to 77% compared to 56 to 58%. The median rate of AE reported per institution was 16%, ranging from 5 to 18%. For interventional cases the median rate of AE reported per institution was 19% (7 to 25%) compared to 10% for diagnostic cases (6 to 16%). The incidence of AE was significantly higher for interventional compared to diagnostic cases (20% vs 10%, p<0.001), as was the incidence of higher severity AE (9% vs 5%, p<0.001). Adverse events in biopsy cases were uncommon. Conclusions: In this multi-institutional cohort, the incidence of AE is higher among interventional compared to diagnostic cases, and is very low among biopsy cases. Equitable comparisons among institutions will require the development and application of risk adjustment methods.

AB  - Recent scientific reports and popular press describing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) collectively link this condition to a broad array of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including extremely rare and multi-determined behaviors such as murder-suicide. These reports are difficult to reconcile with several decades of research on the science of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its consequences, especially the natural history and prognosis of mild TBI. This article attempts to reconcile these sources by reviewing the state of the science on CTE, with particular attention to case definitions and neuropathological criteria for this diagnosis. The evidence for links between TBI, CTE, and catastrophic clinical events is explored, and the complexity of attributing rare frequency behavioral events to CTE is highlighted. The clinical and medicolegal implications of the best available evidence are discussed, concluding with a cautionary note against prematurely generalizing current findings on CTE to entire populations of persons with, or at risk for, concussion exposures.

AB  - Abstract Background Fibrosis, a proliferative response of fibrocytes after tissue injury, is a common sequela of external radiotherapy and can vary greatly among patients even in the absence of DNA repair syndromes, due to their different intrinsic radiosensitivity. Fibrosis is also a serious cosmetic problem for patients, and in some cases it can also imply pain. Case Here, we report a case of a severe fibrosis 2 years after breast conserving surgery and postoperative 3D conformal breast irradiation. Furthermore, our patient had the suspicion of tumour recurrence. Our examinations were aimed at diagnosing recurrence or the lack of recurrence and investigating whether the symptoms occurred due to overdosing or extreme intrinsic radiosensitivity. Therefore, examining the patients' radiosensitivity, a cytogenetic test was performed, which revealed the patient's increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation, and therefore we rejected the prospect of overdosage. As a solution for the fibrosis, mastectomy was effectuated, and a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was used for reconstruction. Conclusions We suggest a multi-disciplinary approach to manage fibrosis and propose cytogenetic markers to be used as predictors to identify patients who most likely benefit from a certain therapeutic regimen in terms of reduction of therapy-related side effects.

In taking a developmental approach to violence, a link is established between the maltreatment of children in an attachment context and the risk of violence via the child's capacity to envision mental states in the other. Evidence from epidemiology and neuroscience is brought to bear on this link. Finally, some studies of prevention of violence that are likely to enhance attachment and mentalizing are considered.

This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.

AB  - Background Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal skin disease of cats and dogs. The most common pathogens of small animals belong to the genera Microsporum and Trichophyton. It is an important skin disease because it is contagious, infectious and can be transmitted to people. Objectives The objective of this document is to review the existing literature and provide consensus recommendations for veterinary clinicians and lay people on the diagnosis and treatment of dermatophytosis in cats and dogs. Methods The authors served as a Guideline Panel (GP) and reviewed the literature available prior to September 2016. The GP prepared a detailed literature review and made recommendations on selected topics. The World Association of Veterinary Dermatology (WAVD) provided guidance and oversight for this process. A draft of the document was presented at the 8th World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology (May 2016) and was then made available via the World Wide Web to the member organizations of the WAVD for a period of three months. Comments were solicited and posted to the GP electronically. Responses were incorporated by the GP into the final document. Conclusions No one diagnostic test was identified as the gold standard. Successful treatment requires concurrent use of systemic oral antifungals and topical disinfection of the hair coat. Wood's lamp and direct examinations have good positive and negative predictability, systemic antifungal drugs have a wide margin of safety and physical cleaning is most important for decontamination of the exposed environments. Finally, serious complications of animal?human transmission are exceedingly rare.

AB  - Abstract Aim To explore the experiences, concerns and priorities of patients newly diagnosed with advanced malignant spinal cord compression and had significant problems with mobility at presentation. Background The consequences of malignant spinal cord compression can be devastating. Patients and their families are under pressure to adapt quickly to the significant functional impairment that occurs while coping with a diagnosis of advanced cancer. Much of the literature has focused on diagnosis and treatment and little is known about patients' experiences, priorities and concerns. Design A descriptive qualitative methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews and Framework Analysis techniques. Method A semi-structured interview schedule was developed to explore patient's descriptions of their experiences leading up to diagnosis and during their admission to the cancer centre along with their thoughts and feelings about their future with malignant spinal cord compression. The interviews took place after completion of radiotherapy before discharge home. Interviews were carried out between April 2009?March 2010. Findings Ten participants were interviewed. A dual narrative was identified in which participants talked about their concerns and emphasized their ability to cope and maintain a positive outlook. Patients' concerns and priorities were identified. Maintaining hope emerged as an important element of coping. Uncertainty was a source of hope. Conclusion The study provides insights into the experience of malignant spinal cord compression from symptom occurrence to diagnosis and beyond. The findings highlight the importance of early discharge planning and family involvement in meeting patients' priorities for care.

AB  - Abstract Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health costs. Although a wide range of psychological therapies have been used in the treatment of PTSD there are no systematic reviews of these therapies in children and adolescents. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of psychological therapies in treating children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with PTSD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to December 2011. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 -), MEDLINE (1950 -) and PsycINFO (1967 -). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. We applied no date or language restrictions. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies compared to a control, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or adolescents exposed to a traumatic event or diagnosed with PTSD. Data collection and analysis Two members of the review group independently extracted data. If differences were identified, they were resolved by consensus, or referral to the review team. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes, the standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both, using a fixed-effect model. If heterogeneity was found we used a random-effects model. Main results Fourteen studies including 758 participants were included in this review. The types of trauma participants had been exposed to included sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a trauma-related support service. The psychological therapies used in these studies were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure-based, psychodynamic, narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Most compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No study compared psychological therapies to pharmacological therapies alone or as an adjunct to a psychological therapy. Across all psychological therapies, improvement was significantly better (three studies, n = 80, OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.85) and symptoms of PTSD (seven studies, n = 271, SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.42), anxiety (three studies, n = 91, SMD -0.57, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.13) and depression (five studies, n = 156, SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.36) were significantly lower within a month of completing psychological therapy compared to a control group. The psychological therapy for which there was the best evidence of effectiveness was CBT. Improvement was significantly better for up to a year following treatment (up to one month: two studies, n = 49, OR 8.64, 95% CI 2.01 to 37.14; up to one year: one study, n = 25, OR 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69). PTSD symptom scores were also significantly lower for up to one year (up to one month: three studies, n = 98, SMD -1.34, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.89; up to one year: one study, n = 36, SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.01), and depression scores were lower for up to a month (three studies, n = 98, SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.13) in the CBT group compared to a control. No adverse effects were identified. No study was rated as a high risk for selection or detection bias but a minority were rated as a high risk for attrition, reporting and other bias. Most included studies were rated as an unclear risk for selection, detection and attrition bias. Authors' conclusions There is evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for treating PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. At this stage, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to others. There is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to psychological therapies than others. The findings of this review are limited by the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small size of identified studies. In addition, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of all psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other treatments. More details are required in future trials in regards to the types of trauma that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD and whether the traumas are single event or ongoing. Future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and reliable measures of PTSD symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and sub-scores, are consistently reported. Plain Language Summary Psychological therapies for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health costs. The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of all psychological therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents.  We searched for all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies to a control, other psychological therapies or other therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years. We identified 14 studies with a total of 758 participants. The types of trauma related to the PTSD were sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a trauma-related support service. The psychological therapies used in the included studies were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure-based, psychodynamic, narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Most included studies compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No study compared psychological therapies to medications or medications in combination with a psychological therapy. There was fair evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in the longer term and to be able to compare the effectiveness of one psychological therapy to another. The findings of this review are limited by the potential for bias in the included studies, possible differences between studies which could not be identified, the small number of identified studies and the low number of participants in most studies.
