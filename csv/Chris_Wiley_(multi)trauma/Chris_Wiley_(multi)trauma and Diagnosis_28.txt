AB  - Introduction Blood is often collected from performing poorly horses to measure blood variables that may indicate a reason. However, intense exercise affects many blood variables and therefore time of sampling can affect the interpretation of results. This study examined the behaviour of blood variables after racing to determine the magnitude of the changes and to determine when it is better to collect samples. Methods Blood was sampled in 17 Standardbred racehorses 3 and 2 days before as well as 2 and 3 days after racing. GGT, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, CK, AST, LDH and cortisol were measured in plasma, and haematocrit, haemoglobin, number of erythrocytes, total white blood cells, granulocytes and lymphocytes were measured in EDTA blood. Parametric data was analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher test; non-parametric data with Friedman test and Wilcoxon test. Results Plasma Ca concentration was lower on day 3 after racing than on day 2 before racing (P<0.01). P concentration and GGT activity were higher at days 2 and 3 after racing compared to before racing (P?=?0.01). Erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin were higher at day 2 after racing than before and 3 days after racing (P<0.01). The other variables were not affected. Conclusions Some slight but significant changes in blood variables have to be taken in account when interpreting biochemical and haematologic variables for poor performance diagnosis in Standardbreds. It seems preferable to take blood samples on the third day after racing than on the second day.

AB  - Abstract Background Leprosy or Hansen's disease is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) or Mycobacterium lepromatosis (M. lepromatosis). In Europe, most of the leprosy cases are imported. However, occasionally a case is diagnosed in one of the old endemic foci. Leprosy is often not suspected because it is no longer emphasized in the medical curricula. Attention shifted from leprosy to tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus infections in the late 20th century, whereby the WHO leprosy programme was toned down in the conviction that leprosy was all but eliminated. The result of unawareness is a harmful doctor's delay. Material and methods This paper focusses on clinical diagnosis, complications and treatment based on literature and experience. Results It mentions the value of laboratory tests in classification, follow-up and detection of relapses. It discusses the etiopathology. Conclusion This is a position statement.

AB  - Objective: To assess the value of routine bone marrow biopsy (8MB) in adult patients less than 65 years of age with suspected idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Design: Retrospective analysis. Data were collected from hospital medical records and laboratory results. Setting: Large tertiary-level metropolitan teaching hospital, Victoria. Participants: Sixty-six patients who had undergone BMB for investigation of isolated thrombocytopenia between January 1992 and May 1997, according to defined eligibility criteria. Results: Sixty-one of the 66 patients had BMB findings consistent with ITP (ie, normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes and other haemopoietic lineages normal). Three of these patients' biopsies incidentally showed reduced or absent iron stores. In the remaining five patients, BMB in four showed mild hypocellularity and the subsequent course in these patients was consistent with chronic ITP. The fifth patient had neutrophil hypersegmentation and giant band cells on 8MB, the cause of which was unclear. The subsequent course in this patient has also been consistent with chronic ITP. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the routine performance of BMB for the diagnosis of ITP is not useful, provided that a thorough clinical history and physical examination are undertaken and that the blood count and peripheral blood smear show no abnormalities apart from thrombocytopenia.

AB  - The association of bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans among others with periodontal disease offers the opportunity for the development of diagnostic tests that are based upon the detection and/or quantification of one or more of these organisms or their by-products in the plaque. Three of the putative periodontal pathogens namely, T. denticola, B. gingivalis, and B. forsythus, can hydrolyze the synthetic trypsin substrate, N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-naphthylamide (BANA) forming a color reaction. The present investigation evaluated a commercially developed solid state assay for BANA hydrolysis that can be read after 15 minutes incubation at chairside. A total of 702 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 117 patients seen at four university dental clinics and placed on reagent cards. The color development on the cards was compared to the presence of T. denticola and B. gingivalis in the plaque, and with the clinical appearance of the sampled sites. This multi-center study demonstrated that antibodies to B. gingivalis and T. denticola could detect these organisms by an ELISA in the majority of the subgingival plaque samples. Comparable information could be obtained when the same plaques were evaluated by the reagent card format for BANA hydrolysis. The ELISA and reagent card were comparable in their ability to distinguish between clinically healthy and diseased sites. Both diagnostic procedures detected the periodontopathogens in plaques from sites that were judged clinically healthy. The reagent card test has certain clinical advantages over the ELISA in that it is simple, can be performed quickly at chairside, and provides valuable information as to the pathogenicity of the microflora at discrete oral sites. Such information may be used in the detection of patients or intraoral sites at risk for periodontal disease. J Periodontol 1990;61:189-196.

AB  - Abstract Neuroimaging comprises a set of tools, which include different types of magnetic resonance imaging such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), and radiotracer imaging such as positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography. The focus of this review is to address the question whether fMRI can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders. Key anxiety processes and neural substrates are reviewed. The main findings and shortcomings of fMRI in the context of anxiety are briefly summarized. Finally, the next stages of developing fMRI for diagnosis and treatment are highlighted. The main conclusion of this review is that fMRI could become a clinical tool for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders, but neuroimaging groups will need to better develop its specificity and sensitivity so that fMRI results can be meaningful for an individual patient not just for groups of individuals.

AB  - Telomeropathies involve a wide variety of infrequent genetic diseases caused by mutations in the telomerase maintenance mechanism or the DNA damage response (DDR) system. They are considered a family of rare diseases that often share causes, molecular mechanisms and symptoms. Generally, these diseases are not diagnosed until the symptoms are advanced, diminishing the survival time of patients. Although several related syndromes may still be unrecognized this work describes those that are known, highlighting that because they are rare diseases, physicians should be trained in their early diagnosis. The etiology and diagnosis are discussed for each telomeropathy and the treatments when available, along with a new classification of this group of diseases. Ethical and legal issues related to this group of diseases are also considered.

AB  - The intrauterine development of the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most interesting fields in perinatology. The brain has three-dimensional structure and rapidly changes its appearance during pregnancy. Therefore, the fetal brain should be evaluated three-dimensionally with consideration of gestational age. Sonoembryology has been established by high-frequency transvaginal sonography. Premature brain structure and ventricular system of early fetuses can be clearly demonstrated and prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies has been done earlier and earlier. Application of transvaginal approach to the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters has enabled brain imaging from fetal parietal direction through fontanelles and cranial sutures, and ?neurosonography? has been established. Recent introduction of 3D ultrasound in neurosonography produced skull imaging, serial parallel images of the brain structure, volume extraction of target organ and brain circulatory images. Furthermore, advanced technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate CNS morphology including the brain stem, which is not clearly depicted by sonography. By using all those technologies, prenatal diagnosis of CNS abnormalities has been more objective and accurate. Intracranial changes in cases with CNS anomalies have been objectively demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, intrauterine acquired brain damage such as periventricular leukomalacia, which is one of the controversial issues in perinatology, has been proven by sonography in a few cases. Further case studies will be required for investigation of CNS pathology in utero.

Methods: Medical records of 10 dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology and treated with ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole were reviewed at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Laboratory abnormalities, side effects, clinical and cerebrospinal fluid responses to treatment and association between blood ciclosporin level and response to treatment were evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis was available in three patients. Results: No significant abnormalities were detected on serial complete blood count and serum chemistry panel in any of the dogs. Side effects of ciclosporin therapy included excessive shedding, gingival hyperplasia and hypertrichosis. Overall median survival time for all dogs in the study was 930 days (range, 60 to more than 1290 days). In all dogs, serial cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a marked improvement in the inflammation. Clinical Significance: Results suggest that ciclosporin either alone or in combination with ketoconazole may be a safe and effective treatment for meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Glutaric aciduria type I (synonym, glutaric acidemia type I) is a rare organic aciduria. Untreated patients characteristically develop dystonia during infancy resulting in a high morbidity and mortality. The neuropathological correlate is striatal injury which results from encephalopathic crises precipitated by infectious diseases, immunizations and surgery during a finite period of brain development, or develops insidiously without clinically apparent crises. Glutaric aciduria type I is caused by inherited deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase which is involved in the catabolic pathways of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine and L-tryptophan. This defect gives rise to elevated glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid, and glutarylcarnitine which can be detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (organic acids) or tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitines). Glutaric aciduria type I is included in the panel of diseases that are identified by expanded newborn screening in some countries. It has been shown that in the majority of neonatally diagnosed patients striatal injury can be prevented by combined metabolic treatment. Metabolic treatment that includes a low lysine diet, carnitine supplementation and intensified emergency treatment during acute episodes of intercurrent illness should be introduced and monitored by an experienced interdisciplinary team. However, initiation of treatment after the onset of symptoms is generally not effective in preventing permanent damage. Secondary dystonia is often difficult to treat, and the efficacy of available drugs cannot be predicted precisely in individual patients. The major aim of this revision is to re-evaluate the previous diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients with this disease and incorporate new research findings into the guideline.

AB  - Abstract Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a rare inherited disorder in the methionine catabolic pathway, in which the impaired synthesis of cystathionine leads to accumulation of homocysteine. Patients can present to many different specialists and diagnosis is often delayed. Severely affected patients usually present in childhood with ectopia lentis, learning difficulties and skeletal abnormalities. These patients generally require treatment with a low-methionine diet and/or betaine. In contrast, mildly affected patients are likely to present as adults with thromboembolism and to respond to treatment with pyridoxine. In this article, we present recommendations for the diagnosis and management of CBS deficiency, based on a systematic review of the literature. Unfortunately, the quality of the evidence is poor, as it often is for rare diseases. We strongly recommend measuring the plasma total homocysteine concentrations in any patient whose clinical features suggest the diagnosis. Our recommendations may help to standardise testing for pyridoxine responsiveness. Current evidence suggests that patients are unlikely to develop complications if the plasma total homocysteine concentration is maintained below 120 ?mol/L. Nevertheless, we recommend keeping the concentration below 100 ?mol/L because levels fluctuate and the complications associated with high levels are so serious.

AB  - Aims and objectives This study seeks to identify the factors that shape the communication networks of men who face a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer, and how these factors relate to their disclosure about their changing health status. Background Men facing a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer are in a challenging situation; the support benefits of disclosing their changing health status to others in their communication networks is set against a backdrop of the potential stigma and uncertainty of the diagnosis. Design All men on a prostate biopsy waiting list were eligible for inclusion in an exploratory and interpretive study. Methods Semi-structured interviews with 40 men explored their network structures and disclosure of health information. Thematic analysis highlighted the factors which contributed to their network structures and their disclosure about their health status. Results Four network factors shaped men's perspectives about disclosing their health status: (1) tie strength, comprising both strong and weak ties; (2) knowledgeable others, with a focus on medical professionals in the family; (3) homophily, which included other individuals with a similar medical condition; and (4) geographical proximity, with a preference for face-to-face communication. Conclusion Communication networks influence men's disclosure of their health status and in particular weak ties with medical knowledge have an important role. Men who use the potential for support in their networks may experience improved psychosocial outcomes. Relevance to clinical practice Using these four network factors-tie strength, knowledgeable others, homophily or geographical proximity-to forecast men's willingness to disclose helps identify men who lack potential support and so are at risk of poor psychosocial health. Those with few strong ties or knowledgeable others in their networks may be in the at-risk cohort. The support provided in communication networks complements formal medical care from nurses and other health professionals, and encouraging patients to use their communication networks improves the psychosocial health of the men themselves, their partners and their families.

AB  - Summary Double aortic arch is the most common congenital anomaly of the aortic arch system, in which the trachea and esophagus are completely encircled by vascular segments of the aortic arch and its branches, often resulting in variable airway compression. One case of late diagnosis of this congenital malformation and long-term consequences of late surgical treatment with persistent tracheo-broncomalacia and dynamic airway obstruction is reported. This report emphasizes the importance of an early diagnosis to minimise the progressive airways damage and subsequent respiratory symptoms, that need an accurate medical follow-up.

Methods Forty-one adolescents with cancer (10?17 years, 54% female) and their mothers self-reported PTSS at T1 (two months after cancer diagnosis) and T3 (1-year follow-up). At T2 (3 months after T1), mother?adolescent dyads were videotaped discussing cancer, and maternal communication was coded with macro (harsh and withdrawn) and micro (solicits and validations) systems. Results Adolescent PTSS at T1 was associated with adolescent PTSS at T3. Greater maternal PTSS at T1 predicted greater harsh maternal communication at T2. There was an indirect effect of maternal PTSS at T1 on adolescent PTSS at T3 through maternal validations at T2. Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of maternal PTSS, maternal communication, and subsequent adolescent PTSS over the course of treatment of childhood cancer.

AB  - Abstract Recent technical advances in neurodiagnostic procedures have improved significantly our knowledge of the pathophysiology of a number of disease processes and how they relate to behavioral manifestation. This paper focuses on advances in electroencephalography (EEG) and the implications that this growing body of research has for the diagnosis of suspected brain disorders in older patients.
