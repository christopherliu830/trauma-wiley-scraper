AB  - Abstract Among the millions of edentulous Americans, a persistent minority have not been able tolerate wearing dentures. Complicating factors may have precluded surgical intervention with grafts or dental implants to improve the physical and anatomic limitations of these unfortunate patients. A heat-cured polymer liner containing multiple small suction cups has been used for decades to successfully restore many such debilitated individuals. Two middle-aged female patients with edentulous maxillae and near fully dentate mandibles had both reached a point where they could no longer retain a maxillary complete denture, or function with it. Both had experienced multiple failed surgical attempts to improve their situations. They were both successfully restored with maxillary complete dentures containing heat-cured silicone liners with multiple small suction cups. Two young female maxillectomy patients had significant difficulties wearing maxillary obturators due to defect size and absence of defect undercuts. One had an edentulous maxilla, while the other had no axial undercuts on her few remaining maxillary teeth. Without an obturator, both suffered considerable air and fluid leaks, unintelligible speech, and swallowing problems. They too were successfully restored with obturators containing a heat-cured, multi-cup, silicone liner. The multi-cup, silicone denture liner has offered an economic, noninvasive alternative for patients unable or unwilling to undergo surgical intervention to facilitate prosthesis retention.

AB  - Abstract To be able to diagnose systemic candidiasis (SC) and to predict outcomes in SC patients are still challenging tasks for physicians. Previous proteomic studies suggest that anti-Candida methionine synthase (Met6p) IgG antibodies may be a candidate marker for SC. To evaluate their reliability for diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification in SC, we developed a generic prototype strategy for their measurement in SC. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses revealed a high diagnostic accuracy for this prototype format, which was slightly better to that for the widely used Western blot assays. Multivariate logistic-regression models showed a positive association between serum anti-Met6p IgG antibody levels and SC risk that was independent from established SC risk factors and other baseline variables. After adjusting for and stratifying according to known prognostic factors, a significant trend toward a lower two-month mortality risk with increasing levels was evidenced in SC patients at presentation. We conclude that these antibodies may be useful in discriminating SC from non-SC patients and determining risk stratification in SC. These may also confer protection against SC and be valuable for the design of future immunotherapies. Furthermore, our prototype format has the potential to make impact on other infectious diseases, cancers, allergies or autoimmune disorders.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Little is known about adult dental trauma experience at the population level. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and associations of dental injuries in New Zealand (NZ) adults. Materials and Method Information about dental and orofacial trauma in a representative sample of NZ adults (aged 18-94) was collected in a national oral health survey. As well as self-reported information, the maxillary six anterior teeth were examined for signs of dental trauma. Survey weights were used. Results Of the 40.9% (95% CI: 37.6, 44.2) who reported previous orofacial trauma, 69.1% (95% CI: 64.3, 73.5), or just over one-quarter of the sample, reported that this included a dental injury. More males than females had experienced orofacial trauma (51.3% [95% CI: 45.8, 56.8] and 31.4% [95% CI: 27.9, 35.1], respectively). The most common injury was a ?chipped or broken tooth? (66.6%, 95% CI: 60.6, 72.1). Almost three-quarters had sought treatment. Clinical examination revealed an overall trauma prevalence of 23.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 26.0) with more males than females affected. Some 14.9% (95% CI: 12.8, 17.2) had one injured tooth, while 6.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 8.1) had two injured teeth. The maxillary central incisors were the most frequently affected. Most participants with clinical signs of trauma had only one of the six maxillary teeth affected. The most common clinical dental trauma observation was evidence of ?treatment? or an ?untreated enamel fracture?, and these were more common among males and those aged 35-44 years. Conclusion Traumatic dental injuries constitute an important public health issue. More emphasis on preventing them in the NZ adult population is warranted, and public awareness of State-funded cover for dental injuries may need to be bolstered to enable equitable access for injury care. Overall, a greater emphasis on prevention and the importance of initial care for dental injuries could reduce the individual and societal burden.

AB  - Purpose No randomized controlled trials of treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) exist. Since severely preterm neonatal survival has increased over time, survival as an outcome measure is confounded by calendar time. The diagnosis-to-delivery interval is a calendar year independent measure of success of treatment. We wished to evaluate whether treatment of TTTS is associated with a lengthening of the diagnosis-to-delivery interval. Methods MEDLINE search supplemented by careful reference review. All TTTS series were included where the following information on each patient was available: survival, fetal demise, gestational age (GA) at diagnosis and diagnosis to delivery interval in days. Inclusion criteria GA?≤?29?weeks and diagnosis by ultrasound in the absence of maternal symptoms. Cases undergoing multiple types of treatment were excluded. Data were evaluated by Kruskal?Wallis anova, logistic regression & Wilcoxon rank sum testing. Results The 8 publications used included the following cases: controls (n?=?16), amnioreduction (n?=?61), septostomy (n?=?12), and fetoscopic laser occlusion of chorioangiopagus vessels (FLOC) (n?=?51). FLOC therapy showed a significantly longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction (median 75 vs. 56?days) (p?=?0.01). There was no difference in overall survival, at least one survivor, or number of fetal deaths between the 4 groups. Logistic regression using at least one survivor as the dependent variable revealed a positive association with GA at diagnosis and with diagnosis to delivery interval, a negative correlation with fetal death, and no correlation with treatment group. Conclusions FLOC therapy for TTTS is associated with a longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction without a significant increase in survival. The lack of increase in survival appears to be due to a small sample size.

AB  - Abstract Background Ground-glass nodules (GGNs), which are possible precursors of lung cancer, attract increasing attention. Many studies have attempted to identify the characteristic imaging features of GGNs for their qualitative diagnosis; however, the comprehension of GGNs remains controversial. We performed this study to identify imaging characteristics helpful to the differential diagnosis of solitary GGNs. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 112 solitary GGNs resected from 112 patients, pathologically examined after surgical resection. Imaging features of the GGNs, such as size, shape, a solid component, lobulation, spiculation, vascular convergence sign, pleural tag, and air cavity density, were assessed. Differences between malignant and benign nodules were analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 112 GGNs, 82 were malignant and 30 were benign. A solid component, vascular convergence sign, and a larger diameter were risk factors for malignancy, with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93.9%, 60.0%, and 84.8%, respectively. Lobulation, spiculation, air cavity densities, and pleural tags were also important indicators of malignancy, with positive predictive values of 93.5%, 83.3%, 91.7%, and 87.2%, respectively. Conclusion GGNs with a solid component, vascular convergence sign, and a larger diameter are highly suggestive of malignancy. The possibility of a neoplasm should also be considered in the case of GGNs that show lobulation, spiculation, air cavity densities, or pleural tags. To obtain a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the nodules, three-dimensional reconstruction is highly recommended.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is now an accepted standard of care for specific patients with malignant melanoma. With this comes an increase in sensitivity of diagnosis of melanoma metastases but also possible false positive results. Proceeding to a formal lmyphadenectomy in sentinel node positive patients is accompanied by a large amount of morbidity and should not be undertaken lightly. Melan-A is one of the stains used to identify melanoma metastases in sentinel node biopsies. The dilemma arises when there is a small number of Melan-A positive cells or even a single Melan-A positive cell in the entire examined sentinel node. Do we proceed to formal lymphadenectomy or ?watch & wait?. The purpose of this projected study is to examine the sentinel nodes of patients without a diagnosis of melanoma. We aim to perform a Melan-A stain on these nodes and identify the incidence of Melan-A positive staining nodes in presumed melanoma free patients. These nodes will be taken from sentinel nodes of breast cancer patients.

AB  - Objective To describe the bacterial bio-burden of open-treated wounds and make comparisons with bite wounds. Design Retrospective multicentre study. Sample Microbial culture between 2011 and 2013 from open-treated wounds in dogs and cats (initiation of therapy n=88, follow-up n=52) were compared to those from bite wounds (n=184). Procedures Bacteria were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by two accredited laboratories. Results In total, 77/88 (88%) of open-treated wounds yielded positive bacterial cultures at the beginning of treatment, decreasing to 27/52 (52%) during treatment. Upon initial evaluation, 42/88 (48 %) of open-treated wounds were considered infected with multi-drug-resistant bacteria, with a drop to 22/52 (41%) during therapy. Bite wounds yielded fewer positive cultures 88/184 (48%) with only 11/182 (6%) being affected by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Bacteria found most commonly in open-treated wounds were Enterococcus subspecies, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusion The bacterial populations of open-treated wounds differed markedly from the bite wounds. The high incidence of multi-drug-resistant strains in open wounds highlights the need for alternatives to antibiotics.

AB  - Summary: A multi-institutional study on the prognosis of patients with epilepsy was performed in Japan from 1975 to 1977, including 20 institutions. The outcome of epileptic seizures and social adjustment 10, 5, and 3 years after the onset of the illness was studied in three different groups of epileptic patients, respectively. The number of successfully followed-up cases was 1,868 in total, follow-up rate being 42%. The data were analyzed statistically by use of analysis of variance. The rate of remission of seizures in all was 58.3% and the rate of normal social adjustment 62.6%. The remission rate showed no significant difference among the 10-, 5-, and 3-year outcome groups. The study on the outcome of seizure control indicated that the prognosis of seizure control is more favorable (a) in idiopathic than in residual or symptomatic epileptics; (b) in patients with onset before 10 years of age than in those with onset after 10 years; (c) in patients with less frequent seizures; (d) in sleep epilepsy than in waking and diffuse epilepsies; (e) in patients who started treatment within 1 year of onset of seizure; (f) in patients with single-type partial seizures than in those with partial seizures combined with tonic-clonic seizures; (g) in patients without high grade EEG background abnormality; and (h) in patients without neurological symptoms, intellectual deficits, personality disturbances, or psychotic symptoms. Factors that determine the prognosis of social adjustment were almost similar to those for remission of seizures. There was a close correlation between the outcome of seizure control and that of social adjustment. Correlation coefficient between follow-up rate and remission rate in 15 of the 20 collaborated institutions was 0.55 (p < 0.05), showing a tendency that the remission rate becomes higher as the follow-up rate is raised. RÉSUMÉ Une étude collaborative multi-institutionnelle sur le pronostic des épilepsies a été effectuée au Japon de 1975 à 1977 dans 20 institutions différentes. Le devenir des crises et l'adaptation sociale ont été appréciés chez 3 groupes différents de patients 10 ans, 5 ans et 3 ans après le debut de la maladie. Le nombre des cas dont l'évolution a pu être suivie de façon satisfaisante est de 1868, ce qui répond à une proportion de 42%. Les données ont ete analysees statistiquement par analyse de variance. Le taux de rémission des crises a été au total de 58,3% et le taux d'adaptation sociale normale de 62,6%. Il n'a pas été noté de différence significative du taux de rémission entre les 3 groupes. En ce qui concerne le pronostic des crises, il s'est avéré meilleur: 1o chez les sujets qui présentent une épilepsie idiopathique (et non symptomatique); 2o chez ceux dont les crises sont apparues avant l'âge de 10 ans; 3o chez ceux dont le crises sont rares; 4o chez ceux dont les crises surviennent pendant le sommeil; 5o chez ceux qui ont débuté le traitement dans l'année qui a suivi le début des crises; 6o chez ceux qui présentent un seul type de crises partielles par rapport à ceux dont les crises partielles sont combinees à des crises tonicocloniques; 7o chez ceux dont les rythmes de fond EEG ne sont pas très anormaux; 8o chez ceux qui ne présentent pas de troubles neurologiques, de déficit intellectuel, de troubles de la personnalité ou de symptomes psychotiques. Les facteurs qui déterminent le pronostic de l'adaptation sociale sont à peu près les mêmes que ceux qui concernent la rémission des crises. Il y a d'ailleurs une étroite corrélation entre ces deux pronostics. Le coefficient de corrélation entre le taux de rémission et la durée de l'observation des sujets dans 15 des 20 institutions collaboratives est de 0,55 (p < 0,05) et exprime la tendance pour le taux de rémission d'être d'autant plus grand que la durée d'observation est prolongée. RESUMEN Entre los an?os 1975 y 1977 se realizó en Japón un estudio multi-institucional (abarcando 20 Centros) con objeto de establecer el pronóstico de pacientes con epilepsia. Se estudiaron le evolución de las crisis comiciales y la integración social en 3 grupos diferentes de pacientes epilepticos 10 años, 5 an?os y 3 an?os después del comienzo de la enfermedad. El número de casos seguidos con éxito fue 1.868 en total, siendo la tasa de seguimiento del 42%. Se analizaron estadísticamente los datos por medio del análisis de la varianza. La tasa de remisión de las crisis fue en total del 58,3% y la tasa de ajuste social del 62,6%. La tasa de remisión no mostró diferencias significativas en los grupos evolutivos de 10, 5 y 3 años. El estudio pronóstico reveló que el control de los ataques era más favorable en la epilepsyía idiopática que en la residual o sintomática; en pacientes con un comienzo de las crisis antes de los 10 años de edad que después; en pacientes con crisis menos frecuentes; en epilepsyía relacionada con el sueño que la que tenia lugar durante la vigilia o era difusa; en pacientes que empezaron tratamiento antes del año del inicio de los ataques; en enfermos con un único tipo de crisis parciales que en aquéllos que presentaban crisis parciales y tónico-clonicas; en pacientes sin anomalías groseras de la actividad de fondo en el EEG y en enfermos sin síntomas neurológicos, déficit intelectual, alteraciones de la personalidad o síntomas psicóticos. Los factores que determinaron el pronóstico en lo que respecta a ajuste social eran casi similares a los relacionados con la remisión de los ataques. Hubo una estrecha correlación entre el pronóstico del control de las crisis y el grado de ajuste social. El coeficiente de correlación entre la tasa de revisiones y la tasa de remisiones en 15 de los 20 Centros fue 0,55 (p< 0,05), mostrando una tendencia a que las remisiones fuesen mayores a medida que la tasa de re-evaluaciones aumenta. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Eine kollaborative Studie über die Prognose von Patienten mit Epilepsie wurde in Japan an 20 Institutionen von 1975 bis 1977 durchgeführt. Der Verlauf epileptischer Anfälle und die soziale Anpassung wurden 10 Jahre, 5 Jahre und 3 Jahre nach Beginn der Erkrankung in 3 verschiedenen Gruppen epileptischer Patienten untersucht. Insgesamt wurden 1868 Patienten erfolgreich verfolgt, das sind 42%. Die Daten wurden mit Hilfe der Varianz-analyse statistisch bearbeitet. Die Heilungsquote für alle Anfälle betrug 58,3%, die Rate der normalen sozialen Anpassung 62,6%. Die Heilungsquote zeigte keine deutlichen Unterschiede zwischen den Zehnjahres-, Fünfjahres- und Dreijahresergebnissen. Die Aufschlüsselung ergab, daß die Prognose hinsichtlich Anfallsfreiheit günstiger bei der idiopathischen als bei der residualen Oder symptomatischen Epilepsie ist; günstiger schneiden Patienten mit Anfallsbeginn vor dem Alter von 10 Jahren ab, Patienten mit seltenen Anfällen, Patienten mit Schlaf-Epilepsie verglichen mit Wachoder diffuser Epilepsie, Patienten, bei denen die Behandlung innerhalb eines Jahres nach erstem Anfall eingeleitet wurde, Patienten mit isolierten Herdanfällen als solche mit Partialanfällen kombiniert mit tonisch-klonischen Krämpfen, Patienten ohne hochgradige Hintergrundsveranderungen im EEG, Patienten ohne neurologische Symptome, intellektuelle Defekte, Verhaltungsstorungen oder psychotische Symptome. Die Faktoren, die die Prognose hinsichtlich der sozialen Eingliederung bestimmen, waren ähnlich denen, die eine Anfallsfreiheit entschieden. Der Korrelationskoeffizient zwischen der Verlaufsrate und der Anfallsfreiheit betrug bei 15 der 20 kolla-borierenden Institutionen 0,55 (p < 0,05). Er zeigt somit die Tendenz, daß die Anfallsfreiheit höher wird in dem Maße, in dem die Häufigkeit der Kontroll-untersuchungen zunimmt.

AB  - Background Patients with traumatic bladder rupture frequently have associated pelvic fracture. With increasing numbers of pelvic fractures fixed internally, there are concerns that conservative management of bladder rupture may increase the risk of pelvic metalware infection. This study aims to determine if operative repair of bladder rupture in comparison to conservative management with catheter drainage alone is associated with a lower rate of infection of internal fixation device for concurrent pelvic fracture. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of level IV evidence. From July 2001 through June 2013, 45 multi-trauma patients at a level 1 trauma centre were identified to have sustained bladder rupture with concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation. Clinicopathological data were extracted from the TraumaNET database, medical records and health-coding database. Patients were stratified into two retrospective cohorts, management with surgical repair and management with catheter drainage alone. Fischer's exact test was used to determine whether the rate of pelvic metalware infection was different in the two cohorts. Results Of the 45 patients, 13 had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, 28 had extraperitoneal bladder rupture and four had combined intra-extraperitoneal bladder rupture. The median age for this cohort was 31. Bladder rupture was surgically repaired in 36 patients and managed conservatively with catheter drainage in nine patients. The rate of pelvic internal fixation device infection was lower in patients managed with surgical repair compared with conservative management (5.6% versus 33.3%, P = 0.047). Conclusion Operative repair of bladder rupture is associated with a lower rate of pelvic orthopaedic hardware infection in the presence of concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Survival and causes of death of 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) were examined. The patients were originally found in a community-based epidemiological survey of dementia, and all patients with AD or MID alive on the prevalence day were included. The 6-years survival rate for AD was 21.1% vs. the expected rate 48.5%, that for MID 11.9% vs. 45.2% expected. A comparison of relative survival rates suggested that MID carries a less favorable survival prognosis than AD. The mean durations were: AD 5.7 years and MID 5.2 years; median duration being 5 years in both diseases. The excess mortality in both AD and MID was independent of age. In AD, the survival rate decreased with increasing severity of dementia, while in MID the mortality was the same regardless of the severity of the dementia. The dementia disorder was the underlying cause of death in 68% of AD patients, and in 38% of MID patients, bronchopneumonia being the most frequent immediate cause of death in both groups. As a cause of death, acute cerebrovascular accidents occurred more often in MID patients than in the general population of comparable age. Malignant diseases were less frequent as a cause of death in both dementia groups than in the general population.

AB  - Abstract Through the application of the Delphi technique, this study draws on the expertise of British child protection academics and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines in seeking to develop a consensus opinion on possible early indicators of child abuse and neglect. The search for early indicators is described in the context of a secondary preventative approach to the problem of child maltreatment. A very tentative conclusion arising from the study is that the early indicators of child abuse and neglect that achieved consensus of agreement may help in diagnosing child abuse and neglect at an earlier stage, although they are not necessarily diagnostic. Alternative explanations, differential diagnoses and information-gathering are paramount, as is a willingness and ability to act on concerns. Although great caution is urged, it is suggested that the findings from the study are credible and of interest to those who are working towards more timely recognition and referral of abused and neglected children.

AB  - Objective To evaluate outcome and adverse events following ventral stabilization of the atlantoaxial (AA) joint in dogs with clinical AA subluxation using screw/polymethymethacrylate (PMMA) constructs in a retrospective, multi-center cohort study. Study Design Historical cohort study. Animals 35 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 3 institutions were reviewed to identify dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw and PMMA constructs. Data on signalment, pre- and postoperative neurologic status, imaging performed, and adverse events were retrieved. Neurologic examination data were abstracted to generate a modified Frankel score at admission, discharge, and re-examination. Telephone interview of owners >180 days postoperative was conducted. Results Thirty-five dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw/PMMA constructs were included. Most dogs were young (median age 1 year), small breed dogs with acute onset of neurologic signs (median duration 22.5 hours). Most dogs were non-ambulatory at the time of admission (median modified Frankel score 3). Adverse events were identified in 15/35 dogs including 9 dogs with major adverse events. Four dogs required a second surgery due to vertebral canal violation (n?=?2) or implant failure (n?=?2). Re-examination at 4?6 weeks postoperative reported 15/28 dogs with improved neurologic status and 19/28 dogs were ambulatory. Telephone follow-up was available for 23/35 dogs with 23/23 reported as ambulatory (median follow-up 390 days). Conclusions Ventral application of screw and PMMA constructs for AA subluxation, as described here, is associated with clinical improvement in the majority of dog. Major adverse events are infrequent and the technique is considered relatively safe.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the rationale behind and experiences with traditional and newly evolving concepts of fluid therapy in the traumatized patient, and to review conventional and novel fluid preparations for use in trauma resuscitation. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical and research studies. Human data synthesis: Current treatment guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution (LRS) or saline as optimum management of hemorrhagic shock in trauma, regardless of whether bleeding is controlled or not. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore intravascular volume as rapidly as possible to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion. Recently, this strategy has been challenged, especially in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, as neither laboratory evidence nor clinical trials support this practice. Current research indicates that vigorous fluid infusion may exacerbate bleeding and cause severe hemodilution, both impairing resuscitation outcome. As a result, a new line of thinking is emerging that balances the risks and benefits of intravenous volume infusion by offering the clinician alternative treatment strategies and emphasizes continuous endpoint-oriented monitoring. ?Hypotensive? or ?hypovolemic? resuscitation techniques as well as initial volume replacement with fluids other than LRS or saline (e.g., hypertonic saline [HTS], HTS with dextran 70 [HTS-D]) have been introduced in human medical practice as additional options for treatment of victims of trauma under certain circumstances. Clinical studies evaluating the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) in the trauma setting are underway and may soon lead to an expansion of the fluid arsenal available to the clinician for treatment of trauma patients. Veterinary data synthesis: Based on available animal data, neither strict guidelines nor a clear fluid preference for resuscitation of traumatic shock have been defined. Although systematic clinical trials are missing, combinations of crystalloid and colloid (natural or artificial) appear to be as effective for resuscitation as crystalloid alone. Judicious use of an HBOC (e.g., Oxyglobin?) as a substitute for blood/red blood cells may be recommended in situations where whole blood or pRBCs are not or not yet available. Conclusions: The search for optimal methods of fluid resuscitation in trauma is ongoing. At this point the best solution is a differentiated approach to fluid therapy, one that tailors type and volume of resuscitation solution(s) used to the type and severity of injury in an individual patient and uses monitoring of perfusion and oxygenation parameters to guide resuscitation. Crystalloid fluids are effective for resuscitation but may need to be combined with or replaced by colloidal fluids in certain clinical situations.

AB  - Asymptomatic tumors are not uncommon, may be diagnosed during clinical examination or during surgical interventions for other purposes such as treatment of a hemorrhage due a blunt trauma. Case report? 6 year-old boy had fallen, hitting his abdomen against a rock, and arrived at hospital ten hours later. Initial assessment he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain; his physical examination showed: respiratory rate: 16?mov/min, blood pressure: 100???80?mmHg, heart rate: 100?bat/min, and Glasgow coma score: 15. His abdomen was distended, with guarding and rebound tenderness, and had a palpable mass. FAST ultrasound was positive; and Ct-scan showed an abdominal mass with 15???12???7?cm dimension, and moderate amount of free blood in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9?mg/dl, hematocritic 28.8%, white blood cells 6.900?cel/dl. Midline laparotomy was performed, a large, injured and bleeding mesenteric mass was found encircling superior mesentery artery and several small bowel loops; 500?ml of free blood was found in the peritoneal cavity. Mesenteric mass was partially removed with a segment of the small bowel. Findings of anatomico-pathologic examination revealed an intestinal Burkitt lymphoma, with mesenteric linfonodes. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and started with quimotherapy. Comments? This case report shows an unusual traumatic abdominal blending that could not be clearly diagnosed before laparotomy was performed. The emergency of this case was bleeding control, decision to remove mass was taken only for this purpose, and not to treat the tumor. As removal of the whole mass was impossible, a partial removal was performed.
