AB  - Summary Inherited disorders of platelet granules are clinically heterogeneous and their prevalence is underestimated because most patients do not undergo a complete diagnostic work-up. The lack of a genetic diagnosis limits the ability to tailor management, screen family members, aid with family planning, predict clinical progression and detect serious consequences, such as myelofibrosis, lung fibrosis and malignancy, in a timely manner. This is set to change with the introduction of high throughput sequencing (HTS) as a routine clinical diagnostic test. HTS diagnostic tests are now available, affordable and allow parallel screening of DNA samples for variants in all of the 80 known bleeding, thrombotic and platelet genes. Increased genetic diagnosis and curation of variants is, in turn, improving our understanding of the pathobiology and clinical course of inherited platelet disorders. Our understanding of the genetic causes of platelet granule disorders and the regulation of granule biogenesis is a work in progress and has been significantly enhanced by recent genomic discoveries from high-powered genome-wide association studies and genome sequencing projects. In the era of whole genome and epigenome sequencing, new strategies are required to integrate multiple sources of big data in the search for elusive, novel genes underlying granule disorders.

AB  - Aim These international clinical practice recommendations (CPR) for developmental coordination disorder (DCD), initiated by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD), aim to address key questions on the definition, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and psychosocial aspects of DCD relevant for clinical practice. Method Key questions in five areas were considered through literature reviews and formal expert consensus. For recommendations based on evidence, literature searches on ?mechanisms?, ?assessment?, and ?intervention? were updated since the last recommendations in 2012. New searches were conducted for ?psychosocial issues? and ?adolescents/adults?. Evidence was rated according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (level of evidence [LOE] 1?4) and transferred into recommendations. For recommendations based on formal consensus, two meetings of an international, multidisciplinary expert panel were conducted with a further five Delphi rounds to develop good clinical practice (GCP) recommendations. Results Thirty-five recommendations were made. Eight were based on the evidence from literature reviews (three on ?assessment?, five on ?intervention?). Twenty-two were updated from the 2012 recommendations. New recommendations relate to diagnosis and assessment (two GCPs) and psychosocial issues (three GCPs). Additionally, one new recommendation (LOE) reflects active video games as adjuncts to more traditional activity-oriented and participation-oriented interventions, and two new recommendations (one GCP, one LOE) were made for adolescents and adults with DCD. Interpretation The CPR?DCD is a comprehensive overview of DCD and current understanding based on research evidence and expert consensus. It reflects the state of the art for clinicians and scientists of varied disciplines. The international CPR?DCD may serve as a basis for national guidelines. What this paper adds Updated international clinical practice guidelines on developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Refined and extended recommendations on clinical assessment and intervention for DCD. A critical synopsis of current research on mechanisms of DCD. A critical synopsis of psychosocial issues in DCD, with implications for clinical practice. The first international recommendations to consider adolescents and adults with DCD.

AB  - Summary Accurate pharmacoepidemiologic study conclusions require assessment of valid data, regardless of whether the data originate from questionnaires, administrative claims, or electronic health records. This chapter provides an overview of current methodologic concerns in validation studies, including types and detection of measurement error, effects of error on the point estimate of association, and correction options. Validity issues for diagnosis and medication data, and how the accuracy of these data varies by patient and other characteristics, are also discussed. Two examples are provided to illustrate validation efforts for questionnaires and electronic data: nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and myocardial infarction and NSAIDs and gastrointestinal bleeding. Current solutions include steps to consider when designing and analyzing validation studies using either questionnaire or electronic data. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the continued need for validation studies, especially as research moves toward incorporation of new data sources, increase in data linkage, and use of unstructured data for pharmacoepidemiology research.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate nursing home residents with psychiatric diagnoses who wander and who are not diagnosed with dementia. Method A national cross-sectional study was conducted in a male Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit population using a retrospective review of the MDS. Results Eleven thousand six hundred and nineteen residents were identified as having a psychiatric diagnosis without significant cognitive impairment; just under 1% (n?=?113) wandered. Using rare events logit regression, we determined that a diagnosis of schizophrenia/bipolar disorder or comorbid psychiatric conditions were associated with increased risk of wandering compared to residents diagnosed with anxiety/depression. Psychiatric wanderers were also more likely to, have symptoms of delirium, exhibit socially inappropriate behavior, manifest problems in decision-making, take anti-psychotic medications, and to be more independent in locomotion. Conclusions Psychiatric wanderers may be conceptualized better as exhibiting ambulatory concomitants of unremitted neurological/psychiatric symptoms or medication side effects of their treatment. Findings have implications for addressing treatable causes of wandering. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Are multi family groups appropriate for patients with first episode psychosis? A 5-year naturalistic follow-up study. Objective:? To compare outcome over 5?years for patients who participated in multi family groups (MFGs) to those who refused or were not offered participation. Method:? Of 301 first episode psychotic patients aged 15?65?years, 147 participated in MFGs. Outcome was measured by drop-out rates, positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) symptom scores, and duration of psychotic episodes during the follow-up period. Results:? Multi family group participants had a significantly lower drop-out rates at 5-year follow-up than patients who did not participate. However, the MFG participants had significantly less improvement in PANSS positive and excitative symptoms and had significantly longer duration of psychotic symptoms during the follow-up period. Conclusion:? Multi family groups appear to increase the chance of retaining patients in a follow-up study, but adjustment of the programme may be necessary with first episode psychosis patients to meet their needs better.

AB  - Background:? Comparatively little is known about the cognitive appraisals and coping styles of child road traffic accident (RTA) survivors that are associated with chronic post-traumatic reactions. Methods:? Seventy-five children and young people aged 7?18 who were involved in a road traffic accident and attended an accident and emergency department were assessed 8?months after their accident. Post-traumatic symptoms were assessed by diagnostic interview (CAPS-C) and self-report questionnaires (IES). Demographic, accident and injury severity variables were recorded. Informed by the Ehlers and Clark (2000) model, trauma memory, subjective appraisals of the trauma and cognitive coping styles were assessed. Results:? Gender was the only non-cognitive variable associated with significant post-traumatic reactions and explained 5?6% of the overall variance. Trauma memory did not significantly contribute to the final regression model. The addition of the remaining cognitive factors assessing subjective appraisals of the trauma and cognitive coping style resulted in the model accounting for 61?65% of the variance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 8?months post trauma. Conclusion:? This study adds support to the applicability of the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model to children. The results indicate that the theoretically determined appraisals and cognitive coping styles are associated with chronic post-traumatic reactions. The findings suggest the need to develop trauma-focused interventions for children that directly address these key cognitions during therapy.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to assess the effects on counselors of working with sexual violence survivors. Members of a women psychologists? organization and a group of sexual violence counselors completed questionnaires regarding the extent of their work with survivors and their psychological functioning. Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported more disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the goodness of other people), more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and more self-reported vicarious trauma. Symptomatology was not related to counselors? own history of victimization. Qualitative data regarding difficult and enjoyable aspects of working with survivors also were gathered, along with data on the strategies used by counselors to cope with work-related stress. implications for counselor training are discussed.

AB  - Dysphagia is associated with aspiration, pneumonia, and malnutrition, but remains challenging to identify at the bedside. A variety of exam protocols and maneuvers are commonly used, but the efficacy of these maneuvers is highly variable. We conducted a comprehensive search of 7 databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus, from each database's earliest inception through June 9, 2014. Studies reporting diagnostic performance of a bedside examination maneuver compared to a reference gold standard (videofluoroscopic swallow study or flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing) were included for analysis. From each study, data were abstracted based on the type of diagnostic method and reference standard study population and inclusion/exclusion characteristics, design, and prediction of aspiration. The search strategy identified 38 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Overall, most bedside examinations lacked sufficient sensitivity to be used for screening purposes across all patient populations examined. Individual studies found dysphonia assessments, abnormal pharyngeal sensation assessments, dual axis accelerometry, and 1 description of water swallow testing to be sensitive tools, but none were reported as consistently sensitive. A preponderance of identified studies was in poststroke adults, limiting the generalizability of results. No bedside screening protocol has been shown to provide adequate predictive value for presence of aspiration. Several individual exam maneuvers demonstrated reasonable sensitivity, but reproducibility and consistency of these protocols was not established. More research is needed to design an optimal protocol for dysphagia detection. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2015;10:256?265. ? 2015 Society of Hospital Medicine

This transpired amidst pervasive, pre-disaster hardships, with the resulting situation described as ?acute on chronic? trauma exposure. The current paper provides a description of a dynamic model focused on three factors of consideration for similar crises: cultural context, unfolding traumatic events and developmental processes. Knowledge from developmental psychology can inform humanitarian aid efforts to effectively address the unique needs of children. Recommendations are offered for research, clinical work and policy related to the mental health needs of children where ?acute on chronic? conditions exist.

AB  - Computed tomography is the cornerstone of modern radiology and arguably the most important modality in terms of clinical impact. CT is used extensively for emergencies, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, orthopedic and other applications - often as the first and only imaging procedure needed for diagnosis, characterization, staging, treatment planning, and follow-up. CT is often the first and only modality needed. There is high likelihood that a patient will have a CT scan in the emergency department, as an outpatient, or as an inpatient for a multitude of indications - trauma, suspected infection or malignancy, and frequently to investigate symptoms such as pain and fever, or to answer a question raised by another test, such as an EKG abnormality or ultrasound finding. Many other modalities are available, including MRI, ultrasound, fluoroscopy and nuclear medicine PET and SPECT. Depending on the clinical question, more than one modality may be required, so questions raised in a CT exam could be resolved with PET or MRI. Each modality has strengths and limitations which are known and recognized relative to the clinical indication. Since pre-certification may be required by payors prior to imaging, these indications are important for reimbursement. The principal drivers for clinical imaging, both single and multi-modality today are reimbursement, radiation dose, workflow efficiency, and availability. Multimodality imaging is most frequently applied to solve complex or demanding clinical problems, and almost never used for screening. A major advantage of CT in hospitals and clinics as well as free-standing imaging centers, is its availability 24/7, while other modalities such as US and MRI may be limited to scheduled examinations in the majority of cases. Multimodality scanners based on CT incorporate PET/SPECT and MRI to combine morphologic and functional imaging. The most demanding imaging applications are cardiovascular, where complex motion and small morphologic features coexist, so imaging methods that are very satisfactory elsewhere in the body may not be successful. Clinical CT scanning consists of administering toxic materials, e.g., contrast media, while monitoring the EKG and illuminating the body with high brightness x-rays. Larger area detectors and higher acquisition rates are welcome improvements, but don't solve all of the problems encountered with scan variability due to respiratory, whole body, and cardiac motion, especially in a spectrum of patients from infant to massively obese adult sizes (< 1 kg to 250 kg or more). The challenges and pitfalls in CT and multimodality imaging will be delineated and evaluated relative to current and future technology. Learning Objectives: 1. The role of x-ray computed tomography (CT) is central to multimodality imaging in diagnosis, staging, treatment planning and follow-up. 2. The principal drivers for CT and complementary use of other modalities are availability, reimbursement, workflow, and radiation dose. The influence of these factors on clinical decision making will be outlined and illustrated. 3. The limitations of a single modality, such as CT, can be overcome by integrating complementary instrumentation, especially PET/SPECT, MRI and others (such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy) to provide simultaneous morphologic and functional imaging.

AB  - Background and Objectives To examine the associations between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, stimulant use, and treatment outcomes among dually diagnosed women. Methods Participants were 141 women who participated in a multisite clinical trial of group treatments for PTSD and addictions. Results Generalized linear models indicated Seeking Safety (SS; a cognitive-behavioral intervention) was significantly more effective than Women's Health Education (WHE; a control group intervention) in reducing stimulant use at follow-up among women who were heavy stimulant users at pre-treatment and who showed improvements in PTSD symptoms. There were no significant differences between the interventions among women who were light stimulant users at treatment entry. Conclusions and Scientific Significance These findings suggest that integrated treatment of co-occurring PTSD and addictions may be more effective than general health education approaches for heavy stimulant users. Assessment of frequency of stimulant use among individuals with PTSD symptoms may inform treatment selection for this population. (Am J Addict 2014;23:90?95)

AB  - Purpose To visualize healthy and abnormal articular cartilage, we investigated the potential of using the 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) signal's magnitude and frequency and maps of relaxation. Materials and Methods After optimizing imaging parameters in five healthy volunteers, 3D multi-echo GRE magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired at 3T in four patients with chondral damage prior to their arthroscopic surgery. Average magnitude and frequency information was extracted from the GRE images, and maps were generated. Cartilage abnormalities were confirmed after arthroscopy and were graded using the Outerbridge classification scheme. Regions of interest were identified on average magnitude GRE images and compared to arthroscopy. Results All four patients presented with regions of Outerbridge Grade I and II cartilage damage on arthroscopy. One patient had Grade III changes. Grade I, II, and III changes were detectable on average magnitude and maps, while Grade II and higher changes were also observable on MR frequency maps. For average magnitude images of healthy volunteers, the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnitude image averaged over three echoes was 4.26?±?0.32, 12.26?±?1.09, 14.31?±?1.93, and 13.36?±?1.13 in bone, femoral, tibial, and patellar cartilage, respectively. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using different imaging contrasts from the 3D multi-echo GRE scan to visualize abnormalities of the articular cartilage. ? 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Level of Evidence: 1 J.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.

AB  - Abstract The Wound/Burn Guidelines Committee consists of members commissioned by the Board of Directors of the Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA). It held several meetings and evaluations in writing since October 2008, and drafted five guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment including commentaries on wounds in general and the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment for Pressure Ulcers by taking opinions of the Scientific Committee and Board of Directors of JDA into consideration.

AB  - Long-term survival was examined for 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID). The 14-year survival rate for AD was 2.4% versus an expected rate of 16.6%, and for MID 1.7% versus 13.3% expected. MID showed a more malignant natural course than AD. Men carried a less favourable survival prognosis than women, both in AD and MID: the relative risk of dying for women was half that for men in both diseases. In MID, advanced disability indicated a relative risk of dying over twice as high. In both diseases the risk of death was substantially higher in the event of occurrence of primitive reflexes.

AB  - Dry eye conditions are prevalent with one in four to five patients presenting to eye care practitioners having dry eye signs and/or symptoms. An intimate relationship exists between the ocular surface and the tear film. The cycle of tear film instability and ocular surface damage characteristic of dry eye conditions suggests that dry eye represents a dysfunction of an integrated ocular surface-lacrimal gland unit. Therefore, dry eye is a multifactorial condition and an approach based on clinical subtypes is required for diagnosis and management. There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a contributing and exacerbating factor in dry eye conditions and anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy for chronic dry eye conditions may facilitate ocular surface healing. Other promising new treatments for dry eye include new generation artificial tear polymers and preservative systems, secretagogues, topical androgen supplements and surgical techniques for ocular surface reconstruction.

AB  - Migraine or headache is a common problem in the active duty population, in the recently deployed service members, and is a cardinal symptom of traumatic brain injury. While there is increasing appreciation of the clinical burden of post-traumatic headache (PTHA) in the military traumatic brain injury population, there remain significant research gaps related to the epidemiology of PTHA, including lack of understanding of natural history, whether there are predisposing factors that predict the development or prognosis of headache post trauma and, most basically, the features that distinguish PTHA from other forms of chronic headache. Although diagnostic criteria for PTHA are included in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition, revised, these criteria are somewhat arbitrary and were not empirically defined. This lack of precision about the PTHA phenotype limits the rigor of observational studies of PTH but does not appear to significantly hamper treatment, provided the treatment involves a multi-modality approach.

AB  - Importance There is a paucity of evidence analysing the treatment of cyclodialysis clefts. Background We describe outcomes following the treatment of this rare condition at six centres internationally. Design Retrospective case series. Participants Thirty-six patients with a cyclodialysis cleft from 2003 to 2017 were recruited. Methods Clefts were treated with cycloplegic agents, laser therapy and/or surgery. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative best recorded visual acuity (BRVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and the rate of cleft closure. Results The mean age was 45?±?17?years and 29 (80.6%) patients were male. One eye (2.8%) received only medical therapy, 5 (13.9%) received laser, 14 (38.9%) underwent surgery after laser failure and 16 (44.4%) eyes received exclusively surgery. Over 80% of eyes had a BRVA improvement of more than two lines. Closure was attained in 30 eyes (93.8%; n?=?32), with postoperative stabilized IOP?≥?12?mmHg in 29 eyes (80.6%; n?=?36) and postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 in 20 eyes (58.8%; n?=?34). Improved postoperative BRVA was related to better preoperative BRVA (P =?0.006) and preoperative IOP?≥?4?mmHg (P =?0.03). There was no significant difference between treatment approach for IOP?≥?12?mmHg (P =?0.85) or postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 (P =?0.80). Only two eyes at last follow-up required IOP lowering medication. Conclusions and Relevance There was a high closure rate with most eyes eventually requiring surgery. Clinically significant improvements in BRVA were found in most eyes. Improved postoperative BRVA was significantly related to better preoperative BRVA and IOP.
