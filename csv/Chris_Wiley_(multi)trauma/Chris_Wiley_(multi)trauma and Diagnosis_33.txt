AB  - Abstract Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a traumatic childbirth. Objective To test if providing psychological self-help materials would significantly lower the incidence of PTSD at 6-12 weeks postnatally. Design Open label, randomised controlled trial, blinded outcome assessment. Setting Community midwifery services in two North West NHS Trusts. Sample 2419 women receiving usual NHS postnatal care. Methods Midwives screened women for traumatic birth experience. 678 women who screened positive (28.1%) were randomly allocated to self-help with usual care (n=336) or usual care alone (n=342). Self-help materials, were a leaflet and on-line film designed to prevent the development of PTSD after trauma exposure through how to manage early psychological responses. Main Outcome Measure The primary outcome was a composite of diagnostic and sub-diagnostic PTSD at 6-12 weeks postnatally using the gold standard Clinician Administered PTSD Interview (CAPS-5). Results 478 of 678 (70.5%) correctly randomised women and 9 randomised in error were followed up. Diagnostic or sub-diagnostic PTSD rates at follow-up did not differ between groups who received self-help (26.7%, 65/243) or usual care alone (26.2%, 64/244) (ITT analysis: relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.53). Findings remained consistent in the per protocol analysis (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.27). Women viewed the materials very positively. There were no adverse effects. Health economic micro-costing indicated implementation would be very low cost. Conclusions Many women experience a traumatic birth and risk developing PTSD, but self-help strategies without professional support are insufficient and should not be routinely introduced.

AB  - Importance There is a paucity of evidence analysing the treatment of cyclodialysis clefts. Background We describe outcomes following the treatment of this rare condition at six centres internationally. Design Retrospective case series. Participants Thirty-six patients with a cyclodialysis cleft from 2003 to 2017 were recruited. Methods Clefts were treated with cycloplegic agents, laser therapy and/or surgery. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative best recorded visual acuity (BRVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and the rate of cleft closure. Results The mean age was 45?±?17?years and 29 (80.6%) patients were male. One eye (2.8%) received only medical therapy, 5 (13.9%) received laser, 14 (38.9%) underwent surgery after laser failure and 16 (44.4%) eyes received exclusively surgery. Over 80% of eyes had a BRVA improvement of more than two lines. Closure was attained in 30 eyes (93.8%; n?=?32), with postoperative stabilized IOP?≥?12?mmHg in 29 eyes (80.6%; n?=?36) and postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 in 20 eyes (58.8%; n?=?34). Improved postoperative BRVA was related to better preoperative BRVA (P =?0.006) and preoperative IOP?≥?4?mmHg (P =?0.03). There was no significant difference between treatment approach for IOP?≥?12?mmHg (P =?0.85) or postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 (P =?0.80). Only two eyes at last follow-up required IOP lowering medication. Conclusions and Relevance There was a high closure rate with most eyes eventually requiring surgery. Clinically significant improvements in BRVA were found in most eyes. Improved postoperative BRVA was significantly related to better preoperative BRVA and IOP.

AB  - A six-year-old, neutered, female golden retriever was presented with generalised, dark purple to black cutaneous nodules and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Histopathologically, all cutaneous nodules were diagnosed as benign cavernous haemangiomas. Endoscopic analysis revealed similar nodules in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. At laparotomy, similar nodules were seen on the visceral peritoneal lining of abdominal organs. Metastatic haemangiosarcoma was ruled out based on histological features and lack of primary tumour in spleen, liver or heart ultrasonographically. Blood loss associated with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was managed with blood transfusion. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first canine case of multi-system progressive angiomatosis resembling blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome in humans.

Data Sources Selected research and clinical articles in professional journals and online websites, peer review, educational technical bulletin from professional organization and the authors? professional clinical experiences. Conclusions Vulvar LS can manifest with varied symptoms that may mimic other common vulvar disorders such as infections. Careful assessment of the vulva and biopsy of any suspicious skin changes are needed for diagnosis and management of vulvar LS. Treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids may alleviate uncomfortable symptoms and reduce physical changes. Follow-up management is essential to check for progressing problems such as introital stenosis and to assess for skin changes that may indicate vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Implications for Practice Accurate diagnosis and successful management of vulvar LS requires thorough assessment of the genitalia, knowledge of the disorder and appropriate treatment and follow-up management.

AB  - When considering the allergenic activity of a compound not only the possibility of bioactivation by skin metabolism but also air activation by autoxidation must be taken into account. Natural compounds (terpenes) easily oxidize at air exposure. They are found in products that are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) i.e. colophony and fragrances. The introduction of oxygen enables the molecules to form antigens with skin proteins via a nucleophilic- electrophilic interaction or via a radical reaction. The latter mechanism seems to be important since the primary oxidation products, the hydroperoxides, are the most potent sensitizers formed. Oxidative decomposition at air exposure resulting in allergenic oxidation products is observed also for other common compounds e.g. ethoxylated fatty alcohols used as surfactants. It is important to test the patient with the offending compounds for diagnosis of ACD. A negative diagnosis can be due to failure in testing with the correct substances. In the case of air activated compounds, testing should not be performed with the pure substances but rather with the oxidation mixture or the most sensitizing oxidation products (the hydroperoxides). We have in multicenter-studies shown that the common fragrance terpenes, limonene and linalool, are frequent sensitizers when oxidized. This is a challenge in clinical practice since such patch test materials are not easily standardized. Compounds, easily activated at air exposure, should be prevented from oxidative decomposition by addition of antioxidants and proper handling and storage. More research is needed in this area.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham.

AB  - The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF) is widely used to measure childhood abuse of all types. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the instrument. The participants constituted four subsamples (n = 517): substance abusers (n = 126), psychiatric patients (n = 210), prisoners (n = 109) and adolescents in out-of-home placements (n = 72). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a reasonable fit of the data to the original five-factor structure of the CTQ-SF. Measurement invariance was found across gender and the four subsamples. It was concluded that the Norwegian version of the CTQ-SF has acceptable psychometric properties, with good reliability and satisfactory accuracy, to assess different dimensions of childhood trauma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:? Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) induced by a Chinese medicinal herb Tusanqi is increasingly being reported in recent years. The aim of the study was to investigate the possibility of using blood pyrrole-protein adducts test as a confirmatory diagnostic method. METHODS:? Patients with HSOS according to international diagnostic criteria associated with Tusanqi from January 2006 to August 2010 in Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University were included and clinical features were collected. Pyrrole-protein adducts in blood sample were determined with ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) while pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in available herbal preparations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV). RESULTS:? Five patients (age 41?72 years, median age 54 years, all women) were included. Ascites (5/5), jaundice (5/5) and hepatomegaly (4/5) were common manifestations. The imaging features were diffused, patchy hepatic enhancement, periportal edema and ascites. Pathology ascertained that blood flow was obstructive at the site of sinusoid. PAs (Seneionine and seneciphylline) were identified in all the three available herbal preparations ingested by the HSOS patients. Pyrrole-protein adducts were unequivocally found in all the five blood samples. Two patients recovered, two developed chronic illness and one died due to liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS:? The detection of blood pyrrole-protein adducts using a UPLC-MS approach is a specific, reliable, unambiguous and confirmatory test for HSOS induced by PA, and should be used together with the conventional HSOS clinical diagnostic criteria for the definitive diagnosis of PA-induced HSOS.

AB  - Background: Both stereotactic imaging and ultrasound have been used to localize non-palpable breast lesions for core biopsy analysis. In particular, stereotactic core breast biopsy with a dedicated recumbent mammographic unit is an accurate and reliable technique, and this has been substantiated in a number of recent prospective studies comparing percutaneous core biopsy with open excisional biopsy. Methods: This article reviews biopsies of 521 lesions from 502 cases using both stereotactic localization (469 lesions) and ultrasound (33 lesions). The types of breast cancer and benign breast disease diagnosed with core sampling are reviewed. In this series it was not intended to compare all the results of core biopsies with those of open excisional biopsy, but a subset group, which comprised certain benign lesions and malignancies, as well as lesions diagnosed on core biopsy in which the radiology and pathology did not correlate, was further evaluated and compared to the findings with open biopsy. The cases where there were differences in core and excisional biopsy diagnosis are discussed. Results: In this series the benign to malignant ratio was 2.7:1; in other words, 27% of the lesions biopsied were malignant. The sensitivity for detecting cancer was 97% with the positive predictive value being 99%. Conclusions: This series further substantiates the accuracy of core biopsy. It is recommended that certain lesions diagnosed as benign on core biopsy histology should also proceed to open biopsy. Correlation between clinical findings, radiology and pathology further improves the reliability of core biopsy under imaging guidance.

AB  - Abstract The present study highlights the role of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining in diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis and correlates the cytomorphological features with histopathology. FNAC and biopsy was performed on 30 cases of cutaneous tuberculosis and along with the routine stains, ZN and periodic acid Schiffs staining was carried out in all cases. On cytology, out of 9 cases of lupus vulgaris, 89% showed cohesive epithelioid cell granulomas with or without chronic inflammatory infiltrate; however, acid fast bacilli (AFB) could be demonstrated only in 22.2% on cytology while none on histopathology. Of 19 cases diagnosed as Scrofuloderma, 79% showed caseation necrosis with or without granulomas, 10.5% revealed granulomas with acute inflammatory infiltrates. AFB was demonstrated in 78.9% cases on cytology when compared with 15.8% on histopathology. No conclusion could be drawn in one case each of TBVC and lichen scrofulosorum. Hence, correlating cytomorphological patterns with clinical presentations often yields diagnostic information in cases of cutaneous tuberculosis and frequently obviates the need for biopsy especially in cases of scrofuloderma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the long-term outcome of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and pericardectomy for treatment of chylothorax in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Thirty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods Dogs were included if they had undergone a VATS TDL and pericardectomy and had at least 1-year follow-up or had died within 1 postoperative year. Medical records were evaluated, and recorded data included clinicopathological and diagnostic imaging results, surgical findings, complications, conversion rates, and long-term resolution and recurrence rates. Results Thirty-nine dogs met the inclusion criteria. Two dogs died intraoperatively; 1 was euthanized after severe restrictive pleuritis was diagnosed intraoperatively, and 1 underwent ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest during pericardectomy and could not be resuscitated. Conversion to an open approach was required in 1 of 39 (3%) dogs for TDL and 4 of 36 (11%) dogs for pericardectomy. Overall follow-up time was median 38 months (range, 3-115). Resolution of pleural effusion occurred in 35 of 37 (95%) dogs that survived the perioperative period. Late recurrence of pleural effusion was seen at 12, 12, and 19 months postoperatively in 3 of 35 (9%) dogs that survived the perioperative period and in which chylothorax had initially resolved. Conclusion Successful long-term resolution of chylothorax was seen in a high proportion of dogs that underwent VATS TDL and pericardectomy, although late recurrence was sometimes seen. Clinical significance Video-assisted thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation and pericardectomy are highly successful in dogs with chylothorax. Future studies should evaluate whether pericardectomy is required in dogs without evidence of pericardial disease.

AB  - Disorders of sex development (DSD) represent a spectrum of uncommon but very complex disorders with medical, psychosexual, and family implications for those affected by them. The diagnosis and management of these disorders requires a coordinated team of multiple specialists. Following an international conference in Chicago in 2005, a consensus statement was created and presented, which has resulted in a new paradigm in the nomenclature, classification, and management of DSDs. Since that time, many improvements have been forthcoming, most notably in the area of molecular genetic technologies. These developments have advanced our understanding of the specific etiologies underlying many of these conditions. In this article, we present an overview of the physiology of sex development, a few clinical vignettes highlighting specific pathologic conditions, discussions regarding the evaluation and management of these disorders, and some thoughts on future directions in this field.

AB  - Summary Mesenteric ischaemia results from decreased blood flow to the bowel, causing cellular injury from lack of oxygen and nutrients. Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is an uncommon disorder with high morbidity and mortality, but outcomes are improved with prompt recognition and aggressive treatment. Five subgroups of AMI have been identified, with superior mesenteric artery embolism (SMAE) the most common. Older age and cardiovascular disease are common risk factors for AMI, excepting acute mesenteric venous thrombosis (AMVT), which affects younger patients with hypercoaguable states. AMI is characterized by sudden onset of abdominal pain; a benign abdominal exam may be observed prior to bowel infarction. Conventional angiography and more recently, computed tomography angiography, are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Correction of predisposing conditions, volume resuscitation and antibiotic treatment are standard treatments for AMI, and surgery is mandated in the setting of peritoneal signs. Intra-arterial vasodilators are used routinely in the treatment of non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) and also are advocated in the treatment of occlusive AMI to decrease associated vasospasm. Thrombolytics have been used on a limited basis to treat occlusive AMI. A variety of agents have been studied in animal models to treat reperfusion injury, which sometimes can be more harmful than ischaemic injury. Chronic mesenteric ischaemia (CMI) usually is caused by severe obstructive atherosclerotic disease of two or more splanchnic vessels, presents with post-prandial pain and weight loss, and is treated by either surgical revascularization or percutaneous angioplasty and stenting.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare demographics and disease characteristics in dogs in which peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) had been diagnosed and report outcomes after surgical treatment (ST) or conservative treatment (CT). Study design Retrospective study. Sample population One hundred twenty-eight dogs (91 ST, 37 CT) in which PPDH had been diagnosed. Methods Medical records were reviewed for demographics, perioperative findings, and outcomes. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and email correspondence with owners and referring veterinarians. Baseline variables were compared between treatment groups. Results Dogs treated surgically were younger (P < .001), more likely to be sexually intact (P = .002), more likely to have clinical signs from PPDH vs an incidental diagnosis (P < .001), and more likely to have other congenital abnormalities (P = .003) compared with dogs treated conservatively. Ninety-seven percent of ST dogs were discharged from hospitals. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were reported in 22% and 41% of dogs, respectively, although most complications were classified as low grade (75% and 83%, respectively). Follow-up was available in 87 dogs, at a median of 1062?days. Hernia recurrence was not reported in any surgically treated dog. The deaths of nine dogs (five ST, four CT) could be attributed to PPDH, and long median survival times were observed in both the ST and CT groups (8.2 and 5?years, respectively). Conclusion Preoperative characteristics differed between dogs treated conservatively vs surgically. Surgical treatment was associated with low operative mortality, and both ST and CT dogs had good long-term survival. Clinical significance A diagnosis of PPDH can confer a good long-term prognosis for both ST and CT dogs.

AB  - Abstract The restoration of a traumatized tooth may require minimally invasive or more extensive treatment options. The majority of injuries occur in the younger population, so management should consider the long-term outcome, failure and future treatment needs over the course of, often, many decades. The aim should be to provide a tooth-restoration complex that closely mimics the functional and aesthetic qualities of an intact tooth for as long as possible. This narrative review will assess the relevant literature pertinent to restoration of traumatized teeth in order to provide guidance for the practising clinician.

AB  - Abstract Background With an aging population increasing presentations of cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can be expected to old age services. While progress has been made in recent years in relation to the understanding and development of aetiological theories, classification, assessment and management strategies and protocols in the adult population, similar advances have lagged behind for the elderly. Aims To review the adult literature regarding PTSD and discuss how this might apply to an elderly population. An attempt is made to highlight a better awareness of the field of psychological trauma in the elderly in the hope of stimulating debate and research. Method A review of the adult literature is conducted relating to classification, aetiology, demographic features, vulnerability, assessment, clinical management including psychotherapy and medications and how these may apply to the elderly. Results Little has been published in this field that directly relates to the elderly. The adult literature allows insight into understanding how PTSD may present in the elderly, and how they may be managed. Conclusions Further specific research is needed in the elderly in order to facilitate a better understanding of PTSD that present in this unique population. This will lead to better clinical assessment, management and treatment provision. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
