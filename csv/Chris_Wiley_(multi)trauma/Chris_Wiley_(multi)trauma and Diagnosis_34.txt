AB  - Objectives: To review the presenting clinical signs, treatment and survival of dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma and, if possible, to identify useful prognostic indicators. Methods: Medical records of 44 dogs were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical signs, clinical stage, time of diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Chi-square/Fisher Exact test as appropriate. Results: The most frequent clinical signs were cough (12 dogs, 27%), enlarged lymph nodes (11 dogs, 25%) and dysphagia (11 dogs, 25%). Anorexia and lethargy were less common but were significantly associated with a poor outcome. No matter what treatment modalities were used, survival times were short and median survival time for all the dogs in the study was 179 days. However, there were a small number of long-term survivors. Clinical Significance: Dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma that suffered anorexia and lethargy had shorter survival times than patients without these clinical signs. Although surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seem to increase the median survival time of dogs diagnosed with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, there is no highly effective treatment for canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - Abstract:? Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (SFNN) is an uncommon self-limiting panniculitis. Lesions may be fluctuant and spontaneously drain. Here we report a technique to rapidly confirm the diagnosis of SFNN when fluctuance exists via a touch preparation that demonstrates the characteristic histologic features of this condition. The material can be collected by fine needle aspirate, from draining fluctuant lesions, or if biopsy if performed.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma can result in tooth loss despite best efforts at retaining and maintaining compromised teeth (Dent Traumatol, 24, 2008, 379). Upper anterior teeth are more likely to suffer from trauma, and their loss can result in significant aesthetic and functional problems that can be difficult to manage (Endod Dent Traumatol, 9, 1993, 61; Int Dent J 59, 2009, 127). Indeed, teeth of poor prognosis may not only present with compromised structure but trauma may also result in damage to the support tissues. Injury to the periodontium and alveolus can have repercussions on subsequent restorative procedures (Fig. 19). Where teeth are identified as having a hopeless prognosis either soon after the incident or at delayed presentation; planning for eventual tooth loss and replacement can begin at the early stages. With advances in both adhesive and osseointegration technologies, there are now a variety of options for the restoration of edentate spaces subsequent to dental trauma. This review aims to identify key challenges in the provision of tooth replacement in the traumatized dentition and outline contemporary methods in treatment delivery.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the literature on quality of life (QoL) in patients with hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (HTAAD); including Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) and other HTAAD diagnoses, critically appraising and synthesizing the relevant literature. A systematic review was performed by searching the published literature using available medical, physical, psychological, social databases and other sources. Studies addressing QoL in persons with an HTAAD diagnosis, published in peer-reviewed journals were assessed. Of 227 search results, 20 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. No studies of QoL in LDS, vEDS, or other HTAAD were found, only on MFS. Most studies had been published in the last 3 years. All were cross-sectional quantitative studies besides one pilot intervention study. Most studies were of small sample size, had low response rate or participants without verified diagnosis. Despite these limitations, most studies indicate that having an HTAAD diagnosis as MFS may negatively impact QoL, but few studies found any associations between the biomedical symptoms and decreased QoL. More research is needed on QoL in samples with verified HTAAD diagnosis to develop evidence-based knowledge and appropriate guidelines for these diagnoses.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Williams?Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multi-system disorder that requires ongoing management by a primary care physician familiar with the natural history and common medical problems associated with the condition. Some abnormalities are unique to WBS, such as the elastin arteriopathy that often manifests as supravalvar aortic stenosis and hypertension. Still other features, such as diverticulosis, are seen in the general population but tend to present earlier in WBS. Life long monitoring of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems is essential to the clinical management of individuals with Williams?Beuren syndrome. Constipation should be aggressively managed, and symptoms of abdominal pain should prompt an evaluation for diverticulosis/diverticulitis. While the mean IQ of WBS is in the mild mental retardation range, difficulties with attention and anxiety are more likely to negatively impact independent functioning in the adult with WBS. There is no evidence for decline in cognitive ability over time, but adaptive functioning may be improved with treatment of anxiety by both behavior and medical modalities. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Acute suppurative thyroiditis and recurrent abscess formation due to third and fourth branchial anomalies typically present in children. However, thyroid abscesses in branchial anomalies may occur in adulthood as well. Failure to recognize and delayed drainage of a neck abscess may lead to a fulminant life-threatening outcome. Methods This is a retrospective case series. The study group comprised all patients presenting over a 12-month period from January to December 2012 with thyroid abscesses and a branchial cleft anomaly in two centres, one adult and the other paediatric. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, imaging, surgical management, definitive histology and outcomes were documented. Results Five patients were identified with a history of thyroid abscesses. Only one was a child (aged 9 years) with the other four being adults (aged 20, 34, 37 and 41 years). All patients had third or fourth left branchial cleft anomalies, presenting as suppurative thyroiditis with a left-sided thyroid abscess. Management options ranged from abscess drainage on initial presentation, primary thyroid lobectomy or delayed thyroid lobectomy following abscess drainage. Conclusion Acute suppurative thyroidits and thyroid abscesses is not just a paediatric diagnosis but may present at any age. In both children and adults, a thyroid abscess almost always arises from branchial cleft anomalies.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Although individual HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) show good performance in evaluations conducted by WHO, reports from several African countries highlight potentially significant performance issues. Despite widespread use of RDTs for HIV diagnosis in resource-constrained settings, there has been no systematic, head-to-head evaluation of their accuracy with specimens from diverse settings across sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a standardized, centralized evaluation of eight HIV RDTs and two simple confirmatory assays at a WHO collaborating centre for evaluation of HIV diagnostics using specimens from six sites in five sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Specimens were transported to the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Antwerp, Belgium for testing. The tests were evaluated by comparing their results to a state-of-the-art reference algorithm to estimate sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Results: 2785 samples collected from August 2011 to January 2015 were tested at ITM. All RDTs showed very high sensitivity, from 98.8% for First Response HIV Card Test 1?2.0 to 100% for Determine HIV 1/2, Genie Fast, SD Bioline HIV 1/2 3.0 and INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Test kit. Specificity ranged from 90.4% for First Response to 99.7% for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK with wide variation based on the geographical origin of specimens. Multivariate analysis showed several factors were associated with false-positive results, including gender, provider-initiated testing and the geographical origin of specimens. For simple confirmatory assays, the total sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 98.8% for ImmunoComb II HIV 12 CombFirm (ImmunoComb) and 99.7% and 98.4% for Geenius HIV 1/2 with indeterminate rates of 8.9% and 9.4%. Conclusions: In this first systematic head-to-head evaluation of the most widely used RDTs, individual RDTs performed more poorly than in the WHO evaluations: only one test met the recommended thresholds for RDTs of ≥99% sensitivity and ≥98% specificity. By performing all tests in a centralized setting, we show that these differences in performance cannot be attributed to study procedure, end-user variation, storage conditions, or other methodological factors. These results highlight the existence of geographical and population differences in individual HIV RDT performance and underscore the challenges of designing locally validated algorithms that meet the latest WHO-recommended thresholds.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Purpose? To discuss the entire spectrum of injuries seen in lower limb trauma and choice of reconstructive options. Methodology? Retrospective review of 72 consecutive cases in one year. Data collected from individual case records and the department photo data base. Injuries were classified and analyzed based on bone and soft tissue involvement, associated vascular injuries, mechanism of injury as in crush, degloving, and combined. Bony injuries were classified according to Gustilo?s classification. Treatment options and outcome for bone and soft tissue are discussed separately. Results? Total of 72 cases. 95%of cases were two wheeler traffic accidents. Distribution of cases according to site involved: Leg-39; Foot-14; Leg and foot-16; Thigh, leg, and foot-3. 8 of them were of Gustilo?s IIIB and 7 of IIIC. 42 flaps done included Gastrocnemius-4, Soleus-7, reverse sural-7, Cross leg-2, Fasciocutaneous-5 Perforator based local flaps-3Latissimus dorsi-7, Gracilis-6 Lateral thigh-1 Intervention: Immediate: 12%. Early (less than 1 week): 36, Delayed (>1 week): 52% Complications:Wound infection:Minor: 12; Major: 8 (3 Cases ? Clostridia) Partial flap loss: 6; Loss of SSG over flap/donor site: 5; Acute renal failure: 1 Amputations: Above knee: 4; below knee: 2 Conclusions? This series represents the spectrum of high velocity injuries in an overcrowded urban locality of developing country. Significant tissue loss is most often the rule. A judicious execution of reconstructive options can optimize results. Management protocols were adopted to avoid delayed referrals. This audit served as a benchmark to put together a dedicated trauma team in our hospital.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to assess a broad range of cognitive functioning in a dual diagnosis sample (individuals with a chronic psychotic disorder and substance abuse/dependence) and offer recommendations for programme design and treatment interventions. The Neurobehavioural Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE) was administered to twenty-seven subjects. Statistical comparisons with a normative and psychiatric sample were conducted. The results revealed that two-thirds of the sample demonstrated cognitive impairments as measured by the NCSE, with 37% scoring in the impaired range on three or more of the ten subtests. Great variability between subjects was recorded. Deficits at the p<0.05 level were recorded for seven of the ten subtests in the young group, and for two of the ten subtests for the old group as compared to a normal population. For both age groups memory and judgement were the most statistically deficient. This study supports assessment of cognitive status for dual diagnosis clients, in order to offer treatment appropriate to varied levels of intellectual functioning and suggest a number of treatment options.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the ventricular rate response of rate-adaptive (VVIR) pacemakers in dogs using a multi-stage exercise test. Methods: The rate-responsiveness of VVIR pacemakers was assessed in seven dogs with complete atrioventricular (AV) block and implanted with various models of pulse generators (six motion sensors and one automatic dual-sensor rate-response pacemaker). Response activity was assessed with a multi-stage exercise test on a treadmill. Atrial and ventricular rate were analysed retrospectively at the end of the test and the AV ratio was calculated after each minute of exercise. Results: During exercise, the mean (sd) AV ratio recorded in all paced dogs was 1.7 (0.5) (expected physiological ratio 1.0), although a variety of individual performances was observed. A poor response (AV ratio 2.8 [0.2]) was obtained with the automatic dual-sensor pacemaker, suggesting that this type of rate-responsive device may not be indicated for implantation in dogs with complete AV block. The overall AV ratio for the six dogs implanted with motion sensors was 1.4 (0.2), showing a better performance of these pacemakers during exercise. Clinical Significance: This multi-stage exercise test represents an easy and repeatable method for assessing the accuracy of rate-responsive sensors and offers valuable information for the correct setting of VVIR pacemakers in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Background: Psychosis can be considered one of the most severe stressors that an individual may face. Previous studies have suggested that the traumatic experience of psychotic symptoms and hospitalization may provoke a post-traumatic type reaction. Aim: The aim of this study was to establish the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among patients recovering from a first-episode of psychosis in Singapore, and to elucidate the factors associated with it. Methods: Patients from the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme in Singapore, who were recovering from their first psychotic episode, participated in this study. Diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) ? Text Revised Axis I Disorders. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, an interviewer-rated semi-structured interview, was used to diagnose PTSD. Results: Sixty-one patients (30 males, 31 females) were recruited. Twelve (19.7%) patients were diagnosed with PTSD. Hospitalization for treatment, whether compulsory or otherwise, did not increase the rate of PTSD. The Chinese ethnic group had lower risk of developing PTSD (adjusted odds ratio 0.14, P?=?0.018). Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of PTSD in patients recovering from their first psychotic episode. This study raises awareness among clinicians and hopes to promote early recognition and treatment of PTSD so as to potentially improve outcome.

AB  - Abstract Despite clinical observations that many veterans have multiple sources of war-related guilt, many problematic guilt issues are commonly not treated or even detected by clinicians. We describe development of a survey that systematically assesses idiosyncratic sources of guilt across the spectrum of events that are potential sources of trauma-related guilt from the war-zone. A multimethod strategy was used to develop a survey with strong content validity. Results indicate the survey is temporally stable, substantially correlated with other measures of guilt, and highly correlated with measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Findings confirm that many Vietnam veterans have multiple sources of severe war-related guilt. The survey may have important clinical utility for problem identification, treatment planning, and evaluating treatment efficacy.

AB  - Abstract Aim Determine the effect of traumatic event re-exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity on proximal drug use and drug abuse treatment-seeking in syringe exchange participants. Design Prospective longitudinal 16-month cohort study of new syringe exchange registrants enrolled in a parent study of methods to improve treatment engagement. Setting Data were collected in a research van next to mobile syringe exchange distribution sites in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants Male and female (n?=?162) injecting drug users (IDUs) registered for syringe exchange. Measurements Traumatic event re-exposure was identified each month with the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire. PTSD symptoms were measured with the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale?Revised, given every 4 months. Outcome measures collected monthly were days of drug use (heroin, cocaine) and drug abuse treatment-seeking behavior (interest, calls to obtain treatment, treatment participation). Findings Each traumatic event re-exposure was associated with about 1 more day of cocaine use after accounting for the previous month's cocaine use [same month adjusted B, standard error?=?1.16 (0.34); 1 month later: 0.99 (0.34)], while PTSD symptoms had no effect. Traumatic event re-exposure increased interest in drug abuse treatment [same month adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals?=?1.34 (1.11?1.63)] and calling to obtain treatment [same month 1.58 (1.24?2.01); 1 month later 1.34 (1.03?1.75)]. Each 10% increase in PTSD symptom severity was associated with persistent increased interest in treatment [same month 1.25 (1.10?1.42); 1 month later 1.16 (1.02?1.32); 2 months later 1.16 (1.02?1.32)] and calling to obtain treatment [same month 1.16 (1.02?1.32)]. Neither traumatic events nor PTSD symptoms were associated with participants receiving treatment. Conclusions Becoming exposed again to traumatic events among injecting drug users is associated with an increase in cocaine use up to 1 month later, but drug use is not related to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Both traumatic event re-exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms predict drug abuse treatment-seeking behavior for up to 2 months.
