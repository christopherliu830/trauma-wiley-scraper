AB  - Abstract Despite clinical observations that many veterans have multiple sources of war-related guilt, many problematic guilt issues are commonly not treated or even detected by clinicians. We describe development of a survey that systematically assesses idiosyncratic sources of guilt across the spectrum of events that are potential sources of trauma-related guilt from the war-zone. A multimethod strategy was used to develop a survey with strong content validity. Results indicate the survey is temporally stable, substantially correlated with other measures of guilt, and highly correlated with measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Findings confirm that many Vietnam veterans have multiple sources of severe war-related guilt. The survey may have important clinical utility for problem identification, treatment planning, and evaluating treatment efficacy.

AB  - Abstract In electrocutions, death may be caused by alterations in the heart conduction system provoking ventricular fibrillation. This study aims to identify histological cardiac markers of high- and low-voltage electrocution. Two groups of decedents were evaluated: group A included 14 fatalities caused by high- or low-voltage electrocution and group B (control) included 14 fatalities due to other traumatic or disease causes. Myocardial sampling with microscopic examination was performed on all the hearts using the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains to investigate morphological characteristics that could indicate the damage caused by high- and low-voltage electrocutions. Interstitial myocardial hemorrhagic infiltration was the only differentiating finding, which was shown only in high-voltage electrocution. This pathological finding has not been previously reported, and it may be specific to high-voltage electrocution deaths. Further studies are warranted.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the relationship between emotions, depression and eating disorders. Initially, a review is undertaken of the current state of the research and clinical literature with regard to emotional factors in eating disorders. This literature is then integrated within a version of the multi-level model of emotion proposed by Power and Dalgleish. The aim of this paper is to incorporate a basic emotions, multi-modal perspective into developing a new emotions-based model that offers a theoretical understanding of psychological mechanisms in eating disorders. Within the new Schematic Propositional Analogical Associative Representation System model applied to eating disorders, it is argued that the emotions of anger and disgust are of importance in eating disorders and that the eating disorder itself operates as an inhibitor of emotions within the self. It is hoped that the development of a multi-levelled model of eating disorders will allow for the construction of number of specific testable hypotheses that are relevant to future research into the psychological treatment and understanding of eating disorders.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ?Dementia? refers to a broad neurological syndrome marked by multifaceted intellectual loss. Primary and secondary forms exist. Alzheimer's disease, a primary dementia, is the most important cause of the syndrome. It has a well-defined pathology and a characteristic clinical presentation, but its etiology, or etiologies, remains unknown. No currently available medical therapy can reverse or arrest Alzheimer's disease. However, treatment of associated symptoms and attention to the needs of patients and their families can blunt some of the effects of this devastating illness.

AB  - Abstract Patients presenting with swelling arising from the floor of the mouth (FOM) should be examined prudently, with the aid of appropriate diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography, ultrasound guided aspirational biopsy, CT with contrast or MRI. Clinicians should include even the rare occurrences, like lipomas, especially while categorising intra-oral lesions because this can impede appropriate surgical planning, which can consequently cause recurrence or even malignant transformation of the lesion. This case report presents a painless sublingual lipoma situated on the left side of the FOM. The size gradually increased and eventually interfered with the movement of tongue and swallowing that was initially attributed as either sublingual cyst (dermoid/epidermoid) or ranula. Although lipomas are considered to originate at any site in the body, their incidence in the oral cavity is rare (1%?4%). In the present case, a sublingual lipoma presented as a painless and slow-growing swelling located on the left side of FOM associated with restricted tongue movement. Complete resection of the lesion was performed with the preservation of Wharton?s duct, lingual nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Post-operative recovery was uneventful and subsequent follow-up was satisfactory showing no sign of wound dehiscence or infection. The salivary flow was normal in both Wharton?s ducts.

AB  - Summary Aging and old age confront the psychiatric clinician and nosologist with special diagnostic problems. Aging reflects evolving biological, psychological, and social processes. Fundamental alterations of central nervous system functioning color the psychopathological and pathophysiological significance of specific symptoms, while the psychosocial meaning of discrete life events changes as one moves across the age spectrum. Old age brings an increase in confounding systemic medical conditions. Thus, we are confronted with an array of yet-to-be-answered questions. The development of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) provided an opportunity to begin considering such issues more formally.

At the time of the trauma, a diaphragmatic lesion went unnoticed. Five years later, the patient had a 24-h history of increasingly severe abdominal pain with repeated vomiting. Helical CT showed a portion of the left hemidiaphragm avulsed from its insertions on the ribs with large-bowel loop obstruction herniated in the left hemithorax. The preoperative CT diagnosis was confirmed by surgery: reduction of the hernia and reinsertion of the hemidiaphragm to the lumbocostal arch were performed.

AB  - Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation and infection that can be used as a predictive risk marker of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals or as a prognostic marker of recurrent ischemia and death among patients with coronary heart disease or stroke. We developed a sensitive, disposable, and easy to operate sensor based on heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay for high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurement. We used screen-printed electrodes modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and protein A to ensure the oriented immobilization of anti-CRP antibodies. CRP was quantitatively measured down to a concentration of 0.5?ng mL?1, enabling high dilution of the samples before measurement and consequently reducing interferences present in the serum. The sensor developed is suitable for point of care detection of hs-CRP at clinically relevant concentrations for the diagnosis of both conventional and low-grade inflammations.

AB  - Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been used in various problem-solving areas such as financial forecasting, credit analysis and medical diagnosis. However, conventional CBR has the limitation that it has no criterion for choosing the nearest cases based on the probabilistic similarity of cases. It uses a fixed number of neighbors without considering an optimal number for each target case, so it does not guarantee optimal similar neighbors for various target cases. This leads to the weakness of lowering predictability due to deviation from desired similar neighbors. In this paper we suggest a new case extraction technique called statistical case-based reasoning. The main idea involves a dynamic adaptation of the optimal number of neighbors by considering the distribution of distances between potential similar neighbors for each target case. In order to do this, our technique finds the optimal distance threshold and selects similar neighbors satisfying the distance threshold criterion. We apply this new method to five real-life medical data sets and compare the results with those of the statistical method, logistic regression; we also compare the results with the learning methods C5.0, CART, neural networks and conventional CBR. The results of this paper show that the proposed technique outperforms those of many other methods, it overcomes the limitation of conventional CBR, and it provides improved classification accuracy.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, and interventional radiology. Patients with flow-limiting intimal defects should be explored. Posterior knee dislocation is associated with popliteal arterial injuries. These patients should undergo diagnostic imaging to rule out popliteal artery injury. Good diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) angiographic extremity examinations require careful patient preparation, to give images that will provide the necessary information. The use of abdominal ultrasound for detecting the need for operative intervention in a patient who has sustained a penetrating trauma to the abdomen carries a low sensitivity and a high specificity. A normal ultrasound examination of the thoracic cavity demonstrates the rib, the sliding of the pleura, and the presence of a comet tail artifact. Sternal fracture is a diagnosis that can be made using ultrasound, and some reports suggest that ultrasound is more sensitive and specific for this injury than plain radiology.

AB  - Abstract No standard of care is currently recognized for treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC). This retrospective study assesses outcome following definitive-intent, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (RT) in dogs with PC. Medical records review was performed, including 18 patients from four institutions undergoing definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiotherapy to treat PC. Diagnosis was incidental in 7/18 (39%) patients. Five dogs (28%) had evidence of metastasis to loco-regional lymph nodes at diagnosis. Seventeen patients received concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 15/18 (83%) patients received maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy, with variable drugs and protocols employed. Total prescribed radiation dose ranged from 48 to 54?Gy (median 50?Gy) delivered as daily doses of 2.5-2.8 Gy. One patient was euthanized prior to completing radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was observed in nine patients; Grade 1-2 diarrhoea was the most common toxicity observed. Suspected late toxicity (urethral stricture, ureteral stricture and hindlimb oedema) was observed in three patients. Median event-free survival (EFS) following RT was 220?days, and median overall survival was 563?days. Local progression occurred in seven patients at a median of 241?days. Median overall survival was significantly longer in incidentally diagnosed dogs (581 vs 220?days in symptomatic dogs, P = .042). EFS was significantly longer in patients treated with MTD chemotherapy (241 vs 25?days, P <?.001), and significantly shorter in patients presenting with evidence of metastatic disease (109?days) vs those without (388?days, P = .008). These findings suggest that definitive-intent radiotherapy is a valuable treatment option for local control of canine PC with moderate risk of toxicity.

The basic method and mechanism(s) of preparation of albumin microspheres and subsequent modifications made to overcome the drawbacks of earlier approaches and the need for further developments are discussed, as are the processing parameters and the level of various ingredients affecting the physicochemical properties of the albumin microspheres. Different equations proposed by various investigators to modulate in vitro release kinetics are reviewed. The microscopic structural and surface properties, the chemical modification of the biopolymer (e.g., cationization, tagging with amino acids and sugar moieties) for tissue specificity or to influence the release profile and biodegradation are discussed. An array of potential diagnostic applications and the use of albumin microspheres as a drug delivery system are reviewed. Drug Dev. Res. 58:219?247, 2003.? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To assess the value of first trimester scanning for the diagnosis of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Population/methods An unselected group of 7447 pregnant women who had a first trimester scan in our unit. In all the cases an anatomical survey was performed and the nuchal translucency was measured. Four thousand and 84 women also had second trimester biochemical screening. We assessed the performance of first trimester scanning in the detection of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Results The incidence of anomalous fetuses was 1.4%, including 43 chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate for structural abnormalities was 59% (37/63). Seventy-eight percent of chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed at 11?14?weeks either because of a nuchal translucency measurement above the 99th centile or due to the presence of structural abnormalities. Second trimester biochemical screening detected half of the fetuses with trisomy 21 which were missed by first trimester screening, increasing the sensitivity to 90.5% (19/21; 95%C.I. 69.6% to 98.8%). However, the positive predictive value of the biochemical test was very low (0.5%). Conclusion First trimester NT measurement is an effective screening test for the prenatal detection of fetuses with structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the measurement of biochemical markers in the second trimester can detect additional affected fetuses this may be out-weighted by the delay in diagnosis, the extra visits and cost so that the right time for biochemical screening still needs to be determined. Second trimester anomaly scanning should continue to be an essential part of a prenatal screening programme.

AB  - Abstract Objectives A diagnosis of cancer during the teenage years arrives at an important stage of development, where issues of normality, identity and independence are crucial. Education provides opportunity for peer contact, achievement and development for teenagers. This systematic review examined the impact of a diagnosis of cancer on the educational engagement and school life of teenagers. Method Five electronic databases were searched, returning a total of 3209 articles. Inclusion criteria were broad to allow for the range of literature within this area. Following screening, 22 articles (inclusive of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies) were retained and subjected to independent review and quality assessment. Results Key areas involved in the impact of a cancer diagnosis on teenagers' educational engagement include school attendance, reintegration, peer relationships and long-term effects on education and employment. Conclusion School absences are a concern for teenagers, but do not necessarily lead to a reduction in educational and vocational attainment. It is important to involve health care and education professionals, as well as parents and teenagers themselves, in school reintegration if it is to be successful. Peer groups and body image are two areas that could mediate education engagement for teenagers. Further research needs to be undertaken to determine the overall impact of successfully maintaining education engagement specifically for teenagers, the role that peer groups play in this process and how education engagement contributes to the overall coping and well-being of teenage cancer patients.

AB  - Abstract Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in both developing and developed countries. Biomarkers for stroke and its outcome can greatly facilitate early detection and management of the disease. miRNAs have been explored for their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and brain injury in ischaemic stroke. A substantial body of evidence suggests that miRNAs play key roles in numerous cellular changes following ischaemic stroke including mitochondrial dysfunction, energy failure, cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, activation of glial cells, increased intracellular calcium levels inflammatory responses and disruption of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). In addition, targeting specific miRNAs, therapeutic modulation of brain injury and apoptosis can also be achieved. Therefore, the current review has been compiled within an aim to give an overview of the developments exploiting miRNAs at different stages of stroke as prognostic, diagnostic, protective and therapeutic biomarkers.
