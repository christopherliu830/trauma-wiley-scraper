AB  - Mast cell tumours are one of the most common tumours of the canine skin and have a reputation for being difficult to manage because of their variable clinical presentation, behaviour and response to treatment. This review of recent literature on canine mast cell tumours suggests that the majority of such tumours may not be as bad as their reputation suggests. Most grade I and grade II tumours can be managed successfully by good surgery. Recent literature also calls into question the utility of clinical staging systems and the value of assessing surgical margins for prognosis and highlights the paucity of well-conducted, case-controlled clinical trials in assessing the efficacy of medical management of high-risk tumours. In terms of more basic research, recent studies have implicated the stem cell factor receptor KIT as having a role in the aetiology of canine mast cell tumours and there appears to be an association between c-kit mutation and higher grade of tumour. This may offer a possible target for new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Abstract The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was administered to 40 adults with severe and profound mental retardation. All participants were free from known conditions which may have given misleading results from cortisol assay. Of nine participants who showed symptoms possibly indicating depression the DST results concurred in two cases (i.e. there were two true-positives). However there were four or five (depending on criteria adopted) false-positive DST results. There did not appear to be a consistent behavioural profile for positive DST responders. With sensitivity to possible depression estimated at 22%, and a diagnostic confidence of <35%, these data do not support recommendations that the DST is useful for assisting in diagnosis of depression in this population.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes an individual therapy from the author's private practice. On referral, the client came to therapy requesting help with her 8-year-old daughter. Within the assessment, a single episode of trauma was revealed. Further therapeutic conversations told of multiple memories of trauma. The main therapeutic work has now ended, the contract being left that the client can continue to request appointments if she wishes. I show how systemic therapy from Post Milan and Narrative models, including practices from other orientations, has been useful and name three key practices as being crucial to the work, containment, curiosity and consultation. I suggest parallel processes operating between myself and my client as well as between the therapy and consultation. Distinct phases in the therapy recovery are identified. The discussion will consider themes of containment, curiosity and consultation.

AB  - Background Data examining the effect of operator years in practice and volume on adverse events (AE) after cardiac catheterization in patients with congenital heart disease is limited. Methods and Results Data were prospectively collected using a multi-center registry (C3PO). 10,885 catheterizations performed between 02/07 and 06/10 at eight institutions were included. AE rates were risk-adjusted for hemodynamic vulnerability, procedure type risk group, and age and compared between operators with different years in practice (YIP) and volume. AE occurred in 13% of procedures. Operators with less than five YIP had higher adjusted odds of any AE (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14?1.77) or a high severity AE (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04?1.75), when compared with operators with 5 to less than 25 YIP (5?<?25), while operators with ≥25 YIP had higher odds of a high severity (but not any) AE (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08?1.80). Operators with <5 YIP had a higher percentage of preventable AE (out of all AE, 16% vs. 8%, P?<?0.001) as well as higher odds of vascular or cardiac trauma (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11?2.97), or technical AE (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.31?2.99) when compared with operators with 5?<?25 YIP. There was no consistent relationship between operator volume, and incidence of AE. Conclusions Operators with less than 5 years in practice have higher risk-adjusted AE rates. While an important consideration in guiding and mentoring operators with fewer years in practice, it is important to emphasize that reporting adverse events does not take into account procedural efficacy. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Adolescents are at high risk for violence exposure and initiation of drug use. Co-occurring substance use and trauma exposure are associated with increased risk of mental health disorders, school underachievement, and involvement with multiple systems of care. Coordination and integration of systems of care are of utmost importance for these vulnerable youth. This study delineates the negative sequelae and increased service utilization patterns of adolescents with a history of trauma, substance abuse, and co-occurring trauma and substance abuse to support the need for integrated mental health and substance abuse services for youth. Data from two national sources, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment demonstrate the increased clinical severity (measured by reports of emotional and behavioral problems), dysfunction, and service utilization patterns for youth with co-occurring trauma exposure and substance abuse. We conclude with recommendations for an integrated system of care that includes trauma-informed mental health treatment and substance abuse services aimed at reducing the morbidity and relapse probability of this high-risk group.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

AB  - Abstract Background To understand whether patient-reported experiences with lung cancer may create teachable moments (TM) for their relatives as evidenced by shifts in their risk perceptions, affective response, and self-image and in turn, motivation to quit smoking. Methods Patients at a comprehensive cancer center (n?=?152) completed a survey within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis to assess their cancer-related symptoms and openness and enumerated relatives who were smokers. Relative smokers (n?=?218) then completed a survey assessing their risk perceptions, affective response, and self-image as a smoker related to the patient's diagnosis (TM mechanisms), and their motivation to quit smoking. Cross-sectional mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to explore the links between patient-reported experiences, and relatives' TM mechanisms, and motivation to quit smoking. Results Relative-reported affect was a significant mediator of the association between patient-reported symptoms and relative smoker's desire to quit. Relatives' self-image was a significant moderator of the association between patient-reported symptoms and relative smoker's desire to quit, such that patients' reported symptoms were associated with relatives' desire to quit only when the relative smoker reported a generally positive self-image as a smoker. No evidence was found for moderated mediation. However, the link between symptoms and negative affect was moderated by perceptions of risk. Conclusion Whether smokers experience a family member's lung cancer as a TM is influenced by multiple interrelated cognitive and affective factors that warrant further exploration. Clearer understanding of these factors could inform how to re-invigorate and sustain this motivation to promote concrete actions toward smoking cessation. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2-CDG) is the most common congenital disorder of N-glycosylation and is caused by a deficient PMM2 activity. The clinical presentation and the onset of PMM2-CDG vary among affected individuals ranging from a severe antenatal presentation with multisystem involvement to mild adulthood presentation limited to minor neurological involvement. Management of affected patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, a systematic review of the literature on PMM2-CDG was conducted by a group of international experts in different aspects of CDG. Our managment guidelines were initiated based on the available evidence-based data and experts' opinions. This guideline mainly addresses the clinical evaluation of each system/organ involved in PMM2-CDG, and the recommended management approach. It is the first systematic review of current practices in PMM2-CDG and the first guidelines aiming at establishing a practical approach to the recognition, diagnosis and management of PMM2-CDG patients.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of the study was to describe patients' experiences of emotional adaption following treatment for oesophageal cancer from diagnosis to 6 months after surgery. Design A qualitative interview study using an inductive approach was carried out. Methods Participants were recruited from two university hospitals in Sweden. Ten patients who had been operated for oesophageal cancer with curative intent 6 months earlier and consented to participate in the study were included. Patients who had a disease recurrence were not eligible for inclusion. Participants were interviewed with a semi-structured interview approach. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results One overarching theme was identified; Experiencing a crisis reaction, which comprised three key categories; (a) From emotionally numb to feeling quite alright; (b) From a focus on cure to reflections about a whole new life; and (c) From a severe treatment to suffering an emaciated, non-compliant body, derived from 14 distinct sub-categories. Conclusion This study highlights the process of emotional adaptation following oesophageal cancer surgery that patients describe when reflecting back on the first 6 months postoperatively pointing to a crisis reaction in this early postoperative period.

AB  - Mortality associated with cancer remains high, but more people are surviving cancer. Some people experience long-term problems associated with cancer and its treatment, and there is a need to know how to support them. This systematic literature review explores primary research for psychosocial implications of long-term survival (≥5 years) following a cancer diagnosis and interventions designed to address psychosocial problems in the long term. A systematic search of BIDS, BNI, Cancer.gov, CINAHL, Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Science was conducted to identify research publications from 1960 to 2006. Papers were selected on the basis of pre-defined criteria and rated by three independent coders. Forty-three studies met the eligibility criteria. These indicated that most people experience few problems five or more years after their diagnosis of cancer. However, 20?30% of survivors consistently reported problems associated with cancer and its treatment including physical problems, poorer quality of life, psychological distress, sexual problems, problems with social relationships and financial concerns. Not all cancer types are represented in this review. Only two intervention studies met the eligibility criteria. Research is needed to establish appropriate interventions to support those experiencing problems in the long term to enhance well-being.

AB  - Abstract??? The aim of this study was to investigate the current method for recording trauma in UK dental hospitals. A standard questionnaire was sent out to all 19 UK and Irish dental hospitals to investigate how trauma was recorded both at initial presentation and at review appointments. Where a standard form was used, a copy was requested. Each form was analysed to assess what information was being recorded and whether prompts were used. For the initial presentation of trauma, nine institutions had a standard trauma form, one used a standard form for avulsions only, seven had no form and two did not respond. For subsequent follow-up visits of trauma cases, six hospitals had a standard form, one used a standard from for avulsions only, 10 had no form and two did not respond. There was considerable variation in the questions that were asked at initial presentation of trauma cases and follow-up reviews in dento-alveolar trauma. Without consistent recording, there is little chance that multi-centred prospective clinical trials can take place in the field of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background Approximately 80?000 children and young people in the UK suffer from depression, but many are untreated because of poor identification of early warning signs and risk factors. Aims This study aimed to derive and to investigate discrimination characteristics of a prediction model for a first recorded diagnosis of depression in young people aged 15?24?years. Method This study used a matched case?control method using electronic primary care records. Stepwise conditional logistic regression modelling investigated 42 potential predictors including symptoms, co-morbidities, social factors and drug and alcohol misuse. Results Of the socio-economic and symptomatic predictors identified, the strongest associations were with depression symptoms and other psychological conditions. School problems and social services involvement were prominent predictors in men aged 15?18?years, work stress in women aged 19?24?years. Conclusion Our model is a first step in the development of a predictive model identifying early warning signs of depression in young people in primary care.

AB  - Summary A 5-year-old Rheinlander gelding was evaluated for left hindlimb stifle lameness. The lameness was localised to the stifle, but source of the lameness was not specifically diagnosed from the physical, radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. Computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography were therefore used for further investigation since these imaging techniques image bony structures, cartilage and soft tissues. This examination showed multiple lesions in the stifle: an osteochondrosis dissecans like lesion of the medial femoral condyle, bony fragments, cartilage trauma and caudal cruciate ligament injury. The prognosis for continuing use as a sports horse was regarded as unfavourable. Therefore, the horse was subjected to euthanasia. All CT findings were confirmed by gross pathology. The CT and CT arthrography examination in this case provided a diagnosis not achieved with other conventional imaging techniques.

AB  - Abstract The 2006 Lebanon War exposed children in the north of Israel to daily rocket attacks. To cope with the massive psychological needs, a teacher-delivered protocol focusing on enhancing personal resilience was implemented. Children were assessed for risk factors, symptoms, and adaptation before the 16-week program (Time 1; n = 983) and after its completion (Time 2; n = 563). At a 3-month follow-up (Time 3; n = 754) children were assessed together with a waiting-list comparison group (n = 1,152). Participating children showed a significant symptom decrease at Time 2 and significantly fewer symptoms than the control group at Time 3. Six or more risk factors were associated with greater symptoms and parental concern about the child's adaptive functioning. Teachers are valuable cost-effective providers for clinically informed interventions after mass trauma and disaster.

AB  - Abstract T1? describes the spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame and has been proposed for detecting damage to the cartilage collagen-proteoglycan matrix in osteoarthritis. In this study, a multi-slice T1? imaging method for knee cartilage was developed using spin-lock techniques and a spiral imaging sequence. The adverse effect of T1 regrowth during the multi-slice acquisition was eliminated by RF cycling. Agarose phantoms with different concentrations, 10 healthy volunteers, and 9 osteoarthritis patients were scanned at 3T. T1? values decreased as agarose concentration increased. T1? values obtained with imaging methods were compared with those obtained with spectroscopic methods. T1? values obtained during multi-slice acquisition were validated with those obtained in a single slice acquisition. Reproducibility was assessed using the average coefficient of variation of median T1?, which was 0.68% in phantoms and 4.8% in healthy volunteers. There was a significant difference (P = 0.002) in the average T1? within patellar and femoral cartilage between controls (45.04 ± 2.59 ms) and osteoarthritis patients (53.06 ± 4.60 ms). A significant correlation was found between T1? and T2; however, the difference of T2 was not significant between controls and osteoarthritis patients. The results suggest that T1? relaxation times may be a promising clinical tool for osteoarthritis detection and treatment monitoring. Magn Reson Med, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of hyperarousal and hypervigilance. Increasing research on the ?gut?brain? axis (bidirectional signaling between the gut and the brain) has drawn links between PTSD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), an exceedingly common yet incompletely understood gastrointestinal condition. This meta-analysis thus aimed to examine the body of evidence and extent of association of PTSD with IBS. Methods Using the keywords [early abuse OR childhood abuse OR violence OR trauma OR PTSD] AND [irritable bowel syndrome or IBS], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Medline, Embase, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases yielded 11,257 papers published in English between January 1, 1988, and May 1, 2018. Of these, only eight studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Results The eight studies (four cross-sectional and four cohort) contained a total of 648,375 subjects. Most studies were from the USA and conducted on army veterans. The funnel plot revealed a roughly symmetrical distribution of studies, and Egger test was not significant for publication bias (P = 0.583). Random-effects meta-analysis found PTSD to be a significant risk factor for IBS (pooled odds ratio 2.80, 95% confidence interval: 2.06 to 3.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions Overall, PTSD is associated with an increased likelihood of IBS. This is the first meta-analysis to specifically examine the association between PTSD and IBS, and it provides insights into the probable (patho)physiology and management of IBS, supporting a holistic consideration of the psychosocial aspects of IBS and further research into effective multi-modal therapeutics.
