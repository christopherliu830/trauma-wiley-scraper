AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a developmentally disabling disorder of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that affects 3%-20% of school-aged children. It affects the child at home, at school, and with peers, and persists into adolescence and young adulthood. The author reviews the diagnostic criteria, etiological considerations, evaluation process, and management of this handicapping disorder. Included is a discussion of the most frequently used medications and suggestions for home and classroom management strategies that assist the child to behave and achieve success in school. It is pertinent to all nurses, since children with ADHD are in all settings and nurses are often asked questions about this controversial health care issue in both professional and personal arenas.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews evidence-based guidelines supporting specific injury identification and management. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - Background There are no randomized studies that compare outcomes after single-incision (SLC) and conventional multi-incision (MLC) laparoscopic cholecystectomy under an optimized perioperative analgesic regimen. Methods This patient- and assessor-blinded randomized three-centre clinical trial compared SLC and MLC in women admitted electively with cholecystolithiasis. Outcomes were registered on the day of operation (day 0), on postoperative days 1, 2, 3 and 30, and 12?months after surgery. Blinding of the patients was maintained until day 3. The primary endpoint was pain on movement measured on a visual analogue scale, reported repeatedly by the patient until day 3. Results The intention-to-treat population comprised 59 patients in the SLC and 58 in the MLC group. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to any of the pain-related outcomes, on-demand administration of opioids or general discomfort. Median duration of surgery was 32·5?min longer in the SLC group (P?<?0·001). SLC was associated with a reduced incidence of vomiting on day 0 (7 versus 22 per cent; P?=?0·019). The incidences of wound-related problems were comparable. One patient in the SLC group experienced a biliary leak requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The rates of incisional hernia at 12-month follow-up were 2 per cent in both groups. Cosmetic rating was significantly improved after SLC at 1 and 12?months (P?<?0·001). Conclusion SLC did not significantly diminish early pain in a setting with optimized perioperative analgesic patient care. SLC may reduce postoperative vomiting.

AB  - Abstract This is an updated guideline for the diagnosis and management of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, first published in 2007. It was produced by the Standards of Care Committee of the British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, using accredited methods. Allergic rhinitis is common and affects 10?15% of children and 26% of adults in the UK, it affects quality of life, school and work attendance, and is a risk factor for development of asthma. Allergic rhinitis is diagnosed by history and examination, supported by specific allergy tests. Topical nasal corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for moderate to severe disease. Combination therapy with intranasal corticosteroid plus intranasal antihistamine is more effective than either alone and provides second line treatment for those with rhinitis poorly controlled on monotherapy. Immunotherapy is highly effective when the specific allergen is the responsible driver for the symptoms. Treatment of rhinitis is associated with benefits for asthma. Non-allergic rhinitis also is a risk factor for the development of asthma and may be eosinophilic and steroid-responsive or neurogenic and non- inflammatory. Non-allergic rhinitis may be a presenting complaint for systemic disorders such as granulomatous or eosinophilic polyangiitis, and sarcoidoisis. Infective rhinitis can be caused by viruses, and less commonly by bacteria, fungi and protozoa.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.

AB  - Abstract A detailed finite element model of the human kidney for trauma research has been created directly from the National Library of Medicine Visible Human Female (VHF) Project data set. An image segmentation and organ reconstruction software package has been developed and employed to transform the 2D VHF images into a 3D polygonal representation. Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces were then mapped to the polygonal surfaces, and were finally utilized to create a robust 3D hexahedral finite element mesh within a commercially available meshing software. The model employs a combined viscoelastic and hyperelastic material model to successfully simulate the behaviour of biological soft tissues. The finite element model was then validated for use in biomechanical research. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Procedural cooperation between cardiac surgeon and interventional cardiologist to facilitate interventions such as device delivery or angioplasty (hybrid procedure) has become increasingly common in the management of patients with congenital heart disease. Design.? Data were prospectively collected using a multicenter registry (C3PO). Between February 2007 and December 2008, seven institutions submitted data regarding 7019 cardiac catheterization procedures. Procedural data and adverse events (AEs) of 128 hybrid procedures were evaluated. Results.? There was significant variability in the number of hybrid procedures per center, ranging from one to 89 with a median of eight. A total of 60% of interventional (vs. strictly diagnostic) hybrid procedures were performed by one center. The median weight was 3.7?kg (0.7?86?kg). Single-ventricle circulation was present in 60% of the procedures. Hybrid procedures included: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent placement (n = 55), vascular rehabilitation (n = 25), ventricular septal defect (VSD) device closure (n = 7), valvotomy (n = 3), and diagnostic hybrid procedures (n = 38). Sixteen AEs occurred in 15/128 (12%) procedures. These included minor or trivial AEs (n = 9), moderate AEs (n = 5), major AEs (n = 1), and catastrophic AEs (n = 1). The type of AE documented included arrhythmias (n = 6), hypoxia or hypotension (n = 3), vessel or cardiac trauma (n = 2), and other events (n = 5). Of documented AEs, 9/16 (56%) were classified as not preventable, 6/16 (38%) as possibly preventable, and 1/16 (6%) as preventable. The incidence of AE related to PDA stent placement with surgical exposure (5/50, 10%) was significantly lower when compared with PDA stent placement performed percutaneously (4/5, 80%, P= .002). Conclusion.? Hybrid procedures appear to have a low incidence of associated major AEs. PDA stent placement performed as a palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or complex single/two ventricle patients may have a lower incidence of AEs if performed using a direct approach with surgical exposure rather than a percutaneous approach. Accurate definitions of these innovative procedures are required to facilitate prospective data collection.

AB  - Summary.? To describe the in-hospital epidemiology of haemophilia A and B in the US we analysed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), a stratified probability sample of 20% of all hospital discharges in the US for the year 2007. We applied sampling weights to represent all hospital discharges for haemophilia A and B identified using ICD-9 codes 286.0 and 286.1, respectively. Haemophilia (A or B) was one of all the listed diagnoses in 9737 discharges and principal diagnosis in 1684 discharges. The most common associated diagnoses in discharges with Haemophilia in adults and children were hypertension (28.1?±?1.6%) and central line infections (15.2?±?1.8%) respectively. No Hepatitis C or HIV was reported in children. Among 212 deaths, associated diagnoses included sepsis (37.9%), heart failure (30.2%), respiratory failure (28.3%), pneumonia (24.5%), HIV (14.2%), hepatic coma (5.2%) and intracranial haemorrhage (2.3%). All fifteen reported paediatric deaths occurred on day zero of life, the commonest associated diagnoses being Intraventricular haemorrhage and newborn haemorrhage-NOS (33% each). Median age of in-hospital mortality for diagnosis of Haemophilia was 68.3?years as compared to 72.3?years for all males for all hospitalizations in NIS combined. Mean hospital charges for haemophilia of $76823?±?5530 were significantly higher than those from all causes of hospitalization of $26,120?±?562. In-hospital mortality is rare in children with haemophilia beyond the neonatal period and age of mortality in adults is approaching that of the general male population. Hospitalization in children is most often due to central line infections and hospitalization and death in adults is primarily due to age-related illnesses.

AB  - Background The literature is sparse on written test development in a post-graduate multi-disciplinary setting. Developing and evaluating knowledge tests for use in multi-disciplinary post-graduate training is challenging. The objective of this study was to describe the process of developing and evaluating a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test for use in a multi-disciplinary training program in obstetric-anesthesia emergencies. Methods A multi-disciplinary working committee with 12 members representing six professional healthcare groups and another 28 participants were involved. Recurrent revisions of the MCQ items were undertaken followed by a statistical analysis. The MCQ items were developed stepwise, including decisions on aims and content, followed by testing for face and content validity, construct validity, item?total correlation, and reliability. Results To obtain acceptable content validity, 40 out of originally 50 items were included in the final MCQ test. The MCQ test was able to distinguish between levels of competence, and good construct validity was indicated by a significant difference in the mean score between consultants and first-year trainees, as well as between first-year trainees and medical and midwifery students. Evaluation of the item?total correlation analysis in the 40 items set revealed that 11 items needed re-evaluation, four of which addressed content issues in local clinical guidelines. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 for reliability was found, which is acceptable. Conclusion Content and construct validity and reliability were acceptable. The presented template for the development of this MCQ test could be useful to others when developing knowledge tests and may enhance the overall quality of test development.

AB  - Abstract Foot infections are common in persons with diabetes and are often the proximate cause of lower extremity amputation. There have been many publications in the past few years dealing with the appropriate ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections. This review presents information gathered from a comprehensive, ongoing surveillance of the literature (published and abstracts) over the past 4 years. Prospective studies have now defined the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections, as well as methods to score and classify the wounds. Several recently published guidelines can assist clinicians in managing these infections. The etiologic agents of infection have been well-defined, and the prevalence of multi-drug-resistance pathogens is growing. Molecular methods offer great promise for quicker and more sensitive diagnosis of infection. New antimicrobial agents, both systemic and topical, as well as novel local treatments, have been shown to be effective in various studies. Improved methods of deploying older agents have added to the variety of treatment approaches now available. Several adjunctive treatments may benefit some patients but their role is as yet unclear. While there is much yet to learn about the most cost-effective ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections the main effort is now to disseminate the available information and facilitate employing the evidence-based guideline recommendations.

AB  - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), given its psychiatric focus on mental disorders in individuals, presents families and family therapists with challenges. Despite considerable controversies over its adoption, the DSM-5 extends a process of standardizing a language for human and relational concerns. No longer a diagnostic language of professionals alone, its use is medicalizing how mental health funders and administrators, as well as clients, respond to human concerns. For family therapists who practice systemically, particularly from poststructuralist and strengths-based orientations, many tensions can follow when use of the DSM-5 is expected by mental health administrators and funders, or by clients who present concerns about themselves or a diagnosed family member. In this paper, I explore how such DSM-5 related tensions might be recognized, navigated, and negotiated in the practice of family therapy with clients, and with administrators and funders.

AB  - Abstract A paradigmatic shift in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) research is underway. Formistic and mechanistic reserch designs, characterized by single-category, single-cause, single-effect models, gradually are being replaced by contextual and organistic research designs that feature multi-category, multi-cause, and multi-effect interactional models. Such changes in diagnostic and treatment outcome research require solving many methodological issues in such areas as: (1) measuring types of traumas and stressors; (2) measuring PTSD symptoms and subtypes; (3) measuring subject dispositional characteristics (such as ethnic differences); (4) assessing concurrent and/or pre-existing psychiatric (Axis I) disorders; (5) classifying personality styles and concurrent and/or pre-existing personality (Axis II) disorders; (6) evaluating phase in the development of PTSD as a disorder; (7) measuring current environmental stresses and interpersonal interactions; and (8) assessing secondary gains and readiness for treatment. These and other methodological problems must be addressed as research on PTSD shifts to longitudinal measurement of subjects randomly assigned to treatment conditions.

AB  - Abstract Aortic dissection is a lethal cardiovascular emergency that continues to pose a diagnostic dilemma to the emergency physician. The condition is rare, can present atypically and is associated with a cumulative mortality for every hour that passes. While it is a recognised differential of acute chest pain, its prevalence in comparison to other causes often leads to the diagnosis being overlooked. The ED is a busy environment with high patient turnover and varying degrees of complexity and acuity. This increases susceptibility to cognitive bias and error-producing conditions that can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis. In reported cases where aortic dissection has been missed, clinician awareness of the disease was not the primary issue but failure to respond to clinical cues suggestive of aortic dissection was. To improve patient outcomes for this condition, it is important for clinicians to be aware of pertinent cognitive bias and error-producing conditions.
