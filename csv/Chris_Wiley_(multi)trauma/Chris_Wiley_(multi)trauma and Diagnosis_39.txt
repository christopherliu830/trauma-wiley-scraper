AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND There appears to be a growing movement in favor of core needle biopsy (CNB) over fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in detecting breast carcinoma in women. The authors compared the sensitivity and specificity of these two methods in patients who presented to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for evaluation of a palpable breast mass. METHODS One hundred and twenty-four women (mean age, 51 years; range, 28-86 years) with a clinically suspicious palpable mass (mean size, 4.4 cm; range, 1-12 cm) underwent concurrent FNA and CNB. For the FNA, an average of three needle passes were made. FNA was followed by three CNBs using the Bard Monopty needle. CNB samples were submitted for frozen section to determine adequacy, and an additional three cores were performed if the first batch was deemed inadequate. All patients ultimately had histologic confirmation of their neoplasms either by the core needle procedure or by definitive open surgical biopsy. Features of cases with discrepant diagnoses were examined in relation to tumor size and histologic type. RESULTS Specificity of both FNA and CNB was 100%. The sensitivity in detecting a malignant neoplasm was higher for FNA than for CNB (97.5% vs. 90%, P < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, FNA of palpable breast lesions is a more sensitive method for the detection of carcinoma regardless of tumor type, size, or differentiation. Contrary to other reports, not only was FNA alone more sensitive than CNB alone, the addition of CNB to an already negative FNA failed to increase sensitivity in the detection of carcinoma. However, CNB did contribute to a more definitive diagnosis in some cases. The authors also found FNA to be more cost effective than CNB for palpable breast lesions when time and effort are taken into consideration. This reinforces the benefit of FNA over CNB in the detection of early stage breast carcinoma. Cancer 1996;78:773-7.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives The increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and the consequent progression to cirrhosis is expected to become a major cause of liver transplantation. This will exacerbate the organ donor shortage and mean that ?marginal? fatty liver grafts are more frequently used. Autofluorescence spectroscopy is a fast, objective, and non-destructive method to detect change in the endogenous fluorophores distribution and could prove to be a valuable tool for NAFLD diagnosis and transplant graft assessment. Materials and Methods A system was constructed consisting of a fibre probe with two laser diodes that provided excitation light at 375 and 405?nm, and an imaging spectrograph system. This was used to distinguish fluorescence spectra acquired from the harvested livers from mice with NAFLD of differing severity (healthy, mild steatotic and steatohepatitic). The fluorescence data were entered into a sparse multiclass probabilistic algorithm for disease classification. Histopathology, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and alanine transaminase (ALT) assays were conducted in addition to the fluorescence measurements Results TBARS and ALT assays enabled differentiation of the steatohepatitic group from the mild steatosis and control groups (P?≤?0.028) but failed to separate the mild steatotic group from the control group. The three groups were all clearly differentiated from each other using fluorescence spectroscopy, and classification accuracy was found to be 95%. Conclusion Fluorescence spectroscopy appears to be a promising approach for the analysis of diseased liver tissue. Lasers Surg. Med. 43:392?400, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the relevant human and veterinary literature regarding the timing of surgical intervention for trauma patients and the impact on outcome. Data Sources Original research, clinical studies, and review articles with no date restrictions from both human and veterinary literature. Human Data Synthesis Despite extensive research into the ideal timing of surgical intervention for human trauma victims, debate is ongoing and views are still evolving. Prior to the 1970s, the standard of care consisted of delayed surgical treatment, as these patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery. Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing for nearly 2 decades, early definitive surgical treatment was recommended. The most recent evolution of human trauma management incorporates the concept of damage control surgery, which acknowledges the importance of early skeletal stabilization or laparotomy for reducing morbidity while attempting to avoid complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Veterinary Data Synthesis Despite a relatively large amount of literature available regarding veterinary trauma, no evidence exists to provide the clinician guidance as to the ideal timing of surgery for trauma patients. With the exception of diaphragmatic hernia, no studies were identified that attempted to evaluate this variable. Conclusions Veterinary-specific studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on outcome following trauma. The information that can be obtained from studies in this area can improve veterinary trauma care and may be used as models for human trauma care through translational applications.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC), the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppressive agents, plays a crucial role in new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT). Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the ? cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC-induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/AKT and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (eg, PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (odds ratio = 2.692, P = .023, n = 135). Integrating grafts? CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs 0.79, P = .048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces ?hematogenous diabetes? via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a challenging condition for which there is no reference standard for treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide outcome data on the largest study to date evaluating pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for ON and to determine whether any demographic, clinical, or treatment characteristics are associated with success. Design.? Retrospective data analysis was conducted in 102 subjects evaluating the effect of myriad factors on treatment success. Setting.? This study was conducted in academic civilian and military pain treatment centers. Patients.? One hundred and two consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of ON were treated with PRF of the greater and/or lesser occipital nerve. Outcome Measures.? A positive primary outcome was predefined as ≥50% pain relief lasting at least 3 months. The secondary outcome measure was procedural satisfaction. Results.? Fifty-two (51%) patients experienced ≥50% pain relief and satisfaction with treatment lasting at least 3 months. Variables associated with a positive outcome included a traumatic inciting event (65.7% success rate; P?=?0.03), lower diagnostic block volumes (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62?0.82; P?<?0.0001), and employment of multiple rounds of PRF (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.77?4.92; P?<?0.0001). Factors correlating with treatment failure included extension of pain anterior to the scalp apex (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14?0.73; P?=?0.006) and ongoing secondary gain issues (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11?0.33; P?<?0.0001). Conclusion.? PRF may provide intermediate-term benefit in ON to a significant proportion of refractory cases. Careful attention to selection criteria and treatment parameters may further improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - Objective Exposure to sexual assault is a significant risk factor to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in females. The early neurobiological changes leading to the development of PTSD remain understudied and unclear in this population. Methods Participants were 27 adult females recruited within a month following exposure to sexual assault (T1) and 20 age-matched non-exposed controls. Among the victims, 10 participants met (PTSD+) and 15 did not meet (PTSD?) DSM-IV criteria for PTSD 6 months post-trauma (T2). At both visits, hippocampal and amygdala volumes were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging scans, and indices of total diurnal cortisol changes were derived from individual areas under the curve relative to the ground (AUCg). Measures at T1 were compared between groups at T1, measures at T2 between groups at T2, and measures at T1 between groups at T2. Results At T1, victims had significantly smaller bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not AUCg, than controls. At T2, neither hippocampal volume nor AUCg significantly differed among the groups. However, the PTSD+ group had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes at T1 than the control group, but not compared to the PTSD? group. Conclusions This study indicates that having smaller hippocampal volumes is a risk factor to develop PTSD in females exposed to sexual assault.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the Intensive In-home Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service (IICAPS), a large-scale home-based intervention that collaboratively engages the family, school, and various other service providers (e.g. health practitioners or judicial systems) to prevent the hospitalization, institutionalization or out-of-home placement of children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. Multi-informant data (youth, parents and clinician) on the level of youth problem severity and functioning was gathered from 7169 youth and their families served by the IICAPS network, pre- and post-intervention. A newly developed ?Multi-informant Latent Consensus? (MILC) approach was employed to measure mental health ?baseline levels? and change, within a Structural Equation Modeling framework. The MILC approach demonstrated promise integrating information from multiple informants involved in the therapeutic process to yield a more accurate and systemic view of a child's level of functioning and problem severity than each report taken individually. Results indicated that the IICAPS family and community based intervention model led to a reduction of problem severity and improved functioning in children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance.

AB  - Abstract A variant of the Implicit Association Test focusing on the association of sexual and aggressive themes was administered to 90 college students (61 women) and correlated with a series of variables based on participant history of sexually traumatic events. A history of sexual abuse was correlated with increased difficulties in processing sexual and aggressive concepts simultaneously. Furthermore, this relationship remained significant after controlling for general level of emotional distress, and even after controlling for self-reported aggressiveness and positive feelings towards sex. The findings provide grounds for further exploration of deficits in associations between sexual and aggressive concepts as a possible indicator of the cognitive effects of sexual abuse.

AB  - Summary Chronic venous disease is a common disorder associated with a variety of symptoms in later disease stages but also with complications such as venous leg ulcer. This, in turn, has substantial socioeconomic effects and significantly impacts patients? quality of life. While there are a number of diagnostic procedures available, color-flow duplex ultrasound has become the gold standard. As regards therapeutic options, major advances have been made in recent decades. Today, there are alternatives to saphenofemoral ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein, including endovenous thermal ablation techniques. However, treatment selection continues to depend on many factors such as individual anatomical circumstances and disease stage. The following article provides an overview of the anatomy and pathophysiology as well as current diagnostic and therapeutic standards.

AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - SYNOPSIS Potential availability of a reliable non-invasive system for measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)prompted measurement of rCBF in patients with vascular headache in order to assess its diagnostic value. The rCBF in migraine varied with the clinical phase. During the prodrome phase the blood flow was reduced; whereas during the headache phase, a striking cortical hyperperfusion was noted. Patients who continued to have neurologic symptoms of the prodrome in the headache phase showed a mixed pattern of reduced and increased blood flow. The rCBF was found normal in the headache phase in patients with muscle contraction and psychogenic headache. In patients with headache as a prominent symptom of cerebrovascular insufficiency, rCBF was reduced but was not significantly different from rCBF in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency without headache.

AB  - Aim Previous research has demonstrated a strong association between early trauma exposure and the development of psychotic symptoms. However, few of these studies have included young adolescents and children. This study investigated rates and number of potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) among typically developing youth (TD; n = 21), youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 38), and youth with a psychotic disorder (PD; n = 28) between 7 and 18 years of age. CHR participants were further evaluated to determine whether a history of PTEs was associated with prodromal symptom severity. Methods Study group inclusion was determined by structured interviews. Trauma history was assessed using the post-traumatic stress disorder module of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children?Present and Lifetime Version. CHR participants with vs without a history of PTEs were compared on severity of prodromal symptoms. Results CHR and PD participants reported significantly higher rates and numbers of PTEs than TD participants. Contrary to expectations and prior research, CHR participants with vs without a history of PTEs did not differ in prodromal symptom severity. Explanations and implications for the findings are discussed. Conclusions These findings suggest that the relationship between trauma and the development of psychotic symptoms extends to children and adolescents as young as 7 years of age. This study underscores the importance of screening for trauma exposure among youth seeking treatment for psychotic symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) reconstruction at two different slice thicknesses (1?mm, ?high resolution? vs. 5?mm, ?routine?) with respect to the detection of blebs and bullae (BBs) in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Methods Thirty-one patients underwent wedge resection of BBs (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral) for PSP from January 2010 to January 2013. Two observers assessed the presence and locations of BBs independently using high-resolution CT (HRCT) and routine CT reconstruction, and compared the sensitivities of each reconstruction method for BB detection using operative findings as a standard reference. In addition, the number of BBs in each CT image set was recorded and inter-observer agreements were evaluated. Results Sensitivity for the detection of BBs was significantly better for HRCT than routine CT (97.0% vs. 63.6% for observer 1 and 94.0% vs. 57.6% for observer 2, respectively, both P-values?<?0.001). On a per-bleb and a per-bulla basis, inter-observer agreements regarding BBs by HRCT were good and very good (k?=?0.66 and 0.94, respectively) and superior to those determined by routine CT (k?=?0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion Different slice thickness reconstructions influence the diagnostic efficacy of MDCT for the detection of BBs in patients with PSP. High-resolution thin slice CT reconstruction was found to have a significantly greater sensitivity than routine thicker slice thickness reconstruction for the detection of BBs.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to describe and discuss the diagnostic and treatment challenges related to tooth fractures primarily in the vertical plane, that is, the long axis of the crown and/or root. This includes when and how to identify and determine the extent of the fracture, when a coronal restoration should be placed, when root canal treatment is needed, and when a tooth or root should be extracted based on the location and extent of the fracture. The term ?longitudinal fractures? is used because they usually represent vertical extensions of fractures over distance and time. These fractures often present problems with diagnosis and treatment, but should be considered as findings only. They are not to be considered as pulpal or periapical diagnoses, but as pathways for bacteria that may induce pulpal and/or periapical inflammation or disease. Longitudinal fractures are divided into five definitive classifications, generally from least to most severe: (1) craze lines; (2) fractured cusp; (3) cracked tooth; (4) split tooth; and (5) vertical root fracture. These differ but have frequently been confused or combined in clinical articles, creating misunderstanding and resulting in incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. These classifications have been devised to provide global definitions that researchers and clinicians can use to eliminate this confusion. This review is subdivided into these five classifications as to incidence, pathogenesis, clinical features, etiologies, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention.

AB  - Summary The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are effective statistical tools for evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests for binary-class medical data. However, many real-world biomedical problems involve more than two categories. The Volume Under the ROC Surface (VUS) and Hypervolume Under the ROC Manifold (HUM) measures are extensions for the AUC under three-class and multiple-class models. Inference methods for such measures have been proposed recently. We develop a method of constructing a linear combination of markers for which the VUS or HUM of the combined markers is maximized. Asymptotic validity of the estimator is justified by extending the results for maximum rank correlation estimation that are well known in econometrics. A bootstrap resampling method is then applied to estimate the sampling variability. Simulations and examples are provided to demonstrate our methods.
