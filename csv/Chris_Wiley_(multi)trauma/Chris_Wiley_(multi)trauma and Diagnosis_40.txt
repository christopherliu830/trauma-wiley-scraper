AB  - Background: We investigated the incidence and severity of post-injury morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)-treated trauma patients. We also identified risk factors in the early phase after injury that predicted the later development of complications. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study design was used. One hundred and sixty-four adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24?h were included during a 21-month period. The incidence and severity of morbidity such as multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), severe sepsis and 30-day post-injury mortality were calculated and risk factors were analyzed with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The median age was 40 years, the injury severity score was 24, the new injury severity score was 29, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 15, sequential organ failure assessment maximum was 7 and ICU length of stay was 3.1 days. The incidences of post-injury MOF were 40.2%, ALI 25.6%, severe sepsis 31.1% and 30-day mortality 10.4%. The independent risk factors differed to some extent between the outcome parameters. Age, severity of injury, significant head injury and massive transfusion were independent risk factors for several outcome parameters. Positive blood alcohol was only a predictor of MOF, whereas prolonged rescue time only predicted death. Unexpectedly, injury severity was not an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions: Although the incidence of morbidity was considerable, mortality was relatively low. Early post-injury risk factors that predicted later development of complications differed between morbidity and mortality.

AB  - choi y., lawler e., boenecke c.a., ponatoski e.r. & zimring c.m. (2011)?Developing a multi-systemic fall prevention model, incorporating the physical environment, the care process, and technology: a systematic review. Journal of Advanced Nursing67(12), 2501?2524. Abstract Aims.? This paper reports a review that assessed the effectiveness and characteristics of fall prevention interventions implemented in hospitals. A multi-systemic fall prevention model that establishes a practical framework was developed from the evidence. Background.? Falls occur through complex interactions between patient-related and environmental risk factors, suggesting a need for multifaceted fall prevention approaches that address both factors. Data sources.? We searched Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and the Web of Science databases for references published between January 1990 and June 2009 and scrutinized secondary references from acquired papers. Review methods.? Due to the heterogeneity of interventions and populations, we conducted a quantitative systematic review without a meta-analysis and used a narrative summary to report findings. Results.? From the review, three distinct characteristics of fall prevention interventions emerged: (1) the physical environment, (2) the care process and culture and (3) technology. While clinically significant evidence shows the efficacy of environment-related interventions in reducing falls and fall-related injuries, the literature identified few hospitals that had introduced environment-related interventions in their multifaceted fall intervention strategies. Conclusion.? Using the multi-systemic fall prevention model, hospitals should promote a practical strategy that benefits from the collective effects of the physical environment, the care process and culture and technology to prevent falls and fall-related injuries. By doing so, they can more effectively address the various risk factors for falling and therefore, prevent falls. Studies that test the proposed model need to be conducted to establish the efficacy of the model in practice.

AB  - Abstract Although the diagnosis of a diabetic foot infection is made based on clinical symptoms and signs, we also use blood laboratory, microbiological and radiological studies to make treatment decisions. All of these diagnostic studies have pitfalls that can lead to a delay in diagnosis. Such delays will likely lead to further tissue damage and to a higher chance of amputation. One of these pitfalls is that some clinicians rely on microbiological, rather than clinical data, to diagnose infection. Though subjective by nature, clinical signs predict outcome of foot infections accurately. Another pitfall is that microbiological data can be misleading. All wounds harbour microorganisms; therefore, a positive wound culture does not mean that a wound is infected. Furthermore, the outcome of cultures of wound swabs does not correlate well with culture results of tissue biopsies. Therapy guidance by wound swab will likely lead to overtreatment of non-pathogenic organisms. Genotyping might have a role in identifying previously unrecognized (combinations of) pathogens in diabetic foot infection, bacteria in sessile phenotype and non-culturable pathogens, e.g. in cases where antibiotics have already been administered. One more pitfall is that the diagnosis of osteomyelitis remains difficult. Although the result of percutaneous bone biopsy is the reference standard for osteomyelitis, some other diagnostic modalities can aid in the diagnosis. A combination of several of these diagnostic tests is probably a good strategy to achieve a higher diagnostic accuracy. Relying on a single test will likely lead to misidentification of patients with osteomyelitis with associated overtreatment and undertreatment. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been identified as a meaningful indicator of distress in cancer survivors. Distinct from young adult survivors of childhood cancer, young people diagnosed with cancer as adolescents and young adults (AYAs) face unique psychosocial issues; however, there is little published research of PTSS in the AYA population. This study examines prevalence and predictors of PTSS among AYAs with cancer. Methods As part of a longitudinal study of AYAs with cancer, 151 patients aged 15?39?years completed mailed surveys at 6 and 12?months post-diagnosis. Severity of PTSS was estimated at 6 and 12?months post-diagnosis. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the predictive effects of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on changes in PTSS over time. Results At 6 and 12?months, respectively, 39% and 44% of participants reported moderate to severe levels of PTSS; 29% had PTSS levels suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder. No significant differences in severity of PTSS between 6 and 12?months were observed. Regression analyses suggested that a greater number of side effects were associated with higher levels of PTSS at 6?months. Currently receiving treatment, having surgical treatment, diagnosis of a cancer type with a 90?100% survival rate, remaining unemployed/not in school, and greater PTSS at 6?months were associated with higher levels of PTSS at 12?months. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress symptoms were observed as early as 6?months following diagnosis and remained stable at 12-month follow-up. The development of early interventions for reducing distress among AYA patients in treatment is recommended. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The histological distinction between dermatofibroma (DF) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) may be difficult. CD34 and Factor XIIIa have been used to differentiate DF from DFSP, but there is a lack of specificity. CD44 is a membrane glycoprotein which has multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing of variant exons. CD44 is the principal cell surface receptor for hyaluronate (HA). In this study we explored the expression of standard CD44 (CD44s) and its isoforms (CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7, CD44v7v8, and CD44v10), and HA in DF and DFSP. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the biopsy specimens of 15 cases of DF and 4 cases of DFSP, using antibodies for the CD44s and its isoforms, and hyaluronate binding protein (HABP). Tumor cells displayed a strong CD44s immunoreactivity in all cases of DF whereas a faint HA positivity was observed in the tumor stroma. DF cells were negative for CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v6, CD44v7 and CD44v7v8 but they showed a strong reactivity for CD44v5 and CD44v10. CD44s expression was significantly reduced or absent in all DFSP lesions and the tumor stroma displayed a strong staining for HA. Our results indicate that CD44 and HA can be used as additional diagnostic markers to distinguish DF from DFSP.

AB  - Despite advances in evidence-based treatments (EBTs), research suggests these interventions are not utilized in practice settings. This study examined implementation of multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP), an EBT for childhood mood disorders, in two outpatient community clinics. Fifteen community therapists facilitated MF-PEP. Twenty community clinicians referred 40 children ages 8?12 with mood disorders and their parents who participated in MF-PEP. Preliminary descriptive findings based on observations and self-report questionnaires demonstrated implementation outcomes of acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of MF-PEP at these clinics. Parents also demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of mood disorders posttreatment. Preliminary results support implementation of MF-PEP in practice settings and suggest community-based MF-PEP may be associated with improvement in clinical outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background The Virtopsy project, a multi-disciplinary project that involves forensic science, diagnostic imaging, computer science, automation technology, telematics and biomechanics, aims to develop new techniques to improve the outcome of forensic investigations. This paper presents a new approach in the field of minimally invasive virtual autopsy for a versatile robotic system that is able to perform three-dimensional (3D) surface scans as well as post mortem image-guided soft tissue biopsies. Methods The system consists of an industrial six-axis robot with additional extensions (i.e. a linear axis to increase working space, a tool-changing system and a dedicated safety system), a multi-slice CT scanner with equipment for angiography, a digital photogrammetry and 3D optical surface-scanning system, a 3D tracking system, and a biopsy end effector for automatic needle placement. A wax phantom was developed for biopsy accuracy tests. Results Surface scanning times were significantly reduced (scanning times cut in half, calibration three times faster). The biopsy module worked with an accuracy of 3.2 mm. Discussion Using the Virtobot, the surface-scanning procedure could be standardized and accelerated. The biopsy module is accurate enough for use in biopsies in a forensic setting. Conclusion The Virtobot can be utilized for several independent tasks in the field of forensic medicine, and is sufficiently versatile to be adapted to different tasks in the future.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether a systematic stream-lined approach could be routinely used in the evaluation of the fetal intracranal anatomy, and which could be used to effectively and efficiently exclude all major intracranial malformation. Three planes were determined to be independent without overlay. Following the establishment of these three independent oblique planes across the intracranial anatomy, there were applied clinically to determine whether such planes would be sufficient to diagnose the major intracranial abnormalities. After retrospectively examining the various imaging levels taken, it was independently determined that three levels of intracranial imaging provided the greatest anatomic view of the entire fetal brain: the lateral ventricular level (Level I); the medial-thalamic level (Level II); and the inferior-posterior fossa view (Level III). We examined 131 cases of intracranial abnormalities that were prenatally diagnosed between 14 and 24?weeks gestation. One investigator was given the three-level view protocol to determine if the anomalies could be identified using this system. It was determined that, of the 131 abnormal cases, 126 (96.2%) were diagnosed using Levels I, II or III, independently or in combination. There were no false-positive test results. The present study investigated the efficacy of a three level view (TLV) imaging of the fetal brain representing a complete 2-D examination. We found this approach to be applicable throughout pregnancy and suitable for visualization of normal intracranial structures as well as the identification of abnormalities.

Diagnoses included: lifetime mania/hypomania, panic disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder; six-month adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and 30-day major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and substance (alcohol or drug) use disorder (abuse or dependence). The sample (n?=?460) was weighted for over-sampling CIDI-SC/PCL screened positives. Diagnostic thresholds were set to equalize false positives and false negatives. Good individual-level concordance was found between CIDI-SC/PCL and SCID diagnoses at these thresholds (area under curve [AUC]?=?0.69?0.79). AUC was considerably higher for continuous than dichotomous screening scale scores (AUC?=?0.80?0.90), arguing for substantive analyses using not only dichotomous case designations but also continuous measures of predicted probabilities of clinical diagnoses.

To quantify the impact of edentulousness on residual ridge volume, denture stomatitis (DS), as well as oral health behaviours among geriatric denture-wearers. Background:? Residual ridge resorption (RRR) is the primary intraoral complication of complete edentulism, but individual variation among geriatric patients has been observed. Materials and methods:? Data collection relied upon a 10-year retrospective chart review of all complete denture-wearing geriatric patients presenting at the Removable Prosthodontics Clinic, Dental School of Athens, between 1993 and 2002. Analyses relied on descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on ordinal logistic regression. Results:? A total of 873 records of geriatric patients (age mean?=?72; median?=?70; range?=?65?95) comprised our analytical sample. Subjects? mean (SD) time since edentulation was 7.7 (10.2) years. Eleven percent were diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). While 28% of patients reported cleaning their dentures at least daily, 6% presented with denture stomatitis (DS). Each added year of edentulism increased the odds of mandibular RRR: OR (95% CI)?=?1.05 (1.03, 1.07). Nightly denture wear was the strongest risk factor for DS. Finally, independent of age and sex, each year of being edentulous increased the odds of presenting with TMD: OR (95% CI)?=?1.03 (1.01, 1.05). Conclusion:? Time since edentulation was strongly associated with mandibular but not maxillary RRR, as well as TMD development.

AB  - Abstract Despite the many journal articles and reviews that have been published regarding the treatment of trauma to teeth, the endodontic management of these injuries is often still not fully understood. The purpose of this review is to establish clear and up-to-date guidelines for practitioners who are faced with treating dental injuries on a day-to-day basis, based on an assessment of current available scientific information relating to the endodontic management of these injuries. Treatment is discussed under the headings: infractions, uncomplicated crown fractures, complicated crown fractures, crown-root fractures, root fractures, luxation injuries, avulsion, root resorption, pulp canal obliteration and open-apex teeth. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of traumatized immature teeth where maintenance of pulp blood supply is important to encourage continued development of the root system. Only the treatment of traumatized permanent anterior teeth is reviewed. Information contained in this article is based on a review of the literature on dental trauma which involved a MEDLINE search using the key words ?dental trauma? and the individual topics listed above. The guidelines produced by the International Association of Dental Traumatology, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and the American Association of Endodontists were also reviewed and the recommendations contained in this paper are in concert with the major recommendations of these bodies.

AB  - Summary Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a limb- and life-threatening condition that necessitates prompt recognition and treatment. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of ALI. Diagnostic and therapeutic treatment strategies are presented in the context of the best available evidence in the field. The primary causes for ALI may be categorized into two major groups: embolic and thrombotic. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) may be less desirable in a patient with underlying anemia or risk of bleeding, since systemic effects of thrombolytic agents may worsen these issues. The initial treatment of a patient with a cold limb and high suspicion for ALI should include the institution of intravenous unfractionated heparin. The administration of aspirin, while generally recommended for primary or secondary prevention purposes, can be considered in most patients presenting with ALI, assuming no drug allergy or concurrent bleeding diathesis.

AB  - Abstract:? First described in the 1500s, scurvy is infrequently seen in industrialized countries today, although vulnerable patient groups remain. A 15-yr-old girl underwent liver transplantation at age 26?months for a primary diagnosis of biliary hypoplasia, and subsequently developed late allograft failure and progressive renal insufficiency culminating in listing for combined liver retransplantation and kidney transplantation at age 13?yr. She required regular hemodialysis treatment for 12?months prior to deceased donor organ availability, with a complicated clinical course including recurrent septic episodes and severe cachexia. Ten months after initiation of hemodialysis, she presented with severe bone pain, purpura, ecchymoses, gingival hyperplasia, mucosal bleeding, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Serial serum ascorbic acid levels were found to be extremely low (<10??mol/L) despite routine supplementation both in her dialysate and via regular oral supplementation. Histopathology from skin biopsy revealed purpura, hyper- and parakeratosis, and follicular plugging. She had ECG and 2D echocardiogram disturbances, as well as osteopenia and sclerosis of the extremities on radiological evaluations. Therapy with high-dose ascorbic acid (1?g/day orally) led to complete resolution of skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of awareness and recognition of this historic diagnosis, and particularly in children with end-stage organ disease with severely compromised nutrition.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the incidence and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) in children. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients younger than 18 years of age treated for DFSP over a period of 11 years (2000?2011) in Madrid, Spain. The sample consisted of 13 children. The average annual incidence of DFSP in the pediatric population corresponded to 1.02 cases per million person-years (95% confidence interval 0.55, 1.73). Sites of involvement were diverse, with 15.3% of tumors found in acral locations. The median tumor size was 3.5 cm ? 3 cm and the median time from apparent onset to diagnosis was 36 months. Histopathologic examination revealed conventional (77.0%), pigmented (15.4%), and myxoid (7.6%) variants. The mitotic index was consistently <5 per 10 high-power fields. All lesions were removed using surgical excision. One patient developed a local recurrence because of initial affected margins; none developed metastases. The median duration of clinical follow-up was 70.5 months. This study estimated the average annual incidence rate of DFSP in a population of patients younger than 18 years and reviewed the experience of several hospitals in the management of this tumor.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.

AB  - An improved understanding and characterization of glial activation and its relationship with white matter injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination after brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public healthcare burden and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Particularly, traumatic white matter (WM) injury or traumatic axonal injury has been reported as being associated with patients' poor outcomes. However, there is very limited data reporting the importance of glial activation after TBI and its interaction with WM injury. This article presents a systematic review of traumatic WM injury and the associated glial activation, from basic science to clinical diagnosis and prognosis, from advanced neuroimaging perspective. It concludes that there is a disconnection between WM injury research and the essential role of glia which serve to restore a healthy environment for axonal regeneration following WM injury. Particularly, there is a significant lack of non-invasive means to characterize the complex pathophysiology of WM injury and glial activation in both animal models and in humans. An improved understanding and characterization of the relationship between glia and WM injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination.
