AB  - Background Independently, maternal depression and maternal history of childhood abuse confer risk for impaired parenting. These associations may be compounded when depressed mothers with histories of childhood abuse are faced with the challenge of parenting offspring who themselves struggle with mental health problems. This study examined the relationships among maternal history of childhood abuse, maternal depression, and parenting style in the context of parenting a psychiatrically ill child, with an emphasis on examining maternal emotional abuse and neglect. We hypothesized that maternal childhood emotional abuse would be associated with maladaptive parenting strategies (lower levels of maternal acceptance and higher levels of psychological control), independent of maternal depression severity and other psychosocial risk factors. Method Ninety-five mother-child dyads (children ages 7?18) were recruited from child mental health centers where children were receiving treatment for at least one internalizing disorder. Participating mothers met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Mothers reported on their own childhood abuse histories and children reported on their mothers? parenting. Results Regression analyses demonstrated that maternal childhood emotional abuse was associated with child reports of lower maternal acceptance and greater psychological control, controlling for maternal depression severity, and other psychosocial risk factors. Conclusions When treating psychiatrically ill children, it is important for a child's clinician to consider mothers? childhood abuse histories in addition to their history of depression. These mothers appear to have additional barriers to effective parenting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mutations in FLNA (Filamin A, OMIM 300017) cause X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia (XL-PNH). XL-PNH-associated mutations are considered lethal in hemizygous males. However, a few males with unusual mutations (including distal truncating and hypomorphic missense mutations), and somatic mosaicism have been reported to survive past infancy. Two brothers had an atypical presentation with failure to thrive and distinct facial appearance including hypertelorism. Evaluations of these brothers and their affected cousin showed systemic involvement including severe intestinal malfunction, malrotation, congenital short bowel, PNH, pyloric stenosis, wandering spleen, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, inguinal hernia, and vesicoureteral reflux. The unanticipated finding of PNH led to FLNA testing and subsequent identification of a novel no-stop FLNA mutation (c.7941_7942delCT, p.(*2648Serext*100)). Western blotting and qRT-PCR of patients' fibroblasts showed diminished levels of protein and mRNA. This FLNA mutation, the most distal reported so far, causes in females classical XL-PNH, but in males an unusual, multi-organ phenotype, providing a unique insight into the FLNA-associated phenotypes. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? Portal hypertension leads to a wide variety of complications, which lead to significant morbidity and mortality and are some of the leading reasons for liver transplantation in children with chronic liver disease. Evidence-based approaches to the management of adults with portal hypertension exist and have been comprehensively reviewed in a series of international meetings, including the Baveno meetings. Similar evidence-based approaches for the management of portal hypertension in children do not exist and as such international meetings on portal hypertension have not focused on this problem in children. On October 7, 2005 at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, a panel of pediatric experts reviewed the most recent Baveno statement and crafted a statement modified with their opinions vis a vis approaches to the management of portal hypertension in children.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3 years (range: 54?75 years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma n = 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) n = 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma n = 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5 years (range: 51?69 years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

AB  - Summary.? Platelets play a pivotal role in the arrest of bleeding at sites of vascular injury. Following endothelial damage, they respond rapidly by adhesion to subendothelial matrix proteins resulting in platelet activation, spreading, aggregation, secretion and recruitment of additional platelets to form the primary haemostatic plug. This mass provides a surface for thrombin generation and fibrin mesh formation that stabilizes the clot. Careful study of patients with inherited platelet disorders and, subsequently, of informative animal models, has identified structural platelet abnormalities that have enhanced our understanding of platelet function. The investigations of rare, but severe, inherited platelet disorders have led us to the discovery of causative molecular defects. One of the most informative is the rare autosomal recessive disorder Glanzmann thrombasthenia, caused by defect or deficiency in the platelet integrin αIIb?3, resulting in absent platelet aggregation and a significant clinical bleeding diathesis. Our new challenge is to understand the mechanisms underlying more common, but less well-defined, mucocutaneous bleeding (MCB) disorders. Present diagnostic testing for platelet function disorders and von Willebrand?s Disease often fails to identify the cause of bleeding in individuals with inherited MCB.

AB  - Of 220 residents living in the residential unit of a multi-level geriatric center, 95 required a total of 131 transfers to other facilities over a one-year period. Fifty-three of these patients were transferred to the associated chronic-care hospital for short-term acute medical investigation or treatment. The average length of stay of 17 days was similar to that of patients of comparable age with comparable medical conditions admitted to an affiliated acute general hospital from the community. In addition to continuity of medical care and the social and psychologic advantages of remaining within the geriatric center, this transfer potential resulted in substantial financial savings. The cost of hospitalization in the general hospital would have been more than twice that of the geriatric unit.

AB  - Background:? Negative trauma-related cognitions have been found to be a significant factor in the maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. Initial studies of such appraisals in trauma-exposed children and adolescents suggest that this is an important line of research in youth, yet empirically validated measures for use with younger populations are lacking. A measure of negative trauma-related cognitions for use with children and adolescents, the Child Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI), is presented. The measure was devised as an age-appropriate version of the adult Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (Foa et al., 1999). Methods:? The CPTCI was developed and validated within a large (n?=?570) sample, comprising community and trauma-exposed samples of children and adolescents aged 6?18?years. Results:? Principal components analysis suggested a two-component structure. These components were labelled ?permanent and disturbing change? and ?fragile person in a scary world?, and were each found to possess good internal consistency, test?retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminative validity. The reliability and validity of these sub-scales was present regardless of whether the measure was completed in the acute phase or several months after a trauma. Scores on these sub-scales did not vary with age. Conclusions:? The CPTCI is a reliable and valid measure that is not specific to the type of trauma exposure, and shows considerable promise as a research and clinical tool. The structure of this measure suggests that appraisals concerning the more abstract consequences of a trauma, as well as physical threat and vulnerability, are pertinent factors in trauma-exposed children and adolescents, even prepubescent children.

AB  - The aim of this replication study was to determine if prior findings at one U.S. dental school about dental students' comfort discussing and perceptions of the relevance of 15 risk behaviors to adolescent patient oral health care would be observed at other institutions. All first- and fourth-year dental students (n=414) at three U.S. dental schools in fall 2017 were invited to participate, and 218 completed the survey (52.7% response rate). These students reported feeling comfortable to uncomfortable discussing risk behaviors with adolescent patients, yet perceived those risk behaviors as relevant to their oral health. There were significant differences in student comfort discussing risk behaviors with adolescents and their perceptions of relevance by gender, age, class status, and school location. Males were more comfortable than females discussing oral health risk behaviors. There were no significant differences by race/ethnicity. Fourth-year students had higher levels of comfort discussing risk behaviors than first-year students. Compared to students in the South and Midwest schools, students at the West school were more comfortable discussing selected topics and had higher perceptions of their relevance to adolescent oral health care. These results suggest there is room for improvement in this area of dental education. Dental schools should aim to strengthen students' knowledge of and comfort in discussing oral health risk behaviors with adolescent patients with the use of educational activities and clinical experiences.

AB  - There is a potential role of ultrasound examination in the management of women with postmenopausal (PMP) bleeding. Because women with an endometrium = 4?mm at transvaginal ultrasound examination rarely have endometrial pathology, it may be justified not to sample their endometrium. However, endometrial pathology is common among women with endometrium = 5?mm. In our prospective study, 105 consecutive women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm underwent hydrosonography, hysteroscopy, D  Kappa 0.77), but neither hysteroscopy nor hydrosnography could reliably discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. In a randomized trial, 49 women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 4?mm were randomized to D & C and 48 to ultrasound follow up. 14 (29%) women in the D & C group and 22 (46%) in the ultrasound group had either rebleeding or manifested endometrial growth during a 12-month follow-up period. Endometrial pathology was not found in women with rebleeding unless the endometrium was?=?5?mm. Conclusion Women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm should undergo hydrosnography. If focal lesions are detected hysteroscopic resection should be carried out. In women with PMP bleeding, rebleeding during the first 12?months is an indication to sample the endometrium only if the endometrium measures = 5?mm at ultrasound examination.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Controversial recommendations regarding the evaluation of dysphonia have been made in the absence of evidence related to clinical practice. This study aims to describe existing patterns of care for dysphonia to generate data for potential systemic improvement and provide a baseline for dysphonia recommendations. Study Design Retrospective review. Methods Information regarding the current complaint, including duration of hoarseness; inciting factors; number and type of previous physicians seen; Voice Handicap Index-10; and details of prior evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment was collected from patient records. Results A total of 259 patients complaining of hoarseness were evaluated. Of those, 35.1% presented directly to subspecialty care, whereas 61% were previously evaluated by another otolaryngologist. Median times (in months) from symptom onset to evaluation were as follows: initial evaluation, 3.0; laryngoscopy, 3.0; stroboscopic exam, 5.8; subspecialty evaluation, 6.6. A total of 64.5% of patients had at least one incoming diagnosis; 45% of all incoming diagnoses were revised on re-evaluation. Diagnoses most commonly revised included ?no abnormality,? edema or laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPR), infection or allergy, and muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) or behavioral disorders. Final diagnoses that most frequently differed from incoming diagnoses were paresis; MTD or behavioral disorders; malignancy; and sulcus, atrophy, or scar. Conclusions Patients received prompt laryngeal visualization. However, we observed high rates of diagnostic error. Initial diagnoses of LPR, edema, infection, and allergy appear to be particularly likely to be revised on further evaluation; and scar, sulcus, atrophy, and paresis are likely to be overlooked.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of ovarian cancer is up to 10 times higher in Western countries than in rural Asia and Africa. One common consequence of a Western lifestyle is the development of excessive body weight and obesity. A multi-centre prospective study was conducted to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and ovarian cancer risk. A case-control study was nested within 3 prospective cohorts in New York (USA), Umeå (Sweden) and Milan (Italy). Information on anthropometry, demographic characteristics, medical history and lifestyle was obtained at the time of subjects' recruitment in each cohort. Women diagnosed with primary, invasive epithelial ovarian cancer from the 3 cohorts (n = 122) diagnosed 12 months or later after recruitment into the respective cohort served as case subjects. For each case subject, 2 control subjects that matched the case subject on cohort, menopausal status, age and date of recruitment were randomly identified. Data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. There was an inverse association between BMI and ovarian cancer risk. For increasing quartiles of BMI above the lowest, the ORs were 0.62 (0.32?1.21), 0.59 (0.30?1.17) and 0.46 (0.23?0.92), p = 0.03. Analyses limited to women diagnosed 3 or more years after recruitment into the cohorts did not alter these findings. When obese women (BMI > 30) were compared to lean women (BMI ≤ 23), the inverse association became stronger, with an OR of 0.38 (0.17?0.85), p < 0.02. There was some evidence of direct association of ovarian cancer with height, which was limited to cancers diagnosed before age 55. Our data suggest that increasing body weight may confer a protection against ovarian cancer. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background The college years represent a period of increased vulnerability for a wide range of mental health (MH) challenges. The onset of common psychiatric conditions occurs during this period of development. Increases in depression, anxiety, and suicidality among U.S. college students have been observed. This study identified prevalence and correlates of MH diagnoses and suicidality in a recent sample of U.S. college students. Methods The Spring 2015 American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) survey assessed MH diagnoses and suicidality from U.S. undergraduate students (n = 67,308) across 108 institutions. Results Stress was strongly associated with a greater likelihood of suicide attempts and MH diagnoses, even among students reporting 1?2 stressful events (OR [odds ratio] range 1.6?2.6, CI [confidence interval] = 1.2?3.2). Bisexual students were more likely to report MH diagnoses and suicidality, compared to heterosexual and gay/lesbian students (OR range 1.5?3.9, CI = 1.8?4.3), with over half engaging in suicidal ideation and self-harm, and over a quarter reporting suicide attempts. Transgender students reported a higher rate of MH diagnoses and suicidality relative to females (OR range 1.9?2.4, CI = 1.1?3.4). Racial/ethnic minority students were generally less likely to report MH diagnoses relative to Whites, although the likelihood for suicidality was mixed. Conclusions The high rate of multiple stress exposures among the U.S. college population and the high impacts of stress on MH and suicidality point to an urgent need for service utilization strategies, especially among racial/ethnic, sexual, or gender minorities. Campuses must consider student experiences to mitigate stress during this developmental period.

Trajectories were modeled using multi-trajectory group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) and determinants of trajectory membership were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Results Two hundred and thirteen patients were included: 58.2% Chinese, 16.4% Malay, 21.6% Indian, mean (SD) age 51.3 (12.6) years and symptom duration 21.8 (15.3) weeks. In the multi-trajectory analysis, three groups of disease trajectories and corresponding disability and HRQoL trajectories were identified: group 1 (moderate disease rapid response, 49.9%), group 2 (high disease rapid response, 31.1%) and group 3 (high disease slow response, 19.1%). Malay patients had higher relative risk ratio (RRR) of being in trajectory groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (RRR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.05-3.98 and RRR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.45-6.43, respectively) while patients with tertiary education had lower relative risk (RRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.89 and RRR = 0.33, (95% CI 0.14-0.83, respectively). In the analysis of individual outcomes, ethnicity, education level and body mass index were determinants of the heterogeneous disease activity trajectories. Gender and education level were determinants of the disability trajectories. Only gender was a determinant of the HRQoL trajectories. Further, 96.2% of the patients were treated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Conclusion Disparities in sociodemographic factors should be taken into consideration in formulating treatment strategies in ERA.

AB  - Educational outcomes for looked-after children on the autism spectrum are significantly poorer than for autistic children not being looked-after by their local authority (those ?in care?), and poorer than for most other groups of children with special educational needs who are looked-after in England. Such poor outcomes have led to calls for specific attention to be paid to the needs of autistic looked-after children within the care of local authorities. There is also evidence that the numbers of autistic children being looked-after by local authorities could be under-represented in official figures. This study sought to find the current numbers of autistic looked-after children formally recorded across local authorities in England, and whether their needs are given special attention via strategic planning and oversight, using freedom of information (FoI) requests sent to all local authorities in England. From the 147 (97%) local authorities who responded, approximately 3% of looked-after children in England are recorded as having an autism spectrum diagnosis, although this is still very likely to be an underestimation. The majority of local authorities do not routinely monitor or report on the diagnostic status of autistic looked-after children at a strategic level. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Summary Rapid advances in the understanding of the molecular biology, data from translational and clinical trials, and retrospective analyses has influenced the diagnosis and treatment of systemic mastocytosis (SM). Many options have existed for the symptomatic management of SM patients, but recent evolution in regards to the molecular underpinnings of this disease and our ability to distinguish clonal mastocytosis from mast cell activation syndrome has changed our treatment paradigm and opened new opportunities for understanding genetic risk, transformation to mast cell leukaemia, and treatment choices. Key to this change has been the discovery of the KIT mutation and the use of next generation sequencing to evaluate for co-existing molecular mutations that may define the disease course. Careful diagnosis, judicious symptom management and close surveillance of those who may have yet undiagnosed disease is paramount in providing optimal management. In this article, we review the diagnosis and provide a paradigm for the management of SM patients.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Digital ulcers (DUs) are a major cause of disease-related morbidity and difficult to treat vascular complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Demonstrating treatment efficacy has traditionally focussed upon clinician assessment of DUs alone. No existing patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument captures the multi-faceted impact of SSc-DU. We report the findings of a multi-centre qualitative research study exploring the patient experience of SSc-DU. Methods Patient focus groups (FGs) were conducted across 3 scleroderma units, following a topic guide devised by SSc patients, experts and experienced qualitative researchers. A purposive sampling framework ensured the experiences of a diverse group of patients were captured. FGs were audio recorded, transcribed, anonymised, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. We continued FGs until thematic saturation was achieved. Results Twenty-nine SSc patients with a history of DU disease participated in 4 FGs across the UK (Bath, Manchester and London). Five major inter-related themes (and sub-themes) were identified which encompass the patient experience of SSc-DUs: ?Disabling pain and hypersensitivity?, ?Deep and broad-ranging emotional impact?, ?Impairment of physical and social activity?, ?Factors aggravating occurrence, duration and impact? and ?Mitigating, managing and adapting?. Conclusion The patient experience of SSc-DU is multi-faceted and comprises a complex interplay of experiences associated with significant pain and morbidity. Patient experiences of SSc-DU are not captured using existing SSc-DU outcomes. Our findings shall inform the development of a novel PRO instrument to assess the severity and impact of SSc-DUs for use in future SSc-DU clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract This paper uses macroscopic and radiological examinations to provide differential diagnoses of pathological lesions in the skeleton of a young woman, 20?25 years of age, which triggered the Danish palaeopathologist Vilhelm M?ller-Christensen's interest in leprosy. The skeleton was incomplete, but the majority of bones of the upper body, as well as the skull, were present. The pathological changes consisted of medullary and cortical lytic foci, periosteal reaction and enhanced cortical density. The lesions were most extensive on the left side, especially around the elbow, wrist and scapula. Treponematosis, leprosy, smallpox, ergotism, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis are all reviewed with regard to bone and joint pathology and their likelihood of being the correct diagnosis. We concluded that the most plausible diagnosis is treponematosis, but neither sarcoidosis nor smallpox can be completely excluded. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
