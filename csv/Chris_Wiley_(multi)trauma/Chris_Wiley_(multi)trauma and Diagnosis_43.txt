AB  - Abstract This paper uses macroscopic and radiological examinations to provide differential diagnoses of pathological lesions in the skeleton of a young woman, 20?25 years of age, which triggered the Danish palaeopathologist Vilhelm M?ller-Christensen's interest in leprosy. The skeleton was incomplete, but the majority of bones of the upper body, as well as the skull, were present. The pathological changes consisted of medullary and cortical lytic foci, periosteal reaction and enhanced cortical density. The lesions were most extensive on the left side, especially around the elbow, wrist and scapula. Treponematosis, leprosy, smallpox, ergotism, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis are all reviewed with regard to bone and joint pathology and their likelihood of being the correct diagnosis. We concluded that the most plausible diagnosis is treponematosis, but neither sarcoidosis nor smallpox can be completely excluded. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the occurrence and the type of after office-hours traumatic dental injuries managed by the Dental Unit of the Accident and Emergency Department at the Singapore General Hospital. During a 2-year period (from August 1990 to July 1992), 461 trauma patients (314 males, 147 females) sustained injuries to 968 teeth. The distribution in different races of Chinese: Malay: Indian: others was 7.3: 1.3: 0.9: 0.5. The predominant age groups were 2?3 years, 3?4 years and 17?18 years; 71.3% of the teeth sustained luxation type injuries, the remaining 28.7% had fractures, 45.3% of the cohort had concomitant soft tissues injuries, while 13.7% had associated facial bone fractures. Teenager traumas were more common during school vacations. It is concluded that thorough standardized documentation is imperative to obtain baseline information on dental trauma. This could facilitate future preventive measures, education and research.

AB  - The participation and support of the family in the rehabilitation process is essential. The family of the brain-injured person, placed in a stressful situation, needs nursing care and intervention. This need is identified in the literature and supported by experience. The dimensions of a family care plan are included in a step-by-step approach, with emphasis on the assessment phase. Specific areas addressed in the assessment are the overall family system, phases of recovery, and the response to crisis. A care plan is provided as a guide. The care plan must be expanded and individualized to meet the needs of the family unit or family member to be most effective.

To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Surgical treatment of traumatic abdominal hernias is usually delayed for 2?3 months following injury. The residual defects are then repaired by herniorrhaphy or mesh herniorrhaphy. Objective To describe the outcome following herniorrhaphy (without a mesh) within 21 days of initial injury to repair external traumatic lateral abdominal hernias in horses and mules. Study design Descriptive case series. Methods Twenty-two cases were included. Surgical treatment involved exposure of the hernia sac and closing of the abdominal wall defect with interrupted Mayo mattress or cruciate sutures after reduction of the herniated organ into the peritoneal cavity. Data collected included cause and site of the hernia, surgical findings, immediate and long-term post operative complications, return to use, duration of convalescence and hernia recurrence. Results Falling while crossing impassable pathways was the most common initial cause of the hernia (9/11 horses and 10/11 mules). Adhesion formation to underlying viscera was found intraoperatively in 2 cases. Uncomplicated healing occurred in all animals except 3 with suture abscesses and one with a subcutaneous seroma. At the time of follow-up (6?24 months after surgery), complete recovery without recurrence of herniation was achieved and animals had returned to their previous use. Conclusion Herniorrhaphy within 21 days using interrupted Mayo mattress or cruciate pattern sutures can be effective for treating external traumatic abdominal hernias in horses and mules. The Summary is available in Chinese ? see Supporting Information.

AB  - Objective To describe contemporary outcomes of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAVP) performed in 22 US centers. Background: BAVP constitutes first-line therapy for congenital aortic stenosis (cAS) in many centers. Methods We used prospectively-collected data from two active, multi-institutional, pediatric cardiac catheterization registries. Acute procedural success was defined, for purposes of this review, as a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg and no more than mild aortic regurgitation (AR) for patients with isolated cAS. For patients with mixed aortic valve disease, a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg without worsening of AR was considered successful outcome. Results In 373 patients with a median age of 8 months (1 day to 40 years of age) peak systolic gradient had a median of 59 [50, 71] mm Hg pre-BAVP and 22 [15, 30] mm Hg post-BAVP (P?<?0.001). Procedural success was achieved in 160 patients (71%). The factors independently associated with procedural success were: first time intervention (OR?=?2.0 (1.0, 4.0) P?=?0.04), not-prostaglandin dependent, (OR=3.5 (1.5, 8.1); P?=?0.003), and isolated cAS (absence of AR) (OR?=?2.1 (1.1?3.9); P?=?0.03). Twenty percent of patients experienced adverse events, half of which were of high severity. There was no procedural mortality. Neonatal status was the only factor associated with increased risk of high severity adverse events (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.5?9.0). Conclusion In the current era, BAVP results in procedural success (gradient reduction with minimal increase in AR) in 71% of patients treated at US centers where BAVP is considered first-line therapy relative to surgery. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract This article discusses critically the focus on stress symptoms when treating traumatized refugees. It describes common challenges that practitioners meet, when working with extreme trauma. It suggests three concepts that might help to understand the complicated dynamics of severe traumatization. These concepts deal as well with the nature of post-traumatic problems as with the way they might be treated. A clinical case is used to exemplify and discuss the concepts. Finally the article offers some thoughts on the special dynamics of the situation of refugees.

AB  - Abstract Aim. To recognize epileptic spasms (ES) as a seizure type after traumatic brain injury (TBI), accidental or non-accidental, in infants and children. In the process, we aim to gain some insight into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in ES. Methods. A retrospective electronic chart review was performed at the Children's Hospital of Michigan from 2002 to 2012. Electronic charts of 321 patients were reviewed for evidence of post-traumatic epilepsy. Various clinical variables were collected including age at TBI, mechanism of trauma, severity of brain injury, electroencephalography/neuroimaging data, and seizure semiology. Results. Six (12.8%) of the 47 patients diagnosed with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) had ES. Epileptic spasms occurred between two months to two years after TBI. All patients with ES had multiple irritative zones, manifesting as multifocal epileptiform discharges, unilateral or bilateral. Cognitive delay and epileptic encephalopathy were seen in all six patients, five of whom were free of spasms after treatment with vigabatrin or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Conclusion. The risk of PTE is 47/321(14.6%) and the specific risk of ES after TBI is 6/321 (1.8%). The risk of ES appears to be high if the age at which severe TBI occurred was during infancy. Non-accidental head trauma is a risk factor of epileptic spasms. While posttraumatic epilepsy (not ES) may start 10 years after the head injury, ES starts within two years, according to our small cohort. The pathophysiology of ES is unknown, however, our data support a combination of previously proposed models in which the primary dysfunction is a focal or diffuse cortical abnormality, coupled with its abnormal interaction with the subcortical structures and brainstem at a critical maturation stage.

AB  - Summary Furcation defects present the greatest challenges to the success of periodontal therapy, as a reduced efficacy of periodontal therapy and higher risk of tooth loss have been consistently observed in multi-rooted teeth with furcation involvement, regardless of the treatment modality employed. An accurate and precise pre-surgical diagnosis is essential in order to approach correctly patients affected by periodontal disease complicated by the invasion of molar furcation areas. Root amputation can usually be indicated in the maxillary molars for removing the distal root, thus avoiding the need to restore the tooth with a crown in a conservative treatment plan. Treatment options for molars with furcation involvement could be divided into three different modalities: conservative procedures, regenerative procedures, and resective procedures. Resective techniques have been developed especially for deep class II and class III furcation-involved molars to overcome the anatomical limitations by physically removing both the dental and osseous structures that make up the defect.

Objectives To assess latency times of muscular motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the m. extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the m. tibialis cranialis (TC), elicited by transcranially applied multipulse stimulation in 12 healthy horses. Study design Prospective observational study applied in 12 healthy horses. Methods Horses with a mean age of 11.0 (range 3.6?20.5) years and a height of 160 (s.d.?±?10.0) cm were studied. Horses were sedated with detomidin (1.5??g/kg bwt) and butorphanol (1.5??g/kg bwt) i.v. A subcutaneous ring block with lidocaine 2%?+?adrenaline was placed on the forehead. TES was performed using biphasic high frequency multipulse voltage trains (pulse width: 0.1?ms, interpulse interval: 1.3?ms, 3 pulses/train) applied to 2 subcutaneous needle electrodes bilateral from the centre of the forehead. Latency times (30?V above motor threshold (MT) and amplitude of MEP were recorded bilaterally at the ECR and the TC muscles. Motor latency times are expressed as mean?±?2?s.d. Results Mean latency times (at MT?+?30?V) for the ECR muscles were respectively 20.18?±?1.85?ms (left side) and 19.7?±?1.69?ms (right side) and for the TC muscles respectively: 34.6?±?2.01?ms (left) and 34.9?±?2.43?ms (right). Conclusions TES is well tolerated. Interestingly, recorded motor latency times at the level of front and hind legs appear to be shorter for TES when compared to TMS from literature data [1]. Ethical animal research:?Ethical approval was granted by the animal ethics committee of the Groningen University. Sources of funding:?JS Center and Wolvega Equine Clinic. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract Objective We addressed the relatively unexplored use of screening scores measuring symptoms of depression and/or anxiety to aid in identifying patients at increased risk for post-discharge DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses. We were unable to find such studies in the literature. Method Elderly veterans without recent psychiatric diagnoses were screened for depression and anxiety symptoms upon admission to acute medical/surgical units using the Mental Health Inventory (MHI). Following discharge, those who had exceeded cut-off scores and had been randomized to UPBEAT Care (Unified Psychogeriatric Biopsychosocial Evaluation and Treatment, a clinical demonstration project) were evaluated for DSM diagnoses. We report on 839 patients, mostly male (96.3%; mean age 69.6?±?6.7 years), comparing three groups, i.e. those meeting screening criteria for symptoms of (i) depression only; (ii) anxiety only; and (iii) both depression and anxiety. Results Despite absence of recent psychiatric history, 58.6% of the 839 patients received a DSM diagnosis post-discharge (21.8% adjustment; 15.4% anxiety; 7.5% mood; and 14.0% other disorders). Patients meeting screening criteria for both depression and anxiety symptoms received a DSM diagnosis more frequently than those meeting criteria for anxiety symptoms only (61.9% vs 49.0%, p?=?0.017), but did not differ significantly from those meeting criteria for depressive symptoms only (61.9% vs 56.8%, p?=?0.174). Although exceeding the MHI screening cut-off scores for depression, anxiety, or both helped to identify patients with a post-discharge DSM diagnosis, the actual MHI screening scores failed to do so. Conclusion Screening hospitalized medical/surgical patients for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and particularly for the combination thereof, may help identify those with increased risk of subsequent DSM diagnoses, including adjustment disorder.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objectives of the present study were to describe the injury profiles of cyclists presenting to an ED and determine the risk of significant head injury associated with bicycle helmet use. Methods This was a retrospective single trauma centre study of all adult cyclists presenting to an inner city ED and undergoing a trauma team review between January 2012 and June 2014. The outcome of interest was significant head injury defined as any head injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale score of two or more. Variables analysed included demographic characteristics, helmet use at time of incident, location, time and the presence of intoxication. Results The most common body regions were upper limb injuries (57%), followed by head injuries (43%), facial injuries (30%) and lower limb injuries (24%). A lower proportion of people wearing helmets had significant head injury (17% vs 31%, P = 0.018) or facial injury (26% vs 48%, P = 0.0017) compared with non-helmet users. After adjustment for important covariates, helmet use was associated with a 70% decrease in the odds of significant head injury (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.15, 0.76, P = 0.008). Conclusions Head injuries were common after inner city cycling incidents. The use of helmets was associated with a reduction in significant head injury.

AB  - Summary The shoulder has greatest range of motion of any joint in the body, and is a frequent site of injury. Shoulder girdle includes proximal humerus, scapula, and lateral clavicle. The anatomic structures involved in fracture of the proximal humerus include humeral head, anatomic neck, surgical neck, and greater and lesser tuberosities. The fractures to the proximal humerus result from a direct blow, fall on an outstretched hand in the elderly, or are related to glenohumeral joint fracture-dislocation. Fractures of the humeral shaft may result from direct trauma, high-velocity motor vehicle accidents or a fall. Scapular fractures are infrequent as the scapula is surrounded and protected by large and prominent muscle attachments. Acromioclavicular joint injury is commonly due to a fall onto the point of the shoulder. Radiographs are generally the first step in initial imaging modality for patients with shoulder trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background Little is known about childhood ALL in the Middle East. This study was undertaken by MECCA as initial efforts in collaborative data collection to provide clinical and demographic information on children with ALL in the Middle East. Procedure Clinical and laboratory data for patients with ALL between January 2008 and April 2012 were prospectively collected from institutions in 14 Middle East countries and entered into a custom-built-database during induction phase. All laboratory studies including cytogenetics were done at local institutions. Results The 1,171 voluntarily enrolled patients had a mean age of 6.1?±?3.9 years and 59.2% were boys. T-ALL represented 14.8% and 84.2% had B-precursor ALL. At diagnosis, 5.6% had CNS disease. The distribution of common genetic abnormalities reflected a similar percentage of hyperdiploidy (25.6%), but a lower percentage of ETV6?RUNX1 translocation (14.7%) compared to large series reported from Western populations. By clinical criteria, 47.1% were low/standard risk, 16.9% were intermediate risk, and 36% were high risk. Most patients received all their care at the same unit (96.9%). Patients had excellent induction response to chemotherapy with an overall complete remission rate of 96%. Induction toxicities were acceptable. Conclusions This first collaborative study has established a process for prospective data collection and future multinational collaborative research in the Middle East. Despite the limitations of an incomplete population-based study, it provides the first comprehensive baseline data on clinical characteristics, laboratory evaluation, induction outcome, and toxicity. Further work is planned to uncover possible biologic differences of ALL in the region and to improve diagnosis and management. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014; 61:1403?1410. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder most often diagnosed 10?years after its onset and development. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-? peptide (ABP) into amyloid plaques between nerve cells, which produces a massive local neurodegeneration. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging allows diagnosis of AD by showing ABP accumulation in the brain. The ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) derivatives proposed in the present work were functionalized with peptides that present an affinity for ABP, independently of its state of aggregation. Their nanomolar Kd* confirms the high affinity of our vectorized contrast agents (VCA) for ABP and therefore their high labeling potential, specificity and sensitivity. Their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated, both by in vitro studies using the MTT method on several cell types, and by in vivo investigations with assessment of renal and hepatic biomarkers and by histopathology evaluation. The results of biodistribution studies corroborated by MRI demonstrate that USPIO-PHO (USPIO coupled to peptide C-IPLPFYN-C) are able to cross the blood?brain barrier without any facilitating strategy, and accumulates in the brain 90?min after its injection in NMRI mice. None of the USPIO derivatives were found in any organs one week after administration. To conclude, USPIO-PHO seems to have a genuine potential for labeling amyloid plaques in the brain; it has a nanomolar binding affinity, no toxic effects, and its elimination half-life is about 3?h. Further tests will be made on transgenic mice, aimed at confirming the potential of early AD diagnosis using our VCA. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the relationship between acute cortisol responses to trauma and subsequent PTSD symptoms (PTSS) in children and their biological mothers. Urinary cortisol levels were assessed in 54 children aged 8?18 upon admission to a level-1 trauma center. Six weeks posttrauma, 15-hour urine samples were collected from children and their mothers. Depression and PTSS were assessed at 6 weeks (N = 44) and 7 months (N = 38) posttrauma. Higher child in-hospital cortisol significantly predicted 6-week child PTSS. This was true only for boys at 7 months. In mothers, lower 6-week cortisol levels significantly predicted 7-month PTSS. Results extend findings of differing directions of acute hormonal predictors of PTSS in adults versus children to a sample of genetically related individuals.

AB  - Abstract Survival from cancer has improved over the past decade resulting in more long-term survivors. The literature on multi-dimensional quality of life (QOL) among long-term (5+ years) adult survivors is reviewed for each of seven cancer sites (i.e. breast, ovarian, cervical, prostate, colorectal, head and neck, and Hodgkin's disease survivors). Overall, long-term survivors experience good to excellent QOL. Physical domain QOL was the most frequently measured while spiritual domain QOL was the least frequently measured. QOL varies according to treatment received and by age for all groups with older persons (excepting head and neck and Hodgkin's disease survivors) reporting better QOL. QOL improves with time for breast cancer survivors and tends to decrease over time for prostate cancer survivors. Issues regarding sexual functioning affected the social domain?especially for breast and prostate cancer survivors. Social support improves psychological domain QOL for breast, cervical, and colorectal survivors. Review of findings may assist researchers and clinicians wishing to enhance the QOL of the long-term survivor population by identifying the most pressing and widely experienced concerns and by providing directions for future research.

AB  - Abstract The authors conducted a systematic BRS and English-language literature review of the last 10 years of research on the assessment, prevalence, and antidepressant treatment of major depression in the medically ill to determine the current state of knowledge and to make recommendations for future studies. Ninety-three prevalence studies (13,518 patients and 33 conditions or medical settings) met basic methodological inclusion criteria. The great majority (68.8%) of these studies did not describe their methodological approach to the diagnostic assessment of symptoms such as fatigue, which could be due to either a depression or a comorbidphysical disorder. This problem of overlapping symptomatology has been termed the ?problem of etiological assessment.? The 29 (31.2%) studies which did describe an approach to this problem used one or more of four different approaches: an ?inclusive? approach, an ?exclusive? approach, an ?etiological? approach, or a ?substitutive? approach. Prevalence rates of major depression varied greatly (0-78%). Regarding treatment, of eight controlled studies of antidepressant therapies for major depression, six reported statistically significant differences between medications and placebo. The authors conclude that many recent studies concerning the assessment, prevalence, and treatment of major depression in the medically ill have been inadequate to generate reliable and valid information. Guidelines for future research, especially focusing on the collection of validation data, are proposed. Depression 1:181-204 (1993). ? 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To generate a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields using images acquired from 7 T, multi-echo, gradient-echo MRI for the evaluation of epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders as well as investigating (apparent transverse relaxation rate) and quantitative volume magnetic susceptibility (QS) of the subfields. Experimental Design: Healthy control subjects (n?=?17) were scanned at 7 T using a multi-echo gradient-echo sequence and susceptibility-weighted magnitude images, and QS maps were reconstructed. We defined a hippocampal subfield labeling protocol for the magnitude image produced from the average of all echoes and assessed reproducibility through volume and shape metrics. A group-wise diffeomorphic registration procedure was used to generate an average atlas of the subfields for the whole subject cohort. The quantitative MRI maps and subfield labels were then warped to the average atlas space and used to measure mean values of and QS characterizing each subfield. Principal Observations: We were able to reliably label hippocampal subfields on the multi-echo susceptibility images. The group-averaged atlas accurately aligns these structures to produce a high-resolution depiction of the subfields, allowing assessment of both quantitative susceptibility and across subjects. Our analysis of variance demonstrates that there are more apparent differences between the subfields on these quantitative maps than the normalized magnitude images. Conclusion: We constructed a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields for use in voxel-based studies and demonstrated in vivo quantification of susceptibility and in the subfields. This work is the first in vivo quantification of susceptibility values within the hippocampal subfields at 7 T. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3588?3601, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
