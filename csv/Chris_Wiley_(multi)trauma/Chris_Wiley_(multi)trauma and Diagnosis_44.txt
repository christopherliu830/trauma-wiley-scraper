AB  - Cases Two patients with cerebral infarction following head and neck injury who showed a lucid interval are presented. Outcome A 70-year-old male showed infarctions in the cerebellum bilaterally and the right hypothalamus on the sixth day after an injury with no fracture of the cervical spine, and bilateral dissection of the vertebral arteries was diagnosed. A 74-year-old male showed infarctions in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery 2 days after injury with fractures of the cervical spine (C2 and C3) and was diagnosed as having artery-to-artery embolism based on dissection of the right vertebral artery. Conclusion Head and neck injury is a very common presentation in the emergency department. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography is an effective screening imaging method for vertebral artery dissection that should be carried out on arrival in every patient with fracture of the cervical spine, and even considered in doubtful cases with no fracture.

AB  - Aim: To assess the causes and the prevalence of traumatic injuries to the permanent incisors of 12-year-old schoolchildren in Jaragua do Sul, Brazil. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Public and private primary schools. Participants: 476 children of both sexes, selected by multistage sampling technique. Methods: Clinical examination of upper and lower permanent incisors. Main outcome measures: Incisal overjet, lip coverage, traumatised anterior teeth, cause of trauma. Parents' levels of education and employment status and family income. Results: Boys experienced double the percentage of injuries compared to girls. Children with incisal overjet greater than 5mm (P = 0.077) and inadequate lip coverage (P = 0.667) were not more likely to have experienced dental injuries. The main causes of injuries to the permanent incisors were falls (26 per cent), traffic accidents (20.5 per cent), sports (19.2 per cent), violence (16.4 per cent) and collisions with people or inanimate objects (6.8 per cent). Socio-economic measures had no significant effect on prevalence of trauma. Conclusions: Policy makers must take the causes of trauma into account when developing a strategy for the prevention of dental injuries. The role of violence in causing traumatic dental injuries has been underestimated.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the relationship between acute cortisol responses to trauma and subsequent PTSD symptoms (PTSS) in children and their biological mothers. Urinary cortisol levels were assessed in 54 children aged 8?18 upon admission to a level-1 trauma center. Six weeks posttrauma, 15-hour urine samples were collected from children and their mothers. Depression and PTSS were assessed at 6 weeks (N = 44) and 7 months (N = 38) posttrauma. Higher child in-hospital cortisol significantly predicted 6-week child PTSS. This was true only for boys at 7 months. In mothers, lower 6-week cortisol levels significantly predicted 7-month PTSS. Results extend findings of differing directions of acute hormonal predictors of PTSS in adults versus children to a sample of genetically related individuals.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) presents in young, otherwise-healthy individuals. This study examined recurrence and survival characteristics after surgical resection for FLC by utilizing an international multi-institutional database. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for FLC from six institutions (1993?2010) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was studied with life tables and Cox regression models. Results Thirty-five patients (13 female, 37%) were included (median age: 32 years). R0 resection was achieved in all curative-intent operations (n?=?30), and palliative operations were performed for five patients. Crude 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 22% and 3%, respectively. For curative-intent surgery, overall and recurrence-free survivals at 5 years were 62% and 45%, respectively. In patients who achieved a 4-year disease-free interval after surgery, none subsequently developed recurrence. In multivariate models, presence of extrahepatic disease was the only factor that independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38?22.55, P?=?0.016) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.64, 95% CI: 1.48?21.49, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Patients with surgically amenable FLC had encouraging long-term survival. Recurrence-free survival to 4 years suggested possible freedom from disease thereafter. Recurrent resectable disease was associated with an excellent prognosis, and repeat surgery should be strongly considered. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014; 110:412?415. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Common peroneal nerve (CPN) injury occurs in 10?40% of patients following knee dislocation. Is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using routine knee protocols able to adequately evaluate CPN injury and predict long-term outcome? Methods Trauma patients presenting for knee MRI at a single public hospital, between July 2007 and May 2017, were retrospectively identified using radiology and orthopaedic databases. Medical records were retrieved for clinical scores. MRI images were scored by two independent radiologists blinded to the clinical CPN status and scores correlated with initial clinical scores using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Final cohort included 107 patients (81 males and 26 females) with a mean age of 39 (range 19?81 years). MRI was considered to be adequate for coverage of the CPN in 84 patients. Fourteen patients had CPN injury clinically (seven complete and seven partial). Concordance between MRI scores and initial clinical scores was 0.456 (P = 0.01). MRI sensitivity and specificity for CPN injury on the 84 adequate scans were 54.5% and 93.2% respectively. All seven cases of partial CPN injury and three of seven cases of complete CPN injury recovered fully. High MRI scores of 5 and 8 were given for the two patients with a persisting complete CPN palsy. Highest scores for partial CPN injury subjects were 2 and 4. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging using a routine knee protocol is not adequate for the assessment of CPN injury in many subjects. More specific MRI neural sequences with complete CPN coverage may be worth trialing.

AB  - Abstract Objective This is an overview of the cellular biology of upper nasal mucosal cells that have special characteristics that enable them to be used to diagnose and study congenital neurological diseases and to aid neural repair. Study Design After mapping the distribution of neural cells in the upper nose, the authors' investigations moved to the use of olfactory neurones to diagnose neurological diseases of development, especially schizophrenia. Olfactory-ensheathing glial cells (OEGs) from the cranial cavity promote axonal penetration of the central nervous system and aid spinal cord repair in rodents. The authors sought to isolate these cells from the more accessible upper nasal cavity in rats and in humans and prove they could likewise promote neural regeneration, making these cells suitable for human spinal repair investigations. Methods The schizophrenia-diagnosis aspect of the study entailed the biopsy of the olfactory areas of 10 schizophrenic patients and 10 control subjects. The tissue samples were sliced and grown in culture medium. The ease of cell attachment to fibronectin (artificial epithelial basement membrane), as well as the mitotic and apoptotic indices, was studied in the presence and absence of dopamine in those cell cultures. The neural repair part of the study entailed a harvesting and insertion of first rat olfactory lamina propria rich in OEGs between cut ends of the spinal cords and then later the microinjection of an OEG-rich suspension into rat spinal cords previously transected by open laminectomy. Further studies were done in which OEG insertion was performed up to 1 month after rat cord transection and also in monkeys. Results Schizophrenic patients' olfactory tissues do not easily attach to basement membrane compared with control subjects, adding evidence to the theory that cell wall anomalies are part of the schizophrenic ?lesion? of neurones. Schizophrenic patient cell cultures had higher mitotic and apoptotic indices compared with control subjects. The addition of dopamine altered these indices enough to allow accurate differentiation of schizophrenics from control patients, leading to, possibly for the first time, an early objective diagnosis of schizophrenia and possible assessment of preventive strategies. OEGs from the nose were shown to be as effective as those from the olfactory bulb in promoting axonal growth across transected spinal cords even when added 1 month after injury in the rat. These otherwise paraplegic rats grew motor and proprioceptive and fine touch fibers with corresponding behavioral improvement. Conclusions The tissues of the olfactory mucosa are readily available to the otolaryngologist. Being surface cells, they must regenerate (called ?neurogenesis?). Biopsy of this area and amplification of cells in culture gives the scientist a ?window to the developing brain,? including early diagnosis of schizophrenia. The ?Holy Grail? of neurological disease is the cure of traumatic paraplegia and OEGs from the nose promote that repair. The otolaryngologist may become the necessary partner of the neurophysiologist and spinal surgeon to take the laboratory potential of paraplegic cure into the day-to-day realm of clinical reality.

AB  - Mr. J was referred to a speech and language therapist (SLT) by a consultant psychiatrist. He had sustained an industrial accident which he claimed was responsible for a range of problems which included a speech and language problem. Some three years after his accident, he brought an action for damages arising out of the accident. His solicitor, on the recommendation of, the consultant psychiatrist, contacted the SLT requesting his views as to whether Mr. J's speech difficulties were due to the injuries sustained and requesting recommendations for further treatment. The SLT saw Mr. J and concluded that he had problems at all communication levels, the greatest being an articulatory impairment. Some reports' suggested a psychological basis for his problems and others, including the psychiatrists', suggested an organic basis.

AB  - Records were reviewed of 477 patients who had diaphragm pacemakers implanted for treatment of chronic hypoventilation. Three groups were established for comparison. (1) Center group: 165 patients operated on in six medical centers participating in a cooperative study; (2) Noncenter group, sufficient data available: 203 patients operated on by surgeons with experience limited to a few cases; (3) Nonstudy group, minimal data available: 109 patients operated on as in group 2; vital statistics only were contributed. The protocol for data gathering was comprised of 154 major variables. Basic data on age, sex, diagnosis and etiology were analyzed for homogenicity of data among the groups. A comprehensive analysis of the pacing methods, complication and results fom the Center group yielded information on the early experience with diaphragm pacing important to its future application.

AB  - Summary Many patients come to the emergency department with complaints of visual change or loss, ocular trauma, eye pain or other conditions that necessitate an accurate assessment of the eye and/or orbit. Ultrasound has been used by ophthalmologists for several decades. As multi-purpose, high-frequency probes are now available for many of the portable ultrasound machines found in emergency departments, emergency physicians take advantage of these diagnostic capabilities and perform bedside ultrasound ocular examinations as their scope of practice. Vitreous haemorrhage can occur secondary to diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, trauma, retinal vein occlusion or retinal tears. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) can occur as a result of normal aging, trauma, vitreous haemorrhage or inflammation. In chronic PVD, the vitreous may become more stiff and dense and may resemble retinal detachment. Differentiation may be difficult and may depend on ophthalmology consultation.

AB  - Background Few efficacious early treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents exist. Previous trials have intervened within the first month post-trauma and focused on secondary prevention of later post-traumatic stress; however, considerable natural recovery may still occur up to 6-months post-trauma. No trials have addressed the early treatment of established PTSD (i.e. 2- to 6-months post-trauma). Methods Twenty-nine youth (8?17 years) with PTSD (according to age-appropriate DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnostic criteria) after a single-event trauma in the previous 2?6 months were randomly allocated to Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD; n = 14) or waiting list (WL; n = 15) for 10 weeks. Results Significantly more participants were free of PTSD after CT-PTSD (71%) than WL (27%) at posttreatment (intent-to-treat, 95% CI for difference .04?.71). CT-PTSD yielded greater improvement on child-report questionnaire measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety; clinician-rated functioning; and parent-reported outcomes. Recovery after CT-PTSD was maintained at 6- and 12-month posttreatment. Beneficial effects of CT-PTSD were mediated through changes in appraisals and safety-seeking behaviours, as predicted by cognitive models of PTSD. CT-PTSD was considered acceptable on the basis of low dropout and high treatment credibility and therapist alliance ratings. Conclusions This trial provides preliminary support for the efficacy and acceptability of CT-PTSD as an early treatment for PTSD in youth. Moreover, the trial did not support the extension of ?watchful waiting? into the 2- to 6-month post-trauma window, as significant improvements in the WL arm (particularly in terms of functioning and depression) were not observed. Replication in larger samples is needed, but attention to recruitment issues will be required.

AB  - Abstract Isolated swellings within the head and neck region are common phenomena, with the majority being readily diagnosed and appropriately managed. While history alone will often assist in arriving at a correct diagnosis, discrepancies and inconsistencies in the clinical picture should act as a prompt for the clinician to consider the prospect of having encountered less common pathology. We report a case of an unusual supra-orbital swelling where the history, clinical findings and initial investigations masked a rare diagnosis. The differential diagnoses for this case principally included haematoma, infection and cutaneous cyst. However, following a period of review with no improvement in either symptoms or objective clinical measures, incisional biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma. Management thereafter involved referral for lymphoma specialist assessment, with subsequent investigation to establish the level of locoregional and/or systemic involvement and the initiation of appropriate radiotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Although psychological resilience has been shown to ?buffer? against depression following major stressors, no studies have reported on this relationship within the prostate cancer (PCa) population, many of whom are at elevated risk of depression, health problems and suicide. To investigate the effects of resilience upon anxiety and depression in the PCa population, postal surveys of 425 PCa patients were collected from two sites: 189 PCa patients at site 1 and 236 at site 2. Background data plus responses to depression and resilience scales were collected. Results indicated that total resilience score was a significant buffer against depression across both sites. Resilience had different underlying component factor structures across sites, but only one (common) factor significantly (inversely) predicted depression. Within that factor, only some specific items significantly predicted depression scores, suggesting a focused relationship between resilience and depression. It may be concluded that measures of resilience may be used to screen depression at-risk PCa patients. These patients might benefit from resilience training to enhance their ability to cope effectively with the stress of their diagnosis and treatment. A focus upon specific aspects of overall resilience may be of further benefit in both these processes.
