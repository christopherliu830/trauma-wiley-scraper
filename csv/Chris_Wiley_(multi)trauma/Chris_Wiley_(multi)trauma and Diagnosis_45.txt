AB  - Abstract This study examined how the characteristics of people with mental illness who are participants in post-booking jail diversion programs affect recidivism and time spent incarcerated. The study employed data from a multi-site, federally funded jail diversion initiative. A pre?post comparison design was used to compare experiences of arrest and days spent in jail of diverted individuals for the 12 months following enrollment with the 12 months prior to enrollment. Also compared were differences in 12-month public safety outcomes. Data were collected between February 2003 and August 2007. The findings suggest that people with mental illness who are diverted from jail to community-based services experience fewer arrests and jail days. Approximately half of the sample were never arrested during the 12 months following enrollment. The strongest differences between people who experienced reduced contact with the criminal justice system and people with unchanged or increased contact were found in measures of criminal history. The results suggest that services targeted to diverted individuals with mental illness should address public safety goals, not just those of public health. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Although psychological resilience has been shown to ?buffer? against depression following major stressors, no studies have reported on this relationship within the prostate cancer (PCa) population, many of whom are at elevated risk of depression, health problems and suicide. To investigate the effects of resilience upon anxiety and depression in the PCa population, postal surveys of 425 PCa patients were collected from two sites: 189 PCa patients at site 1 and 236 at site 2. Background data plus responses to depression and resilience scales were collected. Results indicated that total resilience score was a significant buffer against depression across both sites. Resilience had different underlying component factor structures across sites, but only one (common) factor significantly (inversely) predicted depression. Within that factor, only some specific items significantly predicted depression scores, suggesting a focused relationship between resilience and depression. It may be concluded that measures of resilience may be used to screen depression at-risk PCa patients. These patients might benefit from resilience training to enhance their ability to cope effectively with the stress of their diagnosis and treatment. A focus upon specific aspects of overall resilience may be of further benefit in both these processes.

AB  - Abstract ? A cross-sectional survey was carried out on 3702 boys and girls aged 9?14 years, attending public and private primary schools in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A multi-stage sampling technique using an equal probability scheme was adopted to select the children. The response rate for the total sample was 97%. Dental examinations were carried out by one dentist (MISC). Intra-examiner agreement was very good. The prevalence of dental injuries increased from 8% at the age of 9 years to 13.6% at 12 and 16.1% at 14 years. Adjusted results showed that children from high socio-economic backgrounds were 1.4 (95% CI=1.15?1.79) times more likely to present with a dental injury than children with low SES. Boys were 1.7 times (95% CI=1.41?2.16) more likely to have dental injuries than girls. Children with an overjet size greater than 5.0 mm were 1.37 times (95% CI=1.06?1.80) more likely to have a dental injury than children with an overjet size equal or lower than 5.0 mm. Finally, children with an adequate lip coverage were 0.56 times (95% CI=0.44?0.72) less likely to have a traumatic dental injury than those with inadequate lip coverage.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Objective. Little is known about socio-demographic, diagnostic, and clinical characteristics of patients referred for assessment to psychodynamic psychotherapy services. The aim of this study was to remedy this by prospectively collecting comprehensive and systematic demographic and clinical information on a large number of patients referred to NHS psychodynamic psychotherapy services. Design. Fourteen psychotherapy services operating within a National Health Service joined the study and contributed data for 1,136 patients referred from primary and secondary care clinics. Method. Patients were assessed using questionnaires and self-rated measures, which included the clinician-based version of the diagnostic form of the Millon clinical multi-axial inventory-III-revised edition (MCMI-III-R), the brief symptom inventory (BSI), the inventory of interpersonal problems (IIP), and the clinical outcome in routine evaluation (CORE). The pathway from assessment through to treatment and variables associated with treatment uptake and exclusion are described and examined. Results. Most patients were in the moderate to severe range of psychiatric severity at the time of presentation. Ninety-five percent met clinically based criteria for a psychiatric disorder (mostly anxiety and mood disorders) and/or personality disorder. Although the majority of patients were found suitable for treatment (N=935, 82%), analysis of uptake showed relatively high rates of treatment rejection by patients and treatment drop-out. Partial outcome data at 6-month follow-up after intake into treatment revealed significant change but modest effect size (d=0.35). Conclusion. Systematic collection of baseline and outcome data would provide a national database of the performance of psychotherapy services that would be invaluable in facilitating comparative studies.

AB  - Abstract Meningococcal infection remains a significant health problem in children, with a significant mortality and morbidity. Prompt recognition and aggressive early treatment are the only effective measures against invasive disease. This requires immediate administration of antibiotic therapy, and the recognition and treatment of patients who may have complications of meningococcal infection such as shock, raised intracranial pressure (ICP) or both. Encouragingly, its mortality has fallen in recent years. This is the result of several factors such as the centralization of care of seriously ill children in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs), the establishment of specialized mobile intensive care teams, the development of protocols for the treatment of meningococcal infection, and the dissemination by national bodies and charities of guidance about early recognition and management. We will review the pathophysiology and management of the different presentations of meningococcal disease and examine the possible role of adjunctive therapies.

AB  - Abstract Medical imaging and emergency departments work collaboratively to interpret trauma radiographs. In addition to accurate radiographic interpretation, clear communication is crucial to ensure appropriate and timely management of musculoskeletal injuries. This two-step ?how to guide? provides the reviewer with a recipe for effectively evaluating trauma radiographs for traumatic pathology and succinctly documenting the findings. Step 1 is a systematic search of the radiograph: soft tissues, bones, alignment of joints and satisfaction of search (SBASS). Utilising SBASS increases reviewer confidence in identifying traumatic pathology of the appendicular and axial skeleton. Step 2 is a streamlined communication model for the documentation of pathological findings. The WWW acronym (What is it? Where is it? What is it doing?) can be adapted to describe simple or complex traumatic pathology.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult with many patients treated without the disease or left untreated without an adequate diagnostic work up. Recent advances in PE diagnosis are reviewed. The use of risk stratification in PE diagnosis is strongly recommended and evidence on how it can best be performed summarized. The Ginsberg/Wells stratification rule is recommended currently as the best validated rule. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was found to have quite poor sensitivity and to be poorly validated. It is recommended as adequate as a positive test in moderate/high risk groups and an exclusionary test in low risk groups or where an adequate alternative diagnosis is found. For D-Dimer tests the only test with adequate sensitivity and validation in management studies is the VIDAS? D-Dimer. This is in low/intermediate risk groups in the ED population. The Simpli-Red? test is also reviewed but is too insensitive for most populations. Echocardiography: this is good in compromised patients as it is a bedside test which when negative virtually excludes PE. If positive in the right setting it has a high positive predictive value. A negative echocardiogram predicts a benign clinical course for PE. The rest of the paper details the authors approach to integrating these new techniques with established algorithms and where progress is likely to occur in the next few years. These include improvements in CTPA (plus the addition of CT venography), new point of care D-Dimer tests, better risk stratification rules and integration of new strategies with artificial neural networks or computerized guidelines.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively useful sonographic diagnostic criteria for testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma and to determine significant predictors among the criteria. Methods From July 2004 to February 2007, 29 consecutive patients (mean age, 22.8 years; range, 20?43 years) with blunt scrotal trauma who underwent scrotal sonography were enrolled. Ten ruptured testes and 6 intact testes were confirmed by surgery, and an additional 13 intact testes were confirmed by a physical examination. The sonographic findings were recorded with respect to contour irregularity, the presence of intratesticular and extratesticular heterogeneous echoes, loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography, and engorgement of the pampiniform plexus by consensus between 2 radiologists. The sonographic findings used to diagnose testicular rupture were analyzed by the Fisher exact test, and significant predictors were determined by multiple regression analysis. Results The ruptured testes showed contour irregularity (P = .0002), a heterogeneous intratesticular echo pattern (P = .0077), and loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography (P = .0093). Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus was seen in most nonruptured testes (P = .0178). Contour irregularity was the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture (P = .0002). On the basis of this single predictor, diagnostic predictive values for sonography were calculated; the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all 90%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 82% and 94%, respectively. Conclusions Among the useful sonographic criteria, contour irregularity is the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma.

AB  - Abstract Child abuse is a significant social and public health problem in many societies. One particular form of physical abuse is inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI) ? the so-called ?Shaken Baby Syndrome?. One of the key features associated with ITBI is characteristic ocular findings ? only observed on fundal examination. It is crucial not to miss the diagnosis of ITBI as there may be implications for the safety of the child. The ophthalmologist is one key contributor to the process required to make the diagnosis of ITBI accurately and on the basis of all the relevant evidence. This article discusses some medicolegal implications of examining a child with retinal haemorrhages in the context of suspected ITBI, with practical advice for the ophthalmologist to be as objective and prepared as possible. The scientific validity of some alternative explanations advanced in court is discussed, with a strong emphasis on the literature.

AB  - Abstract Background Hospital-associated venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE) is a serious adverse event, preventable with appropriate care during and post-admission. Accurate measurement of in-hospital and post-discharge incidences is essential for implementation and evaluation of prevention strategies and monitoring. Aims To estimate in-hospital and post-discharge diagnosed VTE, trends and risk factors. Methods This was a population-based study in New South Wales, Australia, using linked hospital admission and emergency department data for 2010?2013 of adult patients with a minimum stay of 48 h. HA-VTE were diagnosed in-hospital or post-discharge (within 90 days). Multi-level modelling schemes produced adjusted rates and ratios for patient, admission and hospital-related characteristics. Results From 1?865?059 admissions, the HA-VTE incidence rate was 9.7 per 1000 admissions; 71% were diagnosed post-discharge, and 4.3% died with a greater risk for VTE diagnosed in hospital compared to post-discharge (8.4% vs 2.6%, P < 0.001). Compared with surgical patients, medical patients developed fewer HA-VTE (IRR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.58?0.63) but were more likely to be diagnosed post-discharge (OR = 2.19; 95% CI: 2.00?2.40). HA-VTE increased 6.5% over the period, driven by the 44% increase in in-hospital diagnoses and not by the 9% decrease in post-discharge diagnoses. Conclusions HA-VTE is a continuing burden, and diagnosis after recent hospital discharge is notably high. Incidence varies across patients and facilities, highlighting the need for individual VTE risk assessment. Inclusive measures and routine monitoring of HA-VTE incidence and mortality are essential for implementing best practice and assessing effectiveness of prevention strategies.

AB  - Depression is the most common mental disorder for young people, and it is associated with educational underachievement, self-harm, and suicidality. Current psychological therapies for adolescent depression are usually focused only on individual-level change and often neglect family or contextual influences. The efficacy of interventions may be enhanced with a broader therapeutic focus on family factors such as communication, conflict, support, and cohesion. This article describes a structured multi-family group approach to the treatment of adolescent depression: Behaviour Exchange Systems Therapy for adolescent depression (BEST MOOD). BEST MOOD is a manualized intervention that is designed to address both individual and family factors in the treatment of adolescent depression. BEST MOOD adopts a family systems approach that also incorporates psychoeducation and elements of attachment theories. The program consists of eight multifamily group therapy sessions delivered over 2 hours per week, where parents attend the first four sessions and young people and siblings join from week 5. The program design is specifically aimed to engage youth who are initially resistant to treatment and to optimize youth and family mental health outcomes. This article presents an overview of the theoretical model, session content, and evaluations to date, and provides a case study to illustrate the approach.

AB  - Abstract Background Voice changes after thyroidectomy are common but not always related to recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury. We evaluated if RLN neuromonitoring correlated with non-RLN injury-related changes in voice after thyroidectomy. Methods Prospective multi-dimensional voice assessment was conducted on patients undergoing thyroidectomy before, 1?4 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively. Voice outcome (VO) was determined as normal (NormVO) or negative (NegVO) based upon combinations of patient-reported symptoms, videolaryngoscopy, a composite of acoustic measurements, and clinician-perceived voice quality. Groups with and without neuromonitoring were compared for early and durable differences in VO. Results Ninety-one patients underwent thyroidectomy; 39 with RLN neuromonitoring and 52 without. The two study groups were similar with regard to baseline characteristics including voice assessment. There was no difference in NegVO between neuromonitored and non-monitored patients at 1?4 weeks (n?=?89; 32% vs. 27%; P?=?0.81) and 6 months (n?=?71, 14% vs. 7%; P?=?0.42) after thyroidectomy. Neuromonitoring was associated with a 48-min increase in median operative time, but this finding was not statistically significant in a multivariate model. Conclusion In this study, recurrent laryngeal neuromonitoring did not appear to influence non-RLN injury related VO as measured by a comprehensive multidimensional voice assessment. J. Surg.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews psychological trauma from a multilevel developmental psychopathology. This perspective holds that no single approach or discipline adequately encompasses the phenomenon of psychological trauma and how it interacts with development in terms of its impact on the individual. Rather, multiple levels are preferable, including the areas of neurobiology, psychology, psychopathology, and psychiatric diagnosis, individual, familial, societal, cultural, economic, and physical. To address all of these levels, an interdisciplinary team approach is required, with individuals who have expertise in as wide a range of fields as psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, cardiology, internal medicine, statistics, radiology, physics, computer science, psychopharmacology, child development, philosophy and literature. The implication is that no single individual or specialty will have sufficient expertise and knowledge in enough areas to provide an appropriate characterization of the effects of trauma on the individual. Additionally, all of these areas will interact with developmental epoch in different ways. Use of the multilevel developmental psychopathology approach has the promise of being more helpful to individuals affected by psychological trauma.

AB  - Acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure is a known complication of patients undergoing burns resuscitation. It can progress rapidly in the absence of primary abdominal pathology, causing multiple organ dysfunction. This is known as secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Intravascular fluid replacement and decompressive laparotomy form the standard management practices for ACS. Despite these measures, survival rates of secondary ACS in burns patients remain extremely poor. The medical records of four severely burnt patients are reviewed. All four patients underwent decompressive laparotomy. Three patients had either vacuum-assisted closure therapy or a Silastic bowel bag inserted and temporary abdominal wound closure was gained using an absorbable synthetic mesh. There was one survivor. Early recognition and alternatives to standard therapy may result in possible decrease in mortality figures. However, the poor outcome may be intrinsic to the severe burn injuries rather than a reflection of current practices. Patients that survive open laparotomy face a new set of complications on road to recovery that are often ignored.

AB  - Background: The economic, accurate, and rapid screening of foals for failure of transfer of passive immunity (FPT) is essential to ensure timely intervention. Hypothesis: Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of foal sera and pattern recognition may be used to diagnose FPT and quantify serum IgG. Samples: Sera from 194 foals (24?72 hours) with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations determined previously by radial immunodiffusion assay (RID) were used. Methods: IR spectra were recorded for the serum samples, and the data were randomly divided into training and independent test sets, each containing both FPT-positive (IgG <400 mg/dL) and non-FPT samples. A genetic optimal region selection algorithm and linear discriminant analysis were used to partition the training spectra, and the resulting classifier was then validated by comparing the IR-predicted FPT status for each of the test samples to that provided by the RID IgG assay. A quantitative IR-based assay for IgG was developed using partial least squares (PLS) and validated by testing its ability to predict IgG concentrations. Results: Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy for the combined data were 92.5, 96.8, and 95.9%, respectively. Corresponding positive (88.1%) and negative predictive (98.0%) values determined a success rate of 95?97% as compared to RID-based IgG concentrations. The IR-based quantitative assay yielded correlation coefficients for IR spectroscopy versus RID-based IgG concentrations of 0.90 and 0.86 for the training and test sets, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The overall performance of the IR-based test was similar to that of the colorimetric assay and was superior and more economic than other available tests.
