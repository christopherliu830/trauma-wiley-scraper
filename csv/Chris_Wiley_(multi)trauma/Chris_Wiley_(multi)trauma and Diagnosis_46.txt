AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of multi-family therapy at reducing the addiction severity and at improving the psychological and family dynamics of opiate addicts receiving methadone treatment at a public treatment center. The study compares multi-family therapy with a reflecting team (MFT-RT) and a standard treatment following a methadone maintenance treatment program. The results show that multi-family therapy with a reflecting team effectively reduces the addiction severity in several of the areas evaluated and noted that this effect is superior to standard treatment. The psychotherapy patients showed improvement in the areas of employment and social support; their drug use diminished and their psychiatric condition improved. At the same time, they needed a lower daily dose of methadone. In addition, the group undergoing standard treatment showed a noteworthy deterioration in their medical condition. Both groups showed a significant increase in their alcohol use. When applied to family treatments, the systemic-constructivist approach by the reflecting team offers combined techniques that can help improve care for the families of patients with addiction problems.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To examine the prospective associations among peer victimization and somatic symptoms across 5 years of adolescence using multiple informants and disaggregating effects at the within-person and between-person level. Methods From age 13?17 years, 612 Canadian children (54% girls; 76% White) completed measures of peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Parents (89% mothers) reported on their child's somatic symptoms. We built autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals, controlling for diagnosed medical and psychiatric conditions, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results Within-person, self-reported somatic symptoms were stable across time and there were bidirectional associations between peer victimization and somatic symptoms across the 5-year period. The magnitude of effect was strongest from somatic symptoms to peer victimization. Between-person, being a girl or having a psychiatric diagnosis predicted higher mean levels and rising trajectories of somatic symptoms and higher mean levels of peer victimization. The level of peer victimization among non-White participants increased over time. In the parent-reported model, somatic symptoms were less stable and did not predict peer victimization. Conclusions The results highlight the dynamic processes between peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Increased effort is needed to protect adolescents with psychiatric problems, girls, and ethnic minorities from peer abuse.

AB  - Summary This chapter begins with an introduction of the anatomy of the ankle and foot. Appropriateness criteria for imaging foot and ankle trauma are then discussed. The ankle and foot are anatomically distinct from each other and therefore radiographic evaluation of each is different from the other. Standard ankle radiographs include anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and mortise view, and foot radiographs include AP, lateral, and oblique views. Computed Tomography (CT) is used for pre-operative planning in patients with complex distal tibial and malleolar fractures, tarsal fractures and Lisfranc fracture-dislocations. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is indicated in assessment of radiographically occult stress and insufficiency fractures. In the setting of foot and ankle trauma, ultrasound is often performed to evaluate the Achilles tendon for the presence and severity of a tear. The key to interpreting ankle and foot radiographs is familiarity with normal anatomy and injury patterns that may involve the ankle and foot.

AB  - During one year all ankle inversion injuries seen at the acute ward of our institution were divided into grades of severity and classified according to the maximal area of tenderness at the time of clinical examination. Seven years later 648 of the subjects (91%) evaluated their ankle with the help of a questionnaire. Location of maximal tenderness at the time of injury was: lateral fibular ligaments 61%, lateral midfoot ligaments 24%, base of the fifth metatarsal/peroneal tendons 5% and combined lesions 8%. 39% were considered minor, 46% were moderate, and 15% severe. All cases followed a functional treatment protocol. Seven years post- injury 32% reported chronic complaints of pain, swelling or recurrent sprains. 72% of the subjects with residual disability reported that they were functionally impaired by their ankle ? in most cases a question of not performing sports at a desired level. 4% experienced pain at rest and were severely disabled. 19% were bothered by repeated inversion injuries ? 43% of these subjects felt that they could compensate by using an external ankle support. There was no correlation between the severity of the sprain as judged at the time of injury and the frequency of residual disability or between the area of maximal tenderness at the time of injury and the area of maximal pain at the time of follow-up.

AB  - Abstract The current BLS Annual Survey of Occupational Illnesses and Injuries and several recent analyses of factors affecting missed worktime in occupational back injuries rely on ANSI-based injury codes derived from injury narratives to classify occupational injuries and estimate incidence and outcome. No population-based studies of the concordance between back injury codes and clinical diagnoses have been reported. Back injury cases were identified in two large work-injured populations totaling almost 80,000 cases in the states of Michigan and Minnesota. In both populations, cases had been coded by the single nature-of-injury and part-of-body-injured codes assigned by an ANSI-based injury-coding system and by as many as four (Michigan) or three (Minnesota) clinical diagnoses according to the International Classification of Diseases?Clinical Modification, 9th Revision. Concordance was measured by the sensitivity and predictive value positive (PVP, aka PV+ or PPA) of the injury coding scheme for related diagnostic groups. We also used an algorithm based on the limited clinical information available to corroborate the diagnosis of displaced/herniated disc for cases that underwent spinal surgery. Cases identified by the algorithm were then used to obtain a lower bound estimate of the fraction with disc injury. The injury coding scheme had PVPs of 82.9?90.1% and overall sensitivities of 69.7?75.9%. Sensitivities for individual diagnostic groups show that their distribution in ANSI-coded injury groups is skewed slightly toward cases with sprain and disc displacement/herniation, but these shifts are modest. The lower bound estimate of the fraction of cases with disc displacement/herniation in a population of cases with back injuries producing at least 1 day of missed worktime is 5.8%. The demographic comparisons indicate that, as the time between injury and cohort ascertainment increases during the first 8 days of missed worktime following injury, the proportion of younger workers in an injury cohort decreases. The relationship between increasing age and increasing missed worktime disability, reported in various outcome studies, is also present during the first few days following injury. The use of ANSI injury codes underestimates the contribution of back injuries to missed worktime because 24?30% of cases are missed by the ANSI coding system. However, the distribution of diagnostic groups in the injury-coded groups approximates that observed with all diagnosed cases and supports the use of such data to study outcome. Our estimate, and one from Quebec, suggest that disc displacement/herniation occurs more frequently in the subset of occupational back injuries compared to the set of back injuries from all sources. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background: The value of the radionuclide blood pool venogram in detecting deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has to date been inadequately evaluated. This is despite its lower complication rate than the gold standard of contrast X-ray venography. Aims: To compare the relative accuracy and inter observer variability of radionuclide blood pool and X-ray contrast venography as well as evaluate previous literature on radionuclide venography. Methods: Prospective comparison of radionuclide and contrast venography was performed in 39 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of radionuclide venography were compared to contrast venography and confidence intervals were measured using standard error calculations. A meta-analysis of previous studies was also performed. Results: Significant inter observer variation in reports was present in both radionuclide (37%) and contrast (22%) venograms. Using consensus reports sensitivity of radionuclide venography was 87% compared to contrast venography and specificity was 83%. These results are similar to those obtained in previous studies. Furthermore, sensitivity in specificity in the proximal veins were 90% and 92% respectively which were superior to sensitivity and specificity in the distal veins where it was 74% and 90% respectively. Conclusion: The radionuclide venogram appears accurate in the proximal veins and in excluding but not diagnosing distal venous thrombosis. (Aust NZ J Med 1993; 23: 641?645.)

AB  - Abstract Objective Abdominal pain is a common paediatric presentation to the ED. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging, with the best-performing clinical scoring systems having sensitivities between 72% and 100%. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to seniority in diagnosing paediatric acute appendicitis in ED. Methods This is a prospective multi-centre observational study of clinician's prediction of appendicitis in children under the age of 16?years presenting to four EDs with abdominal pain over a 1 month period at each site. Clinician-estimated likelihood of acute appendicitis was compared with the final diagnosis determined by histopathology or operative findings and supplemented by telephone follow up for those without an operation. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to clinician seniority in diagnosing appendicitis. Results There were 381 children enrolled with completed clinician questionnaires, and 224 children had complete follow up or underwent appendicectomy. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range 6?12) and the incidence of appendicitis was 31/224 (13.8%, 95% confidence interval 9.3?18.4). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of clinician gestalt were 0.84 (0.76?0.91), 81% (63?93%), 76% (69?82%), 35% (28?42%) and 96% (92?98%), respectively, giving an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76% (70?82%). AUC stratified by clinician seniority (junior, intermediate and senior) were 0.89 (0.80?0.98), 0.82 (0.69?0.95) and 0.76 (0.56?0.96), respectively. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of ED clinician gestalt in paediatric appendicitis is comparable to current clinical scoring systems irrespective of seniority.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Abstract Thirty-four (34) days after arrival at our facility, a recently imported rhesus macaque demonstrated a grade 4/5 reaction to intradermal testing with mammalian old tuberculin and a strong positive response in a serum interferon gamma (IFN-?) stimulation assay (Primagam?). The affected animal was euthanized to prevent further exposure of the other rhesus in the quarantine room. Necropsy revealed enlarged, caseating mediastinal lymph nodes. Further analysis confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms. Strict isolation measures were initiated and intensive testing of all animals in the affected room began immediately. After 13?weeks of additional testing, none of the animals in the room showed any positive response and all were released from quarantine. This case illustrates the importance of prolonged quarantine of non-human primates (NHP) and illustrates the usefulness of serology-based diagnostics as an adjunct to intradermal testing (molecular-based diagnostics typically refers to polymerase chain reaction, whereas this assay is really serology based, even though it is an in vitro IFN-? stimulation assay). It also demonstrates that with proper isolation procedures, the spread of tuberculosis can be prevented in NHP facilities.

AB  - Summary Despite an increasing number of case reports published using computed tomography (CT) in foals only limited data on its diagnostic utility are available. Medical and imaging records of 10 foals that had a CT examination between May 2008 and December 2010 were retrieved and studied. Three out of 10 cases were examined for orthopaedic problems, 3 were referred for medical disorders, 3 for both orthopaedic and medical problems, and one case was presented for a follow-up of an abdominal mass. In this series CT was an accurate diagnostic tool in identifying abscesses, osteomyelitis, arthritis, physitis and fractures, bone ossification defects, intracranial haematomas and sinusitis. An indication for the best medical and/or surgical approach was obtained.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience. Methods Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24 months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) subscores respectively. Results In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P?<?0.001, cluster size?>?20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group and three CAPS subscores. Discussion These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.
