AB  - SUMMARY Two patients who presented with skin fragility and a bullous eruption were found to have amyloid deposits along the epidermal basement membrane. In both cases a basement membrane similar to that observed in pemphigoid was seen on direct immunofluorescence resulting from the non-specific absorption of immunoglobulins by the amyloid deposits. Evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia was found in both patients, one of whom developed nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Adaptive behavior impairments have been reported in children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) but are not typically found following mild TBI. It is possible that mild TBI induces subtle changes in adaptive functioning that are not captured in conventional group comparisons. This study aimed to explore time course changes in adaptive functioning following early mild TBI. Parents of 63 children with mild TBI and 53 children with orthopedic injuries aged between 1.5 and 5 years at the time of injury completed the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II at three time points: retrospectively to assess pre-injury functioning, then at 6 and 18 months post-injury. Developmental trajectories of adaptive functioning domains (practical, conceptual, and social) reported by parents were modeled using linear mixed-model analyses. Findings suggest that mild TBI may disrupt the expected developmental progression of children's social adaptive behavior, but does not appear to alter practical and conceptual domains.

AB  - Abstract The mortality associated with invasive fungal infections remains high with that involving rare yeast pathogens other than Candida being no exception. This is in part due to the severe underlying conditions typically predisposing patients to these healthcare-related infections (most often severe neutropenia in patients with haematological malignancies), and in part due to the often challenging intrinsic susceptibility pattern of the pathogens that potentially leads to delayed appropriate antifungal treatment. A panel of experts of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Fungal Infection Study Group (EFISG) and the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) undertook a data review and compiled guidelines for the diagnostic tests and procedures for detection and management of rare invasive yeast infections. The rare yeast pathogens were defined and limited to the following genera/species: Cryptococcus adeliensis, Cryptococcus albidus, Cryptococcus curvatus, Cryptococcus flavescens, Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus uniguttulatus (often published under the name Filobasidium uniguttulatum), Malassezia furfur, Malassezia globosa, Malassezia pachydermatis and Malassezia restricta, Pseudozyma spp., Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula minuta and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Sporobolomyces spp., Trichosporon asahii, Trichosporon asteroides, Trichosporon dermatis, Trichosporon inkin, Trichosporon jirovecii, Trichosporon loubieri, Trichosporon mucoides and Trichosporon mycotoxinivorans and ascomycetous ones: Geotrichum candidum, Kodamaea ohmeri, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (incl. S. boulardii) and Saprochaete capitatae (Magnusiomyces (Blastoschizomyces) capitatus formerly named Trichosporon capitatum or Geotrichum (Dipodascus) capitatum) and Saprochaete clavata. Recommendations about the microbiological investigation and detection of invasive infection were made and current knowledge on the most appropriate antifungal and supportive treatment was reviewed. In addition, remarks about antifungal susceptibility testing were made.

AB  - Summary Spinal clearance in unconscious children following traumatic brain injury is an area of controversy. The risk of significant injury in this high-risk group needs to be balanced against that of prolonged spinal immobilization and all its implications. No national or international guideline exists to aid clinicians faced with such a scenario. This article reviews traumatic spinal injury in children looking at prevalence, risk factors, anatomical considerations, and radiological investigation. Spinal immobilization is discussed along with the use of appropriate and targeted radiological investigations to aid clearance.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer are continuous stressors in the lives of the entire family involved. Disease-related tools for the assessment of parental stress and adaptation are scarce. For that reason, the Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP), a disease-related measure, was translated into Dutch and its psychometric qualities were determined to prove its value. Methods: The PIP and three other measures (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, General Health Questionnaire and Parenting Stress Index, Short Form) were administered to 174 parents of 107 children diagnosed with cancer in three university medical centers in the Netherlands. Results: Internal consistency (Crohnbach's α=0.94 and 0.95) and test?retest reliability (Pearson's r between 0.67 and 0.87) of the Dutch PIP total scales are satisfactory. Validity was illustrated by a high correlation between PIP-scores and anxiety and general stress. Confirmatory factor analysis showed acceptable fit to the data for the original four-factor and the one-factor models; the four-factor model showed slightly better fit. Conclusion: The PIP can be used in clinical practice to assess disease-related parental stress. Further psychometric testing is highly recommended. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background In the era of frequent head-to-pelvis computed tomography (CT) for adult blunt trauma evaluation, we sought to update teachings regarding aortic injury by determining 1) the incidence of aortic injury; 2) the proportion of patients with isolated aortic injury (without other concomitant thoracic injury); 3) the clinical implications of aortic injury (hospital mortality, length of stay [LOS], and rate of surgical interventions); and 4) the screening value of traditional risk factors/markers (such as high-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on chest x-ray [CXR]) for aortic injury, compared to newer criteria from the recently developed NEXUS Chest CT decision instrument (DI). Methods We conducted a preplanned analysis of patients prospectively enrolled in the NEXUS Chest studies at 10 Level I trauma centers with the following inclusion criteria: age > 14 years, blunt trauma within 6 hours of ED presentation, and receiving chest imaging during ED trauma evaluation. Results Of 24,010 enrolled subjects, 42 (0.17%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13% to 0.24%) had aortic injury. Most patients (79%, 95% CI = 64% to 88%) had an associated thoracic injury, with rib fractures, pneumothorax/hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion occurring most frequently. Compared to patients without aortic injury this cohort had similar mortality (9.5%, 95% CI = 3.8% to 22.1% vs. 5.8%, 95% CI = 5.4% to 6.3%), longer median hospital LOS (11 days vs. 3 days, p < 0.01), and higher median Injury Severity Score (29 vs. 5, p < 0.001). High-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on CXR had low sensitivity for aortic injury (76% [95% CI = 62% to 87%] and 33% [95% CI = 21% to 49%], respectively), compared to the NEXUS Chest CT DI (sensitivity 100% [95% CI = 92% to 100%]). Conclusions Aortic injury is rare in adult ED blunt trauma patients who survive to receive imaging. Most ED aortic injury patients have associated thoracic injuries and survive to hospital discharge. Widened mediastinum on CXR and high-energy mechanism have relatively low screening sensitivity for aortic injury, but the NEXUS Chest DI detected all cases.

AB  - Background: Severe periodontal furcation invasion has long been a treatment dilemma for the clinician. Many techniques have been advocated in the treatment of multi-rooted posterior teeth ranging from conventional scaling and root planing (SRP), apically positioned flaps, root amputations, root resections, tunnel procedures, guided tissue regeneration, and restorations. The keys to success depend on the clinician's ability to access the furcation to remove local factors and create an environment that enhances the patient's own hygiene efforts. Long-term success in treating teeth with furcation invasion depends upon tooth retention and arresting the destructive processes within the furcation area. Methods: A Class III furcation invasion in a mandibular molar was treated by surgical access for SRP along with obliterating the furcation utilizing a resin ionomer restoration. Results: Initially, the patient was asymptomatic. Within 3 months of treatment, the patient presented with suppuration that was refractory to local efforts. Radiographs taken only 5 months postsurgery demonstrated advanced bone loss apical to the restoration. The tooth ultimately was extracted because mobility increased and the tooth became symptomatic. Conclusions: The clinician must consider the multi-factorial etiology of periodontal breakdown within a furcation. For this patient, the technique of sealing off the exposed furcation with restorative material appeared to have resulted in progressive bone loss and accelerate tooth loss. This single case report is presented as a rebuttal to recently published articles, which have demonstrated excellent results when treating furcations with ionomer restorations.

AB  - Abstract Myriad factors have been found to have an impact on delinquent behavior and traumatic stress. This study proposes a model that tests the relationship between common predictors of delinquency (neighborhood condition, antisocial peer socialization, and exposure to violence) with traumatic stress. Serial mediation was used to test the relationships between these predictors and traumatic stress. Results indicate the mediation effect between neighborhood conditions and traumatic stress significantly reduces the total effect. Implications for traumatic stress in the context of delinquent behavior are discussed.

AB  - In order to standardize and quantify diagnostic information derived from medical histories and case reports given by demented patients, their families or care-providers, a questionnaire has been developed containing 94 questions. The output is categorized by computer into graphic clinical scales which correlate and weigh information relating to seven of the most common causes of dementia. The present investigation assesses the validity of predictive diagnostic classifications derived from the clinical scales tested on admission by correlating them later with final diagnoses determined independently by thorough clinical evaluation including standard diagnostic tests, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance scans. Results of 101 healthy, neurologically normal, age-matched volunteers and 140 patients representative of the more common forms of dementia indicate that correct diagnostic identification was: 75% for dementia secondary to Parkinson's disease, 100% for Huntington's disease, 90.2% for Alzheimer's disease, 82.4% for multi-infarct dementia, 90.0% for posttraumatic dementia, 77.8% for normal-pressure hydrocephalus and 85.7% for Wernicke-Korsakoff dementia. Correct diagnostic assignment was highly significant (P < .0005). The screening questionnaire may prove to be a useful and standard diagnostic tool for clinicians and investigators concerned with epidemiology, prevention and treatment of dementia.

AB  - Objectives:? High resolution two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) difficulty in evaluation of some scrotal mass lesions is not frequent. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional ultrasound extended imaging (3D XI) in characterization of those lesions. Methods:? The study protocol had the approval of the University's review board all participants' informed consents were obtained. The study included 28 selected patients (12 testicular and 16 para-testicular mass lesions) examined by 2D US and 3D XI applications including computed multi-slice view (MSV) and multi-resolution enhanced images (XI MR). Results were correlated with histopathological findings. Results:? Two-dimensional ultrasound did not adequately characterize 28 patients out of 329 (8.5%). 3D XI interrogation was an easy procedure and distinctive of the pathological findings in 27 patients out of 28 (96.4%). The performance of XI MR with respect to characterization provided additional diagnostic information over MSV. Conclusions:? The performance of 3D XI with respect to testicular mass characterization proved better than static 2D US. Subsequently, the results of this study suggest that the routine use of 2D US in diagnosis of scrotal mass lesions should preferably be upgraded to 3D XI methods.

AB  - Abstract Background Women are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men. Limited research exists evaluating the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) among military women with PTSD. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using US Department of Defense (DoD) data comprised of all active-duty women giving birth to their first, liveborn singleton infant using DoD-sponsored health insurance from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008 (n = 34 176). Birth hospitalisation records, maternal mental health visits, and Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) and Reassessment (PDHRA) screenings were included. The HDP outcome (yes vs no) was defined using ICD-9-CM codes in the maternal birth hospitalisation record. Women fit into one of four PTSD exposure categories (confirmed, probable, possible, none). Confirmed cases had a PTSD ICD-9-CM diagnosis code. Probable/possible cases were classified using PDHA screening items. We used multiple log-linear regression to assess PTSD (confirmed, any vs none) and the risk of HDP overall, and then explored effect modification by military service and demographic variables. We assessed the risk of HDP among deployed mothers with PTSD (confirmed, probable/possible vs none) who completed a PDHA, and explored effect modification by race/ethnicity. We also assessed risk of HDP with differing PTSD lead times. Results Overall, PTSD was not associated with HDP except among mothers whose PTSD was diagnosed ≥1 year prior to conception (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06, 1.90). Conclusions Post-traumatic stress disorder preceding conception by at least a year appeared to confer an increased risk of HDP, but further research is needed using more thorough PTSD assessment.

AB  - Purpose: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred blood access for hemodialysis due to its longevity and resistance to infection. Little attention is given to the long-term hemodynamic consequences of large left-to-right shunts, particularly in patients with brachial artery fistulae. Materials and Methods:?We describe 9 patients (8 on dialysis, 1 post-transplant), aged 25?73, who developed clinical heart failure, primarily due to large, upper arm AVFs. Results:?4/9 had access flows in excess of 2 liters/min, assessed by blood temperature monitoring. 6/9 had cardiac output measured by right heart catheterization, before and after shunt compression. One also underwent left heart catheterization with ventriculography. 3/9 had surgical reduction of the fistula, either by banding or by serial interposition of small caliber GoreTex graft. In 2/9 the shunt was ligated. One patient had heart failure in association with 2 large, upper arm AVFs, one of which was ligated. After years of improved cardiac symptoms, heart failure recurred in association with marked hypertrophy of his remaining AVF. Resting cardiac output in this patient was in excess of 11 liters/min. 2/9 experienced acute onset of heart failure within 1?3 days of angioplasty of a venous stenosis. One of these, with very poor baseline cardiac function, expired. Surgical revision or ligation was accompanied by clinical improvement in the 5 patients so treated. One of these expired of a stroke after two months of cardiac improvement. Conclusion:?High output heart failure is under-diagnosed in dialysis patients. Patients with large upper arm shunts are particularly at risk. Access flow should be assessed regularly and those with outputs >1.5 liters/min should be monitored closely for development of heart failure. Surgical correction is beneficial and indicated in symptomatic patients.

AB  - SUMMARY From a review of the literature, it can be concluded that it is always advantageous and usually necessary to distribute the casualties of a disaster to several hosp-hospitals rather than allowing 1 hospital, the nearest to the scene, to bear the whole load. The potential of these hospitals would be enhanced if their preparedness and planning included anticipation of their functioning as part of a framework of the entire capacity of the medical services of an entire small country, or a region of a larger one. For the smooth functioning of this framework, central co-ordination and control of the distribution of the load, the movements within it, the strengthening of its various component parts is necessary and services other than medical (transport, communications, etc.) are essential. The establishment of a multihospital system for disaster situations for a whole region is suggested. This would integrate all medical facilities and services of the region, as well as promoting additional services, first horizontally integrated and later vertically, and would have a central governing body with full authority to prepare the system for the calamity and to execute the implementation of the plan when disaster occurs. This body may find it useful to base some of its decision in the planning as well as the implementing stage, on an assumed population of casualties that is characteristic for the region and on implications that may be drawn from the population.

AB  - Abstract The relationship between farming and cancer risk was investigated in an integrated series of case-control studies conducted from 1985 to 1991 in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, north-east Italy. Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, colon and rectum, pancreas, breast, thyroid gland, kidney and urinary tract, bladder, prostate, soft-tissue sarcomas, Hodgkin's diseases, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myelomas, and controls admitted to hospital for acute, non-neoplastic conditions, were interviewed. For males, a significantly elevated relative risk was seen for oral cavity and pharynx. Farming, however, was associated with a significant protection against cancer of the colon and rectum and bladder. In females, only one significant association emerged, for multiple myeloma. A few significant interactions between cancer risk and year of birth (i.e., before 1930 or 1930 and after) were observed. The risk of cancer of the larynx was significantly elevated in younger male farmers but not in older ones. Our multi-site case-control study confirms that farmers have, for some cancer sites, a distinctive pattern. Excesses of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx in farmers are characteristic of the present study area and, possibly, of similar European rural populations who have in common high levels of alcohol consumption and, at least in the past, unbalanced diets.

AB  - Abstract??? Background:? Apical barrier formation and root strengthening procedures have been extensively described in the literature. This systematic review attempts to establish where the effects of interventions using multi-visit apexification, single visit apical plug techniques and root strengthening procedures are consistent and where they may vary significantly. Objectives:? To evaluate the relative effectiveness of apexification and apical plug techniques as well as root strengthening procedures for treating traumatized necrotic immature permanent anterior teeth through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Reported immediate and/or long-term adverse events and effects of the materials and techniques are also evaluated. Search strategy & selection criteria:? Structured electronic and hand search was performed with no restriction on the language of publication. Only randomized controlled trials comparing different apical barrier formation techniques and root strengthening procedures in traumatized necrotic immature anterior teeth were assessed. Results:? Two hundred studies were identified but only two were suitable for inclusion. Included studies investigated multi-visit apexification techniques using calcium hydroxide and tricalcium phosphate. There were no eligible studies investigating root strengthening procedures or any other intervention for apical barrier formation in necrotic immature anterior teeth. No reliable information was available on long-term adverse effects of the reported interventions or cost implications. Conclusions:? Based on two included studies, there is weak evidence supporting the use of either calcium hydroxide or tricalcium phosphate for apical barrier formation in necrotic immature anterior teeth employing multi-visit apexification techniques. The evidence is insufficient to provide guidelines for practice. There was no reliable evidence on adverse events or long-term effects after the use of calcium hydroxide or tricalcium phosphate justifying caution in their use in apical barrier formation techniques.
