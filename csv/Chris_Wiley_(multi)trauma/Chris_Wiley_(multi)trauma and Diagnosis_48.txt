AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - Gastric stump-pleural fistula is a common complication following gastroesophageal anastomosis in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. Mortality is high because of the severe subsequent relevant complications caused by the fistula. Here we report five cases of gastric stump-pleural fistula diagnosed by air perfusion radiography under digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DSA air perfusion radiography provides a reliable basis for the development of clinical programmes; it is a simple method which does not involve any pain or trauma to the patient.

AB  - Objectives: To retrospectively review the first treatment response of dogs with mycotic rhinosinusitis to commonly utilised treatment techniques. Methods: Medical records of dogs treated for mycotic rhinosinusitis were obtained retrospectively via a manual review of the clinical databases of six veterinary referral centres for the period of January 1998 to June 2008, and first treatment outcome was evaluated. Historical and clinicopathological findings were also reviewed to evaluate their impact on treatment success or failure. Results: There was no significant difference in first treatment outcome between treatment groups (P=0·21). When all topical treatments were considered together (n=85), 39 dogs (45·8%) had a successful first treatment. Initial treatment success was associated with a younger age (56·3 versus 75·8 months; P=0·02) and was 2·7 times more likely in dogs with unilateral disease, although this was not significant (P=0·07). Adjunctive therapy with systemic antifungal agents was associated with treatment failure (PÄ0·01). Fifty-nine dogs (69·4%) responded successfully following multiple treatments. Clinical Significance: Treatment of mycotic rhinosinusitis remains challenging, and multiple treatments are frequently required for adequate treatment. Reasons for first treatment failure are likely multifactorial in origin, making it difficult to predict those dogs that are likely to have a superior prognosis, regardless of the treatment type used.

AB  - Low back pain patients (n=142) on sick leave for at least 8 weeks were given a multi-modal cognitive behavioural treatment program (MMCBT) that lasted for 4 weeks. Before treatment, all patients were tested with a comprehensive test battery. The outcome at 12-month follow-up was predictable from the pretest, but only when combining medical and psychological data. Patients who returned to work (Returners, 50%) in the MMCBT group were characterised by less pain, more psychological strength, were evaluated by the physiotherapist as having a good prognosis for return to work, and were less educated. Patients who did not return to work (Non-returners) in the MMCBT group felt tense and unfit, felt hopelessness concerning the future, were less physically active, thought their complaints would worsen if they continued working, and reported fewer difficulties driving a car. Returners to work (58%) in the randomised control group (n=81), who received ordinary physical therapy, were characterised by high levels of energy, less subjective health complaints, less exhaustion for a condition test, and did not work in positions giving a constant load on the back. There was no significant differences between number of patients who had returned to work in the MMCBT and the control group. Non-returners in the control group lacked energy, trained less regularly, worked in occupations that gave an almost constant load on the back, and did not expect to be back to work in the course of a couple of weeks. It seems to be important to develop further diagnostic tools to identify those who might benefit from extensive or specific treatments.

AB  - Summary The incidence of multiple pregnancies continues to rise, in part due to the increasing use of assisted reproduction techniques. Due to the serious maternal and perinatal complications with multiple pregnancies and the further increased risks with higher order multiples, selective fetal reduction has been offered in an attempt to improve perinatal outcomes. This invasive, ultrasound-guided, percutaneous procedure has theoretical risks of pregnancy loss, morbidity to the surviving fetuses and associated risks of premature ruptured membranes and preterm labour. It also evokes complex ethical and moral issues for the parents, clinicians and society as a whole. Pregnancy outcome rates have improved following selective fetal reduction as experience with techniques have improved and the number of very high order pregnancies has reduced.

AB  - This revised Clinical Guideline in Paediatric Dentistry replaces the previously published ninth guideline (Shaw L, O?Sullivan E. Int J Paediatr Dent 2000; 10: 356?365). The process of guideline production began in 1994, resulting in first publication in 1997. Each guideline has been circulated widely for consultation to all UK consultants in paediatric dentistry, council members of the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry (BSPD), and to people of related specialities recognized to have expertise in the subject. The final version of this guideline is produced from a combination of this input and thorough review of the published literature. In the case of the present guideline, an internationally recognized expert in the field was invited to be a co-author (AM). The intention is to encourage improvement in clinical practice and to stimulate research and clinical audit in areas where scientific evidence is inadequate. Evidence underlying recommendations is scored according to the SIGN classification and guidelines should be read in this context. Further details regarding the process of paediatric dentistry guideline production in the UK is described in the Int J Paediatr Dent 1997; 7: 267?268.

AB  - Abstract The institutional aspect of return migration has received little attention in the theoretical and empirical literature on return migration. This research fills the apparent lacuna by unearthing institutional challenges to multi-stakeholder coordination, at different spatial levels in crisis situations and negative effects on reintegration of forcibly returned migrants. We use the evacuation of Ghanaian migrants from Libya who occupied very low socio-economic positions, experienced racism and discrimination, including physical attacks and arbitrary arrests in 2011, as a case study to understand institutional challenges to forced return when migrants? carefully tailored plans are thrown into disarray and they are forced to return unprepared. This study employed mainly qualitative research methods among six different categories of actors and engaged an adaptation of Cassarino's ?returnee's preparedness framework? to expand theoretical understandings of return migration from the institutional perspective and to highlight what can go wrong when institutions are unprepared for involuntary returnees.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the utility of multimodal quantitative MRI (qMRI) and atlas-based methods to identify characteristics of lesion-driven injury and neurodegeneration in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Materials and Methods: This work is health insurance portability and accountability act compliant. High resolution T1-weighted, dual echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion tensor MRI images were prospectively acquired on 68 RRMS patients (range, 25?58 years) and 68 age-matched controls. The data were analyzed using standardized human brain atlas-based tissue segmentation procedures to obtain regional volumes and their corresponding T2 relaxation times and DTI maps. Results: Group-averaged brain atlas-based qMRI maps of T2, fractional anisotropy and diffusivities are visually presented and compared between controls and RRMS. The analysis shows a widespread injury in RRMS. Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) was substantial in RRMS. The qMRI attributes of the neocortex in combination with the CC such as T2 and diffusivities were elevated and correlated with disability. Conclusion: Using a standardized multimodal qMRI acquisition and analyses that accounted for lesion distribution we demonstrate that cerebral pathology is widespread in RRMS. Our analysis of CC and neocortex qMRI metrics in relation to disability points to a neurodegenerative injury component that is independent from lesions. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Neutron activation analysis has been used to determine the total content in the body of N, K, Na, Cl, P and Ca in 25 critically ill surgical patients before and after a 14-day course of intravenous nutrition. Muscle elemental compostion was also determined in these patients at the same time as the total body analysis. Over the 14-day period of intravenous feeding the total body contents of all the measured elements increased (2?9·7 per cent) but only the increase in K was statistically significant. Muscle chemistry suggested an intracellular K depletion which was corrected over the study period. The results of the total body multi-element analysis were interpreted to show a mean gain of 1·25 l of extracellular fluid and 0·51 l of intracellular fluid and direct measurement of total body water suggested that this interpretation was probably valid. The first application of the technique to patients with nutritional and metabolic problems has quantified the weight gained by two body compartments during a 2-week period of intravenous nutrition. Its further application should help to solve a number of nutritional and metabolic problems in clinical surgery.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The optional filter is gaining ground, supplementing anticoagulation in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients, this despite knowledge gaps relating to its efficacy. We studied the literature and audited our experience with inferior vena cava filters to educate ourselves on this mode of VTE prophylaxis, particularly its practical implications, if any, for the surgeon. Methods:? A retrospective clinical study on inferior vena cava filter (IVCF)-related events in a Western Australian tertiary centre in 2008 was performed. Literature on IVCFs was reviewed. Results:? The 118 IVCF-related events at our centre in 2008, involved either Recovery-G2 75(88%) or Cook-Celect nine (11%). Of these, 78 were insertions and 36 were retrievals with four failed retrievals (10% of the attempts). Major indications for insertion included multi-trauma 32 (38%), prothrombotic state 29 (34%), head injury/intracranial bleeding 16 (19%) and others eight (9%). The mean dwelling time was 100 days (12?349 days). The mean age was 43 and the retrieval rate was 58%. Conclusion:? Optional filters have presented both versatility and challenge to the management of VTE in high-risk patients. An underlying concern about the quintessential efficacy of IVCFs lingers on, while the impact of lost follow-ups in young patients is still at large. Class 1 studies on optional filters would add certainty to the use of this generation of filters, be a step forward in relevance from the seminal work of Decousus and garner the willingness needed to engage teamwork and institutional proactiveness against loopholes such as lost follow-ups that can undermine the portrayed benefits of a potentially lifesaving device.

Those with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury frequently go through a course of inpatient neurorehabilitation prior to discharge back into the community. A broad overview of neurorehabilitation is presented, including the standards for admission to inpatient rehabilitation and the members and roles of the neurorehabilitation team. Common medical complications that are managed after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury are reviewed. The spectrum of arousal issues is summarized. The evidence regarding neurorehabilitation is then reviewed. Future studies that are underway to better understand the utility of neurorehabilitation are then discussed.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a significant public health concern, and growing recognition in Australia led to the establishment of a specialist service for young children. The aim of the current study was to report on the diagnostic profile of a group of children who attended the service, to document the extent to which there were comorbid diagnoses and to provide information on the neurocognitive functioning of the children. Design and Methods. This study was a retrospective chart review conducted by the diagnostic service. A pre-formulated tool to extract the diagnostic data from the client files was designed, a chart review was performed, and the required data was extracted. FASD diagnoses were made using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. Results. Thirty-one families participated, and the majority of children were diagnosed with static encephalopathy (alcohol exposed) or neurobehavioral disorder (alcohol exposed) (11 children each; 36%). Only one child was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (alcohol exposed), and five children were diagnosed with partial fetal alcohol syndrome (alcohol exposed). Twenty-six children (84%) had a comorbid diagnosis, with 19 (61%) having a comorbid diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. While the majority of children were not found to display growth deficiency or significant facial features, 18 children (58%) had significant central nervous system dysfunction. Discussion and Conclusions. The current study demonstrates that with the relevant training and expertise, assessment and diagnosis of FASD can be embedded within the existing health services available in Australia.

AB  - Abstract Cognitive processing speed is crucial for human cognition and declines with aging. White matter hyperintensity (WMH), a common sign of WM vascular damage in the elderly, is closely related to slower psychomotor processing speed. In this study, we investigated the association between WMH and psychomotor speed changes through a comprehensive assessment of brain structural and functional features. Multi-modal MRIs were acquired from 60 elderly adults. Psychomotor processing speeds were assessed using the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A). Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between TMT-A and brain features, including WMH volumes in five cerebral regions, diffusivity parameters in the major WM tracts, regional gray matter volume, and brain activities across the whole brain. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to demonstrate the contribution of each index to slower psychomotor processing speed. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that WMH volume in the occipital lobe and fractional anisotropy of the forceps major, an occipital association tract, were associated with TMT-A. Besides, resting-state brain activities in the visual cortex connected to the forceps major were associated with TMT-A. Hierarchical regression showed fractional anisotropy of the forceps major and regional brain activities were significant predictors of TMT-A. The occurrence of WMH, combined with the disruption of passing-through fiber integrity and altered functional activities in areas connected by this fiber, are associated with a decline of psychomotor processing speed. While the causal relationship of this WMH-Tract-Function-Behavior link requires further investigation, this study enhances our understanding of these complex mechanisms.

AB  - SUMMARY With the advent of standard flow cytometric methods using two-colour fluorescence on samples of whole blood, it is possible to establish the ranges of CD3. CD 4 and CDS T lymphocyte subsets in the routine laboratory, and also to assist the definition of HIV-1-related deviations from these normal values. In 676 HIV-1-seronegative individuals the lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts were determined. The samples taken mostly in the morning. The groups included heterosexual controls, people with various clotting disorders but without lymphocyte abnormalities as well as seronegative homosexual men as the appropriate controls for the HIV-1-infected groups. The stability of CD4% and CD8% values was demonstrated throughout life, and in children CD4 values < 25% could be regarded as abnormal. The absolute counts of all T cell subsets decreased from birth until the age of 10 years. In adolescents and adults the absolute numbers (mean±s.d.) of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells were 1·90±0·55, 1·45±0·46, 0·83±0·29 and 0·56± 0·23 ± 109/l, respectively. In patients with haemophilia A and B the mean values did not differ significantly. In homosexual men higher CD8 levels were seen compared with heterosexual men and 27% had an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio but mostly without CD4 lymphopenia (CD4<0·4 ± 109/l). However, some healthy uninfected people were?physiologically? lymphopenic without having inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. When the variations?within persons? were studied longitudinally over a 5-year period, the absolute CD4 counts tended to be fixed at different levels. As a marked contrast, over 60% of asymptomatic HIV-1+ patients exhibited low CD4 counts <0·4 ± 109/l together with inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. Such combined changes among the heterosexual and HIV-1-seronegative homosexual groups were as rare as 1·4% and 3%, respectively. For this reason, when the lymphocyte tests show <0·4 ± 109/l CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than unity, the individuals need to be investigated further for chronicity of this disorder, the signs of viral infections such as HIV-1 and other causes of immunodeficiency.

AB  - Abstract ?? Background:?Non-setting calcium hydroxide (Ultracal XS?) is recommended by the International Association of Dental Traumatology as the initial medicament following avulsion and replantation for mature teeth. There is experimental evidence to suggest Ledermix?, placed as an alternative inter-visit dressing may improve periodontal healing. Aim:?This study investigated, using a multi-centre randomized controlled trial, the effect of two root canal medicaments, Ledermix? and Ultracal XS?, on periodontal healing of avulsed and replanted teeth. Material and methods:?Children were recruited if they fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Treatment followed a standardized protocol. Assessment of periodontal healing or ankylosis was made clinically and radiographically by an experienced, ?blinded?, clinician at 12?months. Results:?Over 200 patients were assessed for eligibility at five centres. Twenty-nine patients were eligible for inclusion. Final analysis involved 22 patients with 27 teeth. Ankylosis was detected in four of the 12 teeth in the Ledermix? group and nine of 15 in the Ultracal XS? group. No significant difference between medicaments was found in the proportion of teeth or patients showing periodontal healing. Discussion:?There was no significant difference in periodontal healing between the two medicaments at either a tooth or patient level. The numbers recruited fell short of an estimated power calculation. For patients meeting the inclusion criteria and completing the trial, periodontal healing was seen in 52% of teeth at the 12-month assessment between both groups. The only factor found to significantly influence the periodontal outcome was dry time.

AB  - The ultimate promise of diffusion MRI (dMRI) models is specificity to neuronal microstructure, which may lead to distinct clinical biomarkers using noninvasive imaging. While multi-compartment models are a common approach to interpret water diffusion in the brain in vivo, the estimation of their parameters from the dMRI signal remains an unresolved problem. Practically, even when q space is highly oversampled, nonlinear fit outputs suffer from heavy bias and poor precision. So far, this has been alleviated by fixing some of the model parameters to a priori values, for improved precision at the expense of accuracy. Here we use a representative two-compartment model to show that fitting fails to determine the five model parameters from over 60 measurement points. For the first time, we identify the reasons for this poor performance. The first reason is the existence of two local minima in the parameter space for the objective function of the fitting procedure. These minima correspond to qualitatively different sets of parameters, yet they both lie within biophysically plausible ranges. We show that, at realistic signal-to-noise ratio values, choosing between the two minima based on the associated objective function values is essentially impossible. Second, there is an ensemble of very low objective function values around each of these minima in the form of a pipe. The existence of such a direction in parameter space, along which the objective function profile is very flat, explains the bias and large uncertainty in parameter estimation, and the spurious parameter correlations: in the presence of noise, the minimum can be randomly displaced by a very large amount along each pipe. Our results suggest that the biophysical interpretation of dMRI model parameters crucially depends on establishing which of the minima is closer to the biophysical reality and the size of the uncertainty associated with each parameter.

AB  - Objective To combine and analyse the results from centres with a large experience of laparoscopy for the impalpable testis with small series, to determine the expected success rate for laparoscopic orchidopexy. Methods A questionnaire was distributed to participating paediatric urologists; each contributor retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts for their cases of therapeutic laparoscopy for an impalpable testis, detailing 36 variables for each patient. The data were collated centrally into a computerized database. For inclusion, the testis was intra-abdominal (including ?peeping? at the internal ring) at laparoscopic examination, was not managed through an open approach and did not undergo orchidectomy. Three surgical groups were assessed, with success defined as lack of atrophy and intrascrotal position: group 1, primary laparoscopic orchidopexy; group 2, a one-stage Fowler-Stephens (F-S) orchidopexy; and group 3, a two-stage F-S orchidopexy. Results Data were gathered from 10 centres in the USA, covering the period 1990?1999; 252 patients representing 310 testes were included and overall, 15.2% were lost to follow-up. There was no significant difference between success rates in the larger and smaller series. Atrophy occurred in 2.2% of 178 testes, 22.2% of 27 testes and 10.3% of 58 testes in groups 1?3, respectively. Testes were not in a satisfactory scrotal position in 0.6%, 7.4% and 1.7% of groups 1?3, respectively. The mean follow-up for each group was 7.7, 8.6 and 20.0?months, respectively. The overall success for all groups was 92.8% (97.2% group 1; 74.1% group 2; 87.9% group 3), with an atrophy rate of 6.1%. Conclusion Laparoscopic orchidopexy for the intra-abdominal testis, in both large and small series, can be expected to have a success rate higher than that historically ascribed to open orchidopexy. Within this series, single-stage F-S laparoscopic orchidopexy resulted in a significantly higher atrophy rate than the two-stage repair. However, when considering both F-S approaches, the laparoscopic approach gave greater success than previously reported for the same open approaches. Despite the weaknesses inherent in a retrospective unrandomized study, we conclude that laparoscopic orchidopexy is, if not the procedure of choice, an acceptable and successful approach to the impalpable undescended testicle.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed to determine the frequency of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on neuroimaging and the need for emergency neurosurgery in children with normal mental status following a post-traumatic seizure (PTS). Methods We searched six electronic databases from inception to October 15, 2018, to identify studies including children under 18 years with head injury and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 after an immediate PTS. Relevant non-English articles were translated to determine eligibility. Results We performed random effect meta-analyses and assessed heterogeneity with I2. The pooled estimate of the frequency of TBI, from seven studies, was 13.0% (95% CI: 4.0?26.1; I2 = 81%). Data on the need of emergency neurosurgery were reported in four studies and the pooled estimate of its frequency was 2.3% (95% CI: 0.0?9.9; I2 = 86%). Two studies reported on children with isolated PTS without any other signs of head injury, representing 0.1% of patients in both studies, for a total of 76 children. Of these, only three had TBI and one underwent neurosurgery. Conclusion Children with immediate PTS and normal mental status frequently have TBI with a substantial need for neurosurgery. Clinicians should strongly consider neuroimaging for these children, although prolonged observation may be considered for those with isolated PTS.

AB  - Families of gender nonconforming children need to negotiate the interactions between two gender systems: a rigid gender binary imported from familial, social, and cultural experiences and a fluid gender spectrum articulated by their child. This article reviews parental reactions to nonconforming gender developments and poses that the parental mandates of protection and acceptance are problematized by the difference of gender norms between the child and the family, as well as the child and the environment. Through multiple therapeutic modalities?parental coaching and education, parent support group, and child and family therapy?the author illustrates interventions supporting both parents and prepubescent children in their negotiation of safety, connection, and fluidity. Case vignettes illustrate the method in action.
