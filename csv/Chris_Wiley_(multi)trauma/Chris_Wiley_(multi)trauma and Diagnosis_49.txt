AB  - Families of gender nonconforming children need to negotiate the interactions between two gender systems: a rigid gender binary imported from familial, social, and cultural experiences and a fluid gender spectrum articulated by their child. This article reviews parental reactions to nonconforming gender developments and poses that the parental mandates of protection and acceptance are problematized by the difference of gender norms between the child and the family, as well as the child and the environment. Through multiple therapeutic modalities?parental coaching and education, parent support group, and child and family therapy?the author illustrates interventions supporting both parents and prepubescent children in their negotiation of safety, connection, and fluidity. Case vignettes illustrate the method in action.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common combat injury, often through explosive blast, and produces heterogeneous brain changes due to various mechanisms of injury. It is unclear whether the vulnerability of white matter differs between blast and impact injury, and the consequences of microstructural changes on neuropsychological function are poorly understood in military TBI patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques were used to assess the neurocircuitry in 37 US service members (29 mild, 7 moderate, 1 severe; 17 blast and 20 nonblast), who sustained a TBI while deployed, compared to 14 nondeployed, military controls. High-dimensional deformable registration of MRI diffusion tensor data was followed by fiber tracking and tract-specific analysis along with region-of-interest analysis. DTI results were examined in relation to post-concussion and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The most prominent white matter microstructural injury for both blast and nonblast patients was in the frontal fibers within the fronto-striatal (corona radiata, internal capsule) and fronto-limbic circuits (fornix, cingulum), the fronto-parieto-occipital association fibers, in brainstem fibers, and in callosal fibers. Subcortical superior-inferiorly oriented tracts were more vulnerable to blast injury than nonblast injury, while direct impact force had more detrimental effects on anterior-posteriorly oriented tracts, which tended to cause heterogeneous left and right hemispheric asymmetries of white matter connectivity. The tractography using diffusion anisotropy deficits revealed the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar-cortical (CSTCC) networks, where increased post-concussion and PTSD symptoms were associated with low fractional anisotropy in the major nodes of compromised CSTCC neurocircuitry, and the consequences on cognitive function were explored as well.

AB  - Objectives Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) is a known sequela of high-energy craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma and can result in stroke or death. The objective of this systematic review is to 1) identify CMF trauma patients who may benefit from BCVI screening and 2) describe the optimal diagnostic and treatment modalities. Study Design Systematic review of the literature (1946?2013). Methods An a priori study protocol was created using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. The authors conducted a search of Ovid/Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for articles related to BCVI and CMF fractures. All abstracts were reviewed, and data was extracted to determine the incidence of BCVI in the setting of CMF trauma. Individual fracture patterns were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. The overall incidence of CMF fracture-associated BCVI was 0.45%. The majority of patients (86.6%) sustained BCVI in the setting of high-energy trauma. The distribution of CMF fractures among BCVI patients was the mandible (12.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.8%). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was the most common diagnostic modality. A total of 63.1% of patients with BCVI were managed medically. The mortality among CMF patients with BCVI was 23.9%, and stroke rate was 47.1%. Conclusion Blunt cerebrovascular injury is a rare but devastating complication of blunt trauma. The recommended screening modality is CTA, and the most common treatment is antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication. Mandibular and LeFort fractures were the most common isolated CMF injury associated with BCVI, highlighting the need for prospective trials to expand current screening criteria.

AB  - We performed DNA analysis in four families with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). An interstitial deletion of the 17 p11.2 region was found in typically affected patients as well as in as yet asymptomatic patients. The opportunity for an individual genotyping permitted to ascertain a de novo deletion in one clinically affected case with no relevant familial history. DNA analysis thus becomes the most sensitive tool in diagnosing HNPP, since potentially affected patients may lack either informative familial history, or clinical symptoms or even suggestive EMG or histopathological data (tomaculas).

AB  - Abstract Background Metamemory is the process of monitoring and controlling one's memory. Improving metamemory may reduce the memory problem in old age. We hypothesized that metamemory training (MMT) would improve cognition in older adults with subjective memory complaints and change the brain region related to metacognition. Method We recruited and randomized older adults to the multi-strategic memory training of 10 weekly 90-min sessions, based on the metamemory concept or usual care. Cognitive tests including the Elderly Verbal Learning Test, Simple Rey Figure Test, Digit Span, Spatial Span, Categorical Fluency, and the Boston Naming Test were done in 201 participants, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 49 participants before and after training. Results A total of 112 in the training group and 89 in the control group participated. The training group had a significant increase in long-term delayed free recall, categorical fluency, and the Boston Naming test. In MRI, the mean diffusivity of the bundles of axon tracts passing from the frontal lobe to the posterior end of the lateral sulcus decreased in the training group. Conclusion These results indicate that the MMT program has a positive impact on enhancing older people? cognitive performance. Improved white matter integrity in the anterior and posterior cerebrum and increased cortical thickness of prefrontal regions, which related to metacognition, possibly suggest that the effects of the MMT would be induced via the enhancement of cognitive control.

AB  - Abstract A natural history study was conducted in 142 Thalassemic (Thal), 199 transfused Sickle Cell Disease (Tx-SCD, n = 199), and 64 non-Tx-SCD subjects to describe the frequency of iron-related morbidity and mortality. Subjects recruited from 31 centers in the US, Canada or the UK were similar with respect to age (overall: 25 ± 11 years, mean ± SD) and gender (52% female). We found that Tx-SCD subjects were hospitalized more frequently compared with Thal or non-Tx-SCD (P < 0.001). Among those hospitalized, Tx-SCD adult subjects were more likely to be unemployed compared with Thal (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0?2.5) or non-Tx-SCD (RR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.3?7.3). There was a positive relationship between the severity of iron overload, assessed by serum ferritin, and the frequency of hospitalizations (r= 0.20; P = 0.009). Twenty-three deaths were reported (6 Thal, 17 Tx-SCD) in 23.5 ± 10 months of follow-up. Within the Tx-SCD group, those who died began transfusion (25.3 vs. 12.4 years, P < 0.001) and chelation therapy later (26.8 vs. 14.2 years, P = 0.01) compared with those who survived. The unadjusted death rate in Thal was lower (2.2/100 person years) compared with that in Tx-SCD (7.0/100 person years; RR = 0.38: 95% CI 0.12?0.99). However, no difference was observed when age at death was considered. Despite improvements in therapy, death rate in this contemporary sample of transfused adult subjects with Thal or SCD is 3 times greater than the general US population. Long term follow-up of this unique cohort of subjects will be helpful in further defining the relationship of chronic, heavy iron overload to morbidity and mortality. Am. J.

AB  - Abstract Detecting the presence of injuries to the cervical spine is an important component of the initial assessment of patients sustaining blunt trauma. A small proportion of cervical spine injuries consists of ligamentous disruption. Accurate detection of ligamentous injury is essential as it may result in sequelae including radiculopathy, quadriplegia and death. Flexion?extension (FE) radiography has traditionally been utilised for the detection of ligamentous injury in patients who have been cleared of bony injury. There are controversies surrounding the use of FE for alert patients with neck pain. There are studies that call into question the diagnostic accuracy of FE, the high proportion of inadequate FE images due to muscle spasm and the adverse effects of prolonged cervical collar immobilisation while awaiting FE. Other literature indicates that FE provides no additional diagnostic information following a multi-detector helical computed tomography. This review evaluates the literature on the utility of FE for the detection of ligamentous injury and explores alternate strategies for clearing the cervical spine of ligamentous injury.

AB  - Abstract??? An evaluation of dental and maxillofacial trauma in a level 1 trauma center in Israel was carried out to assess the causes of trauma and the relationship between the injuries to the patient?s age, gender and ethnicity. Analysis was based on data from the Israel Trauma Registry. Patients hospitalized in a level 1 trauma center from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2005 were analyzed according to age, gender, time, place, ethnicity and cause of injury. Files of 22?558 trauma patients were reviewed. Maxillofacial and tooth injuries were separated and further analyzed according to the above parameters. Maxillofacial or dental injuries were observed in 1668 (7.4%) of the trauma patients, caused by motor vehicle accidents (39.2%), falls (30.9%), and intentional injuries (21.2%). Most occurred on the street/road (46.5%), at home (18.8%), and in public buildings (12.4%). Arab patients suffered more from vehicle accidents while Jewish patients presented more intentional injuries. Men were hospitalized three times more than women, and young people were at greater risk. The most frequent age of trauma was 19?28?years (27.6%). Ethnic differences were particularly noticeable for intentional injuries and vehicle accidents. This emphasizes that a larger percentage of the Arab population suffered from dental and maxillofacial injuries. Further dental health education and training for primary caregivers are warranted.

AB  - (Headache 2011;51:860-868) Migraine is a common, often disabling disorder associated with a significant personal and societal burden. The presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may increase this disability substantially. Migraine and PTSD are both up to 3 times more common in women than in men. The divergence in prevalence rates of migraine and PTSD that occurs between the sexes after puberty suggests that gonadal hormones play an important role. In addition, the preponderance of PTSD in women may be related to their higher rates of interpersonal trauma, the most common cause of PTSD. However, recent data suggest that although the odds of PTSD are increased in both women and men with episodic migraine, this association is stronger in men than women. In this paper, we examine the epidemiology of PTSD and migraine, with an emphasis on the known sex differences. We then discuss the neurobiological changes associated with PTSD, the current hypotheses for the mechanisms relating PTSD and migraine, and the treatment implications of these findings.

AB  - Abstract This paper outlines an approach to teaching invention and design that combines engineering, social sciences and humanities. We created an experimental course with a collaborative learning environment in which students from a wide range of majors worked in teams on modules, each of which lasted for several weeks and included strong written and oral components. Standard university curricula tend to compartmentalize engineering, humanities and social sciences. But real world engineering decisions defy such compartmentalization, as students discover when they take this course. Four active learning modules from the course are described in this paper: a hands-on project based on the invention of the telephone, a computer simulator to teach driving, an energy-efficient house and a medical decision support system based on a client's needs. A thorough evaluation of the course and modules is included, as are suggestions for future improvements.

AB  - Despite considerable research on secondary traumatization, the ramifications of veterans? and their wives? posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) for the family system remain largely uninvestigated. Beginning to fill this gap, the current study aims to investigate the reciprocal relations between both spouses? PTSS and marital adjustment, and the implications these bear for their parental functioning. Two hundred and twenty-five Israeli veterans (mean age = 58.62, SD = 7.6) from the 1973 Yom Kippur War and their wives (mean age = 58.28, SD = 5.79) were examined at two points in time: 30 (T1) and 35?37 years after the war (T2). Analysis included longitudinal actor?partner interdependence modeling and sequential mediation analyses. The results show that higher PTSS among the wives at T1 predicted higher PTSS among husbands at T2, and vice versa, and predicted their husbands? marital adjustment at T2. Moreover, wives? PTSS at T1 had a significant effect on parental overinvolvement of both parents at T2, but neither their PTSS nor their husbands? PTSS had an impact on positive parenting. In the intrapersonal domain, better marital adjustment at T1 predicted positive parenting among both spouses in subsequent measurement. Interpersonally, wives? lower marital adjustment at T1 predicted husbands? higher parental functioning, but not vice versa. Furthermore, marital adjustment mediated the association between PTSS and positive parenting for both spouses. The results emphasize the detrimental ramifications of war trauma on the interpersonal domains in veterans? families. Hence, both marital and parental consequences of trauma should be considered in clinical family interventions.

AB  - Abstract Aims To evaluate multi-frequency tactilometry as a method to measure vibrotactile sense in the sole of the foot in subjects with diabetes. Methods Vibration thresholds were investigated at five frequencies (8, 16, 32, 64 and 125 Hz) at three sites (first and fifth metatarsal heads and heel) in the sole of the foot in subjects with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (n = 37). Thresholds were compared with healthy, age- and gender-matched subjects (n = 37) and related to glycaemic levels, subjective estimation of sensation in the feet and to perception of touch. Results Vibration thresholds were significantly higher in subjects with diabetes compared with healthy subjects at low frequencies (8, 16 and 32 Hz) at all measured sites, and also at 64 Hz for the metatarsal heads. Perception of touch and subjective estimation of sensation were significantly impaired in subjects with diabetes. Glycaemic levels, which were higher in subjects with diabetes, did not correlate with vibration thresholds at 32 Hz (most sensitive to Meissner?s corpuscles) or with touch thresholds in subjects with diabetes. Vibration thresholds at 32 Hz correlated significantly with perception of touch (rho = 0.45?0.65; P < 0.01) and with subjective sensation (rho = ?0.38 to ?0.52; P < 0.001) in subjects with diabetes. Perception of touch and subjective estimation of sensation did also correlate (rho = ?0.51 to ?0.80; P < 0.002). Conclusions Tactilometry is effective in detecting neuropathy in the sole of the foot at low frequencies of mainly 8?32 Hz, indicating that at least Meissner's corpuscles, or their related large nerve fibres, are affected by diabetes.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice in the majority of liver injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in primary treatment and outcomes in a single Dutch Level 1 trauma centre with wide experience in angio-embolisation (AE). Methods:? The prospective trauma registry was retrospectively analysed for 7-year periods before (Period 1) and after (Period 2) the introduction of AE. The primary outcome was the failure rate of primary treatment defined as liver injury-related death or re-bleeding requiring radiologic or operative (re)interventions. Secondary outcomes were liver injury-related intra-abdominal complications. Results:? Despite an increase in high-grade liver injuries, the incidence of primary non-operative management more than doubled over the two periods, from 33% (20 of 61 cases) in Period 1 to 72% (84 of 116 cases) in Period 2 (P < 0.001). The failure rate of primary treatment in Period 1 was 18% (11/61), compared with 11% (13/116) in Period 2 (P= 0.21). Complication rates were 23% (14/61) and 16% (18/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.22). Liver-related mortality rates were 10% (6/61) and 3% (4/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.095). The increase in the frequency of non-operative management was even higher in high-grade injuries, in which outcomes were improved. In high-grade injuries in Periods 1 and 2, failure rates decreased from 45% (9/20) to 20% (11/55) (P= 0.041), liver-related mortality decreased from 30% (6/20) to 7% (4/55) (P= 0.019) and complication rates fell from 60% (12/20) to 27% (15/55) (P= 0.014). Liver infarction or necrosis and abscess formation seemed to occur more frequently with AE. Conclusions:? Overall, liver-related mortality, treatment failure and complication rates remained constant despite an increase in non-operative management. However, in high-grade injuries outcomes improved after the introduction of AE.

AB  - Abstract Accurate and timely identification of anaerobic bacteria is critical to successful treatment. Classic phenotypic methods for identification require long turnaround times and can exhibit poor species level identification. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is an identification method that can provide rapid identification of anaerobes. We present a multi-centre study assessing the clinical performance of the VITEK? MS in the identification of anaerobic bacteria. Five different test sites analysed a collection of 651 unique anaerobic isolates comprising 11 different genera. Multiple species were included for several of the genera. Briefly, anaerobic isolates were applied directly to a well of a target plate. Matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry. Mass spectra results were generated with the VITEK? MS, and the comparative spectral analysis and organism identification were determined using the VITEK? MS database 2.0. Results were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 651 isolates analysed, 91.2% (594/651) exhibited the correct species identification. An additional eight isolates were correctly identified to genus level, raising the rate of identification to 92.5%. Genus-level identification consisted of Actinomyces, Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces neuii and Bacteroides uniformis were notable for an increased percentage of no-identification results compared with the other anaerobes tested. VITEK? MS identification of clinically relevant anaerobes is highly accurate and represents a dramatic improvement over other phenotypic methods in accuracy and turnaround time.
