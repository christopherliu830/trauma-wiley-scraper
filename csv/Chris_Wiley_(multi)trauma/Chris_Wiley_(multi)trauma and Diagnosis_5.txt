AB  - Summary.? Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important medical problem because of the high fatality rate from PE and the large number of cases not diagnosed before causing death. Over the last decade, there has been considerable research into the diagnostic process. It is widely accepted that venous ultrasound imaging is an accurate test for the diagnosis of DVT and is the imaging test of choice. For PE, computer tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is replacing ventilation perfusion lung scanning. Technology for CTPA is rapidly evolving and multi-row detector scans have quite reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Despite the accuracy of imaging tests, the post-test probability of disease is highly dependent on pretest probability. Clinical evaluation tools have developed that enable us to accurately categorize patients? risk prior to diagnostic imaging. One advantage of this characterization is an ability to exclude the diagnosis of DVT or PE if clinical probability is sufficiently low and when the D-dimer is negative. There are now a number of D-dimer assays that have well-defined specificities and sensitivities, which enable use in conjunction with clinical probability. A careful combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer and imaging enables safe PE rule out protocols without imaging, an ability to suspect false positive imaging results, and more accurate determination of true positive imaging. These integration strategies result in safer, more convenient and cost-effective care for patients.

AB  - Clinicians are charged with being diligent in gaining competency in the latest trauma-informed interventions when working with relational trauma. This may invest therapists with an overresponsibility that is not only overwhelming and unrealistic, but serves to reduce autonomous functioning in family members. Therefore, clinicians need to become clear about what they are responsible for and what they are not, particularly when family members present as irresponsible or too anxious to think and act more effectively. Using a case vignette, this paper discusses how a clinician's focus on increasing their differentiation of self, a concept embeded in Bowen family systems theory, protects against vicarious traumatisation, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout whilst contributing to more autonomous functioning and better wellbeing outcomes for both clinicians and clients alike.

AB  - Abstract Scoring systems are used for mortality and morbidity rating in intensive care conditions, prognosis prediction, standardization of scientific data and the monitoring of clinical quality. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), APACHE IV and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) III prognostic scorings in the prediction of mortality and disease severity of patients admitted to the Anesthesia and Reanimation Clinic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Bak?rk√∂y Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital according to general and specific diagnoses. A total of 1896 patient files were included in the study. With the exception of single system or head trauma patient groups, a statistically significant difference was found in the mortality prediction rates in all other diagnosis groups (P?<?0.05). The discrimination calculated with AUROC fields was sufficient in all groups, and calibration was evaluated as good except for the neurological and neurosurgical patient group. In respect of standard mortality prediction, APACHE II and IV were good in cases of sepsis, and SAPS III made almost exact predictions for cardiovascular diseases, APACHE II for neurological diseases, and APACHE IV for gastrointestinal system diseases. From the results of this study, it was seen that different scoring systems vary in predictions according to the diagnoses, therefore, it can be recommended that the diagnosis should be taken into account more when applying scoring systems.

AB  - Abstract Juvenile and family courts hold a unique position among the many stakeholders that comprise a healing community for persons experiencing adversity or trauma. Specifically, judges and other court leaders can promote the implementation of screening for trauma, the alignment of appropriate and effective treatment for trauma when indicated, and the accountability of systems for coordination and support of such services. To that end, the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges undertook a field-based project ? consisting of multiple semi-structured court surveys ? to elucidate the key features of a trauma-informed court and how to assist courts in becoming more trauma-responsive for both consumers and staff. With the assistance of courts in 11 pilot sites across the nation, the project has led to the development of a protocol called trauma consultation or trauma audit, which is outlined here. Our work in developing the consultation protocol highlighted the need to better understand (1) the prevalence and impact of secondary traumatic stress in court staff, (2) the potential for environment to contribute to traumatic stress reactions, and (3) the importance of consistent trauma screenings and subsequent use of findings. Practical suggestions for courts to become more trauma-informed are also provided.

AB  - The first in this series of five papers concerns the evaluation and management of renal injuries. The authors of this paper come from four continents and seven countries, and they reviewed all papers on renal injury published between 1966 and April 2002. The results of the authors? deliberations are present here as a consensus document. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal evaluation and management of renal injuries by review of the world's English-language literature on the subject. METHODS A consensus conference convened by the World Health Organization and the Societ√© Internationale d?Urologie met to critically review reports of the diagnosis and treatment of renal trauma. The English-language literature about renal trauma was identified using Medline, and additional cited works not detected in the initial search obtained. Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of renal trauma were made with reference to a five-point scale. RESULTS There were many Level 3 and 4 citations, few Level 2, and one Level 1 which supported clinical practice patterns. Findings of nearly 200 reviewed citations are summarized. CONCLUSIONS Published reports on renal trauma still rely heavily on expert opinion and single-institution retrospective case series. Prospective trials of the most significant issues, when possible, might improve the quality of evidence that dictates the behaviour of practitioners.

AB  - Background Trauma remains the most frequent cause of death for patients under 35 years of age. Head injury and catastrophic haemorrhage account for the majority of early deaths. A trauma laparotomy is often necessary to arrest haemorrhage. Methods All patients who died in Queensland hospitals between 2011 and 2016 having had a trauma laparotomy were identified from the Queensland Audit of Surgical Mortality. Results About 69.0% of the 84 deaths were male with a median age of 47.6 years. About 64.3% of deaths occurred within the first 2 days following trauma. Mechanism of injury was typically road traffic accident (77.4%). Sixteen patients underwent a non-therapeutic laparotomy. Following peer-review, different management was recommended for only three patients. Conclusion This group of patients who died in the setting of a trauma laparotomy received high quality trauma care. Ongoing education is needed as some non-therapeutic laparotomies may be avoidable.

Aims To explore specialist intellectual disability practitioners perspectives on current health provision and developments to address trauma. Methods Twenty-five qualitative interviews were conducted with practitioners across 6 health service areas in the UK. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings Seven central themes emerged: (a) unmasked trauma; (b) trauma informed care; (c) person-centred care and support; (d) multi-disciplinary working; (e) reasonable adjustments; (f) barriers to treatment and (g) awareness, training and education. Conclusion Trauma-informed care and multi-disciplinary working are essential components for future service development. Advances in the evidence-base for effective psychological interventions for PTSD and training and education of health care staff are needed in order to improve service provision amongst this population.

This discussion paper reports development of a model to advance nursing science and practice in trauma care based on an analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Background.? The continuum of clinical care provided to trauma patients extends from the time of injury through to long-term recovery and final outcomes. Nurses bring a unique expertise to meet the complex physical and psychosocial needs of trauma patients and their families to influence outcomes across this entire continuum. Data sources.? Literature was obtained by searching CINAHL, PubMed and OvidMedline databases for 1990?2010. Search terms included trauma, nursing, scope of practice and role, with results restricted to those published in English. Manual searches of relevant journals and websites were undertaken. Discussion.? Core concepts in this trauma outcomes model include environment, person/family, structured care settings, long-term outcomes and nursing interventions. The relationships between each of these concepts extend across all phases of care. Intermediate outcomes are achieved in each phase of care and influence and have congruence with long-term outcomes. Implications for policy and practice.? This model is intended to provide a framework to assist trauma nurses and researchers to consider the injured person in the context of the social, economic, cultural and physical environment from which they come and the long-term goals that each person has during recovery. The entire model requires testing in research and assessment of its practical contribution to practice. Conclusion.? Planning and integrating care across the trauma continuum and recognition of the role of the injured person?s background, family and resources will lead to improved long-term outcomes.

AB  - Summary.? Introduction: Although the advent of multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) has enabled better visualization of subsegmental pulmonary (SSP) arteries, SSP embolism is of uncertain clinical significance. We aimed at answering the following questions: Is spiral CT an accurate method to detect SSP embolism? How are subsegmental perfusion defects managed in outcome studies including spiral CT? What are the main characteristics and outcomes of patients in whom CT detects isolated subsegmental defects? Methods: We performed a Medline search on July 1, 2004, using the keywords ?pulmonary embolism? and ?computed tomography?. We limited our search to English language prospective studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and to prospective outcome studies including CT in a diagnostic strategy, with at least a 3-month follow-up. Results: Fourteen studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and five prospective management studies using CT were retrieved. The sensitivity of single-detector CT for detecting subsegmental defects compared with pulmonary angiography was low (25%). The proportion of isolated SSP images was significantly higher in management studies using multi-detector CT (17 of 770 scans, 2.2%) compared with those using single-detector CT (22 of 2232, 1.0%; P?=?0.01). No straightforward attitude regarding anticoagulation therapy for isolated subsegmental defects emerged from the available literature. Finally, important clinical differences were found between patients having subsegmental and segmental or more proximal defects. Conclusions: These findings underline the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of SSP embolism, and the management of patients with such findings.

AB  - Abstract Paediatric abusive head injury may have grave consequences, especially when characterized by repetitive acceleration?deceleration forces (shaken baby syndrome). Death occurs in approximately 30% and permanent neurologic damage in up to 80% of the victims. Retinal haemorrhages are a cardinal sign seen in approximately 85% of cases. In most cases haemorrhages are preretinal, intraretinal and subretinal, too numerous to count, and involving the entire retinal surface extending to the ora serrata. Traumatic macular retinoschisis is a lesion with important diagnostic significance. Vitreoretinal traction appears to be the mechanism of haemorrhage and schisis formation along with a possible role of orbital tissue trauma from repetitive acceleration?deceleration forces. Ophthalmologists must carefully document ocular findings. Appropriate autopsy examination should include ocular and orbital tissue removal. Although there is a wide differential diagnosis for retinal haemorrhages, clinical appearance, when considered in the context of systemic and laboratory findings, usually leads to the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Summary Comorbidity of trauma and PTSD with addictive disorders is common in adolescents. The interrelationship between the two conditions is complex with addictive behaviors following the trauma, as well as preceding it. While there are established treatments for each of the conditions separately, few treatments addressing the comorbidity have been developed and tested. Little is known about the impact of the comorbid addictive disorders and trauma-related disorders on the adolescent developmental trajectory, the ability of the adolescents to acquire crucial psychosocial skills in the face of these twin disorders. In view of the adolescent tendency not to self-disclose, pro-active screening for trauma in the population of addicted adolescents, as well as screening for substance abuse in those who had experienced trauma, is highly indicated.

AB  - Objective:? To review the research addressing the relationship of childhood trauma to psychosis and schizophrenia, and to discuss the theoretical and clinical implications. Method:? Relevant studies and previous review papers were identified via computer literature searches. Results:? Symptoms considered indicative of psychosis and schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations, are at least as strongly related to childhood abuse and neglect as many other mental health problems. Recent large-scale general population studies indicate the relationship is a causal one, with a dose-effect. Conclusion:? Several psychological and biological mechanisms by which childhood trauma increases risk for psychosis merit attention. Integration of these different levels of analysis may stimulate a more genuinely integrated bio-psycho-social model of psychosis than currently prevails. Clinical implications include the need for staff training in asking about abuse and the need to offer appropriate psychosocial treatments to patients who have been abused or neglected as children. Prevention issues are also identified.

AB  - Summary Abdominal trauma is second only to head injury as a cause of serious injury in children, and the third most common cause of trauma-related death. The most common organs injured in blunt abdominal trauma are the spleen, liver and kidneys. When the spleen and liver are injured, intraperitoneal bleeding occurs (haemoperitoneum). In all suspected intra-abdominal injuries, the presence or absence of macroscopic blood in the urine must be established. The presence of macroscopic haematuria is strongly predictive of serious intra-abdominal injury and may form part of the basis for further investigation with a computerised tomography (CT) scan. Apart from those patients with intraperitoneal haemorrhage, extraperitoneal extravasation or haematuria, there is a difficult group with ill-defined symptoms and signs that may persist for several days after the injury. On the rare occasion of penetrating thoracic trauma, injuries to the mediastinal structures and lungs should be assumed until proven otherwise.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To examine the diagnostic yield differences between computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at The Alfred Hospital, Australia in order to justify patient management that results in all subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients receiving a 4 vessel cerebral angiogram as part of their investigations despite findings on CTA. Methods: The retrospective study of radiology reports in cases of acute non traumatic SAH in which both CTA and DSA had been performed was conducted in July 2006 to December 2008. Results: Sixty-three patients over two years were included in our study. Twenty (32%) of these patients had no aneurysm identified on CTA or DSA. A total of 68 aneurysms were found in 40 patients. Twelve (30%) of these patients had aneurysms that were only identified on DSA and not on CTA at the time of initial reporting. Three (5%) patients had false positive CTs. While our positive predictive value of CTA approached near 100%, the negative predictive value was found to be less than 70% with an overall diagnostic accuracy of our CTA reports to be 76%. Eighty one percent of the undiagnosed aneurysms on CTA were less than or equal to 3 mm in size. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the need for a CTA to be used in combination with a formal 4 vessel subtraction angiogram in every case presenting with a SAH despite the findings of the CTA.

AB  - Translations of summary This study deals with the individual and collective memory of Leningrad Siege survivors who experienced mass and prolonged wartime trauma during childhood (1941?44). While much has been published about the Siege, there has to date been no investigation by psychologists into the effects of extreme deprivation on Siege victims apart from one pilot study (Gulina et al., 2005). This study is still underway. Interviews with 80 participants (68 female and 12 male) are analysed and discussed here. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and content analysis are utilized. Unpublished archival writings by children caught in the Siege have been analysed. The principal method of interpretation is based on a psychoanalytic understanding of child development, mourning and the metabolizing of traumatic experience. The subjective meaning of the Siege experience to individual children is considered

AB  - Abstract Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a congenital gastrointestinal disorder, is one of the most common causes of neonatal bowel obstruction. Without an early screening and diagnosis, some patients develop serious complications, such as toxic megacolon or acute enterocolitis. We sought to identify specific serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that can serve as novel early, non-invasive screening signature and then to test their specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease. We obtained serum samples from 95 HSCR cases and 104 matched controls. An initial screening of miRNA expression was performed through TaqMan Low Density Array. The candidate miRNAs were validated by individual reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR arranged in the training and a two-stage validation set. Additional double-blind testing was performed in 23 patients with clinically suspected HSCR to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of the serum miRNA profile in predicting HSCR. Following a multi-stage evaluation approach, five miRNAs were significantly increased in HSCR cases compared with controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this five-serum miRNA signature were 0.895, 0.893 and 0.925 in training set and two validation sets, respectively. The accuracy rate of the five-miRNA profile as HSCR signature was 82.6%, which, in the double-blind testing set, was markedly higher than that of contrast enema (70%), the most commonly used test performed to diagnose HSCR. Our results indicate that a five-serum miRNA signature may be linked to HSCR, representing a potential, novel, non-invasive diagnostic approach for early screening of HSCR.
