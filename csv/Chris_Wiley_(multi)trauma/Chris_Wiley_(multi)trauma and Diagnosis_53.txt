AB  - Abstract There are accumulating data describing the association between diabetes and cancer mortality from Westernised populations. There are no data describing the relationship between diabetes and cancer mortality in African or South Asian populations from developing countries. We explored the relationship of abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes on cancer mortality risk in a large, multi-ethnic cohort from the developing nation of Mauritius. Population-based surveys were undertaken in 1987, 1992 and 1998. The 9559 participants comprised 66% of South Asian (Indian), 27% of African (Creole), and 7% of Chinese descent. Cox's proportional hazards model with time varying covariates was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk of cancer mortality, after adjustment for confounding factors. In men, but not women, cancer mortality risk increased with rising 2h-PG levels with HR for the top versus bottom quintile of 2.77 (95%CI: 1.28 to 5.98). South Asian men with known diabetes had a significantly greater risk of cancer mortality than those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) HR: 2.74 (95%CI: 1.00-7.56). Overall, impaired glucose tolerance was associated with an elevated risk of cancer mortality compared to NGT (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.98?2.19), though this was not significant. We have shown that the association between abnormal glucose tolerance and cancer extends to those of African and South Asian descent. These results highlight the importance of understanding this relationship in a global context to direct future health policy given the rapid increase in type 2 diabetes, especially in developing nations.

AB  - Important advances in understanding traumatic stress reactions in children and young people have been made in recent years. The aim of this review was to synthesise selected recent research findings, with a focus on their relevance to clinical practice. We therefore address: findings on the epidemiology of trauma exposure and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); recent changes to diagnostic classification; implications for screening and assessment of traumatic stress reactions; and treatment outcome studies including interventions for acute and chronic PTSD, dissemination of effective treatments into community settings, and early interventions. We conclude with recommendations for clinical practice and suggestions for future areas of research.

AB  - Abstract Diagnosing pulmonary embolus (PE) remains one of the great challenges of emergency medicine. The diagnosis relies on a balance of probabilities rather than any definitive test. The probability is based on history, examination and investigations. The principal investigations are chest X-ray, arterial blood gas, electrocardiograph, ventilation perfusion scan, ultrasound and angiography where necessary. Newer techniques such as CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging will become more useful as the technology improves. Transoesophoegeal echocardiography is an important investigative tool for massive PE. Thrombolysis is increasingly being used in the management of PE and the higher risk of adverse outcome should be balanced against the probability of false positive results and the use of invasive angiography.

AB  - Summary Up to 75% of pre-hospital trauma patients experience moderate to severe pain but this is often poorly recognised and treated with insufficient analgesia. Using multi-level logistic regression analysis, we aimed to identify the determinants of pre-hospital analgesia administration and choice of analgesic agent in a single helicopter-based emergency medical service, where available analgesic drugs were fentanyl and ketamine. Of the 1156 patients rescued for isolated limb injury, 657 (57%) received analgesia. Mean (SD) initial pain scores (as measured by a numeric rating scale) were 2.8 (1.8), 3.3 (1.6) and 7.4 (2.0) for patients who did not receive, declined, and received analgesia, respectively (p < 0.001). Fentanyl as a single agent, ketamine in combination with fentanyl and ketamine as a single agent were used in 533 (84%), 94 (14%) and 10 (2%) patients, respectively. A high initial on-scene pain score and a presumptive diagnosis of fracture were the main determinants of analgesia administration. Fentanyl was preferred for paediatric patients and ketamine was preferentially administered for severe pain by physicians who had more medical experience or had trained in anaesthesia.

AB  - Wounding of Norway spruce by inoculation with sterile agar, or agar containing the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica, induced traumatic resin duct formation in the stem. Visible anatomical responses occurred in the cambium 6?9 d post-inoculation. Near the inoculation site cellular proliferation, polyphenolic accumulation, and lignification were induced as a wound reaction to seal the damaged area. Five centimetres from the inoculation site cells in the cambial zone swelled and divided to form clusters. By 18 d post-inoculation, these cells began to differentiate into resin duct epithelial cells surrounding incipient schizogenous lumens. Mature axial traumatic ducts appeared by 36 d as a row of ducts in the xylem centripetal to the cambium. The ducts formed an interconnected network continuous with radial resin ducts. Parenchyma cells surrounding the ducts accumulated polyphenols that disappeared as the cells differentiated into tracheids. These polyphenols appeared to contain fewer sugar residues compared to those accumulating in the secondary phloem, as indicated by the periodic acid?Schiff's staining. The epithelial cells did not accumulate polyphenols but contained immunologically detectable phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.5), indicating synthesis of phenolics as a possible resin component. These findings may represent a defense mechanism in Norway spruce against the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica.

AB  - Abstract Background: We report a multi-institutional experience with intravascular stenting (IS) for treatment of coarctation of the aorta. Methods and Results: Data was collected retrospectively by review of medical records from 17 institutions. The data was broken down to prior to 2002 and after 2002 for further analysis. A total of 565 procedures were performed with a median age of 15 years (mean = 18.1 years). Successful reduction in the post stent gradient (<20 mm Hg) or increase in post stent coarctation to descending aorta (DAo) ratio of >0.8 was achieved in 97.9% of procedures. There was significant improvement (P < 0.01) in pre versus post stent coarctation dimensions (7.4 mm ¬± 3.0 mm vs. 14.3 ¬± 3.2mm), systolic gradient (31.6 mm Hg ¬± 16.0 mm Hg vs. 2.7 mm Hg ¬± 4.2 mm Hg) and ratio of the coarctation segment to the DAo (0.43 ¬± 0.17 vs. 0.85 ¬± 0.15). Acute complications were encountered in 81/565 (14.3%) procedures. There were two procedure related deaths. Aortic wall complications included: aneurysm formation (n = 6), intimal tears (n = 8), and dissections (n = 9). The risk of aortic dissection increased significantly in patients over the age of 40 years. Technical complications included stent migration (n = 28), and balloon rupture (n = 13). Peripheral vascular complications included cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) (n = 4), peripheral emboli (n = 1), and significant access arterial injury (n = 13). Older age was significantly associated with occurrence of CVAs. A significant decrease in the technical complication rate from 16.3% to 6.1% (P < 0.001) was observed in procedures performed after January 2002. Conclusions: Stent placement for coarctation of aorta is an effective treatment option, though it remains a technically challenging procedure. Technical and aortic complications have decreased over the past 3 years due to, in part, improvement in balloon and stent design. Improvement in our ability to assess aortic wall compliance is essential prior to placement of ISs in older patients with coarctation of the aorta. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the incidence of spinal fractures and their outcomes in the elderly who fall from low-levels in a suburban county. Design Retrospective county-wide trauma registry review from 2004 to 2013. Setting Suburban county with regionalized trauma care consisting of 11 hospitals. Participants Adult trauma patients aged ‚â•65 years who were admitted after falling from <3 feet. Measurements Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Results Spinal fractures occurred in 18% of 4,202 older adult patients admitted following trauma over this 10-year time period, in the following distribution: 43% cervical spine, 5.7% thoracic, 4.9% lumbar spine, 36% sacrococcygeal, and 9.6% multiple spinal regions. As compared to non-spinal fracture patients, more spinal fracture patients went to acute/subacute rehabilitation (47% vs 34%, P < .001) and fewer were discharged home (21% vs 35%, P < .001). In-hospital mortality rate in spinal and non-spinal fracture patients was similar (8.5% vs 9.3%, P = .5). Conclusion Low-level falls often resulted in a spinal fracture at a variety of levels. Vigilance in evaluation of the entire spine in this population is suggested.

AB  - Abstract A role for CD36 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammation and lipid metabolism has been well-documented. However, little is known about the role of CD36 in cerebral ischemia. The intent of this review is to develop the concept that CD36, whose functions have been implicated in other pathological events, is a prototypic inflammatory receptor that contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The importance of CD36 as a treatment target is indicated by the fact that many treatment strategies that are effective in experimental models of stroke exhibit little or no efficacy in clinical trials. The failure of clinical trials may be due to the use of animal models of stroke that do not reflect traditional risk factors for stroke in humans. The discussion will be focused on two risk factors, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, that modulate CD36 responses. Blocking the expression and function of CD36 by pharmacological or genetic means will provide insight not only toward identifying CD36 as a novel molecular target but also for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat stroke victims. More importantly, coupling clinically relevant conditions with CD36-mediated ischemic injury may provide an appropriate animal model paradigm and develop a scientific understanding that could lead to clinical translational studies involving human subjects.

AB  - Abstract Much of the extant literature addressing the psychosocial aspects of BRCA1/2 mutation testing and risk management aggregates mutation carriers of all ages in study recruitment, data analysis, and interpretation. This analytic strategy does not adequately address the needs of the youngest genetic testing consumers, i.e., women aged 18?25. Despite low absolute cancer risk estimates before age 30, BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women aged 18?25 feel vulnerable to a cancer diagnosis but find themselves in a management quandary because the clinical utility of screening and prevention options are not yet well defined for such young carriers. We present three cases, selected from a larger study of 32 BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women who completed or considered genetic testing before age 25, to demonstrate the unique developmental, relational and temporal influences, as well as the challenges, experienced by very young BRCA mutation-positive women as they complete genetic testing and initiate cancer risk management. The first case describes the maturation of a young woman whose family participated in a national cancer registry. The second addresses the experiences and expectations of a young woman who completed genetic testing after learning that her unaffected father was a mutation carrier. The third case highlights the experiences of a young woman parentally bereaved in childhood, who presented for genetic counseling and testing due to intense family pressure. Together, these cases suggest that BRCA1/2-positive women aged 18?25 are challenged to reconcile their burgeoning independence from their families with risk-related support needs. Loved ones acting in ways meant to care for these young women may inadvertently apply pressure, convoluting family support dynamics and autonomous decision-making. Ongoing support from competent healthcare professionals will enable these young women to remain informed and receive objective counsel about their risk-management decisions.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper describes a multi-national group of political asylum seekers, designated as ?heroes? because they seem to have chosen to resist, when instead they might simply have moved elsewhere. Inspection reveals that they are also chosen by their families to continue a tradition of resistance, which has existed across generations. Once it is their turn, they endure repeated incidents of torture at the hands of oppressors, until finally they are threatened with death. Then, unlike their predecessors, they change course entirely and flee. This action is accomplished with considerable help from their families. Unlike two other resister groups, who tended to remain in the resistor role until they reached victory or death, ?heroic? asylum seekers relinquish the thrill of the fight and take flight, seemingly because of a family mandate to do so, in order to move the family elsewhere. An attempt is made to understand the complex motivation behind these acts from a psychoanalytic perspective. What happens once they arrive here, however, is hard to predict. Brief follow-up data indicates that successful adjustment is not guaranteed and will depend on a set of strengths similar to those required of all immigrants. These include a solid early attachment history, past adult experiences which have been affirming, and considerable local group support. In addition, access to services for the survivors of torture can be useful, although referral to these is (shockingly) happenstance. Thus, despite the peaceful trend their arrival may represent, many forces must come together if its goal is to be achieved. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among people with substance use disorders, and the comorbidity is associated with negative outcomes. We report on a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of integrated cognitive?behavioral therapy (ICBT) plus standard care, individual addiction counseling plus standard care and standard care alone on substance use and PTSD symptoms. Design Three-group, multi-site randomized controlled trial. Setting Seven addiction treatment programs in Vermont and New Hampshire, USA. Participants/Cases Recruitment took place between December 2010 and January 2013. In this single-blind study, 221 participants were randomized to one of three conditions: ICBT plus standard care (SC) (n?=?73), individual addiction counseling (IAC) plus SC (n?=?75) or SC only (n?=?73). One hundred and seventy-two patients were assessed at 6-month follow-up (58 ICBT; 61 IAC; 53 SC). Intervention and comparators: ICBT is a manual-guided therapy focused on PTSD and substance use symptom reduction with three main components: patient education, mindful relaxation and flexible thinking. IAC is a manual-guided therapy focused exclusively on substance use and recovery with modules organized in a stage-based approach: treatment initiation, early abstinence, maintaining abstinence and recovery. SC are intensive out-patient program services that include 9?12 hours of face-to-face contact per week over 2?4 days of group and individual therapies plus medication management. Measurements Primary outcomes were PTSD severity and substance use severity at 6?months. Secondary outcomes were therapy retention. Findings PTSD symptoms reduced in all conditions with no difference between them. In analyses of covariance, ICBT produced more favorable outcomes on toxicology than IAC or SC [comparison with IAC, parameter estimate: 1.10; confidence interval (CI)?=?0.17?2.04; comparison with SC, parameter estimate: 1.13; CI?=?0.18?2.08] and had a greater reduction in reported drug use than SC (parameter estimate: ?9.92; CI?=??18.14?to??1.70). ICBT patients had better therapy continuation versus IAC (P<0.001). There were no unexpected or study-related adverse events. Conclusions Integrated cognitive behavioral therapy may improve drug-related outcomes in post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers with substance use disorder more than drug-focused counseling, but probably not by reducing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms to a greater extent.

AB  - Abstract Background Persons in the construction trades in the US have high rates of alcohol and substance abuse. We had the unique opportunity to evaluate health care utilization through private insurance and workers' compensation for a group of carpenters at high risk of injury and substance abuse. Methods We identified a cohort of union carpenters. Their claims for medical care through union insurance and workers' compensation, and appropriate measures of time at risk were documented. Using methods of indirect standardization, we compared utilization and costs between carpenters with and without alcohol and substance-abuse related diagnoses (ASRD). Results Through private insurance, those with ASRD had 10% higher outpatient utilization and 2.1 times higher rates of hospitalizations for injury care; 2.6 times higher rates of outpatient care; and 2.9 times higher inpatient admissions for non-injury care. Individuals with ASRD had only modestly increased rates (10%) of outpatient utilization through workers' compensation. Conclusions These findings support the need for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment services for this workforce. Operationalizing this among highly mobile workforces, such as the construction trades, is a challenge. While not intending to minimize the problems of alcohol or substance abuse on the job among carpenters, the focus of prevention should not necessarily be in the workplace. Am. J. Ind.

An interim analysis of data from 60 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel group, multi-centre clinical trial showed that dHACM (EpiFix?, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, GA) is superior to standard wound care (SWC) and BSS (Apligraf?, Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA) in achieving complete wound closure within 4?6 weeks. Rates and time to closure at a longer time interval and factors influencing outcomes remained unassessed; therefore, the study was continued in order to achieve at least 100 patients. With the larger cohort, we compare clinical outcomes at 12 weeks in 100 patients with chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers treated with weekly applications of Apligraf (n = 33), EpiFix (n = 32) or SWC (n = 35) with collagen-alginate dressing as controls. A Cox regression was performed to analyse the time to heal within 12 weeks, adjusting for all significant covariates. A Kaplan?Meier analysis was conducted to compare time-to-heal within 12 weeks for the three treatment groups. Clinical characteristics were well matched across study groups. The proportion of wounds achieving complete closure within the 12-week study period were 73% (24/33), 97% (31/32), and 51% (18/35) for Apligraf, EpiFix and SWC, respectively (adjusted P = 0¬∑00019). Subjects treated with EpiFix had a very significant higher probability of their wounds healing [hazard ratio (HR: 5¬∑66; adjusted P: 1¬∑3 x 10?7] compared to SWC alone. No difference in probability of healing was observed for the Apligraf and SWC groups. Patients treated with Apligraf were less likely to heal than those treated with EpiFix [HR: 0¬∑30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0¬∑17?0¬∑54; unadjusted P: 5¬∑8 x 10?5]. Increased wound size and presence of hypertension were significant factors that influenced healing. Mean time-to-heal within 12 weeks was 47¬∑9 days (95% CI: 38¬∑2?57¬∑7) with Apligraf, 23¬∑6 days (95% CI: 17¬∑0?30¬∑2) with EpiFix group and 57¬∑4 days (95%CI: 48¬∑2?66¬∑6) with the SWC alone group (adjusted P = 3¬∑2 x 10?7). Median number of grafts used per healed wound were six (range 1?13) and 2¬∑5 (range 1?12) for the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, respectively. Median graft cost was $8918 (range $1,486?19,323) per healed wound for the Apligraf group and $1,517 (range $434?25,710) per healed wound in the EpiFix group (P?<?0¬∑0001). These results provide further evidence of the clinical and resource utilisation superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic wounds.

AB  - Abstract Background: Efforts to develop and validate fully-structured diagnostic interviews of mental disorders in non-Western countries have been largely unsuccessful. However, the principled methods of translation, harmonization, and calibration that have been developed by cross-national survey methodologists have never before been used to guide such development efforts. The current report presents the results of a rigorous program of research using these methods designed to modify and validate the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for an epidemiological survey in Nepal. Methods: A five-step process of translation, harmonization, and calibration was used to modify the instrument. A blinded clinical reappraisal design was used to validate the instrument. Results: Preliminary interviews with local mental health expert led to a focus on major depressive episode, mania/hypomania, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder. After an iterative process of multiple translations-revisions guided by the principles developed by cross-national survey methodologists, lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses based on the final Nepali CIDI had excellent concordance with diagnoses based on blinded Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) clinical reappraisal interviews. Conclusions: Valid assessment of mental disorders can be achieved with fully-structured diagnostic interviews even in low-income non-Western settings with rigorous implementation of replicable developmental strategies.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current recommendations for the care of the seriously injured polytraumatized small animal patient, including team organization and facility readiness; scene assessment and care; transport; and hospital assessment and care. Data sources: Original research articles, scientific reviews, book chapters, and clinical experience. Human data synthesis: The care of the seriously injured patient is demanding and requires adequate preparation, rapid access to organized resources and equipment, and skilled personnel. Second in urgency only to stabilization of the airway and breathing is shock. In many, surgical intervention to provide improved and continued stability is required. Evidence is provided by data published comparing survival for humans with high injury scores being cared for at level I trauma centers compared with small rural hospitals. Personal experience as a member of an emergency medical team in the care of multiple injured human patients in both level I trauma centers and small hospitals is also used in this review. Veterinary data synthesis: Publications reporting large clinical series of seriously injured dogs and cats are minimal. Experimental animal models of shock caused by blood loss and the study of various organ injuries and their management are numerous. These and 35 years of the author's experience in managing severely injured dogs and cats (estimated to be >750) is also used in this review for generation of guidelines. Conclusions: Guidelines for care of severe multiple injury patients are presented and are recommended to be used in clinical veterinary medical practice to improve outcome.
