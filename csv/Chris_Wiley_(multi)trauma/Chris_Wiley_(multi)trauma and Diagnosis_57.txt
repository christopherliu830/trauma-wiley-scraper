AB  - Summary As more patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are surviving, despite severe immune suppression, clinicians are faced with atypical manifestations of both common and uncommon dermatoses. A 30-year-old black South African woman presented with a 10-month history of multiple chronic ulcers appearing on a multidermatomal herpes zoster (HZ) scar. The woman was infected with HIV, and her CD4 count was 45 cells/?L. Histology and PCR revealed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This case highlights an unusual presentation of cutaneous CMV occurring as an isotopic immune response on a pre-existing multidermatomal HZ scar.

AB  - A team of therapists from Minnesota and New York workied with labor union families of workers gone missing on September 11, 2001, after the attack on the World Trade Center, where they were employed. The clinical team shares what they did, what was learned, the questions raised, and preliminary evaulations about the multiple family meeting that were the major intervention. Because of the vast diversity, training of therapists and interventions for families aimed for cultural competence. The community-based approach, preferred by union families, plus family therapy using the lens of ambiguous loss are proposed as necessary additions to disaster work.

AB  - Abstract Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) and PCL-R psychopathy are critically examined regarding their application to sentencing determinations. PCL-R psychopathy is emerging in the literature as a more useful forensic diagnostic construct than APD, which appears flawed by multiple weaknesses. These include shifting diagnostic criteria, innumeracy problems, absence of symptom weighting, temporal instability, and the equivalence of some symptoms with substance abuse disorders. Additionally, APD overdiagnosis may result from inattention to issues of social context, trauma history, and symptom pervasiveness. Neither objective nor projective personality testing reliably differentiates APD. Finally, an APD diagnosis does not always indicate criminal, much less incorrigible criminal behavior. By contrast, PCL-R psychopathy results are strongly predictive of criminal behavior and violent recidivism for Caucasian males through mid-life residing in the community. Emerging research with the PCL-R regarding other important populations and contexts is promising but generalization is currently limited. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background The ability to drive is a core function supporting independent living. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may impair driving capacity in numerous ways. Previous research has documented that individuals with TBI have more driving-related problems than other people and has identified predictors of driving status or capacity, mostly among civilians; however, no research has examined the implications of driving limitations for the well-being of individuals with TBI. Objective To examine the association between self-reported difficulty in driving with important domains of psychological well-being in veterans with TBI, with adjustment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and years since most recent TBI. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Veterans' homes. Participants A total of 61 veterans of the Global Wars on Terrorism diagnosed with TBI, all outpatients at a Veterans Affairs medical center rehabilitation service. Methods Home interviews as a baseline assessment for a larger randomized controlled trial. Main Outcome Measures Community reintegration (extent of social participation), depressive symptomatology, and role limitations due to physical health problems and those due to emotional problems. Self-rated competence in driving was the predictor, and sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis of PTSD, severity of TBI, and time since most recent TBI were covariates. Results Self-rated driving difficulty was associated with decreased community reintegration (? = .280, P =.028), greater depressive symptomatology (? = ?.402, P < .001), and greater role limitations due to physical problems (? = ?.312, P =.011) and to emotional problems (? = ?.324, P = .006), after we adjusted for PTSD and other variables. Discussion The self-reported ability to drive seems to be central to psychological well-being in veterans with TBI, showing clear associations with depression, community reintegration, and health-related role limitations. These associations cannot be attributed to comorbid PTSD. Conclusion Rehabilitation specialists should view driving difficulty as a risk factor for poor psychosocial outcomes in veterans with TBI and seek ways to compensate for the veteran's loss of driving if it is no longer advisable.

AB  - Severe Traumatic brain injury (sTBI) often instigates widespread long-lasting disability and is accompanied by extensive rehabilitation. Unsurprisingly, sTBI also holds malignant consequences for patients? close relatives. The burden caused by the injury and its severity explains some of the ramifications for the relatives. Additionally, some findings demonstrate that patients with sTBI and their relatives develop posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, although the link between PTS symptoms and physical and mental health is well-documented in literature, the effect of PTS symptoms on relatives of patients with sTBI has barely been examined. This study examines the influence of PTS symptoms of patients with sTBI and their relatives on the physical and mental health and functioning of the relatives. Patients who sustained a severe sTBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale of the head region > 3) and close relatives were included in a multi-center, prospective cohort study (TRAST-MI). One-hundred patients and their relatives were assessed at 2, 6, and 12 months post injury. Outcome variables included health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as emotional, cognitive, interpersonal, and total functioning (PCRS). Relatives? physical health was predicted by relatives? PTS symptoms (Slope=?1.76; p = .043), and mental health was predicted by both patients? (Slope=?2.77; p = .034) and relatives? (Slope=?6.59; p < .001) PTS symptoms. Functioning level was only predicted by patients? PTS symptoms (Slope=?.25; p<.001). The findings emphasize that TBI should be considered a comprehensive traumatic experience reaching further than mere physical damage to the brain and its direct consequences, affecting the injured individual and close relatives.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of primary coronal caries should be seen as a complex process, comprising both detection and measurement phases, which enables clinicians, researchers and epidemiologists to make informed decisions about the management and prognosis of the disease process. The different diagnostic thresholds employed for measurements of caries experience can be viewed as an iceberg, a metaphor which demonstrates the ambiguity of the term ?caries free? and which can also represent the differing management options appropriate for the care of different types of active and inactive lesions: NAC (No Active Care), PCA (Preventive Care Advised) and OCA (Operative Care Advised). There are considerable methodological difficulties in drawing valid comparisons between studies using incompatible criteria and simulations. However, it is apparent that no caries diagnostic tool in current clinical use fulfils all of the ideal criteria for measurements needed to plan and monitor appropriate care. Systems providing reliable serial measurements with which to assess future caries risk and present caries activity are urgently required, as diagnostic tasks are becoming both more difficult and more important from the standpoint of long-term oral health. Existing diagnostic tools frequently rely on subjective judgements and provide only semi-quantitative measures insensitive to smaller lesions. In the future tools are needed which are objective, quantitative and which can provide acceptable compromises between sensitivity and specificity for a wide range of applications for individual patient care as well as for research and survey use. Key problem areas with existing tools include confusion in terminology and between caries assessments made by clinicians and epidemiologists as well as the lack of valid measurements relating to the activity of primary root caries and secondary caries. Deficiencies with current tools impact on the care of individuals by allowing false negative diagnoses of hidden occlusal dentine lesions and approximal cavities on the one hand, whilst generating some false positive diagnoses on sound surfaces leading to inappropriate decisions to restore on the other. At the population level, current conventional tools significantly underestimate overall caries experience. In future the adoption of more accurate and reliable methods would facilitate more effective preventive care and promote more appropriate restorative treatment decisions. Research in this area should focus for the next five years on diagnostic technologies which: 1) inform valid prospective caries risk assessments for different age groups, 2) can help to determine present caries activity and monitor lesion behaviour over time and 3) help identify methods which can implement existing and new research knowledge about diagnostic tools into clinical and research practice.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Ultrasonography is associated with a high error rate in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. The purposes of this study were to examine the nature of the diagnostic errors and to identify areas in which reporting could be improved. Methods Patients who had soft tissue tumours and received ultrasonography during a 10-year period (1999?2009) were identified from a local tumour registry. The sonographic and pathological diagnoses were categorised as either ?benign? or ?non-benign?. The accuracy of ultrasonography was assessed by correlating the sonographic with the pathological diagnostic categories. Recommendations from radiologists, where offered, were assessed for their appropriateness in the context of the pathological diagnosis. Results One hundred seventy-five patients received ultrasonography, of which 60 had ?non-benign? lesions and 115 had ?benign? lesions. Ultrasonography correctly diagnosed 35 and incorrectly diagnosed seven of the 60 ?non-benign? cases, and did not suggest a diagnosis in 18 cases. Most of the diagnostic errors related to misdiagnosing soft tissue tumours as haematomas (four out of seven). Recommendations for further management were offered by the radiologists in 144 cases, of which 52 had ?non-benign? pathology. There were eight ?non-benign? cases where no recommendation was offered, and the sonographic diagnosis was either incorrect or unavailable. Conclusions Ultrasonography lacks accuracy in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. Ongoing education is required to improve awareness of the limitations with its use. These limitations should be highlighted to the referrers, especially those who do not have specific training in this area.

AB  - Background The prognostic value of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in dogs after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear. Objectives Determine whether MRI findings are associated with prognosis after TBI in dogs. Animals Fifty client-owned dogs. Methods Retrospective study of dogs with TBI that underwent 1.5T MRI within 14 days after head trauma. MRI evaluators were blinded to the clinical presentation, and all images were scored based on an MRI grading system (Grade I [normal brain parenchyma] to Grade VI [bilateral lesions affecting the brainstem with or without any lesions of lesser grade]). Skull fractures, percentage of intraparenchymal lesions, degree of midline shift, and type of brain herniation were evaluated. MGCS was assessed at presentation. The presence of seizures was recorded. Outcome was assessed at 48 h (alive or dead) and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results Sixty-six percent of the dogs had abnormal MRI findings. MRI grade was negatively correlated (P < .001) with MGCS. A significant negative correlation of MRI grade, degree of midline shift, and percentage of intraparenchymal lesions with follow-up scores was identified. The MGCS was lower in dogs with brain herniation (P = .0191). Follow-up scores were significantly lower in dogs that had brain herniation or skull fractures. The possibility of having seizures was associated with higher percentage of intraparenchymal lesions (P = 0.0054) and 10% developed PTE. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Significant associations exist between MRI findings and prognosis in dogs with TBI. MRI can help to predict prognosis in dogs with TBI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? To evaluate the relevance of a form of diagnostic classification called clinical subtyping in relation to possible revisions in the diagnostic criteria for substance abuse and dependence in psychiatric classification systems. Methods? A general rationale for subtyping is presented. To explore the implications for diagnostic classification, recent research on a variety of subtyping schemes is reviewed in terms of the development of new subtypes and the validation of established theories. Results? Subtypes of alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders have been proposed since the beginning of modern psychiatry. Recent subtyping research suggests that no consensus has emerged about the nature, much less the number, of subtypes that could be used to characterize the clinical heterogeneity assumed to be present in groups of people with substance use disorders. Although several relatively simple binary typologies have been developed (e.g. Cloninger?s type I and type II; Babor et al.?s type A and type B), validation research has produced mixed results in terms of the construct, concurrent and predictive validity of these classifications. Conclusions? The adoption of a subtyping scheme in the major psychiatric classification systems is not recommended until further international research is conducted.

AB  - Abstract Introduction In 2018, ARPANSA published updated national DRLs for adult CT, which were first published in 2012, and augmented the national DRL categories. This paper presents the updated national DRLs and describes the process by which they were produced. Methods Examine patient survey data submitted to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) National Diagnostic Reference Level Service (NDRLS). Determine the quartiles of the distributions of median survey dose metrics with categorisation by procedure type. Engage a liaison panel representing the radiology professions to review procedure categories and recommend revised national DRLs. The revised NDRL procedure categories are: head (non-contrast brain (trauma/headache)), cervical spine (Non-contrast (trauma)), soft-tissue neck (post-contrast (oncology)), chest (post-contrast (oncology)), abdomen?pelvis (post-contrast (oncology)), kidney?ureter?bladder (non-contrast (suspected renal colic)), chest?abdomen?pelvis (post-contrast (oncology)) and lumbar spine (non-contrast (degenerative pain)). Results The existing six procedure categories were revised and refined. Updated Australian national diagnostic reference levels for adult CT were recommended and endorsed for eight procedure categories: head (52 mGy/880 mGycm), cervical spine (23 mGy/470 mGycm),soft-tissue neck (17 mGy/450 mGycm), chest (10 mGy/390 mGycm), abdomen?pelvis (13 mGy/600 mGycm), kidney?ureter?bladder (13 mGy/600 mGycm), chest?abdomen?pelvis (11 mGy/940 mGycm) and lumbar spine (26 mGy/670 mGycm). The updated national DRLs are between 12 and 26% lower than the previous DRLs for dose-length product and between 13 and 63% lower for volume computed tomography dose index. Conclusions Australian national DRLs for adult CT have been reviewed and revised. The revised national DRLs are lower, better reflecting current practice among imaging facilities in Australia. The revised Australian national DRLs are similar to those in other developed countries.

AB  - Background:? Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infancy is relatively common, and is likely to lead to poorer outcomes than injuries sustained later in childhood. While the headlines have been grabbed by infant TBI caused by abuse, often known as shaken baby syndrome, the evidence base for how to support children following TBI in infancy is thin. These children are likely to benefit from ongoing assessment and intervention, because brain injuries sustained in the first year of life can influence development in different ways over many years. Methods:? A literature search was conducted and drawn together into a review aimed at informing practitioners working with children who had a brain injury in infancy. As there are so few evidence-based studies specifically looking at children who have sustained a TBI in infancy, ideas are drawn from a range of studies, including different age ranges and difficulties other than traumatic brain injury. Results:? This paper outlines the issues around measuring outcomes for children following TBI in the first year of life. An explanation of outcomes which are more likely for children following TBI in infancy is provided, in the areas of mortality; convulsions; endocrine problems; sensory and motor skills; cognitive processing; language; academic attainments; executive functions; and psychosocial difficulties. The key factors influencing these outcomes are then set out, including severity of injury; pre-morbid situation; genetics; family factors and interventions. Conclusions:? Practitioners need to take a long-term, developmental view when assessing, understanding and supporting children who have sustained a TBI in their first year of life. The literature suggests some interventions which may be useful in prevention, acute care and longer-term rehabilitation, and further research is needed to assess their effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract This article overviews recent advances in biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. Novel biosensors digitally processing multiple biomarker signals produce a final output in the form of YES/NO response through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular systems. The biocomputing approach applied to biosensors leads to high-fidelity biosensing compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices. By processing complex patterns of multiple physiological biomarkers, such multi-signal digital biosensors should have a profound impact on the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and particularly can provide timely detection and alert of medical emergencies (along with immediate therapeutic intervention). The novel biosensing concept has been exemplified with the systems for logic analysis of various injuries, including soft tissue injury, traumatic brain injury, liver injury, abdominal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and oxidative stress.

AB  - Although cognitive impairment in later life is often due to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease, precise diagnosis may sometimes be difficult, particularly in the context of multi-morbidities. In addition, although the genetic aetiology of neurological diseases is increasingly defined, the full spectrum of clinical features associated with particular genetic mutations may be uncertain. Here the authors present a case that illustrates some of these problems, and in which neurological signs may have been a clue to the underlying cognitive diagnosis.

AB  - ?Thinking a lot? (TAL)?also referred to as ?thinking too much??is a key complaint in many cultural contexts, and the current article profiles this idiom of distress among Cambodian refugees. The article also proposes a general model of how TAL generates various types of distress that then cause PTSD-type psychopathology, a model we refer to as the TAL?PTSD model. As tested in this Cambodian refugee sample, the model is supported by the following: (1) the close connection of TAL to PTSD as shown by odds ratio (OR = 19.6), correlation (r = .86), and factor loading; and (2) the mediation of most of the effect of TAL on PTSD by TAL-caused somatic symptoms, catastrophic cognitions, trauma recall, insomnia, and irritability. The questionnaire used in the present study is provided and can be used to examine TAL in other cultural and global contexts to advance the study of this commonly encountered distress form.

Small animal imaging modalities include fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either lateral fluid percussion (LFP) or controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI with mild or moderate severity. Baseline FDG-PET and MRI scans were conducted prior to injury and at various times post-TBI. FDG-PET/CT images were acquired on a Siemens Inveon Multimodality scanner based on IV injection of 37 ? 74 MBq (1 ? 2 mCi) of FDG. Diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopic images along with susceptibility and T1/T2-weighted images were acquired on a Bruker Biospec 7T/20 cm magnet running Paravision 5.1. Results: For translatable FDG-PET imaging, a tail vein injection of FDG with 45 minutes of anesthetized uptake and 30 minutes of scanning was optimal. With the brain centered in the field of view, uptakes (ipsilateral and contralateral) were normalized by cerebellar uptake since blood sampling was not conducted. The 2-hour MRI protocol included fast spin echo (100 um), 3D multi-echo gradient echo susceptibility (100 um), 4-shot EPI-based continuous arterial spin labeling (152 um), 8-shot EPI-based with three direction diffusion (100 um), and single voxel PRESS spectroscopy(3 mm) Conclusions: The impact of TBI on military service members is significant with more than 5,500 soldiers diagnosed with TBIs. Early diagnosis and development of an effective treatment for veterans with TBI is a priority for the military. A multimodal and multi-parameter imaging protocol for experimental TBI that is both translatable and efficient (high throughput) is pivotal for studying neuroprotection, regeneration, and plasticity. An optimized small animal imaging protocol was developed to investigate longitudinal changes in glucose utilization (FDG-PET/CT), cortical volume, diffuse axonal injury, perfusion, and metabolite concentration (MRI).

AB  - Abstract One hundred and six consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer were studied before and after surgery with a clinical psychiatric interview and questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale, General Health Questionnaire and Clinical Global Impression scale). The traumatic stress response after six weeks was related to sociodemographic factors, premorbid health problems, negative life events and clinical-oncological parameters. Symptoms of traumatic distress were significantly reduced post-surgery compared to acutely, and most so among patients with no premorbid health problems and negative life events according to pre-surgery interview and self-report data. Eighteen percent of the patients reported a high level (>19) of intrusive symptoms and 14%, avoidance symptoms. Patients with premorbid impairment in work, family and social functioning and patients who during the last year had experienced the death of a close relative or a serious illness other than cancer showed the greatest distress. Previous consultations for nervous problems, age, marital status, stage of disease, type of surgery (breast-conserving versus mastectomy) and adjuvant cytostatic treatment did not influence the traumaticstress response six weeks after surgery. The level of acute posttraumatic stress response to breast cancer surgery seems best predicted by premorbid variables.

AB  - Abstract Using a quasi-experimental design, this study examined the effectiveness of a standardized intervention model designed to build resiliency in children of women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders and histories of interpersonal abuse. The children and mothers who participated in this study were a subset of the sample used for the Women, Co-occurring Disorders and Violence Study (WCDVS). The children's intervention model consisted of three components: clinical assessment, service coordination and advocacy, and a psychoeducational skills-building group. Children in the comparison group received individual, group, and family services. Six-month and 12-month outcomes were examined among 253 children. Children in the intervention group improved significantly more than children in the comparison group. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comm Psychol 35: 823?843, 2007.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Positive peritoneal cytology equates M1 disease in patients with gastric cancer. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is a proven test to detect occult visceral injury in trauma patients. The objective of this study is to determine whether DPL can be used to assess peritoneal cytology in patients with gastric cancer. Methods Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were prospectively enrolled to undergo DPL prior to diagnostic laparoscopy (DL). Saline was instilled through a percutaneous catheter and fluid was collected for cytology (DPL-cyt). Washings obtained during DL were used as controls (DL-cyt). Results DPL was successful in 22/27 patients (81.5%). Among the 22 successful DPLs, 12 had positive cytology (54.5%). Positive DPL-cyt specimens matched DL-cyt specimens in 12/12 cases (specificity?=?100%). One of 10 cases with negative DPL-cyt was positive on the final DL-cyt (sensitivity?=?92%). There were six patients with negative DPL-cyt who had visible M1 disease diagnosed with DL (DPL evaluation of M1 disease, sensitivity 54.5%, specificity?=?100%). Conclusions DPL is a safe method of detecting positive cytology in patients with gastric cancer, however gross M1 disease may be missed without visual inspection. The specific role of DPL in the staging workup of patients with gastric cancer remains to be determined. J. Surg. Oncol. 2013;107:794?798. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
