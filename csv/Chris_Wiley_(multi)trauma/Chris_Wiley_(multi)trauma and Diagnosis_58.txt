AB  - Summary Sleep disturbances are a hallmark feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have examined sleep quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), a technique able to detect subtle differences that polysomnography does not capture. We hypothesized that greater high-frequency qEEG would reflect ?hyperarousal? in combat veterans with PTSD (n?=?16) compared to veterans without PTSD (n?=?13). EEG power in traditional EEG frequency bands was computed for artifact-free sleep epochs across an entire night. Correlations were performed between qEEG and ratings of PTSD symptoms and combat exposure. The groups did not differ significantly in whole-night qEEG measures for either rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep. Non-significant medium effect sizes suggest less REM beta (opposite to our hypothesis), less REM and NREM sigma and more NREM gamma in combat veterans with PTSD. Positive correlations were found between combat exposure and NREM beta (PTSD group only), and REM and NREM sigma (non-PTSD group only). Results did not support global hyperarousal in PTSD as indexed by increased beta qEEG activity. The correlation of sigma activity with combat exposure in those without PTSD and the non-significant trend towards less sigma activity during both REM and NREM sleep in combat veterans with PTSD suggests that differential information processing during sleep may characterize combat-exposed military veterans with and without PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Objective While emergency medicine (EM) physicians treat the majority of pediatric EM (PEM) patients in the United States, little is known about their PEM experience during training. The primary objective was to characterize the pediatric case exposure and compare to established EM residency training curricula among EM residents across five U.S. residency programs. Methods We performed a multicenter medical record review of all pediatric patients (aged < 18 years) seen by the 2015 graduating resident physicians at five U.S. EM training programs. Resident-level counts of pediatric patients were measured and specific counts were classified by the 2016 Model of Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine (MCP) and Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) diagnostic categories. We assessed variability between residents and between programs. Results A total of 36,845 children were managed by 68 residents across all programs. The median age was 6 years. The median number of patients per resident was 660 with an interquartile range of 336. The most common PECARN diagnostic categories were trauma, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disease. Thirty-two core MCP diagnoses (43% of MCP list) were not seen by at least 50% of the residents. We found statistically significant variability between programs in both PECARN diagnostic categories (p < 0.01) and MCP diagnoses (p < 0.01). Conclusion There is considerable variation in the number of pediatric patients and the diagnostic case volume seen by EM residents. The relationship between this case variability and competence upon graduation is unknown; further investigation is warranted to better inform program-specific curricula and to guide training requirements in EM.

AB  - Objectives: The diagnostic utility of routine faecal examinations can be greatly enhanced through an appreciation of risk factors most commonly associated with endoparasitism. Methods: From a sample of 6578 canine patients presenting to a veterinary teaching hospital between 1996 and 2006, this study used univariate and multi-variable techniques to examine putative signalment, medical history and demographic factors predisposing dogs to intestinal parasites. Results: Age and median household income were the strongest predictors of endoparasitism. The odds of a patient being diagnosed with endoparasites were 0·82 times smaller for every 1 year increase in age (OR=0·82, 95% CI: 0·80 to 0·84) and for every $10,000 increase in median household income, the odds were 0·86 times lower (OR=0·86, 95% CI: 0·83 to 0·89). The variables gender, neuter status, month of diagnosis, admitting clinical service and primary diagnosis were not significant predictors. Animals that were presented for underlying medical conditions were less likely to have parasites and the presence of diarrhoea was associated with 76% lower odds of endoparasitism compared to healthy animals (OR=0·76, 95% CI: 0·64 to 0·90). Clinical Significance: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for parasites in younger patients that live in high population density and low income neighbourhoods.

To describe stigma experiences of adolescents with congenital and acquired facial differences. Design??? Used baseline cross-sectional stigma-related responses from a four site (Seattle WA, Galveston TX, Chicago IL and Chapel Hill NC) US study enrolling 185 English speaking, US participants ages 11?18?years old with facial differences (60% male; 80% congenital conditions). Closed-ended, self-administered questions drawn from the Youth Quality of Life Instrument ? Facial Differences Module (YQOL-FD) determined perceptions of stigmatization. Mothers (n?=?153) were independently asked seven matching questions. Results??? Frequencies report combined responses of ?sometimes,??fairly often,? and ?very often.? Mother's responses are in parentheses. ?? 35% (47%) noticed people staring at their face in the past week. ?? 28% (43%) talked with others about how their face looks in the past month. ?? 29% (31%) heard others say something about their face in the past month. ?? 32% (32%) told peers about their facial difference in the past month. ?? 12% (12%) felt left out of doing things with peers because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 11% (8%) got into a fight because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 20% (18%) were teased about how their face looks in the past month. Conclusions??? Stigma experiences were frequently reported by youth with facial differences and were correlated with independent parental report. This level of stigma suggests that media and public health interventions may be warranted to reduce discrimination, prejudice and negative adolescent social experiences related to facial difference.

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31, 456?468. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00831.x Abstract Vergence eye movements are used to track objects that move in depth in one?s binocular visual field to attain and maintain a fused and single percept. The mechanism and control of vergence eye movements involves complex neurological processes that may be compromised in individuals with traumatic brain injury, thus frequently resulting in a wide range of vergence dysfunctions and related near-work symptoms, such as oculomotor-based reading problems. This paper presents a review of the vergence system and its anomalies in mild traumatic brain injury, as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic clinical ramifications. Implications related to brain imaging and human neuroplasticity are also considered.

AB  - Abstract Background Although lung transplantation improves quality of life, most psychosocial research focuses on adverse psychological and social functioning outcomes. Positive effects, particularly in the late-term years as physical morbidities increase, have received little attention. We provide the first data on a psychological benefit ? post-traumatic growth (PTG) ? and we focused on long-term (>5 yr) survivors. Methods Among 178 patients from a prospective study of mental health during the first two yr post-transplant, we recontacted survivors 6?11 yr post-transplant. We assessed PTG (i.e., positive psychological change resulting from the transplant) and examined its relationship to other patient characteristics with multivariable regression analyses. Results Sixty-four patients (86% of survivors) were assessed (M = 8.1 yr post-transplant, SD = 1.2). Mean PTG exceeded the scale's midpoint (M = 38.6, SD = 10.0; scale midpoint = 25). Recipients experiencing greater PTG were female (p = 0.022), less educated (p = 0.014), and had a history of post-transplant panic disorder (p = 0.005), greater friend support (p = 0.048), and better perceived health (p = 0.032). Neither other pre- or post-transplant mood and anxiety disorders nor transplant-related morbidities (acute rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) predicted PTG. Conclusions PTG exceeded levels observed in other chronic disease populations, suggesting that lung transplantation may uniquely foster positive psychological change in long-term survivors. PTG occurs despite physical and psychiatric morbidities. Whether PTG promotes other positive post-transplant psychosocial outcomes deserves attention.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the relationship between spirituality, science and therapy was explored. In this paper spirituality is discussed in a more clinical context. Family response to trauma is outlined, concentrating on the area of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and several models of adaptation are reviewed. There appear to he commonalities in response to different types of trauma. However in the area of ABI, positive outcomes have been under-reported in the literature which has focussed for various reasons on maladaptation. In viewing response to trauma as involving both the potential for positive transformation as well as suffering and burden, concepts of Frankl and Jung, spiritual belief and ?near death experience? are discussed. Examples of how families find meaning and positively appraise their experience of ABI are given.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the importance of including cultural dimensions as a fundamental component of nursing curricula and to provide some indications as to how this may be achieved. The concept of ?institutionalized racism? is examined, with reference to the absence of the cultural dimension in nursing education, and it is suggested that nurses, as members of a ?caring profession', should be in the forefront in promoting mutual cultural understanding. The argument for promoting cultural awareness is developed in the context of individualized nursing care and the nursing process. The needs of ethnic minority learners are considered along with their potential role, and that of tutors, in breaking down barriers to the acceptance of cultural diversity. Some possible reasons for the failure to include ethnographic perspectives in nurse education programmes are postulated, and finally suggestions as to how this curriculum deficit may be rectified are made. The paper concludes that British nurse educators should ensure that the needs fo learners and patients are better provided for in the future by directing more attention to ethnographic perspectives relating to learning and the provision of nursing care.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Traumatic occlusion (TO) can cause morphofunctional alterations that interfere in the homeostasis of the periodontium. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of TO on the periodontal repair process for teeth following subluxation. Materials and Methods Ninety Wistar rats aged 12 weeks were divided into three groups: control (C), subluxation (S) and subluxation with traumatic occlusion (S+TO). Subluxation was created with an impact force of 900 cN applied by a tensiometer and TO was created with a direct composite resin filling. Healing after two experimental periods of 7 and 21 days was assessed histologically. The Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post hoc tests were used for group comparison. Results At 7 days, there was a significant increase in periodontal ligament (PDL) width and amorphous fundamental substance, as well as a significant bone area reduction in groups S and S+TO. After 21 days, there was a significant PDL width increase in group S+TO, and in the percentage of collagen fibres in group S, whereas group S+TO showed a 52% bone area reduction compared to the same group at 7 days. Subluxation with or without TO caused only superficial root resorption. However, only group S+TO showed damage to the repair process of resorbed root areas after 21 days. Conclusion TO can increase damage to the PDL after subluxation and it can also delay the repair process after PDL damage.

AB  - Abstract Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was initially conceptualized as a psychopathology that arose as a consequence of war time experiences. More recently, available evidence has demonstrated that post-traumatic stress (PTS) as a consequence of war is buffered by social identity processes. In such contexts, identity resources are arguably more readily accessible given the integral relationship between social identities and intergroup violence. There is no evidence as yet to suggest that social identity processes may act to reduce PTS responses to naturally occurring disasters such as earthquakes and even less data pertaining to non-Western contexts where the impact of such disasters tends to be particularly catastrophic. This article reports on a study undertaken in earthquake-affected regions in Nepal devastated by the April 2015 quake and its major aftershock a month later. Participants (n=399) completed measures of their earthquake experience, Post-Traumatic Stress and Post Traumatic growth (PTG), as well as measures of community identification and collective efficacy. In total 399 people completed the measures approximately six months after the quakes. Results of the study indicated that consistent with tenets of the social identity framework, ethnic and gender group memberships impacted on reported experiences during the earthquake. Reported experience during the quakes and ethnic group membership were both related to increased symptoms of PTS. Ethnicity was also linked to the proportion of respondents reporting clinical levels of PTSD symptoms. The relationship between earthquake experience and PTG was mediated by community identification and collective efficacy. Earthquake experience also had an indirect effect on PTS through collective efficacy. Implications of these findings for those working with traumatized groups are discussed.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To describe postoperative adverse events (AEs) and outcomes after transoral surgery for bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP). Study Design Prospective observational multicenter study. Methods Thirty-six patients with BVFP underwent transoral surgery using standard surgical procedures to unilaterally widen the glottic area. Postoperative adverse events (AEs) including severe adverse events (SAEs) were registered continuously. Pre- and 6-month postoperative evaluations included the 6-Minute Walk Test, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, the 12-Item Voice Handicap Index (VHI-12), and a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing graded according to the Penetration?Aspiration-Scale. Results The patients underwent posterior cordotomy, partial arytenoidectomy, or permanent laterofixation as single procedures or in combination. Forty-seven percent of the patients had postoperative AEs. Dyspnea was the most frequent AE (45%). In 40% of AEs, the events were severe (SAEs), and 72.5% were related to the study intervention. Revision surgery leading to prolonged hospitalization or rehospitalization was necessary in nine cases (25%). Laterofixation was correlated to a decreased risk of AEs (P?=?0.042). Six months after surgery, a significant improvement was seen in the SF-domains: Physical component score (P?=?0.008), physical functioning (P?=?0.001), physical role (P?=?0.031), and vitality (P?=?0.032). Concerning the voice handicap, only the VHI-12 physical subscore showed a decrease (P?=?0.005). The total score and other VHI-12 subscores did not change significantly (all P?>?0.05). Conclusion BCVP patients profit from modern transoral surgery for unilateral glottic widening; quality of life is improved; and the voice is preserved. Nevertheless, postoperative complications are frequent. Level of Evidence 2b. Laryngoscope, 125:1401?1408, 2015

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to delineate the key emotional concerns of women newly diagnosed with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Sixty-six women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer within the previous 6 months, receiving treatment at the Medical Oncology Departments of two metropolitan teaching hospitals, completed measures of HADS, IES, CARES-SF and Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, and participated in a semi-structured interview. There were high levels of psychological morbidity, 56.7% of women younger than 55 years qualifying as ?cases? on the HADS, compared with 34.5% of women aged over 55 years. The total HADS score was significantly correlated with the Global and Physical Subscales of the MSAS and CARES. Women younger than 55 years had significantly higher levels of intrusive and avoidant symptoms than women over 55 years. Women also reported high numbers of physical symptoms. Key themes which emerged during the interviews were: difficulties in communicating with doctors, perceived delay in diagnosis, the emotional impact, concerns about the family, feelings about why the cancer developed, other life stress and trauma, and use of non-prescribed treatments.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess whether prehospital triage guidelines, based on mechanistic criteria alone, accurately identify victims of motor vehicle accidents (MVA) with major injury. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the Royal Melbourne Hospital trauma database. Mechanisms analysed were those outlined by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and Advanced Trauma Life Support/Early Management of Severe Trauma prehospital triage guidelines. Results: There were 621 MVA analysed, 253 with major injury (40.7%). Multivariate logistic regression indicated prolonged extrication time (P < 0.0001), cabin intrusion (P = 0.047), high speed (P = 0.003) and ejection from vehicle (P = 0.04) were statistically associated with major injury. Vehicle rollover and fatality in the same vehicle were not statistically associated with major injury. Conclusions: These data suggest that existing guidelines for the prehospital triage of MVA victims, based on mechanistic criteria alone may need revision.
