AB  - Abstract Although the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high among those with severe mental illness, little is known about the use of interventions to lessen the burden of PTSD in this population. Currently, there are limited data about safe and effective interventions to treat these individuals. This systematic published work review presents the scientific published work reporting studies of psychological treatment approaches for individuals with comorbid PTSD and severe mental illness. A secondary aim of this study was to identify the specific models implemented and tested, and their impact upon patient outcomes. A review of the published work from January 2001 through January 2012 of English-language publications retrieved from the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, and the American Psychological Association generated abstracts (PsycINFO) databases was conducted. Six studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The treatment programs described were cognitive?behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, exposure-based cognitive?behavioural therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Evidence of the effectiveness of these programs is examined. Data to support the use of these interventions are limited, indicating the need for further research and efficacy trials. Future areas of research and implications for nursing are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should include derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Aim: The aim of this study was to describe a service operating in Milan, Italy, that provides early intervention for young people aged 17?30?years at the onset and at high risk of psychosis. Method: Following 2?years of preliminary study and organization, Programma2000 was launched in Milan in 1999. This programme was targeted at early detection and intervention in subjects at the onset of, at risk of, or showing ?prodromal? signs of psychosis. This paper contains data on the organization and activities of Programma2000. Results: The service has been active since its launch and has received 378 referrals as of March 2009, 342 of which were thoroughly evaluated. At entry, patients undergo a detailed evaluation of their psychopathology, personal and social role functioning, and cognitive status, with repeated testing over time in order to multidimensionally assess outcome. Treatment involves cognitive?behavioural psychotherapy, structured and unstructured psychosocial interventions, and pharmacotherapy when deemed necessary. Treatment appears effective in reducing morbidity and improving social functioning. Conclusion: A team dedicated to the early identification and treatment of young people with early psychosis is a feasible and sustainable extension of the traditional methods of care for people with mental disorders in Italy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at a high incidence, involving millions of individuals in the U.S. alone. Related to this, there are large numbers of litigants and claimants who are referred annually for forensic evaluation. In formulating opinions regarding claimed injuries, the present review advises experts to rely on two sets of information: TBI outcome and neuropsychological dose?response studies of non-litigants and non-claimants, and response bias literature that has demonstrated the relatively high risk of invalid responding among examinees referred within a secondary gain context, which in turn has resulted in the development of specific assessment methods. Regarding prospective methods for detecting possible response bias, both symptom validity tests, for measuring over-reporting of symptoms on inventories and questionnaires, and performance validity tests, for measuring insufficient effort on ability tests, are considered essential.

AB  - Abstract: Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a cardio-specific myofibrillar protein known to be elevated early after heart transplantation and during cardiac allograft rejection. cTnT determination in heart allograft recipients showed elevated levels in patients with higher degrees of graft rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grades?≥3A?4). Subgroup analyses revealed demographic patient characteristics markedly improving the diagnostic efficiency of cTnT measurement for rejection monitoring, including male recipient gender, recipient age <60 yr, female donor gender and donor age?≥?33 yr. The clinical utility of these parameters was confirmed by longitudinal patient data and may help to select recipients most likely to benefit from cTnT rejection surveillance.

AB  - Prompt and accurate diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias can play a crucial role in ensuring appropriate counseling and management (both antenatal and postnatal). When a skeletal dysplasia is detected during the antenatal period, especially early in the pregnancy, it can be associated with a poor prognosis. It is important to make a diagnosis in antenatal presentation of skeletal dysplasias to inform diagnosis, predict prognosis, provide accurate recurrence risks, and options for prenatal genetic testing in future pregnancies. Prenatal ultrasound scanning is a useful tool to detect several skeletal dysplasias and sonographic measurements serve as reliable indicators of lethality. The lethality depends on various factors including gestational age at which features are identified, size of the chest and progression of malformations. Although, it is important to type the skeletal presentation as accurately as possible, this is not always possible in an antenatal presentation and it is important to acknowledge this uncertainty. In the case of a live birth, it is always important to reassess the infant. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by fragile bones. Here, we report an infant with severe OI born following a twin pregnancy in whom the bone disease is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic mutation, c.4160C >T, p.(Ala1387Val) located in the C-propeptide region of COL1A1. An assumption of lethality antenatally complicated his management in early life. We discuss this patient with particular emphasis on the neonatal presentation of a severe skeletal dysplasia and the lessons that may be learned in such situations. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Whether the introduction of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has an effect on transplant outcome for different age categories remain unclear. Methods We analyzed 49,762 adult hepatitis C virus (HCV) candidates through 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2012 from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Patients were divided into four age categories (18?34, 35?49, 60?64, ≥65 years) in the pre-MELD era and MELD era, respectively. Results Waiting list dropouts have decreased in the MELD era for all categories. A reduced trend in survival was observed for 18?34 years patients in the MELD era compared with the pre-MELD era, with 5-year intention-to-treat, overall and graft survival of 56.5%, 57.9%, 56.3% vs. 56.4%, 69.7%, 64.4% (P = 0.604, 0.034, and 0.071, respectively). For other age categories, survival rates were all superior in the MELD era. Cox-regression analysis showed values of hazard ratio for age increased with advanced age (all >1) in the pre-MELD era compared with the reference group (18?34 years), while these hazard ratios were <1 for overall and graft survival in MELD era. Conclusions Our study provides useful evidence that the introduction of MELD for liver allocation may adversely affect survival of specific HCV patients.

Diagnostic ultrasound demonstrated a fluid filled cavernous mass that was not clearly demarcated from the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. Contrast radiography with intralesional injection of contrast medium showed accumulation of the medium in the caverns of the mass and in the saphenous vein. Contrast enhanced computed tomography demonstrated 2 vascular meshes, one deep and one more superficially, closely associated with the mass. Surgical excision of the mass was performed and a vascular hamartoma was diagnosed based on histopathology. The horse showed no signs of recurrence 7 months after surgery.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal brain functional connectivity may be the neural underpinning of addiction to illicit drugs and of relapse after successful cessation therapy. Aberrant brain networks have been demonstrated in addicted patients and in newly abstinent addicts. However, it is not known whether abnormal brain connectivity patterns persist after prolonged abstinence. In this cross-sectional study, whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (8 min) were collected from 30 heroin-addicted individuals after a long period of abstinence (more than 3 years) and from 30 healthy controls. We first examined the group differences in the resting-state functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in relapse-related processes, including craving and reactivity to stress following acute and protracted withdrawal from heroin. We then examined the relation between the duration of abstinence and the altered NAc functional connectivity in the heroin group. We found that, compared with controls, heroin-dependent participants exhibited significantly greater functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the NAc and weaker functional connectivity between the NAc and the left putamen, left precuneus, and supplementary motor area. However, with longer abstinence time, the strength of NAc functional connectivity with the left putamen increased. These results indicate that dysfunction of the NAc functional network is still present in long-term-abstinent heroin-dependent individuals. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives Adults with bipolar disorder (BD) display aberrant activation in fronto-limbic neural circuitry during cognitive control. However, fronto-limbic response to cognitive control, and factors destabilizing this circuitry, remain under-studied during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood in BD. Sleep patterns are disturbed in BD, undergo change in adolescence, and support brain function. Among transitional age youth, BD diagnosis and sleep (duration and variability) were tested as predictors of fronto-limbic response to a stressful cognitive control task. Methods Two groups of youth (13-22 years old) participated: 15 with BD type I, II or not otherwise specified (NOS) [BD; age 18.1 ± 2.7 years (mean ± standard deviation, SD); 17 female] and 25 healthy controls [CTL; age 19.4 ± 2.7 years (mean ± SD); 17 female]. Sleep was monitored with actigraphy for at least 1 week prior to an adaptive multi-source interference functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm (a Stroop-like cognitive interference task). Group status and sleep duration (average and intra-individual variability) were examined as predictors of activation in response to incongruent>congruent trials within the bilateral amygdala, anterior cingulate (ACC), ventrolateral prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical regions of interest. Results The BD group displayed greater right amygdala activation than the CTL group. Average sleep duration and rostroventral ACC (rvACC) activity were negatively associated in the CTL group, but exhibited a quadratic relationship in the BD group such that short and long sleep were related to greater rvACC activation. Sleep duration variability and dorsal ACC activity were negatively associated in the BD group, and unrelated in the CTL group. Findings remained significant after controlling for age, sex, and mood symptoms. Conclusions Subjects with BD displayed a hyper-limbic response during cognitive control, and sleep was a source of variability in ACC engagement. Stabilizing sleep may be one avenue for improving cognitive control in BD.

AB  - Background PTSD in youth may lead to long-lasting psychological implications, educational difficulties and increased healthcare costs. Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological interventions for children and young people with PTSD. Methods A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 10 psychological interventions and no treatment for children and young people with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion. Results Cognitive therapy for PTSD, a form of individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), appeared to be the most cost-effective intervention for children and young people with PTSD (with a probability of .78 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY), followed by narrative exposure (another form of individual TF-CBT), play therapy, and other forms of individual TF-CBT. After excluding cognitive therapy from the analysis, narrative exposure appeared to be the most cost-effective option with a .40 probability of being cost-effective amongst the remaining 10 options. EMDR, parent training and group TF-CBT occupied middle cost-effectiveness rankings. Family therapy and supportive counselling were less cost-effective than other active interventions. There was limited evidence for some interventions, in particular cognitive therapy for PTSD and parent training. Conclusions Individual forms of TF-CBT and, to a lesser degree, play therapy appear to be cost-effective in the treatment of children and young people with PTSD. Family therapy and supportive counselling are unlikely to be cost-effective relative to other interventions. There is a need for well-conducted studies that examine the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological treatments for children and young people with PTSD.

AB  - Summary The following discussion has been developed to facilitate an historical perspective for future work in defining the boundaries and characteristics of psychopathology. The chapter begins with an historical overview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) classification systems that started with efforts to collect statistics about the population at large (i.e. U.S. Census), which would be consistent with statistics on the diagnostic composition of patients in mental hospitals. Next, there is a review of the history of international collaboration that has allowed for the ongoing coordination efforts to develop classification systems by both the APA and the international scientific community. After a review of the strengths and limitations of the DSM-IV, the chapter concludes with a look ahead to future efforts to improve the validity and clinical utility of diagnostic criteria for psychopathology, and the arrangement of such diagnoses into a system of classification. The roots of the fifth-edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) developmental process are described as options for future efforts to ensure continued collaboration between U.S. and international developers of the DSM and ICD systems.

AB  - SYNOPSISThis study attempts to replicate and synthesize previous headache/MMPI research by investigating scale differences amongst diagnoses and between a control group; re-examining the occurrence of the conversion ?V? pattern; evaluating the Kudrow-Sutkus (1979) classification system; measuring score changes which occur with prognosis; and observing the effect that ?headache items? have on scale score elevations. Several mean scale scores differed from previous studies. A number of these differences were clinically significant. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (sex [370 males and females] and headache diagnosis) for each scale determined that males had higher L scores; the control group had higher K scores than post trauma, mixed, or vascular patients; each headache diagnosis had higher 1, 2, 3, and 7 scores than the control group (scales 1, 2, and 3 were clinically elevated in only the post trauma and mixed conditions); scale 9 scores varied between conditions; and scale 10 scores were higher for migraine, mixed, cluster, and post trauma patients. Chi-square analysis determined that the conversion ?;V? pattern occurred in a significantly greater degree in headache patients. However, the percentage of occurrence ranged from only 12.50 to 31.03 percent. The Kudrow-Sutkus system correctly diagnosed only 40.08 percent of 90 randomly selected subjects. One-way ANOVA determined that no significant change occurred in group scale scores in 20 headache sufferers who received treatment ranging from a multi-disciplinary hospital program to none at all and whose prognosis ranged from excellent to poor. One-way ANOVA determined that the removal of items which inquire about ?headache symptoms? produced significant reductions on scales 1 and 3.The inability of this study to replicate previous empirical investigations raises questions of the MMPI's reliability as a diagnostic classifier in chronic headache. Certain elevations on the MMPI may be the result of symptom measurement and not psychopathology.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim A previous cross-sectional study found that young adults with depression were more likely to have traumatic dental injuries (TDIs). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms during early and middle adolescence, and TDIs at age 15-16 years. Method This study used longitudinal data from phases 1 and 3 of the Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey (RELACHS), a school-based survey following a representative, multi-ethnic sample of adolescents attending public schools in East London (England). Information on depressive symptoms was collected using the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) during early (age 11-12 years) and middle adolescence (age 15-16 years). TDIs were identified during clinical examinations in phase 3 when pupils were 15-16 years old. Logistic regression was used to test the association between depressive symptoms at different stages of adolescence and TDIs adjusting for confounders (age, gender, ethnicity, parental employment and overjet). Results Depressive symptoms were reported by 24% and 32% of adolescents in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Evidence of TDIs was found in 18% of adolescents at age 15-16 years. Adolescents with depressive symptoms, either in early or middle adolescence, had greater odds of experiencing TDIs. However, these estimates were not statistically significant. In regression models adjusted for confounders, the odds of having TDIs were 1.23 (95% CI: 0.77-1.96) and 1.23 (95% CI: 0.76-1.95) among pupils with depressive symptoms in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Conclusion There was no association between depressive symptoms and TDIs in early and middle adolescents.
