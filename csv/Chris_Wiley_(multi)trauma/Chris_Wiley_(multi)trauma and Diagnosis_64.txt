AB  - Abstract ? Trauma to the teeth is a common reason for emergency room visits among children, with the maxillary anterior teeth being mostly affected. The consequences of dental trauma include disfigurement, speech defects and psychological effects. This is a cross-sectional study comprising 1039 students, with 47% being males and 53% females. Teeth were examined for physical evidence of trauma. The prevalence of incisal fracture was 2.4% with no significant gender difference (2.9% and 2.0% among males and females, respectively). The male to female prevalence ratio was 1.45 to 1.0. The maxillary incisors accounted for 96% of fractured teeth. Among children with traumatized incisors, 86% had one tooth affected, while 14% had two traumatized teeth. The prevalence of incisal trauma was significantly higher among children of low socioeconomic status (?2=5.86, P=0.02, df=1). Though African American and Hispanic children had higher prevalence than White children, the differences were not statistically significant. The study reports a low prevalence of incisal trauma among Harris County children and a socioeconomic difference. This study recommends further investigation of incisal trauma in this region as well as educational programs to prevent dental trauma.

AB  - Summary: Purpose: In epilepsy, patient-based assessments are increasingly used as outcome measures in clinical trials of novel therapies alongside the traditional clinical measures of efficacy. The objective of this study was to validate psychometrically a quality of life (QOL) measure developed for use with recently diagnosed epilepsy patients. Methods: The NEWQOL (Quality of Life in Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Instrument) is a 93-item self-administered battery designed to assess QOL in patients with new-onset epilepsy. NEWQOL consists of eight multi-item scales (13 subscales) measuring several health parameters: Anxiety, Depression, Social Activities, Symptoms, Locus of Control/Mastery, Neuropsychological Problems (includes the following subscales: Fatigue, Memory, Concentration, Motor Skills, and Reading), Social Stigma, Worry, Work Limitations, and several single-item measures (General Health, Number of Seizures, Social Limitations, Social Support, Self Concept, Ambition Limitations, Health Transition, and General Limitations). The NEWQOL was collected at baseline and 1 week post-baseline from 108 patients in the U.K. and U.S. Results: All of the multi-item scales had high item discriminant validity, good test-retest reliability, and acceptable levels of internal consistency reliability; all but the Reading and Stigma subscales had negligible floor and ceiling effects. General linear models were used to examine the known groups validity of NEWQOL. Significant differences were observed in the Worry, Symptoms, Summary Neuropsychological Scales, and all Neuropsychological subscales (Memory, Fatigue, Concentration, Motor Skills, and Reading), indicating poorer functioning in the more frequent or severe seizure groups. Conclusions: Results from this study offer supportive evidence that NEWQOL has good validity and reliability and can discriminate between patient groups, particularly in relation to symptoms and psychological problems. We conclude that NEWQOL represents a useful measure for future studies in this patient population.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) show differential activation during an emotional activation task compared with age- and sex-matched controls, by measuring changes in the concentration of oxygenated (oxyHb) and deoxygenated (deoxyHb) hemoglobin, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods:? Fourteen patients with PDD and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated in the study. The relative changes of concentrations of oxyHb and deoxyHb were measured on NIRS during an implicit processing task of fearful expression using Japanese standard faces. Results:? PDD patients had significantly reduced oxyHb changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to healthy controls. Conclusion:? PFC dysfunction may exist in PDD.

AB  - Introduction Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM?) and thromboelastography (TEG?) are increasingly used in the perioperative and emergency assessment of bleeding tendencies. The diagnostic value of ROTEM and TEG for von Willebrand disease (VWD) remains to be established. Aim To investigate whether ROTEM and TEG can discriminate patients with VWD from healthy controls. Methods Rotational thromboelastometry and TEG whole blood coagulation profiles were compared between VWD patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 89). Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated, including sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Prolonged TEG R-time had a positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) of 0.84 and 0.68 respectively. TEG clotting index (CI) had a PPV of 1.00 and an NPV of 0.60. Both R-time and CI had a high specificity and accurately discriminated VWD patients from healthy controls, with an ROC area under the curve of 0.85 and 0.99 respectively. In multivariate analysis, low FVIII levels, but not von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen or activity, determined hypocoagulable TEG R (R2 = 0.35) and CI levels (R2 = 0.51). The ROTEM coagulation profiles of VWD patients did not differ from healthy controls. Conclusions Thromboelastography R and CI accurately discriminated VWD patients from healthy controls, partly through the detection of low FVIII levels. The test's performance may be improved through adjustment of the test thresholds to a local reference population. Both intrinsic pathway-activated (INTEM) and tissue factor pathway-activated (EXTEM) ROTEM were of limited diagnostic value in VWD.

AB  - Summary: Background: Liver metastases are much more common than primary malignant tumours of the liver, and diagnosis is largely based on imaging findings. Thus, the radiologist plays a key role in the management of patients with suspected liver metastases by accurately detecting or excluding liver metastases. A variety of imaging techniques can be used for this purpose. ?Methods: We have reviewed the literature addressing the diagnostic yield of different imaging modalities for the detection of liver metastases. Emphasis is laid upon the preoperative evaluation of colorectal liver metastases with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. ?Results: Sonography is a widely available and low-cost examination technique, but it has limitations in the detection of metastases, with an overall sensitivity of approximately 50?%. Preliminary experience with contrast-enhanced sonography is promising, as this technique is able to depict subcentimetre lesions more accurately. The standard imaging technique for staging in patients with extrahepatic neoplasms at high risk for developing liver metastases is contrast-enhanced helical CT, with a reported sensitivity of 58???85?%. The development of multidetector array CT has recently expanded CT to the ?third dimension? by providing excellent multiplanar imaging capability. CT during arterial portography (CTAP), which has been the ?gold standard? of preoperative liver imaging, has largely been abandoned because of its invasiveness and its high rate of false positive diagnoses (13???31?%) due to tumour-like perfusion defects in the liver. MR imaging with liver-specific contrast agents has been shown to be at least as accurate as CTAP, with a sensitivity of 85???90?%. In many institutions, contrast-enhanced MR imaging has become the procedure of choice for preoperative assessment. Positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) may help in the characterization of small liver lesions and in the detection of extrahepatic spread of disease. ?Conclusions: The diagnostic strategy for assessing liver metastases must take into account (i) the histology of the primary neoplasm, (ii) the clinical situation, and (iii) the planned therapeutic procedure, thereby ensuring that the optimal radiological examination is chosen.

AB  - Summary Intranasal meningoencephaloceles are characterised by protrusion of brain and meninges through a skull-base defect. Nasal intubation or instrumentation may lead to complications such as meningoencephalitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea or fistula formation. A 62 year old lady developed rhinorrhea following failed videolaryngoscopic and nasal fibreoptic intubation, which ultimately necessitated emergency surgical tracheostomy for a ?can't intubation can't ventilate? scenario. This case highlights the diagnosis and management of an unusual complication resulting from difficult airway management.

The migration from the more narrow and specific use of research-based practice to the broader and encompassing use of evidence on which to base guidance and care decisions is explored. Weaknesses and strengths of adopting a culture of EBP nursing are addressed along with how to develop a search question, find and appraise the evidence, make sense of it and then apply the findings.

AB  - Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients with comorbid panic disorder (PD) may express additive symptoms of central fear system disturbance. They endorse elevated levels of sleep and nightmare disturbance [Leskin GA, et al., J Psychiatr Res 2002;36:449?452], and demonstrate movement suppression during laboratory sleep [Woodward SH, et al., Sleep 2002;25:681?688]. We estimated respiratory rate and rate variability separately for rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep. Subjects were 49 Vietnam combat-related PTSD inpatients (11 with comorbid PD and 38 without) and 15 controls. Computer-based estimates of respiratory rate and variability were derived from 10 to 18 hr of baseline sleep collected over two or three nights. Neither rate nor rate variability distinguished PTSD patients with comorbid PD from those without, or PTSD patients from controls; however, PTSD patients failed to exhibit the expected differences between REM and NREM respiratory rates. Moreover, the difference between REM and NREM respiratory rate was inversely related to a continuous measure of PTSD severity. PTSD patients with trauma-related nightmare complaint exhibited higher sleep respiration rates over both REM and NREM sleep. Conversely, in addition to slowed respiration, nightmare-free patients exhibited reduced respiratory rate variability in REM relative to NREM sleep, which was a reversal of the normal pattern. These finding are discussed in light of known telencephalic regulatory influences upon respiration rate. Depression and Anxiety 18:198?204, 2003 ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Infrared thermal imaging (IRTI) is a new technique for detecting deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on DVT's infrared presentation and distribution characteristics (PDCs). A method that is singularly sensitive to DVT is needed. They, therefore, enrolled 157 subjects with suspected lower extremity DVT in a double-blind, controlled clinical trial using IRTI, and Doppler compression ultrasonography (CPUS) to verify the clinical value of IRTI. Methods An IRTI system could precisely measure and store real-time thermal images. A double-blind, controlled clinical study using IRTI and detection on 157 patients with suspected DVTs, evaluating the following parameters: sensitivity, specificity, positive prescreening, negative prescreening, false positivity, false negativity, and diagnostic accordance of IRTI with CPUS for detecting DVT were conducted. Results Of 140 subjects who underwent screening both IRTI and CPUS detect were included for analyses. According to their IRTI DVT's presentation and distribution characteristics, patients were divided into IRTI- negative (n?=?59) and IRTI-positive (including suspicious IRTI positive) (n?=?81) groups. CPUS identified 80 DVT-negative and 60 DVT-positive patients. The sensitivity of IRTI for detecting DVT was 88.33%, specificity 65.00%, false-positive diagnosis 11.67%, false-negative diagnosis 35.00%, positive prescreening 65.43%, negative prescreening 88.14%, diagnostic accordance rate 75.00%. IRTI results accorded with CPUS results (P = .001) except for the positivity incidence (?2?=?39.997, P?<?.001). Conclusions IRTI could be used to supplement CPUS detection for detecting DVTs and adjunctive diagnostic screening.

AB  - Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) show varying degrees of response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. This randomised phase III study in patients with CIDP (ProCID trial) will compare the efficacy and safety of 3 different doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg) of IVIg 10% (panzyga) administered every 3 weeks for 24?weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of treatment response, defined as a decrease in adjusted inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment disability score of ≥1 point, in the IVIg 1.0 g/kg arm at week 24. Patients with definite or probable CIDP according to European Federation of Neurological Sciences/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria with IVIg or corticosteroid dependency and active disease are eligible. All potentially eligible patients will undergo IVIg or corticosteroid dose reduction (washout phase) over ≤12?weeks or until deterioration of CIDP (active disease). Patients with deterioration during the washout phase will be randomised to receive study treatment during a dose-evaluation phase starting with a loading dose of IVIg 2.0 g/kg followed by maintenance treatment with IVIg 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g/kg every 3 weeks. Rescue medication (2 doses of IVIg 2.0 g/kg given 3 weeks apart) will be administered to patients in the IVIg 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg groups who deteriorate after week 3 and before week 18 or who do not improve at week 6. Safety, tolerability and quality of life will be assessed. The ProCID study will provide new information on the best maintenance dose of IVIg for patients with CIDP.

AB  - Severe variants of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) affect <2% of all FOP patients worldwide, but provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the phenotype?genotype relationships that propel the pathology of this disabling disease. We evaluated two unrelated children who had severe reduction deficits of the hands and feet with absence of nails, progressive heterotopic ossification, hypoplasia of the brain stem, motor and cognitive developmental delays, facial dysmorphology, small malformed teeth, and abnormal hair development. One child had sensorineural hearing loss, microcytic anemia, and a tethered spinal cord and the other had a patent ductus arteriosus and gonadal dysgenesis with sex reversal (karyotype 46, XY female). Both children had an identical mutation in ACVR1 c.772A>G; p.Arg258Gly (R258G), not previously described in FOP. Although many, if not most, FOP mutations directly perturb the structure of the GS regulatory subdomain and presumably the adjacent αC helix, substitution with glycine at R258 may directly alter the position of the helix in the kinase domain, eliminating a key aspect of the autoinhibitory mechanism intrinsic to the wild-type ACVR1 kinase. The high fidelity phenotype?genotype relationship in these unrelated children with the most severe FOP phenotype reported to date suggests that the shared features are due to the dysregulated activity of the mutant kinase during development and postnatally, and provides vital insight into the structural biology and function of ACVR1 as well as the design of small molecule inhibitors. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Congenital limb deficiency defects (LDDs) are etiologically heterogeneous. Acquired causes include amniotic bands, teratogens exposure, and chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks? gestation and intrinsic causes include single-gene disorders and chromosome abnormalities. However, a substantial number of cases, especially terminal transverse deficiency defects, occur without an obvious cause and are ascribed to vascular disruption events. Some studies have found an association between maternal thrombophilia and congenital LDDs. We investigated this association through a review of all prenatally identified LDDs at a major tertiary care center in Toronto, Canada over a 12-year period. Our results showed a higher prevalence of thrombophilias among women with a pregnancy affected with an LDD when compared to the general population [?2(3)?=?54.63, P?<?0.01]. Our research was strengthened by the inclusion of affected pregnancies regardless of outcome, and strict criteria to avoid including LDDs with a non-vascular etiology. Most LDDs were identified during the routine 18?20 week anatomy ultrasound, but some were discovered as early as 13 weeks? gestation. We found an excess of left-sided defects among terminal transverse but not longitudinal deficiencies; additionally, all diagnoses of maternal thrombophilia occurred in the terminal transverse group. Our results support thrombophilia screening in all women with a prenatally diagnosed fetal LDD as well as careful evaluation of the fetal extremities during prenatal ultrasounds in women with a known thrombophilia. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine cervical osteoarthritis is a common disease known to contribute to both neck pain and cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy. There are no published studies demonstrating the usefulness of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical osteoarthritis. Objectives To determine the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical articular process joint osteoarthritis. Study design Prospective cadaver study. Methods Latero-oblique radiographs and CT images were collected, and post mortem examinations performed, on 27 cadaver necks from Thoroughbred-type horses of various ages and sexes. Two equine clinicians independently reviewed each set of images for the presence of osteoarthritis. The authors, under the guidance of a veterinary pathologist, reviewed all articular process joints for bony changes indicative of osteoarthritis. Results The prevalence of osteoarthritis identified on CT images was 57.9% (Assessor A) and 23% (Assessor B). The prevalence of lesions identified on post mortem examination was 25.6%. Latero-oblique radiography showed a low sensitivity for identifying osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging (6.3?16.1%) and post mortem examination (2.2?4.4%). However, it showed a high specificity when compared to both CT imaging (92.1?97.8%) and post mortem examination (87.2?95.0%). The positive predictive value for identifying osteoarthritis was moderate (40.9?80.0%) when compared to CT imaging and poor (4.2?18.2%) when compared to post mortem examination. The negative predictive value was moderate when compared to both CT imaging (42.9?76.3%) and post mortem examination (78.0?79.8%). Conclusions Latero-oblique radiography has low sensitivity, but high specificity for the detection of cervical osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging and post mortem examination. Further investigation comparing the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography vs. laterolateral radiography would determine whether taking latero-oblique radiographs, which can be more difficult to obtain and interpret, is necessary for the diagnosis of cervical osteoarthritis in practice.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has a number of indications in paediatric musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, and provides many advantages over traditional imaging and diagnostic techniques. This chapter attention focusses on PoCUS and its application to more acute presentations, including infectious, inflammatory and traumatic conditions. In terms of examiner technique, adequate ultrasound gel, appropriate probe manipulation, probe stabilisation using the hypothenar eminence and little finger of the examiner's hand, as well as multi-angle views to evaluate for anisotropy, are all important to obtaining high-quality clinically useful ultrasound images. PoCUS can be useful in the diagnosis, evaluation and also often the treatment of paediatric skin and soft-tissue infections. Common entities evaluated are cellulitis, abscess and acute haematogenous osteomyelitis. Retained foreign bodies (FBs), dislocation/subluxation in children, ligament, tendon injuries, and joint effusions are also discussed. A high-frequency (7-12?MHz) probe with paediatric hip/MSK preset should be used if available.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a very attractive tool in the context of repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue damaged by trauma. The most common source of MPCs to date has been the bone marrow, but aspirating bone marrow from the patient is an invasive procedure. In an attempt to search for alternative sources of MPCs that could be obtained with minimal invasion, we looked into traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. In this study, we determined whether a population of multipotent MPCs could be isolated from acute traumatic knee hemarthrosis in the absence of intra-articular fractures. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the aspirated hemarthrosis by density gradient separation, and cultured. We were able to obtain plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells from the mononuclear cell fractions. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the adherent fibroblast-like cells were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and were negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. These were similar to control bone marrow stromal cells. These cells could differentiate in vitro into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells in the presence of lineage-specific induction factors. In conclusion, acute unfractured traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee contains MPCs with multipotentiality. Because knee hemarthrosis is easy to harvest with minimal pain and without unnecessary invasion, we regard hemarthrosis-derived cells as an additional progenitor cell source for future tissue engineering and cell-based therapy in knee injuries.

AB  - Summary The vestibulocochlear organ is a multi-part structure that consists of the external, middle, and inner ear. Given that it can be readily observed on physical examination, the external ear is the focus of this chapter. The purpose of the external ear is to funnel sound toward the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. This facilitates the special sense of hearing. Although ear shape and structure vary depending upon breed standard, the function of the organ is essentially the same. In order to preserve the sense of hearing, the pinnae need to operate independently of one another, and the external ear needs to be open, as opposed to stenotic. The ear canal also needs to be free of excessive hair, cerumen, or other debris. Abnormal aural presentations are common in clinical practice and include both those problems that are limited to the pinnae and those that involve the external ear canal. Aural hematomas, infestation with Sarcoptes and Notoedres mange mites, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) affect primarily the pinnae. By contrast, otitis externa involves inflammation of the external ear canal. Otitis externa is a frequent occurrence in both dogs and cats. Patients with long, droopy ears, excessive ear canal hair, or extensive swimming and/or bathing histories may be predisposed due to the potential for reduced aeration and increased moisture within the ears themselves. Patients with otitis may present with malodorous ears and irritation. Clinical signs frequently include head shaking, pawing, or scratching at the ears, and/or reluctance to allow the clinician to perform otoscopy. Otoscopy and cytology are important diagnostic tools that allow for reliable characterization of aural debris. Interpretation of aural cytology requires the clinician to recognize what constitutes normal resident flora of the ear canal. Bacterial and fungal overgrowth versus infection are important distinctions to make. Culture and drug susceptibility profiles may be indicated as follow-up diagnostic aids, particularly in cases of chronic or recurrent otitis externa, or when the patient's response to therapy is poor. The clinician must also make every attempt to identify the primary cause of aural disease. Ear infections are typically the result of other underlying conditions, including allergic skin disease, autoimmune disease, metabolic disturbances, such as hypothyroidism, and parasitic infestation. Without managing these primary causes, otitis externa is likely to recur.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand?s disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficient levels of or dysfunctional von Willebrand factor (VWF). This phase II/III open-label, multicentre study evaluated the efficacy and safety of BIOSTATE?, a high purity plasma-derived double-virus inactivated FVIII/VWF concentrate, when used in non-surgical bleeds, surgical procedures and prophylactic therapy in VWD patients for whom desmopressin treatment was deemed ineffective, inadequate or contraindicated. Twenty three patients (7 type 1, 9 type 2 and 7 type 3; 12 male, 11 female), who received FVIII/VWF concentrate as part of their VWD management, were recruited prospectively between December 2004 and May 2007 from eight centres in Australia and New Zealand. BIOSTATE dosing was based on pre-treatment FVIII:C and/or VWF:RCo plasma levels and a predetermined dosing guide. Haemostatic efficacy of BIOSTATE was rated as excellent or good for all major and minor surgery events, long-term prophylaxis, and for four of the six assessable non-surgical bleeding events. Blood transfusions were required by two major surgery patients as well as one patient with a non-surgical bleed. The median overall exposure to BIOSTATE across all groups was 8?days, greater in the prophylactic group (range 53?197) compared with major surgery (3?24), minor surgery (1?8) and non-surgical bleeds (1?10). BIOSTATE was shown to be efficacious and well tolerated when treating patients with VWD. This study also provides important insights into dosing regimens with BIOSTATE and the role of monitoring therapy with FVIII:C and VWF:RCo.

AB  - Abstract This article reports the case of a large aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) in a 12-year-old girl, who came to the Ophir Loyola Hospital (Belém, Pará, Brazil) complaining of pain and debilitated because of a secondary infection. Radiographic and tomographic findings presented an expansion/destruction pattern, including a slight narrowing of the oropharynx and destruction of the right mandibular condyle and coronoid process, which according to the literature are rarely affected by this type of cyst. Because of the size and progression of the cyst, the treatment included block resection with a costochondral rib graft. The clinical and radiographic aspects of expansion with destruction, associated with trans-surgical moderate bleeding and the histopathological findings (dense connective tissue and numerous blood spaces) led to a final diagnosis of a mixed type ABC.
