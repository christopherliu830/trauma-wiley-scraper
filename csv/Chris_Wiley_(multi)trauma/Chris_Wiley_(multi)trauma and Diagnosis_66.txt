AB  - Abstract Objective To review the prevalence and perinatal management of cases of arthrogryposis delivering at our hospital over a 6-year period. Methods This was a retrospective review of cases of arthrogryposis managed at a UK teaching hospital. Cases were identified from the regional congenital anomalies register and departmental databases. Case notes were reviewed and analysed. Results From 2002 to 2007, there were 27 cases of arthrogryposis. Sixteen (59.3%) were Caucasians, 7(25.9%) Asians and 4(14.8%) Afro-Caribbean; 17(63%) were nulliparous. In eight (29.6%) cases, there was a family history of congenital anomalies. Three had previously affected siblings and in three cases the parents were affected with arthrogryposis. Five (18.5%) were from consanguineous families. Eighteen (66.7%) cases were diagnosed prenatally at a mean gestational age of 21 weeks. Twelve (57%) were delivered by caesarean section. There were 18 live births. Sixteen (59%) cases were reviewed by clinical geneticist. Following detailed review and investigation including post-mortems, 20 (74%) of our cases had a formal diagnosis or likely cause identified. Conclusions Suspected cases of arthrogryposis require multi-disciplinary management to optimise the possibility of making a diagnosis and providing parents with accurate information to enable them to make informed choices regarding the pregnancy and providing information regarding likelihood of recurrence.

AB  - Summary Despite reports of successful pregnancies in heart transplant (HTx) recipients, many centers recommend their patients against maternity. We reviewed our provincial experience of pregnancy in HTx recipients by performing charts review of all known gestations following HTx in the province of Quebec (Canada), stratified between planned and unplanned pregnancies. Long-term survival was compared to HTx recipient women of childbearing age who did not become pregnant. Eighteen pregnancies, 56% unplanned, occurred in eight patients, 10.1 (2.6?27.0) years after HTx. Immunosuppression was CNI-based, with a mean dose increase of 48.3% (tacrolimus) and 26.5% (cyclosporine), without rejection. Cardiometabolic complications were high compared to the general Canadian population, including preeclampsia (15.4% vs. 5.5%), hypertension (38.5% vs. 4.6%), and diabetes (15.4% vs. 5.6%). Mean gestational age was 35.1 (23.4?39.6) weeks (72.2% live births; 53.8% prematurity). Mean birthweight was 2418 (660?3612) g. Serum creatinine increased during pregnancy, becoming significant after delivery (P = 0.0239), and returning to preconception level in all but three patients within a year. After 4.6 (1.2?17.2) years of follow-up, two rejection episodes occurred in one patient. Long-term mortality was similar to overall HTx women (Kaplan?Meier; P = 0.8071). Pregnancy in HTx carries high cardiometabolic complications and decreased kidney function, but is feasible with acceptable outcomes and no impact on mother's survival.

AB  - In traumatised non-vital immature permanent incisors, clinicians are challenged by thin root dentine walls and a wide-open apex. Apexification involves using a temporary paste to stimulate the formation of calcified tissue at the apex; while apical plug techniques involve packing of a material into the apical 2?4?mm of an immature canal to act as a barrier against which gutta-percha is condensed. The risk of root fracture during apexification in immature roots is a concern. This complication has lead researchers to explore ways of root strengthening in addition to inducing a barrier. Objectives:? To assess the effectiveness of methods for inducing an apical barrier or root strengthening and immediate & long-term side effects of these interventions. Design:? Cochrane Systematic Review of randomised controlled trials. Methods:? Electronic and manual search using controlled vocabulary and free text terms with no language restrictions. The methodological quality of each study is assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Primary results:? Multi-database electronic search via OVID revealed 117 total hits. Conclusions:? Primary analysis of reports yielded 10 studies initially fulfilled inclusion criteria, five retrospective studies, 18 in vitro studies, six animal studies, 53 case reports & review articles and 25 not applicable reports.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes how the systematic ACCEPT approach enables movements of ill and injured patients between or within hospitals. Centralisation of specialist services means more transfers for clinical reasons. Many of these transfers will be time critical, some will be intensive, and some will be both. The chapter provides an overview of the patient groups that typically will need to be transferred to specialist centres, some of their characteristics and associated specific clinical management. Some of these broad categories of patients includes: neurosurgery (traumatic brain injury, cerebral bleeds), trauma, burns, vascular surgery (abdominal aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic dissection, acute limb ischaemia), interventional radiology, cardiology (primary coronary intervention), nephrology (acute renal failure), obstetric, and level 3 transfers. However, early and effective communication between centres is essential to ensure that any specific treatments are administered before or during the transfer to optimise patient care.

AB  - Abstract Aim Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, poor function and predisposing to cancer recurrence. Earlier diagnosis and intervention can minimize systemic complications but is hindered by current diagnostic methods that are non-specific and often uninformative. The purpose of this paper is to review current developments in the field and to identify strategies for early detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage. Method A systematic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included ?anastomosis? and ?leak? and ?diagnosis? or ?detection? and ?gastrointestinal? or ?colorectal?. Papers concentrating on the diagnosis of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak were identified and further searches were performed by cross-referencing. Results Computerized tomography CT scanning and water-soluble contrast studies are the current preferred techniques for diagnosing anastomotic leakage but suffer from variable sensitivity and specificity, have logistical constraints and may delay timely intervention. Intra-operative endoscopy and imaging may offer certain advantages, but the ability to predict anastomotic leakage is unproven. Newer techniques involve measurement of biomarkers for anastomotic leakage and have the potential advantage of providing cheap real-time monitoring for postoperative complications. Conclusion Current diagnostic tests often fail to diagnose anastomotic leak at an early stage that enables timely intervention and minimizes serious morbidity and mortality. Emerging technologies, based on detection of local biomarkers, have achieved proof of concept status but require further evaluation to determine whether they translate into improved patient outcomes. Further research is needed to address this important, yet relatively unrecognized, area of unmet clinical need.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome of dogs with presumptive echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion treated with thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study (2011-2017). Animals Eighteen dogs. Methods Records were searched for dogs with pericardial effusion and no identified cause by preoperative echocardiography and subsequent thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Collected data included presenting complaint, physical examination, laboratory results, imaging, and operative findings. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and/or recheck examination. Results No evidence of mass lesions or cause for the effusion was identified in any of the dogs by preoperative echocardiography. Nine dogs had unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results. Nine dogs had pericardioscopic abnormalities consistent with masses, nodules, or adhesions. Median survival time (MST) for the 9 dogs with abnormalities identified by pericardioscopy was 66 days, whereas MST for the 9 dogs with unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results was not reached (P?=?.0067). Median survival time for dogs based on histopathologic diagnosis alone was not different between dogs with a diagnosis of neoplasia and dogs with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.1056). Among dogs with lesions identified during pericardioscopy, MST did not differ between those with a diagnosis of malignancy and those with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.78). Conclusion Dogs with presumptive idiopathic pericardial effusion without evidence of masses, nodules, and/or adhesions during thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy lived longer than dogs in which abnormalities were identified during pericardioscopy. Clinical significance Thoracoscopic pericardectomy/pericardioscopy and targeted biopsy of the pericardium and pleura are recommended in dogs with echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion.

An action research strategy was selected because it offered a framework within which to work with and for rather than on this vulnerable group of service users. ??The women participating in the research developed a conceptual model that captured the essence of their experience, which they named ?Our Cycle?. They also proposed a system for service delivery, ?From trauma to recovery: a non-professional model?. ??The diagnostic phase of the action research has thus resulted in a sound theoretical and practical framework to guide the implementation and evaluation stages of the project, currently being funded through the United Kingdom Department of Health's Health Action Zone initiative.

AB  - Objectives Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to expand in nontraditional risk groups, and the prevalence of undiagnosed infection remains relatively high in the patient populations of urban emergency departments (EDs). Unfortunately, HIV testing in this setting remains uncommon. The objectives of this study were 1) to develop a physician-based diagnostic rapid HIV testing model, 2) to implement this model in a high-volume urban ED, and 3) to prospectively characterize the patients who were targeted by physicians for testing and determine the proportions who completed rapid HIV counseling, testing, and referral; tested positive for HIV infection; and were successfully linked into medical and preventative care. Methods An interdisciplinary group of investigators developed a model for performing physician-based diagnostic rapid HIV testing in the ED. This model was then evaluated using a prospective cohort study design. Emergency physicians identified patients at risk for undiagnosed HIV infection using clinical judgment and consensus guidelines. Testing was performed by the hospital's central laboratory, and clinical social workers performed pretest and posttest counseling and provided appropriate medical and preventative care referrals, as defined by the model. Results Over the 30-month study period, 105,856 patients were evaluated in the ED. Of these, 681 (0.64%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60% to 0.69%) were identified by physicians and completed rapid HIV counseling, testing, and referral. Of the 681 patients, 15 (2.2%; 95% CI = 1.2% to 3.6%) patients tested positive for HIV infection and 12 (80%; 95% CI = 52% to 96%) were successfully linked into care. Conclusions A physician-based diagnostic HIV testing model was developed, successfully implemented, and sustained in a high-volume, urban ED setting. While the use of this model successfully identified patients with undiagnosed HIV infection in the ED, the overall level of testing remained low. Innovative testing programs, such as nontargeted screening, more specific targeted screening, or alternative hybrid methods, are needed to more effectively identify undiagnosed HIV infection in the ED patient population.

AB  - Abstract Background Defecatory disorders (DD) are defined by clinical and objective features of impaired rectal evacuation. The epidemiology of DD in the population is unknown, partly because many constipated patients do not undergo anorectal tests. Our objectives were to estimate the incidence rate and clinical features of DD in the community. Methods We reviewed the medical records of all patients older than 16 years in Olmsted County, MN, who had constipation and underwent anorectal manometry from 1999 through 2008. Criteria for diagnosing DD were constipation for 6 months or longer and one of the following: (i) abnormal rectal balloon expulsion test; (ii) reduced or increased perineal descent; or (iii) two or more abnormal features with defecography or surface electromyography. Key Results Of 11 112 constipated patients, 516 had undergone anorectal tests; 245 of these (209 women, 36 men) had a DD. The mean (±SD) age at diagnosis was 44 years (±18) among women and 49 years (±19) among men. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate per 100 000 person-years was 19.3 (95% CI: 16.8?21.8). The age-adjusted incidence per 100 000 person-years was greater (p < 0.0001) in women (31.8, 95% CI: 27.4?36.1) than in men (6.6, 95% CI: 4.4?8.9). Prior to the diagnosis of DD, nearly 30% of patients had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 48% had a psychiatric diagnosis, 18% had a history of abuse, and 21% reported urinary and/or fecal incontinence. Conclusions & Inferences Among constipated patients, DD are fourfold more common in women than men and often associated with IBS and psychiatric diagnoses.

AB  - Aims The multi-center SPEED registry evaluated the procedural success and in-hospital clinical outcomes of direct stenting with the Svelte ?all-in-one? coronary stent Integrated Delivery System (IDS) through diagnostic catheters to identify the clinical indications for which this approach is appropriately suited. Methods & results Forty-eight (48) patients with 54 lesions of lengths ≤20 mm and RVD 2.5?3.5 mm were targeted for direct stenting through diagnostic catheters (4?6F) via radial or femoral approach. Procedural characteristics early in an investigator's experience (28 lesions) were compared with outcomes following experience (26 lesions). Procedure, device and strategy success were realized in 54 (100%), 50 (93%) and 46 (85%) lesions, respectively, with strategy success significantly related to RVD (P?=?0.05), lesion location (P?=?0.01), and diagnostic catheter size (P?=?0.05). Significant improvement in crossing and intervention time and trends toward improvement in device and strategy success, reductions in procedure and radiation time and contrast use were observed. Conclusions Direct stenting through diagnostic catheters via radial or femoral approach using the Svelte IDS is feasible and associated with good in-hospital outcomes. This approach offers the attractive option of assessing lesions via diagnostic catheter and, depending upon vessel anatomy and lesion morphology, continuing with ad-hoc interventional treatment using the same diagnostic catheter. Improvements in strategy success and procedural efficiencies, based on operator experience, facilitate catheter downsizing and reduce intervention time, ancillary product use and overall procedure costs. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Thirty-six cases of patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (CDAD) were identified from the dementia clinic of the Burke Rehabilitation Center. Controls were identified from the rehabilitative units of the same facility. Controls were matched for age within 5 years, sex, race, marital status, status at time of surrogate interview (case alive or dead), and the absence of dementia. Birth in an urban versus a rural environment (OR = 16), childhood in an urban versus a rural environment (OR = 9.5), and adult life in an urban versus a rural environment (OR = 16) were associated with an increased risk to develop CDAD. The daily or weekly use of beef/pork (OR = 4) and saccharin (OR = 2.25) were associated with an increased risk to develop CDAD as was the ownership of a pet rabbit (OR = 2). Further, a history of other cancers (OR = 3) in cases with CDAD was associated with an increased risk to develop CDAD. Type A personality characteristics were found to be associated with an increased risk (?ate fast? (OR = 3.5)), ?not relaxed and easy-going? (OR = 2.25), ?always rushed? (OR = 2.00) to develop CDAD as was a history of depression (OR = 2). Due to the small sample size, statistically meaningful confidence intervals could not be calculated and our results must be confirmed in larger samples of case control pairs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of all deaths in the United States and is the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged ≥65 years. Although other major causes of death have been on the decrease, deaths because of AD have been rising dramatically. Between 2000 and 2008 (preliminary data), heart disease deaths decreased by 13%, stroke deaths by 20%, and prostate cancer-related deaths by 8%, whereas deaths because of AD increased by 66%. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD; approximately 200,000 people aged <65 years with AD comprise the younger-onset AD population. Every 69 seconds, someone in America develops AD; by 2050, the time is expected to accelerate to every 33 seconds. Over the coming decades, the baby boom population is projected to add 10 million people to these numbers. In 2050, the incidence of AD is expected to approach nearly a million people per year, with a total estimated prevalence of 11 to 16 million people. Dramatic increases in the numbers of ?oldest-old? (those aged ≥85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups will also significantly affect the numbers of people living with AD. In 2010, nearly 15 million family and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $202 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are almost 3 times higher than for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments in 2011 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people aged ≥65years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $183 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health effect of AD, including incidence and prevalence, mortality, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general. The report also examines the current state of AD detection and diagnosis, focusing on the benefits of early detection and the factors that present challenges to accurate diagnosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury is the predominant risk factor for post-traumatic osteoarthritis development (PTOA). Several non-invasive mouse models mimicking human PTOA investigate molecular mechanisms of disease development; none have characterized the inflammatory response to this acute traumatic injury. Our aim was to characterize the early inflammatory phase and later degenerative component in our in vivo non-invasive murine model of PTOA induced by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Right knees of 12-week-old C57Bl6 mice were placed in flexion at a 30° offset position and subjected to a single compressive load (12N, 1.4?mm/s) to induce ACL rupture with no obvious damage to surrounding tissues. Tissue was harvested 4?h post-injury and on days 3, 14, and 21; contralateral left knees served as controls. Histological, immunohistochemical, and gene analyzes were performed to evaluate inflammatory and degenerative changes. Immunohistochemistry revealed time-dependent expression of mature (F4/80 positive) and inflammatory (CD11b positive) macrophage populations within the sub-synovial infiltrate, developing osteophytes, and inflammation surrounding the ACL in response to injury. Up-regulation of genes encoding acute pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17, and the matrix degrading enzymes, ADAMTS-4 and MMP3 was detected in femoral cartilage, concomitant with extensive cartilage damage and bone remodelling over 21-days post-injury. Our non-invasive model describes pathologically distinct phases of the disease, increasing our understanding of inflammatory episodes, the tissues/cells producing inflammatory mediators and the early molecular changes in the joint, thereby defining the early phenotype of PTOA. This knowledge will guide appropriate interventions to delay or arrest disease progression following joint injury. ? 2018 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

AB  - Reasons for performing study Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF), causing epizootic lymphangitis (EZL), is endemic in parts of Africa including, Ethiopia, Senegal and Gambia. Despite its high prevalence, impact on animal welfare and socio-economic importance, there is little evidence upon which to build practical disease control strategies. The performance and availability of diagnostic tests currently used by clinicians is problematic. Methods such as pattern recognition of clinical signs and microscopy lack specificity and other reported methods are either not commercially available or not readily feasible in these settings (e.g. culture). This is a significant barrier to further understanding this disease within endemic countries. Objectives To validate a nested PCR method to confirm the presence of HCF in equine clinical samples. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Twenty-nine horses with suspected EZL were included from topographically varied regions of Ethiopia. Clinical data, lesion location drawn onto equine silhouettes, blood samples and aspirates of pus from cutaneous nodules were obtained before treatment provided by SPANA clinic. Blood and clinical data were collected from a further 20 horses with no cutaneous EZL lesions. Giemsa stained impression smears of pus were examined microscopically. Aliquots of heat-inactivated pus and blood were inoculated onto Whatman FTA cards and imported to the UK with Defra approved licensing. A nested PCR targeting the ITS region, was used to identify samples containing HCF and PCR products were sequenced. Results HCF was confirmed in heat-inactivated FTA card pus samples from 24 horses, additionally, 23 blood samples were positive from EZL suspected cases. Bioinfomatic analyses suggested that there was diversity within the ITS region among these HCF products. Conclusions These PCR techniques allow the rapid diagnosis of HCF directly from equine clinical samples. The identification of HCF in blood raises questions about the pathogenesis of HCF in horses and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Abstract Brewin's dual representation theory, Ehlers and Clark's cognitive appraisal model, and Dalgleish's schematic, propositional, analogue and associative representational systems model are considered in the light of recent evidence on the neural substrates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The models' proposals about the cognitive mechanism of memory dysfunction in PTSD are described and evaluated against current knowledge about the neural pathways and functions disrupted in PTSD. A dual pathway model of memory is consistent with neuroscience of memory. The appraisal model also provides an account of the top-down modulation of memory and arousal problems consistent with current neuroscientific evidence of PTSD. Dalgleish's model is less consistent with the evidence because it relies upon assumptions that cannot yet be tested neuroscientifically. All three models under-specify the causal and maintaining influence of hyperarousal relative to the role it plays in current neuroscientific models of PTSD. Implications of the evidence for improving treatment and prevention are discussed.

AB  - This article examines 3 contexts in which moderate or severe traumatic brain injury can be approached. The epidemiologic background of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury is presented, with particular attention paid to new findings from the study of a national hospital inpatient database. We review aspects of neuroimaging and how new imaging modalities can reveal fine detail about traumatic brain injury. Finally we examine the current state of neuropathologic evaluation of, and recent developments in, understanding of the neural disruptions that occur following traumatic brain injury, together with cellular reactions to these disruptions.

AB  - Abstract Background and aim To improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with diverse neurological diseases, we have elaborated specific clinical and CSF neurotransmitter patterns. Methods Neurotransmitter determinations in CSF from 1200 patients revealed abnormal values in 228 (19%) cases. In 54/228 (24%) patients, a final diagnosis was identified. Results We have reported primary (30/54, 56%) and secondary (24/54, 44%) monoamine neurotransmitter disorders. For primary deficiencies, the most frequently mutated gene was DDC (n = 9), and the others included PAH with neuropsychiatric features (n = 4), PTS (n = 5), QDPR (n = 3), SR (n = 1), and TH (n = 1). We have also identified mutations in SLC6A3, FOXG1 (n = 1 of each), MTHFR (n = 3), FOLR1, and MTHFD (n = 1 of each), for dopamine transporter, neuronal development, and folate metabolism disorders, respectively. For secondary deficiencies, we have identified POLG (n = 3), ACSF3 (n = 1), NFU1, and SDHD (n = 1 of each), playing a role in mitochondrial function. Other mutated genes included: ADAR, RNASEH2B, RNASET2, SLC7A2-IT1 A/B lncRNA, and EXOSC3 involved in nuclear and cytoplasmic metabolism; RanBP2 and CASK implicated in post-traductional and scaffolding modifications; SLC6A19 regulating amino acid transport; MTM1, KCNQ2 (n = 2), and ATP1A3 playing a role in nerve cell electrophysiological state. Chromosome abnormalities, del(8)(p23)/dup(12) (p23) (n = 1), del(6)(q21) (n = 1), dup(17)(p13.3) (n = 1), and non-genetic etiologies (n = 3) were also identified. Conclusion We have classified the final 54 diagnoses in 11 distinctive biochemical profiles and described them through 20 clinical features. To identify the specific molecular cause of abnormal NT profiles, (targeted) genomics might be used, to improve diagnosis and allow early treatment of complex and rare neurological genetic diseases.

AB  - Aim Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported to predict survival in several types of malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate their predictive value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We retrospectively analyzed plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer levels from 252 subjects: control (n?=?20), hepatitis (n?=?20), cirrhosis (n?=?20), and HCC (n?=?192) subjects. The clinical involvement and prognostic value of fibrinogen and D-dimer was analyzed in HCC subjects. To confirm the effects of tumor on hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured in nude mice following HCC inoculation. Results Fibrinogen decreased and D-dimer increased in cirrhosis subjects relative to other groups. In HCC subjects, elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were significantly associated with adverse tumor features (increased size, stage, and grade) and systemic inflammation. Patients with HCC with either elevated fibrinogen or D-dimer levels had significantly higher 3-year tumor recurrence rates (65% vs. 41%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 67% vs. 40%, P?=?0.011 for D-dimer) and significantly lower 3-year overall survival rates (57% vs. 79%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 56% vs. 80%, P?=?0.001 for D-dimer). After multivariate analysis, elevated fibrinogen levels remained an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Finally, elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were confirmed in nude mice following tumor inoculation. Conclusion The fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, elevating after carcinogenesis, may serve as simple but effective predictors of adverse tumor profiles and outcomes in HCC.
