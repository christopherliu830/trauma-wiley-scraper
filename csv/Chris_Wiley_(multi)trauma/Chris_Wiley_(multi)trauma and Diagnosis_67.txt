AB  - Abstract Purpose: To use a new approach which provides, based on the widely used three-dimensional double-echo steady-state (DESS) sequence, in addition to the morphological information, the generation of biochemical T2 maps in one hybrid sequence. Materials and Methods: In 50 consecutive MRIs at 3.0 Tesla (T) after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) of the knee, by the use this new DESS-T2d approach, the morphological Magnetic resonance Observation of CArtilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score, as well as biochemical T2d values were assessed. Furthermore, these results were correlated to standard morphological sequences as well as to standard multi-echo spin-echo T2 mapping. Results: The MOCART score correlated (Pearson:0.945; P < 0.001) significantly as assessed with standard morphological sequences (68.8 ± 13.2) and the morphological images of the DESS T2d sequence (68.7 ± 12.6). T2 and T2d relaxation times (ms) were comparable in between the control cartilage (T2: 52.5 ± 11.4; T2d: 46.6 ± 10.3) and the repair tissue (T2: 54.4 ± 11.4; T2d: 47.5 ± 13.0) (T2: P = 0.157; T2d: P = 0.589). As expected, T2d values were lower than the standard-T2 values, however, both functional relaxation times correlated significantly (Pearson:0.429; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The presented hybrid approach provides the possibility to combine morphological and biochemical MRI in one fast 3D sequence, and thus, may attract for the clinical use of biochemical MRI.

AB  - Abstract Cognitive deficits after a traumatic brain injury can result in significant functional limitations in all areas of daily living. An individual's ability to generalize learning may be limited, thus making it harder to live independently in the community. Assessing a client's metacognitive skills and awareness level may help to establish a baseline understanding about the supervision required and the most suitable living arrangements. This study describes a multicontextual, community re-entry occupational therapy programme directed at awareness training and compensation for cognitive problems in a 34-year-old man with traumatic brain injury. Intervention consisted of metacognitive training, exploration and use of effective processing strategies, task gradations and practice of functional activities in multiple environmental contexts. Strategies such as self-prediction, self-monitoring, role reversal and the use of checklists were used. Results after six months of intervention show improvements in the client's awareness level, enhancement of his occupational function, increased satisfaction with performance and a decrease in the level of attendant care. Additional studies are recommended to validate the findings. Copyright ? 2001 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: To test whether chronic stress, interpersonal relatedness, and cognitive burden could explain depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: A nonprobability sample of 75 mild-to-moderately injured TBI survivors and their significant others, were recruited from five TBI day-rehabilitation programs. All participants were within 2 years of the date of injury and were living in the community. Methods: During face-to-face interviews, demographic information, and estimates of brain injury severity were obtained and participants completed a cognitive battery of tests of directed attention and short-term memory, responses to the Perceived Stress Scale, Interpersonal Relatedness Inventory, Sense of Belonging Instrument, Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory, and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale;. Findings: Chronic stress was significantly and positively related to post-TBI depression. Depression and postinjury sense of belonging were negatively related. Social support and results from the cognitive battery did not explain depression. Conclusions: Postinjury chronic stress and sense of belonging were strong predictors of post-injury depression and are variables amenable to interventions by nurses in community health, neurological centers, or rehabilitation clinics. Future studies are needed to examine how these variables change over time during the recovery process.

AB  - Abstract Background Few prospective studies about early loading of short implant have been available and very little evidence exists on the outcomes longer than 3 years. Purpose To assess clinical and radiographic outcomes of 6 mm-short implants placed in the posterior maxilla and mandible applying an early loading protocol. Materials and methods Ninety-five short implants (6 mm-short, ? 4 mm) were placed in 45 subjects at 3 study sites, 2 or 3 implants per subject, using a one-stage surgical procedure and loaded with a screw-retained splinted fixed prosthesis 6 weeks later. Follow-up took place at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after loading. Marginal bone level changes, implant survival, clinical variables, and adverse events were assessed. Results The survival rate for all implants placed was 95.8%. From implant loading to 3 years follow-up, mean marginal bone level changes were minimal (0.07?±?0.49 mm) and the peri-implant soft tissue status was healthy. No major technical or biological complications occurred except for the 4 early implant losses. Conclusion Three-year data indicates that the use of splinted 6 mm-short implants is a viable treatment in posterior regions with low marginal bone resorption. Early loading after 6 weeks should be taken cautiously in patients with known risk factors.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) uses x-ray beams and reconstructive computer technology to create tomographic slices (sections) of the area being imaged. Computed tomography has higher contrast resolution than conventional radiography allowing for more accurate differentiation of soft tissues and fluids. This form of 3D imaging removes problems caused by superimposition of multiple anatomical structures, which is a major impediment when viewing radiographs of the equine head. Once the images are acquired, multi-planar and 3D reconstructions can be performed to view different teeth or associated structures in an optimal way. Anatomical and pathological changes in the dental tissues, periodontal tissues, alveolar bone and adjacent sinuses can then be assessed. Scintigraphy with 99m technetium methyl-diphosphate (methylene-diphosphonate) can detect changes in bone that precede radiographic changes, and this makes it a very useful imaging modality for diagnosis of early periapical infection of the equine cheek teeth. Additionally, it is invaluable for imaging suspected infections of supernumerary or dysplastic teeth where the results of radiography or even CT may be equivocal. Periapical infections of the cheek teeth typically result in focal and intense increased radionuclide uptake located over the apical region of the affected tooth.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder is a long-lasting psychiatric disease after the traumatic experience of severe fatal stress with the consequence of hippocampal atrophy. Freezing behaviors were more than quintupled on the fear-conditioning test in mice previously subjected to water immersion restrain stress (WIRS) with metronome tones when determined 1?28?days after WIRS, while these mice exhibited the increased immobility time on the forced swimming test with the increased spontaneous locomotion. Prior experience of WIRS led to a transient decrease in subsequent 5-bromo-2?-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into proliferating cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. These behavioral and neurochemical alterations were significantly prevented by the daily injection of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, respectively. Moreover, WIRS significantly decreased the number of cells holding BrdU without affecting the differentiation ratio to astroglial and neuronal lineages 28?days later. Prior administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist significantly prevented the aforementioned changes by WIRS. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may play a role in mechanisms underlying the crisis of a variety of psychiatric symptoms relevant to post-traumatic stress disorder through transient suppression of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the murine hippocampal dentate gyrus.

AB  - Abstract Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffer from a failure of cognitive control over emotional distracters. The physiological substrates of cognitive-emotional interactions and their breakdown in disease are, however, unknown. Here, we studied brain activity in PTSD patients and healthy controls in response to emotion-provoking pictures using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrate that in healthy individuals, emotion-induced frontal theta rhythm modulates activity in the beta rhythm mainly in sensory-motor regions. In contrast, in PTSD patients, beta activity is elevated irrespective of emotion, and is not modulated by frontal theta activity in response to negative emotion. EEG source localization and fMRI findings suggest that theta activity is localized to the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices while beta activity is localized to sensory-motor regions. We further found that beta activity in sensory-motor regions is related to the emotion-induced slowing of the motor response in healthy controls while the excess frontal theta activity in PTSD is related to the intensity of negative emotional experience. These findings reveal for the first time the importance of brain electrical oscillations and coherence in emotional top-down modulation and point to specific failure of these mechanisms in PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Objective To characterise patients presenting to EDs for a bicycle-related injury, identify contributing factors to the injuries and describe the data gaps. Methods A retrospective study of bicycle-related injury presentations over the 5 year period 2010?2014 to two major metropolitan EDs. Data collected from the emergency presentation database consisted of patient demographics, presenting complaint, discharge diagnosis and details about the circumstances and mechanism of the accident. Results Bicycle injuries (n =?4144) increased from 20.0 to 25.2 per 1000 injury presentations over 5 years. Patients were 80% male across all age groups and 35% of presentations occurred at the weekend. Fractures accounted for one-third (34%) of all injuries, while injuries to the upper extremities and head resulted in 36% and 19% of cases, respectively. Admission rate was 17%. The number of falls exceeded collisions (1611 vs 937), and in the 13.3% of the fall cases where documentation was present for which how the fall occurred, over half were attributed to bike handling errors. Information related to type of bicycle, accident location, type of activity, protective clothing worn (including helmets) and visibility aids was not recorded for over 95% of the cases. Conclusion Bicycle injuries carry a considerable burden to the ED and the incidence of presentations appears to be rising. The current triage data, designed to provide a rapid assessment for medical urgency, are limited to describing broad demographics, trends and causes.

AB  - Summary Background Early results from the use of neuromodulation by percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in horses were promising but lacked sufficient case numbers and long-term follow-up. The neuromodulatory procedure has since been established as EquiPENS?. Objectives The aim of this study was to report long-term results from a larger number of cases and to investigate for predictors of outcome. Study design Prospective case series using international, multi-centre data. Methods Eligible cases were horses with a veterinary diagnosis of trigeminal-mediated headshaking, which received EquiPENS? neuromodulation at trained centres between August 2013 and November 2017. The standard protocol was an initial three-procedure course, with additional procedures should a horse go into remission but then relapse. Data collected included signalment, history, diagnostic tests performed, details of any complications, whether horses had gone into remission and the length of remission. Results Results were obtained from 168 horses, with 530 procedures. The complication rate was 8.8% of procedures. In all but one case, complications were mild and transient, without self-trauma. Remission of headshaking following the initial course occurred in 53% (72/136) of horses. Median length of time recorded in remission was 9.5 weeks (range 2 days to 156 weeks ongoing). Where signs recurred, most horses went back into remission following additional procedures, usually for longer than from the previous procedure. No predictors for outcome were determined. Main limitations No placebo or control group, owner-assessed results. Conclusions EquiPENS? neuromodulation can be an effective and safe treatment for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in some horses. An increased understanding of neuromodulation could help optimise the technique. Advances in treatment for trigeminal-mediated headshaking will remain limited until there is a greater understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the condition.

AB  - This study aimed to assess whether the combination of a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level with various noninvasive hemodynamic parameters can help physicians more quickly and accurately diagnose congestive heart failure and determine the type of left ventricular dysfunction present in patients presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea. Subjects were 98 men (aged 64.57±1.23 years) that presented to the VA San Diego Healthcare System. Hemodynamic parameters were measured using impedance cardiography, and BNP levels were quantified using a rapid immunoassay. All patients with a BNP <100 pg/mL (n=37) had no evidence of congestive heart failure 97% of the time. In those with a BNP >100 pg/mL (601 ±55 pg/mL; n=61), a cardiac index of 2.6 L/min/m2 is 65% sensitive and 88% specific in determining systolic dysfunction. In patients with a BNP >100 pg/mL, a multivariate model consisting of noninvasive hemodynamic measurements was able to predict cardiac deaths, readmissions, and emergency department visits within 90 days with 83% accuracy. The authors conclude that, in patients presenting to an emergency department with dyspnea, the addition of impedance cardiography measurements to BNP level measurements will more effectively diagnose congestive heart failure and determine both the type of heart dysfunction and the severity of illness.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate diagnostic utility of aqueous humor analysis in animals with anterior uveitis. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 12) and cats (n = 10). Procedures Examination findings and diagnostic test results including aqueous humor cytology were compared. Results Disease duration prior to aqueocentesis was not significantly different between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those with an etiologic diagnosis, but was shorter in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) than those with idiopathic uveitis. Microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against them were seldom found in blood/serum; however, serum feline coronavirus titers ≥1:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. Aqueous humor cytology was diagnostic in no cats and two dogs, both with neoplasia. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequent in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP-associated uveitis. Cytologically assessed plasma cell number was correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. Clinically detectable hyphema and cytologic erythrocyte number were correlated. However, cytologic cell grades and clinical grade of flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber were not correlated. Conclusions Aqueous humor cytology permitted diagnosis of neoplasia in dogs with anterior uveitis but was generally not helpful in cats. Poor correlation between clinical and cytologic assessment of cell numbers and type within the anterior chamber dictates that clinical grading should not be the sole criterion for electing to perform aqueocentesis.

AB  - Summary Musculoskeletal imaging has advanced leaps and bounds from the time Roentgen utilized X-rays to obtain a plain radiograph in 1895. This chapter outlines the modalities commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging, including plain radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound (US). It discusses the applications of the above modalities in the diagnosis and management of traumatic injuries, infection, arthritis, and tumors. Plain radiography is a two-dimensional depiction of three-dimensional structures and as such, evaluation of complex areas such as the foot, pelvis, and spine can be suboptimal. CT is also useful for assessment of nontraumatic pathologies like arthritis. MRI is one of the more commonly used imaging modalities in musculoskeletal imaging. US is also useful in dynamic assessment of tendons, ligaments, and joints. Imaging plays a vital role in assessment of musculoskeletal trauma. Musculoskeletal tumors comprise benign and malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors.

AB  - Summary This chapter illustrates the point that through the process of educating people on behavioral finance, one can help clients understand and improve their investor behavior. If behavioral finance were to be used by a large number of financial market participants (FMPs) to create better investment portfolios, three key challenges needed to be tackled. First, financial advisors need a guidebook to teach them the basics of what behavioral biases are and how to diagnose their client's irrational behaviors. Second, even if advisors can diagnose a client's biases, they need to know what to do with that information. Third, the industry needs a common behavioral finance language. An investor's background, past experiences, and attitudes can play a significant role in decisions made during the asset allocation process. It is important to note that because psychology is involved, no exact diagnosis can be made of any individual or situation.

AB  - Abstract Background:? In surgical patients, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are often measured as a marker of inflammation and infection. However, the diagnostic and prognostic value of a single initial CRP measurement in the acute presentation has not been well established. This study was performed to investigate the usefulness of measuring CRP in such a setting. Methods:? CRP levels were measured retrospectively in 473 surgical patients who presented to the Royal Adelaide Hospital emergency department. This was correlated with patient outcomes, defined by the need for imaging tests and/or surgical interventions, the length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality. Spearman's rank correlation and one-way analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis. Results:? Of 473 patients, 42% had a CRP test in the emergency department within 24?h of admission. Approximately 80% of patients required imaging for diagnosis and 40% required surgery, regardless of the initial CRP level. No correlation was evident between initial CRP level and length of hospital stay (r= 0.06). One-way analysis of variance revealed no variation in levels between patients who required imaging or had surgery compared to those who did not, with P-values of 0.76 and 0.85, respectively. Two patients died within 30 days of presentation. Conclusions:? CRP has poor diagnostic and prognostic capabilities as a single initial measurement in acute surgical patients. The statistical analyses imply that CRP levels are unable to accurately predict outcomes of such patients. Therefore, we suggest that CRP should not be used as a routine screening tool.

AB  - Abstract Ankle and foot injuries are the most common musculoskeletal injuries presenting to Australian EDs and are associated with a large societal and economic impact. The quality of ED care provided to patients with ankle and foot fractures or soft tissue injuries is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common ankle and foot injuries in the ED. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English language articles published in the last 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 1242 articles, of which 71 were included in the review (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?35 systematic reviews and n?=?14 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the ankle and foot in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. Following a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of the Ottawa ankle rules, ED clinicians should not only provide a diagnosis, but rate the severity of soft tissue injuries, or stability of fractures and dislocations, which are the pivotal decision points in guiding ED treatment, specialist referral and the follow-up plan.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Brush cytology, the conventional method to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma, has been plagued by low diagnostic sensitivity and false-negative results. This paper aims to study the clinical utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in enhancing identification of malignant biliary strictures. Methods Brush cytologic specimens collected from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliary strictures in a tertiary hospital in Singapore from March 2013 to July 2015 were examined by FISH technique using UroVysion probe set in this study. Results Thirty patients were chosen with five patients having multiple FISH performed due to indeterminate results. The diagnoses for biliary strictures were 13 (43.3%) cholangiocarcinomas, seven (23.3%) pancreatic cancers, seven (23.3%) benign biliary strictures, and three (10%) primary sclerosing cholangitis. Conventional brush cytology had sensitivity of 53.8% with specificity of 82.4%. FISH had sensitivity of 30.8% with specificity of 100%. When FISH results were interpreted in cases with negative or atypical brush cytology, two patients had positive FISH results and cholangiocarcinomas. Based on this pilot study, FISH increased sensitivity of brush cytology in detection of cholangiocarcinoma from 53.8% to 69.2% while preserving specificity of 82.4%. Conclusion Compared with conventional cytology with low sensitivity, FISH may help to increase sensitivity on top of brush cytology while maintaining high specificity.

AB  - This paper addresses the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of increased probing depths. In general, in untreated and treated patients, when deep and shallow probing depths are compared, the data indicate that deep sites are associated with increased bleeding upon probing, elevated subgingival temperatures, higher levels of pathogens, more probing errors, a greater amount of infiltrated connective tissue, reduced ability to remove subgingival deposits with root planing, and diminished effectiveness of oral hygiene to alter the subgingival microbiota. Clinical trials demonstrate that probing depth is not a good predictor of future disease progression. However, deep sites are at greater risk of disease progression than shallow sites in untreated and treated patients. Furthermore, the deeper the probing depth, the greater the risk of future disease progression. Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates that it is advantageous, but not always necessary, for patients to have shallow probing depths. With regards to surgical reduction of probing depths beyond that attained with non-surgical therapy, clinicians need to consider the advantages (e.g., ease of maintenance, reduced risk of disease progression) and disadvantages (e.g., root sensitivity, cosmetic defects) of treatment procedures. Since numerous variables require consideration (e.g., response to root planing, goals of therapy, acceptable level of risk for future disease progression), treatment decisions will vary depending on the patient and the desired clinical outcome at specific sites.
