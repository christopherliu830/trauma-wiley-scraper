AB  - A case of central nervous system protothecosis in a dog is reported. A three-year-old male Maremma sheepdog was referred with a two month history of diarrhoea associated with progressive tetraparesis, depression and right circling. Stupor, severe proprioceptive deficits, bilateral decreased thoracic limb flexor reflexes and bilateral deficit of the menace reaction were detected on neurological examination and a multi-focal neurological localisation was suspected. Histopathological evaluation revealed multi-focal granulomatous foci in the thalamus, hippocampus and caudal brainstem containing numerous oval-rounded organisms with a thick, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and Gomori?s methenamine silver-positive cell wall, a basophilic cytoplasm and one nucleus. Scattered sporangia containing two to four endospores were also observed. Morphological features were consistent with Prototheca species. Ultrastructurally, numerous degenerated algae were present within macrophages mainly lacking nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. Generally, protothecosis in dogs is characterised by systemic signs because of a multi-organ involvement, and haemorrhagic colitis or ophthalmologic signs are the most frequent presenting signs. However, protothecosis should be added, also in Europe, to the list of the differential diagnoses in adult dogs with a multi-focal neurological localisation even in absence of other clinical signs.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the population-based incidence and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalised traumatic brain injury (TBI) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods: One-year statewide hospital admission data from the NSW Department of Health were analysed. TBI cases were identified using a combination of TBI-related diagnostic and external cause codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10th Revision). Sociodemographics, causes, associated factors, severity and medical details of hospitalisation were examined. Results: There were 6,827 hospitalised TBI cases that met review criteria. Incidence rate was 99.1/100,000 population. Incidence in persons older than 75 years of age and residents in remote areas was three times higher. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were 1.7 times more likely to sustain a TBI than the general population, and risk was greater for all NSW residents from areas that were remote and disadvantaged-socioeconomically. Older adults and those with severe injuries showed prolonged hospitalisation, higher morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: Overall TBI incidence in NSW is lower than international estimates. Nevertheless, groups with higher incidence rates and/or poor in-hospital outcomes were identified, highlighting directions for prevention and future research. Implications for public health: There is a need for identifying risk factors/barriers and assessing the impact of recent policies on these population groups.

AB  - Aim Blunt injuries to visceral organs have the potential to lead to delayed pseudoaneurysm formation or organ rupture, but current trauma and surgical guidelines do not recommend repetitive imaging. This study examined the incidence and timing of delayed undesirable events and established advisable timing for follow-up imaging and appropriate observational admission. Methods Patients with blunt splenic (S), liver (L), or kidney (K) injury treated with non-operative management (NOM) in our institution were included and retrospectively reviewed. Results From January 2013 to January 2017, 57 patients were admitted with documented blunt visceral organ injuries and 22 patients were excluded. Of 35 patients (L, 10; S, 17; K, 6; L  S  S, 9; K, 1) patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization. Delayed undesirable events occurred in four patients: three patients with splenic pseudoaneurysm on hospital day 6?7 and one patient with splenic delayed rupture on hospital day 7. The second follow-up computed tomography scan carried out 1?2 days after admission did not show any significant findings that could help predict undesirable results of delayed events. The patients with delayed events had longer continuous abdominal pain than that of event-free patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions Undesirable delayed events were recognized on follow-up computed tomography scans in 11.4% of NOM patients at hospital day 6?7 and tended to be associated with high-grade splenic injuries and continuous symptoms. Repetitive screening of these patients 6?7 days after injury might be warranted because of the potential risk of delayed events.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract The DC: 0?3 Assessment Protocol Project, an initiative of ZERO-TO-THREE's diagnostic classification task force, was undertaken in response to the need for an assessment strategy that would support DC: 0?3 diagnostic formulation for both clinicians and researchers. The Project Workgroup developed and pilot tested an assessment protocol that would: (1) define a sufficiently comprehensive information set to direct and organize observations for clinicians and researchers to systematically assign diagnoses and evaluate interrater agreement with respect to DC: 0?3 and DMS-IV diagnoses; (2) be flexible enough for use in different settings; and (3) offer potential benefit to participating children and families. The DC: 0?3 Assessment Protocol employs observational strategies, multiple visits, and a multimethod approach to assessment that emphasizes the importance of obtaining information about how a young child's behavior varies across observational contexts and with different caregivers. Based on results of pilot testing the protocol, Workgroup members agreed on the need for futher clarification of the criteria for the diagnoses on Axis I, for differentiating Axis I disorders that reside in the child from Axis II disorders conceptualized as disrupted or disordered relationships, and on the need for refinement of Axis V. Implications for clinical practice, training, and research are discussed.??2003 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - Background:? We examined the prevalence and nature of comorbid post-traumatic stress reactions and depressive symptoms, and the impact of exposure to traumatic events on both types of psychopathology, among Palestinian children during war conflict in the region. Methods:? The 403 children aged 9?15 years, who lived in four refugee camps, were assessed by completing the Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI), and the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Results:? Children reported experiencing a wide range of traumatic events, both direct experience of violence and through the media. CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were significantly correlated. Both CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were independently predicted by the number of experienced traumatic events, and this association remained after adjusting for socioeconomic variables. Exposure to traumatic events strongly predicted MFQ scores while controlling for CPTSD-RI scores. In contrast, the association between traumatic events and CPTSD-RI scores, while controlling for MFQ scores, was weak. The CPTSD-RI items whose frequency was significantly associated with total MFQ scores were: sleep disturbance, somatic complaints, constricted affect, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration. However, not all remaining CPTSD-RI items were significantly associated with exposure to traumatic events, thus raising the possibility that the association between depression and PTSD was due in part to symptom overlap. Conclusions:? Children living in war zones are at high risk of suffering from PTSD and depressive disorders. Exposure to trauma was not found to have a unique association with PTSD. The relationship between PTSD and depressive symptomatology requires further investigation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To perform a retrospective audit of cases of uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM) at The Canberra Hospital and review of recent literature reporting pregnancies occurring after the diagnosis of UAVM aiming to devise a diagnostic and treatment protocol to optimise pregnancy post UAVM. Methods: A retrospective audit of cases of UAVM at the Canberra Hospital from a prospectively managed patient database was performed. A search of the electronic database PubMed, for articles between 2000?2011 relating to pregnancy post UAVM. Individual case studies were analysed separately to case series. Results: The study included 28 individual studies and five case series (61 women). Average age was 29.5 ± 6.7 (range 18?42). Most women (24, 85.7%, 100% in case series) presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding; 11 (41%) individuals presented post interruption of pregnancy. All women had had a previous pregnancy (mean gravidity 3.1 ± 3.1, range 1?15 for case studies) and only four women (14.2 %) had no history of uterine trauma. Only one woman (3.6 %) did not have any ultrasound and most women underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography (20, 71.4% in case studies; 61, 83.6% in case series). Of the women, 72 (53.6 % of case studies, 78.1 % of case series) were treated with uterine artery embolisation, seven (25%) were treated expectantly. A total of 63 pregnancies occurred post treatment, seven (13.9%) ending in miscarriage. Average time to conceive post diagnosis was 19 months ± 16.3 (range 2?72). A total of 54 healthy infants were born to mothers post AVM diagnosis. Conclusion: UAVM are likely to exist on a continuum with other pregnancy related pathologies, such as sub involution of the placental bed, making a single best diagnostic and treatment plan difficult. However, this study shows that successful uncomplicated pregnancy is achievable for women after the diagnosis of UAVM.

AB  - ABSTRACT We report our experience of 42 patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrating intrinsic lesions of the spinal cord, excluding those secondary to spondylosis, trauma or congenital malformations. Histological confirmation of the radiological diagnosis was obtained in 15 (36%). MRI is more sensitive than either myelography or CT. MRI identified a previously non-visualised lesion in 17 of 30 cases. In a further 13 cases, MRI contributed by identifying associated features such as cysts and haemorrhage which have aided in the diagnosis and management of the patients. The last 12 cases, which were patients with multiple sclerosis, had MRI as the only neuroradiological examination. These illustrate a range of appearances. The overlap of imaging appearances of the various pathologies implies that a useful diagnosis and differential can only be offered by considering the MRI appearances of a lesion, with its associated features, with the clinical presentation, and with other imaging modalities where appropriate.

AB  - Summary Cyathostomins represent a potential cause of equine morbidity and have become the main focus of endoparasite control in managed horses. All grazing horses are at risk of infection with cyathostomins; therefore, the application of appropriate management measures is essential. Anthelmintics currently comprise the main method of control for equine nematodes and the ready availability of these products in some countries has resulted in their use becoming dissociated from veterinary involvement. This is concerning given the levels of anthelmintic resistance that have been recorded in cyathostomin populations. It is important that veterinarians re-establish control over the implementation of parasite control programmes, a major objective of which should be the preservation of anthelmintic efficacy. This article details the principles of cyathostomin control in horses with particular reference to anthelmintic resistance, and the use and interpretation of diagnostic tests for detecting cyathostomins and identifying anthelmintic resistance.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of suspected instability in dogs with vertebral fractures or subluxations. Eleven dogs that had MRI examinations of the spine prior to surgical stabilization of vertebral fractures and/or subluxations were included in the study. Nine dogs also had survey radiographs. Four dogs had cervical fracture or fracture-subluxation and presented with tetraplegia with intact nociception (n = 2) or nonambulatory tetraparesis (n = 2). Seven dogs had thoracolumbar fracture-subluxation or subluxation and presented with paraplegia with intact nociception (n = 5) or nonambulatory paraparesis (n = 2). A three-compartment model was applied to the interpretation of both the radiographic and MRI studies. Radiography identified compartmental disruption consistent with spinal instability in seven out of the nine cases radiographed. In MRI studies, rupture of the supportive soft tissue structures and/or fracture in at least two compartments could be visualized. Nine cases had spinal cord changes on MRI including signal intensity changes, swelling, compression, and intramedullary hemorrhage. Paravertebral muscle intensity changes were also visible at each trauma site. Magnetic resonance imaging provided helpful information on the location and extent of damage to supportive soft tissue structures and enabled assessment of spinal cord injury in this group of dogs with surgically confirmed vertebral fractures and subluxations.

AB  - Objective: To describe the radiographic appearance of pulmonary oedema in cats with cardiac failure. Methods: Thoracic radiographs of 23 cats presented to a first opinion practice with signs of cardiac failure were reviewed. All cats had tachypnoea and/or dyspnoea and enlarged left atrium on echocardiography. Results: Pulmonary oedema was characterised radiographically by an increased opacity associated with a range of patterns and variable distribution. All cats had evidence of a reticular or granular interstitial pattern. This occurred in combination with alveolar pattern in 19 (83 per cent) cats, including six with air bronchograms, with increased diameter of pulmonary vessels in 16 (71 per cent) cats and with bronchial pattern in 14 (61 per cent) cats. The distribution of pulmonary oedema was considered to be diffuse/non-uniform in 14 (61 per cent) cats, diffuse/uniform in four (17 per cent) cats, multi-focal in four (17 per cent) cats and focal in the remaining one (4 per cent). Nine (39 per cent) cats were considered to have a regional distribution of oedema, including five (22 per cent) with a ventral distribution, three (13 per cent) with a caudal distribution and one (4 per cent) cat with a hilar distribution. The distribution of pulmonary opacities was bilaterally symmetrical in five (22 per cent) cats. Clinical Significance: The variable appearance of feline pulmonary oedema is likely to complicate its radiographic diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract The authors examined the effectiveness of narrative exposure therapy for children (KIDNET) in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugee children living in exile. Twenty-six children traumatized by organized violence were randomly assigned to KIDNET or to a waiting list. Significant treatment by time interactions on all PTSD-relevant variables indicated that the KIDNET group, but not the controls, showed a clinically significant improvement in symptoms and functioning. Success of the KIDNET group remained stable at 12-month follow-up. This study confirms previous findings that, if left untreated, PTSD in children may persist for an extended period. However, it also shows that it is possible to effectively treat chronic PTSD and restore functioning in traumatized refugee children in only 8 treatment sessions.

AB  - Comorbidity of substance use disorders with physical and mental disorders was investigated among 1249 consecutive psychiatric consultation patients admitted to six general hospitals in Finland. Of the patients 354 (28%) were diagnosed with substance use disorders (ICD-10), of which 22% were due to use of at least two different types of psychoactive substances. Alcohol dependence (117/226) in male patients and acute drug intoxication (49/128) at a similar rate as alcohol dependence (44/128) in female patients were the most common clinical conditions. With few exceptions, all substance use disorders were comorbid and in 63% of affected patients comprised a ?triple diagnosis? (i.e., physical, mental, and substance use diagnoses concurrently). Poisonings and personality disorders in both sexes, digestive system diseases in men, and injuries in women were related to substance use disorders. Conclusions for service provision were: (1) the high level of co-occurrence of physical and mental disorders with substance use disorders calls for comprehensive, multi-disciplinary assessment of any substance use problems ascertained in psychiatric consultations; (2) poisoning with substance use involvement and mental comorbidity was the most common combined clinical condition justifying provision of addiction psychiatric emergency consultations in general hospitals; (3) polydrug use indicating severe problems and complex treatment needs should be identified; and (4) psychiatric referrals of patients with physical alcohol-related disorders should be ensured in general hospitals.

The most important risk factors for VTE are a history of previous VTE, recent surgery, hospital in-patient stay and cancer. Pulmonary embolism remains the most widely reported preventable cause of death in patients undergoing surgery. It is the most common cause of death within 30 days of surgery, with 40% of VTE events occurring later than three weeks post operatively. Patients undergoing lower limb surgery are among the highest risk patients (odds ratio?>?10), and this includes total hip and knee arthroplasty, hip/leg fractures, major orthopaedic trauma and spinal surgery. Lower limb immobilisation in casts, with or without surgery, increases the risk of VTE. Approximately 70-80% of fatal hospital-acquired thrombosis (HAT) occurs in medical patients. Venous thrombosis is increased in most acute medical conditions, necessitating hospital admission.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome and owner satisfaction after planectomy for nasal planum neoplasia with cosmetic reconstruction with bilateral labial mucocutaneous rotation flaps in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Twenty-six client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records were searched for dogs that had undergone the procedure. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery, complications, requirement for revision surgery, recurrence, and survival information were recorded. Owners were contacted by telephone about their dog's quality of life after the procedure and their satisfaction with their dog's outcome. Results Twenty-five dogs underwent radical planectomy, and 1 dog underwent resection of the nasal planum. Twenty-four dogs had a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, 1 had a diagnosis of atypical adenocarcinoma, and 1 had a diagnosis of a mast cell tumor. Complications occurred in 19 (73%) dogs, with 9 dogs requiring revision surgery; 1 dog not surviving to discharge. Median survival time was 1542 days (range, 3-2010). Recurrence of the primary tumor was suspected in 2 (7.7%) dogs, both with narrow or incomplete excision. Among 11 owners interviewed, 10 were satisfied with their dog's appearance, and 8 reported they would consent to the procedure again. Conclusion Dehiscence was common after this procedure, but local tumor control and survival times were excellent. Owner satisfaction was high, although preoperative client education is vital. Clinical significance This technique should be considered as a viable option for dogs with nasal planum neoplasia given the high rate of recurrence with less aggressive treatment. Complications common following surgery, but do not persist long term and survival times were excellent.

AB  - Voting is the foundation of democracy. Limited data exist about voting characteristics of individuals with neurologic impairment including those living with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). To statistically examine voting characteristics using a convenience sample of registered voters with TBI during elections held in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina?2007, 2008. Data were collected on 51 participants with TBI during May 2007, 2008 general, and 2008 Presidential Election. (i) There was a significant difference between the Competence Assessment Tool for Voting (CAT-V) total score of participants with TBI who voted and the CAT-V total score of participants with TBI who did not vote and the CAT-V total score predicted voting; (ii) the age of the participants with TBI was predictive of voting; and (iii) being married was inversely related to voting. We find that there is variation in voting even among this small sample interviewed for the present study, and that the variation is predictable. Those with the highest CAT-Vs are most likely to vote. In addition, we find that traditional predictors of voting simply are not predictors among this TBI group, and even one, whether the person is married, has a negative effect on voting.
