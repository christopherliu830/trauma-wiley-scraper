AB  - SUMMARY Fifty-seven patients (45 males, 12 females) with a clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were serially evaluated by ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT). Thirty patients had a single study, 18 had one follow-up study while 9 had two follow-up studies. The aetiology was gallstone disease in 26% of patients and a history of chronic alcohol abuse in only 16%. No cause could be identified in 47% of patients; 22% of US scans were unsatisfactory for the evaluation of pancreas whereas CT was uniformly satisfactory. Peripancreatic inflammation was detected in only 29% patients on US compared with 91% on CT. Pancreatic abscesses were detected in 8 patients on CT and gas was present in all of them. Fourteen patients underwent guided interventional procedures (US, 12; CT, 2). On follow up after 3 months, worsening of inflammation was detected in 11% patients on CT, which was not detected on US. It is concluded from this study that CT is far superior to US in the evaluation of acute pancreatitis, detection of peripancreatic inflammation and its extension into the retroperitoneal compartments and mesentery, and also for the evaluation of fluid collections, haemorrhage and abscesses. However, US provides easy guidance for percutaneous interventional procedures and can be used for follow-up scans.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder remains the most significant psychiatric condition associated with exposure to a traumatic event, though rates of traumatic event exposure far outstrip incidence of PTSD. Mitochondrial dysfunction and suboptimal mitochondrial function have been increasingly implicated in several psychopathologies, and recent genetic studies have similarly suggested a pathogenic role of mitochondria in PTSD. Mitochondria play a central role in several physiologic processes underlying PTSD symptomatology, including abnormal fear learning, brain network activation, synaptic plasticity, steroidogenesis, and inflammation. Here we outline several potential mechanisms by which inherited (genetic) or acquired (environmental) mitochondrial dysfunction or suboptimal mitochondrial function, may contribute to PTSD symptomatology and increase susceptibility to PTSD. The proposed pathogenic role of mitochondria in the pathophysiology of PTSD has important implications for prevention and therapy, as antidepressants commonly prescribed for patients with PTSD have been shown to inhibit mitochondrial function, while alternative therapies shown to improve mitochondrial function may prove more efficacious.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of serum fibronectin and serum somatomedin-C as nutritional markers during enteral nutrition support (ENS) of critically ill, traumatized patients using an enteral product containing high concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Twelve critically injured patients received a standard enteral formula with 30 g of a 44% branched-chain amino acid supplement added to each liter of formula. Fibronectin concentration, somatomedin-C concentration, and nitrogen balance were measured on study days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 or until adequate oral intake began. Both fibronectin and somatomedin-C concentrations increased significantly from baseline by day 7 of ENS. Nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline by day 4. On days 14 and 21, only somatomedin-C and nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline. Nitrogen balance was significantly correlated with somatomedin-C concentration (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01), cumulative caloric intake (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01), and cumulative nitrogen intake (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that serum somatomedin-C is useful and serum fibronectin has potential in monitoring nutrition support response in critically ill, traumatized patients.

AB  - To review the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults after moderate to severe TBI. A systematic literature search was conducted on literature published up to December 2018 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and PsychInfo. A systematic review of the identified literature was based on PRISMA guidelines. Risk of Bias was evaluated based on the aspects of Risk of Bias assessment described by the Agency of Health Research and Quality. Seven studies were deemed eligible and information on the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults (age 13?35) after moderate to severe TBI was extracted. Depression was assessed at 12 months (n = 2), >12 months (n = 2) or at varying times (n = 3) after TBI. The identified studies reported a prevalence proportion of depression from 1.6% to 60%. The Risk of Bias assessment showed a range of study quality with the selection of subjects and analysis of attrition being problematic. Although literature is sparse and of varying quality, depression was found to be common among adolescents and young adults with moderate to severe TBI which implies a need to focus on depression in the rehabilitation process and calls for further research.

AB  - Uveitic glaucoma is a range of disorders that results in optic nerve damage from elevated intraocular pressure secondary to intraocular inflammation. As compared to primary open angle glaucoma, uveitic glaucoma is associated with a more aggressive disease course caused by very high intraocular pressure levels that wax and wane. Diagnosis is often based on clinical presentation, disease course, and associated systemic manifestations. Diagnostic imaging plays an important role in both diagnosis and management. While the mechanisms of uveitic glaucoma vary, treatment requires strict control of the inflammation and may involve additional intraocular pressure lowering techniques. Management often dictates an interdisciplinary approach as systemic association and treatment is common. When topical management does not slow the progression of optic nerve damage and vision loss, surgical intervention is required. A significant portion of patients with uveitic glaucoma will eventually require surgical intervention and the appropriate referrals should be made. By nature, success rates of surgical intervention in uveitic glaucoma patients are lower than non-inflammatory causes of elevated intraocular pressure and glaucomatous damage. Chronic inflammation, multiple mechanisms, systemic associations, and unpredictable response to treatment make uveitic glaucoma challenging to manage. This review will discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of uveitic glaucoma to provide a guide for eye-care providers.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a dynamic pathological process where excess amounts of thrombin, the principal role player in the clotting pathway, are generated intravascularly. The diagnosis of DIC is very often suspected in critically ill patients although the clinical features can vary according to the underlying disease state initiating this process. A combination of tests performed in repeats is necessary to reliably diagnose DIC. The principal aim in the management of this condition involves timely and appropriate treatment of the triggering process with adequate transfusion support and certain therapeutic agents in selected situations.

AB  - Objective To report prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes for presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnosed among an emergency-care population of UK dogs. Methods The study used a cross-sectional design using emergency-care veterinary clinical records from the VetCompass Programme spanning September 1, 2012 to February 28, 2014 and risk factor analysis using multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results The study population comprised 77,088 dogs attending 50 Vets Now clinics. Overall, 492 dogs had presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnoses, giving a prevalence of 0·64% (95% Confidence interval: 0·58 to 0·70%). Compared with cross-bred dogs, breeds with the highest odds ratios for the diagnosis of presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus were the great Dane (odds ratio: 114·3, 95% Confidence interval 55·1 to 237·1, P<0·001), akita (odds ratio: 84·4, 95% Confidence interval 33·6 to 211·9, P<0·001) and dogue de Bordeaux (odds ratio: 82·9, 95% Confidence interval 39·0 to 176·3, P<0·001). Odds increased as dogs aged up to 12 years and neutered male dogs had 1·3 (95% Confidence interval 1·0 to 1·8, P=0·041) times the odds compared with entire females. Of the cases that were presented alive, 49·7% survived to discharge overall, but 79·3% of surgical cases survived to discharge. Clinical Significance Approximately 80% of surgically managed cases survived to discharge. Certain large breeds were highly predisposed.

AB  - Abstract Periprosthetic joint infection is among the most common and severe complications in total joint arthroplasty. Today, a combination of different methods is used for diagnosis because no single method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity is available. In this study, we explored the usability of single-molecule microscopy to characterize synovial fluid samples from periprosthetic joint infections. Patients (n?=?27) that needed revision arthroplasty underwent the routine diagnostic procedures for periprosthetic joint infection of the University Hospital in Bonn. Additionally, the diffusion rate of two probes, dextran and hyaluronan, was measured in small volumes of periprosthetic synovial fluid samples using single-molecule microscopy. To evaluate the suitability of single-molecule microscopy to detect PJI the AUC for both markers was calculated. The diffusion rate of hyaluronan in periprosthetic synovial fluid from patients with septic loosening was faster than in samples from patients with aseptic loosening. Single-molecule microscopy showed excellent diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, and allowed the detection of periprosthetic joint infection in patients that would be challenging to diagnose with current methods. For the first time, single-molecule microscopy was used to detect periprosthetic joint infection. Our results are encouraging to study the value of single-molecule microscopy in a larger patient cohort. The speed and accuracy of single-molecule microscopy can be used to further characterize synovial fluid, potentially allowing intraoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections in the future.

AB  - Summary The respiratory system is complex. Although it consists of upper and lower respiratory tracts, the former is the focus of this chapter. The primary function of the upper respiratory tract is to conduct air from the external environment into the lower airway. This process begins at the external nose. Air moves through the nares and into paired nasal cavities. Air is cleansed, warmed, and humidified during its passage through the upper respiratory tract. A small amount of serous nasal discharge can be considered normal in the companion animal patient. However, copious amounts of serous nasal discharge may be indicative of pathology. Nasal discharge is a common complaint in companion animal practice. Its presentation is immensely variable in terms of color, translucency, and consistency, but it is most frequently described by cellular content as being mucoid, mucopurulent, serohemorrhagic, or hemorrhagic. Onset of nasal discharge may be acute, chronic, or recurrent. Nasal discharge may be unilateral or bilateral, or laterality may change with disease progression. It may occur in isolation of systemic signs of disease? or the patient may be systemically ill. Each fact deduced from history taking and every finding on physical examination provides a clue as to the likelihood of the underlying cause. Nasal discharge is particularly frustrating to the veterinary client and clinician alike when it is chronic. In such cases, secondary bacterial infection is common, and although antibiotic therapy may provide transient resolution of clinical signs, recurrence is likely without having identified or addressed the primary issue. A definitive diagnosis requires a multifaceted approach. Signalment, case history, and physical examination findings collectively assist with disease localization and prioritization of differential diagnoses. However, ancillary diagnostic tests are invaluable. A combination of cytology, histopathology, bacteriology, mycology, and imaging studies may be necessary to rule out infectious, inflammatory, and/or neoplastic disease. Idiopathic rhinitis and sinorhinitis are relatively common among companion animal patients. Nasal disease may also be congenital, genetic, or iatrogenic in origin.

AB  - Abstract??? One of the commonly encountered dental emergencies is dentoalveolar traumatic injuries (DTIs). Unfortunately, DTIs result in fractured, displaced, or lost anterior teeth and this could have significant negative functional, esthetic, speech, and psychological effects on children thus affecting their quality of life. Although it is impossible to guarantee permanent retention of a traumatized tooth, patient age, severity of injury, and timely treatment and follow up of the tooth using recommended procedures can maximize the chances for success. This review examines the recent trends in the management of DTI to primary and young permanent teeth. Electronic search of scientific papers written in English from 1990s to 2009 was accomplished using Pub Med search engine. Dental practitioners should follow current literature and consider carefully evidenced-based recommendations that may enhance periodontal healing and revascularization of avulsed permanent teeth.

AB  - Abstract Background Information regarding clinical signs, assessment, treatment, and outcome in cats with hiatal hernia (HH) is limited. Objectives To characterize the clinical presentation of HH and medical and surgical outcomes in a cohort of affected cats. Animals Thirty-one client-owned cats with HH. Methods Medical records of cats with HH were retrospectively reviewed for signalment, history, results of diagnostic tests, details of surgical and medical treatments, complications, and outcome. Long-term follow-up data were obtained by telephone communication. Relationships between clinical variables and outcome were evaluated by regression analysis. Results Type I HH was present in 85.7% (24/28) of cats, and 64.5% (20/31) were >3?years of age at diagnosis. Twenty-one of 31 (67.7%) cats underwent surgical repair including phrenoplasty, esophagopexy, and left-sided gastropexy, and 10 of 31 cats were treated medically without surgery. Concurrent illness was common, and 77.4% cats had comorbidities. All cats survived to discharge, and median time to death or follow-up was 959?days (range, 3-4015?days). Cats treated medically survived longer than cats treated surgically, with median time to death or follow-up of 2559 and 771?days, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Type I HH is the most common type of HH in cats. A congenital etiology is possible, but many cats with HH were >3?years of age at diagnosis and suffered from comorbidities, including upper airway obstruction. Case selection and the presence of comorbidities likely influenced the outcome. Cats with HH may not be diagnosed until disease is advanced or concurrent illness draws attention to clinical signs.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is one of the common malignant tumours of female reproductive organs. Due to early diagnosis difficulties and lack of effective treatment in the late stage, ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate in female reproductive system malignancies. Therefore, finding reliable early diagnosis indicators and new therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer is an urgent problem to be solved. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) is a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family, which has been found to possess multi-effects in tumourigenesis and development. Here, we reported that CXCL14 was preferentially expressed in ovarian cancer. By analysing the TCGA database, we found that CXCL14 was highly expressed in advanced ovarian cancer patients and correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, the abnormal high CXCL14 levels were observed in serum and ovarian tissue of ovarian cancer patients by qRT-PCR and ELISA. In vitro and in vivo experiments both confirmed that overexpression of CXCL14 promoted the ovarian cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, transfection of CXCL14 increased the phosphorylation level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and administration of STAT3 inhibitor III inhibited the tumour-promoting effects of CXCL14. Therefore, our study suggests that CXCL14 could be utilised as a novel adjunct biomarker for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer and provides new targets and ideas for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Significance paragraph CXCL14 could be utilised as a novel adjunct biomarker for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer and provides new targets and ideas for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.

AB  - The usefulness of current psychiatric classification, which is based on ICD/DSM categorical diagnoses, remains questionable. A promising alternative has been put forward as the ?transdiagnostic? approach. This is expected to cut across existing categorical diagnoses and go beyond them, to improve the way we classify and treat mental disorders. This systematic review explores whether self-defining transdiagnostic research meets such high expectations. A multi-step Web of Science literature search was performed according to an a priori protocol, to identify all studies that used the word ?transdiagnostic? in their title, up to May 5, 2018. Empirical variables which indexed core characteristics were extracted, complemented by a bibliometric and conceptual analysis. A total of 111 studies were included. Most studies were investigating interventions, followed by cognition and psychological processes, and neuroscientific topics. Their samples ranged from 15 to 91,199 (median 148) participants, with a mean age from 10 to more than 60 (median 33) years. There were several methodological inconsistencies relating to the definition of the gold standard (DSM/ICD diagnoses), of the outcome measures and of the transdiagnostic approach. The quality of the studies was generally low and only a few findings were externally replicated. The majority of studies tested transdiagnostic features cutting across different diagnoses, and only a few tested new classification systems beyond the existing diagnoses. About one fifth of the studies were not transdiagnostic at all, because they investigated symptoms and not disorders, a single disorder, or because there was no diagnostic information. The bibliometric analysis revealed that transdiagnostic research largely restricted its focus to anxiety and depressive disorders. The conceptual analysis showed that transdiagnostic research is grounded more on rediscoveries than on true innovations, and that it is affected by some conceptual biases. To date, transdiagnostic approaches have not delivered a credible paradigm shift that can impact classification and clinical care. Practical ?TRANSD?iagnostic recommendations are proposed here to guide future research in this field.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Tumours of the thyroid gland are rare in the equine species. In literature varying clinical signs and diagnostic findings are described in single reports and case series. Reported clinical signs are related to upper airway compression or thyroidal metabolic activity. A considerable risk of laryngeal hemiplegia is described when horses were treated with hemithyroidectomy [1]. Objectives To review 11 horses referred with a unilateral thyroid neoplasia in order to describe clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, treatment and outcome. Histopathology was performed on all resected thyroid lobes. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Records from horses with histologically confirmed thyroid tumours treated with unilateral thyroid lobe resection were reviewed (2003?2013). Short-term outcome was defined for 2 weeks after surgery. Owners? questionnaire was performed for evaluation of long-term outcome defined as a minimum of 6 months. Results Affected horses were aged between 6 and 21 years. In contrast to literature the majority of tumours were adenocarcinomas (9/11), mainly found in mares (8/9). Histology revealed follicular and parafollicular (C-cell) mixed growth pattern of the carcinomas. Tumour size, growth rate and sonographic appearance did not correlate to histological characteristics. Ventral displacement of the thyroid lobe and close preparation along the thyroid capsule during surgical resection are inevitable to avoid damage to laryngeal nerves. Seroma formation was the only observed short-term complication. No long-term complications occurred. Conclusions Hemithyroidectomy is regarded the treatment of choice in horses with a unilateral thyroid lobe neoplasia with excellent long-term prognosis. High incidence of malignant tumours particularly in mares has to be considered. Tumour characteristics can only be derived from histopathology and immunhistochemistry.

AB  - Abstract There are complex considerations when planning to disclose an attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) diagnosis. In this review, we evaluate ethical, legal, and clinical perspectives as well as caveats related to full, non- and partial disclosure strategies, discuss societal implications, and provide clinical suggestions. Each of the disclosure strategies is associated with benefits as well as costs/considerations. Full disclosure promotes autonomy, allows for the clearest psychoeducation about additional risk factors, helps to clarify and/or correct previous diagnoses/treatments, facilitates early intervention and bolsters communication between providers but there are important considerations involving heritability, comorbidity, culture, and stigma. Non-disclosure advances nonmaleficence by limiting stigma and stress (which may inadvertently exacerbate the condition), and confusion (related to the rapidly evolving diagnosis) in a sensitive developmental period but is complicated by varying patient preferences and the possibility that, as new treatments without adverse effects become available, the risk with false positives no longer justifies the accompanying loss of autonomy. Partial disclosure balances ethical considerations by focusing on symptoms instead of labels, but evidence that laypersons may interpret this information as a pseudo-diagnosis and that symptoms alone also contribute to stigma limits the efficacy of this approach. In addition, there are notable societal considerations relating to disclosure involving conservatorship, the reach of insurance companies, and discrimination. We advocate a hybrid approach to disclosure and recommend future research aimed at understanding the effects of stigma on clinical course and a renewed focus on those help-seeking cases that do not transition but remain clinically relevant.

AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the human response to various internal and external stimuli, which can modify homeostasis, and exerts a tight control on essential functions such as circulation, respiration, thermoregulation and hormonal secretion. ANS dysfunction may complicate the perioperative course in the surgical patient undergoing anesthesia, increasing morbidity and mortality, and, therefore, it should be considered as an additional risk factor during pre-operative evaluation. Furthermore, ANS dysfunction may complicate the clinical course of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units, in the case of trauma, sepsis, neurologic disorders and cardiovascular diseases, and its occurrence adversely affects the outcome. In the care of these patients, the assessment of autonomic function may provide useful information concerning pathophysiology, risk stratification, early prognosis prediction and treatment strategies. Given the role of ANS in the maintenance of systemic homeostasis, anesthesiologists and intensivists should recognize as critical the evaluation of ANS function. Measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) is an easily accessible window into autonomic activity. It is a low-cost, non-invasive and simple to perform method reflecting the balance of the ANS regulation of the heart rate and offers the opportunity to detect the presence of autonomic neuropathy complicating several illnesses. The present review provides anesthesiologists and intensivists with a comprehensive summary of the possible clinical implications of HRV measurements, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction testing could potentially represent a diagnostic and prognostic tool in the care of patients both in the perioperative setting as well as in the critical care arena.

AB  - Objectives Prevalence and risk factors of PTSD among injured garment workers who survived a major factory collapse. Methods Survivors receiving treatment or rehabilitation care at one year post event were surveyed, which included Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Specific version. Results The respondents consisted of 181 people with a mean age of 27.8 years and a majority had less than high school education (91.2%). Multivariable logistic regression found that the odds of having PTSD was higher among married (OR: 3.2 [95% CI: 1.3?8.0]), those who used to work more than 70?hr/week (OR: 2.4 [1.1?5.3]), workers who used to hold higher job positions (OR: 2.6 [1.2?5.6]) or who had a concussion injury (OR: 3.7 [1.4?9.8]). Among the respondents, 83.4% remained unemployed, and only 57.3% (63 people) reported receiving a quarter or less of what they were promised as compensation. Conclusions Probable PTSD was prevalent among surviving workers of the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh. Am. J. Ind. Med. 58:756?763, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In the context of an implementation study of nuchal translucency (NT) screening for Down's syndrome special attention was devoided to the psycho-social aspects. The impact of age, parity, religion, education together with the reasons for opting in or out for the NT measurement were recorded in 5895 patients. On a sample of 800 patients more specific aspects were addressed such as the level of knowledge about prenatal diagnosis before and after screening, the reaction to the offer of NT screening and the general women's opinion on whether this form of screening should be offered to all pregnant women. Questionnaires devised to measure the anxiety and depression produced by screening (hads) were filled before screening, at 20?weeks' gestation and after delivery by the same group of patients and by 200 controls. Preliminary results are available. 80% of the asked women, with no differences in age, religion and parity choose for NT screening. Main reason for having the NT measured was the hope of avoiding invasive testing and the wish of having more information on their pregnancy. The majority of women experienced positively NT screening even in case of an increased measurement and irrespectively of whether they would terminate an affected pregnancy or not. A slight increase in anxiety level produced by the screening normalized by 20?weeks' gestation.

AB  - We present a clinical case of treatment and neurorehabilitation of a patient with severe neurological deficit due to extensive traumatic lesion of the left hemisphere of the brain. Until recently, such cases were considered incurable and remained marginalized throughout their lives. This clinical case illustrates the compensatory brain possibilities under long-term integrated multidisciplinary treatment and neurorehabilitation with mandatory application of medical, medico-psychological, medico-pedagogical, and medico-social methods, the importance and intensity of which vary at different stages of the disease. This process is addressed in the individual patient. The greatest efficiency of the neurorehabilitation treatment of patients with severe consequences of a stroke and traumatic brain injury can be reached under the following conditions: the earliest possible start of rehabilitation with a sufficient duration and intensity; interdisciplinary and integrative rehabilitation process at various stages of rehabilitation treatment; systematic clinical and neuropsychological diagnostics; systematic monitoring of somatic, neurological, psychiatric, and psychological condition of the patient; assistance with sociopsychological and labor issues; and problem-solving support.
