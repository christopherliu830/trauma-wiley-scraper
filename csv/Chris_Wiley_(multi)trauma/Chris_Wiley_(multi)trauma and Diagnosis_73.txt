AB  - Abstract Psychotropic drugs (PD) are often used close to a cancer diagnosis and may be considered as a way of coping. We aimed to determine the incidence of anxiolytics, hypnotics, antidepressants and antipsychotics initiation around a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Population-based cohort: data were extracted from SNDS (Systeme National des données de Santé), the French health insurance database at the regional level (Midi-Pyrenees area, 2.9 million inhabitants). All newly diagnosed patients treated by a CML tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) between 10/01/2011 and 04/01/2014 were included. Pre-CML (9 months before to 3 months before first TKI prescription ? F-TKI) and CML (3 months before to 9 months after F-TKI) phases were defined. The main evaluation criterion was the initiation of PD during CML phase. Determinants associated with this incident PD use were studied through a logistic regression model. We compared pre-CML and CML health care consumption. The cohort included 103 patients (mean age of 60.8 years). PD initiation rate was 35.9%, anxiolytics being the most initiated PD (59.5%). Advanced age was associated with PD (adjusted OR=1.029, 95%CI=1.001-1.056). The number of consultations during the pre-CML phase and female gender tended to be associated with increased risk of PD initiation in univariate analysis. For PD initiators, health care consumption was greater in CML but not in pre-CML phase. PD initiation is a frequent finding around a CML diagnosis. Its risk increases with age. It could be a way to identify a subgroup with higher health care consumption.

AB  - We present a clinical case of treatment and neurorehabilitation of a patient with severe neurological deficit due to extensive traumatic lesion of the left hemisphere of the brain. Until recently, such cases were considered incurable and remained marginalized throughout their lives. This clinical case illustrates the compensatory brain possibilities under long-term integrated multidisciplinary treatment and neurorehabilitation with mandatory application of medical, medico-psychological, medico-pedagogical, and medico-social methods, the importance and intensity of which vary at different stages of the disease. This process is addressed in the individual patient. The greatest efficiency of the neurorehabilitation treatment of patients with severe consequences of a stroke and traumatic brain injury can be reached under the following conditions: the earliest possible start of rehabilitation with a sufficient duration and intensity; interdisciplinary and integrative rehabilitation process at various stages of rehabilitation treatment; systematic clinical and neuropsychological diagnostics; systematic monitoring of somatic, neurological, psychiatric, and psychological condition of the patient; assistance with sociopsychological and labor issues; and problem-solving support.

AB  - The impact of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the setting of transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for all recipients of deceased donor liver transplants performed between January 1, 1995 and October 31, 2011. In a multivariate Cox analysis, significant predictors of patient survival included the following: HCC diagnosis (P < 0.01), donation after cardiac death (DCD) allograft (P < 0.001), hepatitis C virus-positive status (P < 0.01), recipient age (P < 0.01), donor age (P < 0.001), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (P < 0.001), recipient race, and an alpha-fetoprotein level > 400 ng/mL at the time of transplantation. In order to test whether the decreased survival seen for HCC recipients of DCD grafts was more than would be expected because of the inferior nature of DCD grafts and the diagnosis of HCC, a DCD allograft/HCC diagnosis interaction term was created to look for potentiation of effect. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for all other covariates, this interaction term was statistically significant (P = 0.049) and confirmed that there was potentiation of inferior survival with the use of DCD allografts in recipients with HCC. In conclusion, patient survival and graft survival were inferior for HCC recipients of DCD allografts versus recipients of donation after brain death allografts. This potentiation of effect of inferior survival remained even after adjustments for the inherent inferiority observed in DCD allografts as well as other known risk factors. It is hypothesized that this difference could reflect an increased rate of recurrence of HCC. Liver Transpl 19:1214?1223, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

Method A total of 29 participants were randomized to either to EMDR + SC (n = 15) or SC (n = 14). Participants completed measures on traumatic stress (PCL-C) and comorbid distress at baseline, 1 week post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results In the EMDR + SC group, 9 (60%) participants at post-treatment and 7 (47%) participants at 3-month follow-up were diagnosis free. In SC, 4 (27%) at post-treatment and follow-up were diagnosis free. At post-treatment, three participants (20%) dropped out from the EMDR + SC group, and 1 (7%) dropped out from the SC group. Conclusions It is feasible, acceptable and potentially effective to deliver EMDR in this population group.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - Abstract??? The purpose of this report was to describe the diagnosis and dental treatment of a 2-year-old girl that was involved in a suicide bomb attack. A 14-months-old infant was severely injured when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device inside a crowded bus. Her injury was ?multi-system?, mainly burns and fragments in her face, eyes and other parts of the body. Fifteen months later, she was brought to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry of the Hadassah School of Dental Medicine and the clinical and radiographic examination showed that she was caries free but there were dental trauma injuries to many teeth. Due to her non-cooperative behavior and the extent of treatment the girl was scheduled for a one appointment treatment under deep sedation. Three days later, she was brought to the Emergency Room of the Department of Pediatric Dentistry complaining of pain on the lower left side of the mouth and a swollen vestibule and face could clinically be observed. The lower left first molar that apparently revealed only an enamel fracture and cracks at the time of treatment, actually revealed a necrotic pulp as a result of the blast. As this girl was caries free, and with no history of dental trauma due to any accident, the only explanation for the response of the pulp was the impact of the blast. In conclusion, the reaction of the dental pulp to the blast of an explosion is different than the reaction to other kind of insult and this should be taken in consideration when treating children after this kind of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Aims To estimate the influence of non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) on heroin initiation among US veterans receiving medical care. Design Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we analyzed data from a prospective, multi-site, observational study of HIV-infected and an age/race/site-matched control group of HIV-uninfected veterans in care in the United States. Approximately annual behavioral assessments were conducted and contained self-reported measures of NMUPO and heroin use. Setting Veterans Health Administration (VHA) infectious disease and primary care clinics in Atlanta, Baltimore, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Washington, DC. Participants A total of 3396 HIV-infected and uninfected patients enrolled into the Veterans Aging Cohort Study who reported no life-time NMUPO or heroin use, had no opioid use disorder diagnoses at baseline and who were followed between 2002 and 2012. Measurements The primary outcome measure was self-reported incident heroin use and the primary exposure of interest was new-onset NMUPO. Our final model was adjusted for socio-demographics, pain interference, prior diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and/or depression and self-reported other substance use. Findings Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we found that non-medical use of prescription opioids NMUPO was associated positively and independently with heroin initiation [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 5.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.01, 7.35]. Conclusions New-onset non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) is a strong risk factor for heroin initiation among HIV-infected and uninfected veterans in the United States who reported no previous history of NMUPO or illicit opioid use.

AB  - Summary Burns are classified by cause and mechanism, as well as by extent (expressed as percentage of total body surface area or TBSA) and depth. Inhalation injury is caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion or chemical powders and vapours. Its presence is associated with a worse prognosis for a given extent of cutaneous injury. Timely initiation of appropriate first aid (20 minutes of cool running water for thermal injuries) minimises the extent of tissue damage. Extensive burns constitute major trauma and may be associated with multi-trauma. Patients with major burns require primary and secondary survey, and active resuscitation according to a formula related to size of burn. Burn wounds evolve and require regular review and appropriate dressings. Deep circumferential burns may require escharotomy. Extensive burns are associated with systemic effects, which are a manifestation of a systemic inflammatory response that involves all organs and necessitates provision of critical and multidisciplinary care. Surgical management of extensive burns entails early excision of all necrotic tissue, temporisation of the wound with skin substitutes, and timely grafting according to an established algorithm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To estimate prevalence and risk factors for diagnosis with hyperadrenocorticism in dogs attending primary-care veterinary practices in the UK from 2009 to 2014. METHODS Cases were identified by searching the de-identified electronic patient records from UK primary-care veterinary practices participating in the VetCompass Programme. RESULTS The estimated prevalence for hyperadrenocorticism diagnosis in dogs was 0·28% (95% confidence interval: 0·25 to 0·31). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed four associated risk factors: breed, breed-relative bodyweight, age and insurance status. The bichon frise had 6·5 times the odds (95% CI: 3·5 to 12·1, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with crossbreds. Dogs weighing more than or equal to their breed mean had 1·7 times the odds (95% CI: 1·3 to 2·3, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with dogs weighing less than the breed mean. Dogs aged 12·0 years and above showed 5·7 times the odds (95% CI: 3·7 to 8·7, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with dogs aged 6·0 to 8·9 years. Insured dogs had 4·0 times the odds (95% CI: 2·8 to 5·6, P<0·001) of hyperadrenocorticism compared with non-insured dogs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This is the first epidemiological report of a non-referral hospital population of dogs diagnosed with hyperadrenocorticism in the UK and describes important breed, age and bodyweight associations with this disorder which may improve diagnosis and enhance understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.

AB  - Abstract Most interviews of eating disorders have been developed on homogeneous, English-speaking samples at particular academic institutions for research purposes, and tend to put scientific rigour before clinical utility. The present study deals with the development and preliminary validation of the Rating of Anorexia and Bulimia (RAB), a 56 item interview covering a wide range of eating disorder symptoms, related psychopathology and background variables, which can be used to generate operational DSM-IV diagnoses. Eating disorder variables on the RAB can be compiled into four subscales: Body-shape and Weight Preoccupation, Binge-Eating, Anorexic Eating Behaviour and Compensatory Behaviour. The instrument was investigated among 409 patients participating in the Swedish multi-centre study of eating disorders. Measures of internal consistency, diagnostic discrimination and correlations with the EDI-2 suggest that the RAB is a promising measure that reliably measures important aspects of eating disorder psychopathology.

AB  - Aims Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy. Methods and results This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

AB  - Summary Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most important systemic mycosis in Latin America. It has been regarded as a multifocal disease, with oral lesions as the prominent feature. To provide useful information concerning the diagnosis and management of the disease, this study describes demographic and clinical data from the medical records of a consecutive series of 66 Brazilian patients from an endemic area, evaluated in a referral centre for oral diagnosis. In this sample of patients, there was a predominance of middle-aged male patients, who were primarily rural workers. Chronic multifocal disease was prevalent, with lesions also detected in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin or adrenal glands. Most of the cases presented with lesions at the gingival mucosa followed by the palate and lips; these conditions occurring in the oral cavity were frequently associated with pain. Importantly, most of the patients sought professional care for oral lesions. The diagnosis was obtained through exfoliative cytology and/or biopsy of the oral lesions. Medical treatment was effective, and there were no mortalities in the sample. The present findings not only confirm the importance of oral lesions in the diagnosis and management of PCM but also illustrate that questions still remain unclear, such as the possibility of direct inoculation of the fungus onto oral tissues.

AB  - Aim and Objective The purpose of this study was to develop knowledge on women survivors' healthcare experiences and strategies. Background Survivors of traumatic life events are at an increased risk for an array of negative health consequences, which can be complicated when distressing healthcare experiences act as a barrier to accessing needed care. Implications for trauma-informed and sensitive practice are well established, but evidence to date on survivors' healthcare experiences and patient engagement is limited. Design This study utilized individual interviews and qualitative description methods. Methods Fourteen participants completed a demographic questionnaire and one semistructured interview focused on their exposure to violence, healthcare experiences and strategies for navigating health care. Thematic analysis in alignment with qualitative description methods was used to analyse interview transcripts and identify themes. Results Participants in this study reported a variety of traumatic life experiences, ranging from childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence to severe car accidents. Experiencing a multiplicity of trauma sometimes complicated participants' later healthcare experiences. Although participants described ways in which providers helped them attain positive care experiences, they also acknowledged that limitations of the healthcare system could make trauma-informed practices difficult to implement. Participants described strategies they use to prepare for, navigate and recover after healthcare encounters including selecting providers, bringing support persons to appointments and engaging in relaxing activities after appointments. Conclusions Participants emphasised the importance of trusting and equitable provider?patient relationships and described several ways they prepare for, cope with and care for themselves after difficult healthcare experiences. Descriptive data on the patient engagement behaviours of survivors of violence is a unique contribution of this study to existing research. Relevance to clinical practice Findings from this study indicate the importance of comprehensive trauma history screening during health assessments, development of trusting and mutually respectful provider?patient relationships and provider training programmes focused on trauma-informed care practices.

AB  - Abstract Albeit no direct anatomical information can be obtained, neurosonological methods provide real-time determination of velocity, and spectral waveform of blood flow in basal intracranial arteries adds significant benefit to the care of the patients with neurovascular diseases. Several features, such as relative simplicity in terms of interpretation and performance, significantly low cost, totally non-invasiveness, portability, and excellent temporal resolution, make neurosonology increasingly popular tool for evaluation, planning, and monitoring of treatment, and for determining prognosis in various neurovascular diseases. Usefulness of transcranial Doppler in diagnosing/monitoring subarachnoid hemorrhage related vasospasm and sickle cell vasculopathy is already well known. Utility in diagnosis of intracranial arterial stenosis, acute occlusion and recanalization, intracranial hemodynamic effect of the cervical arterial pathologies, intracranial pressure increase, and cerebral circulatory arrest are also well established. Neurosonological determination of vasomotor reactivity, cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and micro-embolic signals detection are useful in the assessment of stroke risk, diagnosis of right-to-left shunting, and monitoring during surgery and interventional procedures. Transcranial Doppler is also an evolving ultrasound method with a therapeutic potential such as augmentation of clot lysis and cerebral delivery of thrombolytic or neuroprotective agent loaded nanobubbles in neurovascular diseases. The aim of this study is to give an overview of current usage of the different ultrasound modalities in different neurovascular diseases.

AB  - Abstract Aim To explore assessment on a hospital ward for older people from the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals. Design A qualitative study drawing on grounded theory was undertaken between February 2015 - January 2016. Methods Interviews with 15 patients and 22 healthcare professionals, a focus group with six healthcare professionals, 45 hr of observation and review of 18 sets of patient notes. Analysis was conducted using initial and focused coding, continuously comparing data, emerging codes and themes. Findings The core category was navigating, constructed through three themes: containing complexity, networking, and situating the process. Navigating assessment was a complex, flexible, context dependent, and social process where healthcare professionals used a combination of formal, informal, visible, and invisible ways of working. Registered nurses were at the centre of networking and focused on gathering and sharing information in the multi-disciplinary team, whilst patients had a passive role despite a variety of preferences about their involvement. Conclusions Navigating the assessment of older people is contextually situated, includes networking and a professional focus on containing complexity. This process may be enhanced by: (a) making informal assessment visible to others; (b) developing the nurses? role beyond chasing information towards coordinating care; and (c) asking patients and acting on how they would like to be involved in decision-making. Impact Acknowledging that navigating assessment is a social, flexible and complex process, including different ways of working to meet patient needs, may enhance the usability of current assessment guidelines and their development.

AB  - Summary The majority of esthetic emergencies involve fracture of the clinical crown. Traumatic conditions such as avulsion, bony fracture, extrusive and lateral luxation, and root fracture are considered to be acute and demand immediate treatment. Subacute conditions, including intrusion, subluxation, pulpal concussion, and crown fracture with pulp exposure, necessitate treatment within 24?h. In most cases, the emergency-bonded composite restoration will be the definitive restorative treatment. In the case of an esthetic emergency shortly before a social engagement, a dislodged crown or fixed dental prosthesis can be temporarily retained through the application of a little denture adhesive. Although replacement of the prosthesis may ultimately be recommended, patients may need an immediate interim repair. The responsibility of the dentist is to facilitate the long-term preservation of the natural dentition, the supporting periodontium and bone, and the surrounding soft gingival tissues.
