AB  - Abstract Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare but important liver disease that leads to cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation in a high proportion of cases. The disease occurs in approximately 1 per 100,000 population per year, usually presents in adulthood, and affects men more often than women. Typical serum biochemical results, autoantibodies and liver biopsy are suggestive but not diagnostic of PSC, the diagnosis requiring cholangiographic demonstration of stricturing and dilatation of the intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts. The natural history of PSC is variable, the average survival being 12 to 17 years. The cause of PSC is still unknown. Although considered an autoimmune disease, PSC has several atypical features and a strong genetic component. The therapy of PSC is unsatisfactory. Standard doses of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) lead to improvements in biochemical abnormalities but not in histology, cholangiographic appearance or survival. Several innovative therapies have been tried in PSC, but with scant evidence of benefit. For patients with high grade strictures, endoscopic dilatation is beneficial. Liver transplantation is successful for end-stage liver disease due to PSC and improves survival. PSC may recur after transplantation but is rarely progressive. The most dreaded complication of PSC is cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnosis of this highly malignant tumor is difficult, and there are no biomarkers for its early detection. Liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma has an exceedingly poor outcome, although transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoirradiation holds promise in selected patients. Thus, significant opportunities remain for basic and clinical research into the cause, natural history, and therapy of PSC. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:746?764.)

AB  - Abstract Objective: To explore the psychosocial experiences of pregnancy in women diagnosed with breast cancer during or shortly after pregnancy. Methods: A retrospective qualitative design was employed. Fifteen women who had received a gestational breast cancer (GBC) diagnosis participated in semi- structured interviews. The interviews sought to identify the emotional and social issues related to the experiences of pregnancy and motherhood in women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer. Results: Women diagnosed with GBC experience difficulties in adjusting to two different and conflicting life events; the threat of their breast cancer alongside the news of their pregnancy. They have to make difficult decisions that impact on their own life, the life of their foetus/new baby and that of their existing family. Women who received a GBC diagnosis reported high levels of anxiety and stress, which pervaded their whole GBC experience. Women reported their anxiety was linked to the conflict between the concern for their baby's health and the concern for their own health and wellbeing. Conclusions: Women diagnosed with GBC attributed different meanings to their experience of pregnancy and motherhood and made choices based on their own beliefs, values and how complete they believed their family was.

AB  - Introduction Evaluating responses of horses to diagnostic analgesia is subject to bias. Pelvic movement symmetry can be measured accurately with inertial sensors, but it is unclear which of the many symmetry measures best reflect changes. It was hypothesised that objective parameters mimicking commonly observed visual parameters used by veterinarians (difference between upward/downward sacral movement and between amplitudes of left and right tuber coxa motion) would show the largest, most consistent responses. Methods 13 horses underwent visual lameness scoring and independent gait assessment with inertial sensors during clinical lameness investigations. Multiple movement symmetry parameters were calculated and changes before/after diagnostic analgesia regressed against change in lameness grade. Confidence intervals of slopes of regression lines were assessed to identify significant changes. Results All parameters showed variation between horses and across lameness grades. Three measures documented a consistent increase in symmetry for each grade of change in lameness score: difference between sacral displacement minima, and upward movement difference and range of motion difference between the tubera coxae. A change in symmetry of 9?13% for each grade of increase in lameness can be expected. Conclusions The three most promising pelvic parameters for consistent quantification of changes due to diagnostic analgesia in the hindlimb of lame horses were identified. Difference in upward movement between left and right tuber coxae is the most sensitive but requires simultaneously focusing on pelvic and limb movements and may therefore be more difficult to assess visually. Showing a similar response to diagnostic analgesia, the difference in movement amplitude between left and right tuber coxae may be more easily perceived since it does not require simultaneous focus on limb movement. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?None declared.

AB  - Summary Skin and soft tissue infections rank among the most frequent infections worldwide. Classic erysipelas is defined as a non-purulent infection by beta-hemolytic streptococci. The typical signs are tender, warm, bright erythema with tongue-like extensions and early systemic symptoms such as fever or at least chills. Erysipelas always and best responds to penicillin. Limited soft tissue infection or limited cellulitis are the terms we have introduced for infections frequently caused by S. aureus and often originating from chronic wounds or acute trauma. Clinically, they are marked by tender, erythematous swelling which, unlike erysipelas, exhibit a darker red hue and is not always accompanied by fever or chills at onset. Severe cellulitis is a purulent, partially necrotic infection extending to the fascia, with general symptoms of infection, requiring surgical management in addition to antibiotics. It often fulfils criteria of so-called complicated soft tissue infections according to the definition of the FDA, due to their frequent association with e.g. severe diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial occlusive disease or severe immunosuppression. In contrast, the rare necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections represent a distinct entity, characterized by rapid progression to ischemic necroses and shock due to special bacterial toxins. Limited cellulitis should be treated with cephalosporins group 1 or 2, or, when S.aureus is the isolated or highly likely causative agent, isoxazolyl-penicillins (exploiting their minimal selection pressure on other bacteria). For severe cellulitis, initial antibiotic treatment (mostly iv) includes ? depending on the location - agents also active against gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria. (e.g. clindamycine, aminopeniclilline with inhibitors of betalaktamase, fluochinolons, cephalosporines group 4). For cutaneous abscesses, drainage presents the therapy of choice. Only under certain conditions additional antibiotic therapy is required. Adherence to the diagnostic criteria and to evidence-based or consensus-derived treatment recommendations as presented herein should allow for an antibiotic therapy with a good balance of efficacy, tolerability by patients and low selection pressure for highly resistant bacteria.

AB  - ABSTRACT Based on data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,149), the current article provides the first large-sample investigation of associations between different forms of infant attachment insecurity and dissociative symptomatology from childhood through midadolescence as measured by scales based on the mother, teacher, and youth self-report versions of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments. Findings did not replicate the previously reported and highly cited evidence that infant attachment disorganization is associated with dissociative symptomatology. In contrast, correlations of small magnitude were observed between infant avoidance and dissociative symptomatology, as assessed by teachers and mothers (but not self-report). Results were not moderated by contextual risk. Limitations of the study included the absence of measures of maltreatment and interpersonal trauma, leaving open the possibility that infant attachment disorganization is a diathesis for later dissociation in the context of severe and/or chronic trauma. Nevertheless, the present results strongly indicate the need for additional research exploring the possible role of environmental factors in the development of dissociative symptomatology.

AB  - Inguinal hernia was associated with trauma in five dogs and was considered nontraumatic in 30 dogs. There were 11 males, 13 intact females, and six spayed females with nontraumatic inguinal hernia. Six dogs had bilateral hernias. Five dogs were younger than 4 months at the time of diagnosis. In 11 older dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia, the hernias were identified less than 7 days before surgical repair; in 14 older dogs, the hernias had been recognized for 1 to 60 months. Clinical signs in dogs without small intestinal incarceration were usually limited to a visible or palpable mass without pain or systemic illness. Hemiorrhaphy approaches included inguinal, midline with contralateral ring evaluation, and celiotomy with or without inguinal exposure. Fat and omentum were the most common hernial contents. Small intestine was within the hernias of 12 dogs. Six dogs had nonviable small intestine. Postoperative complications included two incisional infections, one incisional dehiscence, two cases of peritonitis and sepsis associated with bowel leakage after intestinal resection and anastomosis, and one hernia recurrence. The overall prevalence of postoperative complications was 17%, and the mortality rate was 3%. Vomiting for 2 to 6 days was predictive of nonviable small intestine. Dogs younger than 2 years were at 11 times greater risk for nonviable small intestine than dogs older than 2 years. Four of five dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia and nonviable small intestine were intact males, whereas none of 13 intact females were affected. Only one of 14 dogs with longstanding hernias had nonviable small intestine.

AB  - Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI) frequently report symptoms of increased distractability and sensory disturbances during mutisensory stimulation. These common post-concussive symptoms could putatively result from dysfunction within the cognitive control network (CCN; top-down) or from unisensory cortex (bottom-up) itself. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-resolution structural data were therefore prospectively collected during a multisensory (audio-visual) cognitive control task from 46 mTBI patients within 3 weeks of injury and 46 matched healthy controls (HC), with a subset of participants returning at 4 months. Multisensory stimuli were presented at two frequencies to manipulate cognitive and perceptual load. Patients self-reported more cognitive, emotional, somatic, vestibular and visual symptoms relative to HC, which improved, but did not entirely resolve, over the 4 month follow-up period. There were no group differences in behavior or functional activation during cognitive control (incongruent ? congruent trials). In contrast, patients exhibited abnormal activation within different regions of visual cortex that depended on whether attention was focused on auditory or visual information streams. Patients also exhibited increased activation within bilateral inferior parietal lobules during higher cognitive/perceptual loads, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to achieve similar levels of behavioral performance. Functional abnormalities within the visual cortex and inferior parietal lobules were only partially resolved at 4 months post-injury, suggesting that neural abnormalities may take longer to resolve than behavioral measures used in most clinical settings. In summary, current results indicate that abnormalities within unisensory cortex (particularly visual areas) following mTBI, which likely contribute to deficits commonly reported during multisensory stimulation.

AB  - Since the advent of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes in 1980, they have become the device of choice for providing long-term enteral nutrition. Despite their overall safety, a number of complications can occur after PEG placement. Bleeding is usually a minor complication associated with PEG placement that occurs soon after the procedure and is most often caused by puncture of an abdominal wall vessel. More severe bleeding can occur when a branch of one of the gastric arteries is punctured. There are only a few case reports of traumatic gastric ulceration secondary to the internal bolster of a PEG. The internal bolsters are either balloons or dome shaped, and are 1.5?2.0 cm in height. We report a case in which a patient developed hemorrhage from a gastric ulcer induced by a balloon-type PEG tube that was resolved only after replacement with a tube manufactured with a low-profile internal bolster that was only 0.3 mm in height. The protruding tip of a balloon-type gastrostomy tube was believed to have caused traumatic injury to the gastric mucosa in our patient, causing ulceration. Usually, removal of the tube and placement in a different location may solve the problem. However, we believe that the PEG tube fashioned with a low-profile internal bumper is a safer option.

AB  - Summary.? We conducted a review of a single institutional experience of patients with haemophilia presenting with suspected intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) who underwent computed tomographic (CT) neuro-imaging. We found that over a 9-year period (1996?2004) 43 patients with haemophilia presented 73 times with suspected ICH: 10 presented multiple times (range: 2?9 times). The median age at presentation was 3.5?years (range: 0.5?17). Preceding trauma occurred in most (62/73; 85%) episodes. ICH was confirmed in 11 of the 73 (16%) episodes in eight patients. Patients with severe haemophilia accounted for a disproportionate number of episodes of suspected (60/73; 82%) and of confirmed ICH (10/11; 91%). All ICH occurred in patients not on prophylaxis; five occurred in three inhibitor-positive patients. Altered consciousness at presentation was present in 10/11 (91%) cases of confirmed ICH but only in 5/62 (8%) (ICH-negative) episodes. The positive and negative predictive values of altered consciousness to predict/rule out an ICH was 67% and 98%, respectively. The following were associated with an increased risk of presenting with suspected ICH and of having a confirmed ICH: (i) having severe haemophilia; (ii) not being on prophylaxis; (iii) having an inhibitor; and (iv) presenting with an altered level of consciousness. Patients without any of these features may not need to undergo CT imaging when presenting with suspected ICH. Ideally a prospective study to evaluate this hypothesis should be conducted.

AB  - Perineural spread (PNS) of mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region occurs with a reported frequency of 2% to more than 27%. Patients previously diagnosed with and treated for head and neck cancer should be closely followed by both their physician and their dentist in order to facilitate the coordination of care. This case history demonstrates the results that can occur when a team approach to head and neck cancer is not followed, especially in a patient who is an infrequent and somewhat reluctant health care utilizer. Despite mandibular pain, the patient, who had a history of a carcinoma of the lower lip and had developed PNS, was not referred to a dentist. In patients with a previous history of squamous cell carcinoma, sensory and/or motor changes must be closely monitored when there is a suspicion of PNS. The outcome of this case supports improved collaborations between physicians and dentists in following head and neck cancer patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with tibial pilon fractures have a higher incidence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis than those with fractures of the tibial plateau. This may indicate that pilon fractures present a greater mechanical insult to the joint than do plateau fractures. We tested the hypothesis that fracture energy and articular fracture edge length, two independent indicators of severity, are higher in pilon than plateau fractures. We also evaluated whether clinical fracture classification systems accurately reflect severity. Seventy-five tibial plateau fractures and 52 tibial pilon fractures from a multi-institutional study were selected to span the spectrum of severity. Fracture severity measures were calculated using objective CT-based image analysis methods. The ranges of fracture energies measured for tibial plateau and pilon fractures were 3.2?33.2?Joules (J) and 3.6?32.2?J, respectively, and articular fracture edge lengths were 68.0?493.0?mm and 56.1?288.6?mm, respectively. There were no differences in the fracture energies between the two fracture types, but plateau fractures had greater articular fracture edge lengths (p?<?0.001). The clinical fracture classifications generally reflected severity, but there was substantial overlap of fracture severity measures between different classes. Similar fracture energies with different degrees of articular surface involvement suggest a possible explanation for dissimilar rates of post-traumatic osteoarthritis for fractures of the tibial plateau compared to the tibial pilon. The substantial overlap of severity measures between different fracture classes may well have confounded prior clinical studies relying on fracture classification as a surrogate for severity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Objectives? Post-traumatic hypopituitarism is well described amongst adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of pituitary dysfunction after head injury in childhood. Design? Retrospective exploratory study. Patients: 33 survivors of accidental head injury (27 boys). Mean (range) age at study was 13·4?years (5·4?21·7?years) and median (range) interval since injury 4·3?years (1·4?7·8?years). Functional outcome at study: 15 good recovery, 16 moderate disability, two severe disability. Measurements? Early morning urine osmolality and basal hormone evaluation were followed by the gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and insulin tolerance (n?=?25) or glucagon tests (if previous seizures, n?=?8). Subjects were not primed. Head injury details were extracted from patient records. Results? No subject had short stature (mean height SD score +0·50, range ?1·57 to +3·00). Suboptimal GH responses (<5??g/l) occurred in six peri-pubertal boys (one with slow growth on follow-up) and one postpubertal adolescent (peak GH 3·2??g/l). Median peak cortisol responses to insulin tolerance or glucagon tests were 538 and 562?nm. Nine of twenty-five and two of eight subjects had suboptimal responses, respectively, two with high basal cortisol levels. None required routine glucocorticoid replacement. In three, steroid cover was recommended for moderate/severe illness or injury. One boy was prolactin deficient. Other basal endocrine results and GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH were appropriate for age, sex and pubertal stage. Abnormal endocrine findings were unrelated to the severity or other characteristics of TBI or functional outcome. Conclusions? No clinically significant endocrinopathy was identified amongst survivors of accidental childhood TBI, although minor pituitary hormone abnormalities were observed.

AB  - Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most prevalent psychological disorder experienced by Vietnam veterans. However, there are many other disorders and problems of adjustment, like social anxiety and social phobia, that have not been fully investigated in this population. This study examined the prevalence of social phobia and the comorbidity of social phobia and PTSD, and tested out a theory of the etiology of social anxiety in trauma victims. Forty one Vietnam combat veterans were interviewed and completed self-report measures assessing PTSD and social phobia. Adversity of homecoming was also assessed. Using a conservative multi-method assessment approach, 32% of the sample were found to be positive for both social phobia and PTSD. Veterans with PTSD were significantly more likely to cany an additional diagnosis of social phobia as compared to veterans without PTSD. Adversity of homecoming and shame about one's experience in Vietnam were significant predictors of current level of social anxiety over and above the effects of pre-military anxiety and severity of combat exposure. These observations suggest that social anxiety and social phobia may be significant problems among individuals with PTSD. Further, these findings offer preliminary support for the theory that posttrauma environment may impact upon the later development of social anxiety.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Purpose:? To establish the diagnostic role of imaging by ultrasound for the diagnosis of uveal effusion syndrome. Methods:? Using ultrasonic imaging features as the main criteria for evaluation, the recorded data from 16 patients with presumed uveal effusion seen between 1994 and 2000 were reviewed and analysed for clinical manifestations and current diagnostic suggestions. Eventually, as cumulating experience suggested that ultrasound is capable of indicating uveal effusion, the study set-up became in part more prospective. Results:? The two main ultrasonic features found were: (1) extended multi-layered detachment patterns by B-scan, often kinetically mobile; (2) a spongy oedematous ciliary body region, often with interstitial lacunae, as demonstrated by high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy (50 Mhz). Conclusions:? In patients with visual loss and ambiguous detachment-like fundus pathology, ultrasonic features are often of practical guidance for diagnosing uveal effusion syndrome.

The series also explores the parallel process that occurs when traumatized individuals and stressed organizations come together to form stressed societies. Part I focused on the basic human stress response. Part II explored the more extended impact of severe, chronic, and repetitive exposure to stress on the functioning of the emotional system and the ways in which human beings tend to adapt to adversity and thus come to normalize highly abnormal behavior. The focus of Part III was on the impact of chronic stress on memory, the ability to put words to feelings and the tendency to repeat the past automatically. Part IV reviews the way attachment schemas are disrupted by trauma and how the accumulative experience of stress leads to downward spirals of anxiety and, finally, alienation if the progress of this deterioration is not stopped.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - Accessible summary What is known on the subject: The physical and psychological trauma that can occur as a result of physical restraint is increasingly highlighted in the media and literature across the globe. Despite this, the use of physical restraint continues without a strong evdience base for its value or efficacy. What this paper adds to existing knowledge: A number of common defences for the use of physical restraint are outlined and considered in light of existing research in this area. The potential for adopting restrictive intervention minimization programmes of work is highlighted as a way forward. What are the implications for practice: The implementation of approaches to prevent and reduce physical restraint is required. A combination of factors including the use of advance planning tools, recognition of potential injury and death, and the importance of trauma informed care is necessary. Patients can be severely traumatized by the use of restraint, and there is an increasing drive to examine, reflect upon, and to reduce the use and impact of these. Abstract Aggression is reported to be prevalent in psychiatric inpatient care and its frequency towards healthcare professionals is well documented. While aggression may not be entirely avoidable, its incidence can be reduced through prevention and the minimization of restrictive practices such as physical restraint. This paper aims to explore three common ?defences? to account for the use of physical restraint; to challenge each defence with regard to the evidence base; and to identify how services are responding to the challenge of reducing the use of restrictive interventions. Following a number of investigations to highlight serious problems with the use of physical restraint, it seems timely to examine its efficacy in light of the evidence base. A combination of interventions to minimize the use of restraint including advance planning tools, and recognition of potential trauma is necessary at an organizational and individual level. Patients can be traumatized by the use of restrictive practices and there is a growing momentum to promote models that incorporate trauma informed care (TIC) and person centredness.

AB  - Summary Both traumatic and atraumatic causes of head and neck pathological changes require careful selection of analgesics, sedatives and anesthetic swith key monitoring points during diagnosis and treatment. Assessment of the ABCs in severely compromised patients should be the initial focus followed by specific injury assessment. Immediate management may require endotracheal intubation prior to emergency care of associated injuries. Oral wounds, dental injuries, electrical cord bite and venomous injuries noted within the mouth or around the head are painful. Analgesia is important for these animals, and potentially general anesthesia is required to conduct a thorough examination, when the patient is stable, to assess the extent of injury. Non-traumatic causes of airway obstruction are laryngeal paralysis, pharyngeal/laryngeal, tumours, inflammation or edema, brachycephalic syndrome or collapsing trachea. Several medical and traumatic conditions cause neck pain and may be difficult to diagnose.

AB  - Abstract Patients with supraventricular tachycardia commonly present to the ED. There is a lack of consensus regarding assessment of these patients. Our aim was to determine the utility of troponin and four other investigations (full blood examination, electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests and chest X-rays) commonly requested for these patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1992?March 2017) were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies (of sample size greater than 10). Our search strategy yielded no randomised controlled trials and seven observational studies with significant statistical heterogeneity among selected studies (I2 87.3%, P < 0.001). Included studies investigated a total of 1155 patients. All studies reported on the utility of troponin testing in this patient population. The pooled proportion of patients investigated with troponin was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.44?0.88). The pooled proportion of positive troponin tests was 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.23?0.41). Only one study reported on the utility of the remaining four investigations with abnormal results as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone 14%, haemoglobin 6%, white cell count 19% and chest X-ray 22%. Investigations are commonly requested for patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardia. Troponin testing is commonly performed with a high proportion of positive findings although these results did not appear to be associated with major adverse cardiac events. Heterogeneity among studies and low levels of evidence precluded conclusions on full blood examinations, electrolyte levels, thyroid testing and utility of chest X-rays in this patient population.
