AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to determine if early enteral nutrition improves outcome for trauma patients with an open abdomen (OA). Methods: Retrospective review was used to identify 78 patients who required an OA for ≥4 hospital days, survived, and had available nutrition data. Demographic data and nutrition data comprising enteral nutrition initiation day and daily % target goal were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups: early enteral feeding (EEN), initiated ≤4 days within celiotomy; and late enteral feeding (LEN; >4 days). Outcomes included infectious complications, early closure of the abdominal cavity (<8 days from original celiotomy), and fistula formation. Results: Fifty-three of 78 (68%) patients were men, with a mean age of 35 years; 74% had blunt trauma. Forty-three of 78 (55%) patients had EEN, whereas 35 of 78 (45%) had LEN. There was no difference with respect to demographics, injury severity, or infectious complication rates. Thirty-two of 43 (74%) patients with EEN had early closure of the abdominal cavity, whereas 17 of 35 (49%) patients with late feeding had early closure (p = .02). Four of 43 (9%) patients with EEN demonstrated fistula formation, whereas 9 of 35 (26%) patients with late feeding formed fistulae (p = .05). The EEN group had lower hospital charges (p = .04) by more than $50,000. Conclusions: EEN in the OA was associated with (1) earlier primary abdominal closure, (2) lower fistula rate, (3) lower hospital charges.

AB  - Summary In the horse, the phalanges are the second most common location for the occurrence of osseous cyst-like lesions (OCLLs) after the medial femoral condyle of the stifle. Phalangeal OCLLs occur in a variety of locations, most of which are adjacent to, if not communicating with, a joint. The aetiology of these lesions is considered to be multifactorial by most authors. Horses with OCLLs demonstrate lameness of varying severity. Diagnostic analgesia should be used to localise the lameness. After localisation of the lameness, standard radiographic views of the isolated area should be performed. The radiographic characteristics of OCLLs are dependent on the stage of development of the OCLL; OCLLs may first be identified as a small lucent flattening or depression in the articular surface; however, they may progress to a circular, oval or conical single or multi chambered radiolucency within the bone. There may be a rim of radiodense sclerosis around the lucency. Diagnosis of some OCLLs may only be achieved using nonstandard radiographic views or may require advanced diagnostic imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment of phalangeal cysts may be conservative or surgical. Surgical treatment options generally aim to prevent cyst enlargement and promote filling of the lesion with osseous material. Depending on the cyst, this can be performed arthroscopically or via an extra-articular approach. Occasionally, the severity of proximal interphalangeal joint OCLLs warrants surgical arthrodesis. Overall the prognosis for return to performance for horses with OCLLs ranges from 30?90% but is dependent on the breed, age and intended use of the horse, surface area of weightbearing cartilage affected, concurrent osteoarthritis within the joint and treatment administered.

AB  - Summary ICD-10 contains diagnostic criteria which exist in two versions: diagnostic guidelines for routine clinical use and criteria for research. Mental disorders in the elderly are not a separate category of morbidity, and psychiatric disturbances in the elderly can be classified in any clinically relevant section. The dementias are embedded in the section on organic and symptomatic mental disorders (?organic? meaning that the disorder can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or systemic disease). Entry points at the level of clinical syndrome are: dementia; amnesic syndrome; delirium; organic quasi-functional disorder; and personality disorder. Once dementia is established, the diagnostic process branches off into the clinical forms of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and dementia in diseases classified elsewhere. Multi-axial coding can be achieved by using extra codes from other ICD-10 chapters for physical disorders; or by using the multi-axial system now available, with axes for clinical diagnosis, disablements and contextual factors.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to identify the main biological, psychological and sociological problems and potential solutions for patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia by use of Group Problem-Solving Therapy. Background Group Problem-Solving Therapy is a technique for identifying and solving problems, increasing assertiveness, self-esteem and eliminating negative thoughts. Design Qualitative phenomenological interpretive design: Group Problem-Solving Therapy sessions conducted with patients suffering fibromyalgia were studied; participants recruited via the Rheumatology Department at a general hospital and associations in Catalonia, Spain with sessions conducted in nearby university setting. Methods The study included 44 people diagnosed with fibromyalgia (43 female, 1 male) from 6 Group Problem-Solving Therapy sessions. Data collected from March?June 2013. A total of 24 sessions were audio recorded, all with prior informed consent. Data were transcribed and then analysed in accordance with established methods of inductive thematic analysis, via a process of reduction to manage and classify data. Findings Five themes were identified: (1) Current problems are often related to historical trauma; (2) There are no ?one size fits all? solutions; (3) Fibromyalgia is life-changing; (4) Fibromyalgia is widely misunderstood; (5) Statistically Significant impacts on physical, psychological and social are described. Conclusion The majority of patients? problems were associated with their previous history and the onset of fibromyalgia; which may be related to trauma in adolescence, early adulthood or later. The solutions provided during the groups appeared to be accepted by the participants. These findings can improve the self-management of fibromyalgia patients by helping to enhance adaptive behaviours and incorporating the female gender approach.

AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.

AB  - Objectives To report the signalment, clinical presentation, treatments pursued and outcomes of dogs with malignant anal sac melanoma. Methods Medical records from five institutions from January 2000 through December 2015 were reviewed and dogs with cytologically- or histologically-confirmed malignant anal sac melanoma were identified. Signalment, clinical signs, staging, cytology, histopathologic analysis, surgical and non-surgical treatments were extracted from the medical records. The referring veterinarians and owners were contacted for follow-up data. Results Eleven dogs were included and survival data was available for all. The most common clinical signs were bloody anal sac discharge and perianal licking. Initial treatments pursued included surgery (n=8), chemotherapy (n=1), and palliative treatment with pain medications and stool softeners (n=2). In an adjuvant setting, melanoma vaccine was pursued following surgery in three dogs and chemotherapy in one dog. Regardless of treatment, progression-free survival (mean 92 · 5?days) and overall survival times (median 107?days) were short. Clinical Significance Dogs in this case series had a guarded to poor prognosis regardless of treatment. Ten of 11 dogs were euthanased due to local or distant disease progression. Only 1 of 11 dogs was alive one year after diagnosis. An understanding of tumour behaviour in this location could lead to improved survival times with earlier diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract The use of appropriate resuscitation targets or end-points may facilitate early detection and appropriate management of shock. There is a fine balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, and when this is perturbed, an oxygen debt is generated. In this narrative review, we explore the value of global haemodynamic resuscitation end-points, including pulse rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure and mixed/central venous oxygen saturations. The evidence supporting the reliability of these parameters as end-points for guiding resuscitation and their potential limitations are evaluated.

AB  - This systematic literature review examined the clinical utility of the construct of self-disgust in understanding mental distress. Specifically, the review assessed whether there is a shared conceptual definition of self-disgust, the face and construct validity of the quantitative assessment measures of self-disgust, and the predictive validity of self-disgust in formulating the development of a range of psychological difficulties. A systematic database search supplemented by manual searches of references and citations identified 31 relevant papers (27 quantitative, 3 qualitative, and 1 mixed). Analysis of qualitative papers indicated a number of shared features in the definition of self-disgust, including a visceral sense of self-elicited nausea accompanied by social withdrawal and attempts at cleansing or suppressing aspects of the self. Quantitative assessment measures appeared to capture these dimensions and evidenced good psychometric properties, although some measures may have only partially captured the full self-disgust construct. Strong relationships were observed between self-disgust and a range of mental health presentations, in particular, depression, body-image difficulties, and trauma-related difficulties. However, these relationships are smaller when the effects of other negative self-referential emotions were controlled, and stronger conclusions about the predictive validity of self-disgust are limited by the cross-sectional nature of many of the studies.

AB  - Abstract The outcomes of posterolateral multilevel spine fusion in difficult clinical settings, such as in an aged multi-diseased osteoporotic patient, remain unpredictable. The osteoprogenitor cells in bone marrow decrease with ageing without losing their osteogeneic potential. Autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) from iliac crest aspirate can be concentrated in the operating room and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) can be obtained from a peripheral blood as a source of autologous osteoprogenitor cells and growth factors, respectively. We present the case of an 88 year-old multi-diseased osteoporotic patient affected by cervical stenosis and subjected to C3?C7 posterior decompression, instrumentation and posterolateral fusion, using an intraoperative ?tissue-engineered? composite made of corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from iliac crest aspirate enriched with PRF from peripheral blood. Lateral dynamic X-rays and CT scan showed consolidation signs at 3 months follow-up, with solid C3?C7 fusion at 6 months follow-up. This paper describes a simple and effective method for potentially improving the fusion rate in aged osteoporotic patients by using corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from the iliac crest, enriched with PRF from peripheral blood, rapidly obtained before the surgical procedure.

AB  - Abstract Since the mid-1990s, there have been frequent reports of individuals whose use of the computer and internet is problematic. Given the recent expansion and the expected increase in internet availability and usage in the coming years, it is important that healthcare professionals be informed about this behavior and its associated problems. Recently, psychological and psychiatric literature has described individuals that exhibit problematic internet use who often suffer from other psychiatric disorders. In the face of this comorbidity, it is essential to evaluate whether these individuals represent a distinct class of disorder, or a manifestation/coping mechanism related to other underlying diagnosis. In either event, problematic internet use negatively impacts social and emotional functioning. Based on the current limited empirical evidence, problematic internet use may best be classified as an impulse control disorder. It is therefore imperative that problematic internet use be appropriately identified among symptomatic individuals. For these reasons, we propose specific diagnostic criteria that will allow for consistent identification and assist in further study of this behavior.

AB  - Summary Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5% of visits to the emergency department. Although most patients presenting with acute abdominal pain have minor problems, about 18?25% of patients have a serious enough condition to warrant hospital admission for investigation and treatment, and about 10% of patients need emergency or urgent surgery. It usually results from gastrointestinal disorders, but other causes, which include a spectrum of medical and surgical conditions, must not be forgotten. Most commonly, acute abdominal pain is due to luminal obstruction, inflammation, perforation, volvulus or torsion, and intestinal ischemia. The two immediate goals in the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain are to decide if the patient needs admission to hospital and to ascertain whether urgent or emergency surgery is needed. A number of tests and investigations are available to guide the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, but only an astute clinician can obtain the information that is needed from a patient, choose the best investigations, and plan appropriate treatment. The desire to obtain an accurate preoperative diagnosis should not be allowed to delay therapeutic intervention in the critically ill or unstable patient.

AB  - Summary Background IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multi-systemic disorder. IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is the biliary manifestation of the disease, often in association with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Hepatic manifestations of IgG4-RD are less well described within the literature. Aim To examine and present an overview of IgG4-RD with a focus on the biliary and hepatic manifestations. Methods An electronic search using Medline was performed. Search items included ?IgG4 multi-system disease, IgG4 associated cholangitis, IgG4 associated liver disease and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)?. Results IgG4-RD is characterised by an IgG4-positive lymphoplasmacytic tissue infiltrate, storiform fibrosis and an obliterative phlebitis. The HISORt criteria may be used to establish the diagnosis and incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach involving histology, radiology, serum IgG4 levels and response to steroid therapy. IgG4-SC is the commonest extrapancreatic manifestation of type-1 AIP, while the hepatic manifestations remain poorly defined. Important differential diagnoses include primary sclerosing cholangitis, secondary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma. Current treatment regimens remain ill defined although steroid therapy is used first line unless contraindicated. Patients with relapsing disease or multifocal disease should be considered for azathioprine. Available data would also suggest a role for rituximab. Conclusions IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis is a common manifestation of IgG4-related disease which requires a multi-disciplinary approach to establish the diagnosis. Differentiating IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis from other conditions, both benign and malignant, is challenging, but vital. Steroids remain the mainstay of treatment. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of the hepatic manifestations of IgG4-related disease continues to evolve.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation is usually the pathological consequence of skin trauma. And hypertrophic scars (HSs) frequently occur in people after being injured deeply. HSs are unusually considered as the result of tissue contraction and excessive extracellular matrix component deposition. Myofibroblasts, as the effector cells, mainly differentiated from fibroblasts, play the crucial role in the pathophysiology of HSs. A number of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of HS occurrence. Currently, with in-depth exploration and clinical research of HSs, various creative and effective treatments budded. In here, we summarize the progress in the molecular mechanism of HSs, and review the available biotherapeutic methods for their pathophysiological characteristics. Additionally, we further prospected that the comprehensive therapy may be more suitable for HS treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the features of dissociative schizophrenia and the clinical model and research data supporting its existence. In classical dissociative identity disorder (DID), the characteristic symptoms are due to full switches of executive control between highly structured, personified, and discrete ego states, or alter personalities. Typically, even in DID, much of the personality system is often structured and functions at the level of Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD). Dissociative schizophrenia fits into broader conception of dissociative disorders, as do the Schneiderian first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. The clinical implications of dissociative schizophrenia are the following: dissociative symptoms are common in schizophrenia and must be considered in treatment, some cases of schizophrenia may be treatable with psychotherapy, the environment can be the major aetiological factor in many cases of schizophrenia, and psychological trauma is a major theme in schizophrenia.

AB  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) has been used to study tumor response to treatment for many years. In this study, the modified full width at half-maximum (mFWHM), calculated from the wash-in slope histogram, is proposed as a parameter for the evaluation of changes in tumor heterogeneity which respond to radiotherapy. Twenty-five patients with brain tumors were evaluated and divided into the nonresponder group (n?=?11) and the responder group (n?=?14) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All selected tumors were evaluated by mFWHM ratios of post- to pre-therapy (the ratio was defined as the therapeutic mFWHM ratio, TMR). The changes in kurtosis of the histograms and the averaged Ktrans within a tumor were also calculated for comparison. The receiver operating characteristic analysis and Kaplan?Meier curves were used to examine the diagnosis ability. The TMR values were significantly higher in nonresponders than in responders (p?<?0.001). When compared with the other two parameters, the proposed method also demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity. When adopting the TMR for the estimation of prognosis after therapy, there was a significant difference between the population survival curves. In conclusion, the derived mFWHM reflects tumor heterogeneity, and the ability to depict patient survival probability from TMR corresponds well with that from RECIST. The results reveal that, in brain tumors, progression may be exhibited not only by tumor size, but also by tumor heterogeneity. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract In hospitalized patients, lipid emulsions are an integral part of balanced parenteral nutrition. Traditionally, a single lipid source, soybean oil, has been given to patients and was usually regarded as just a source of energy and to prevent essential fatty-acid deficiency. However, mixtures of different lipid emulsions have now become widely available, including mixtures of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Fish oil is high in the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is a growing body of evidence that these ?-3 fatty acids can exert beneficial immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and inflammation-resolution effects across a wide range of patient groups including surgical, cancer, and critically ill patients. At least in part, these effects are realized via potent specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). Moreover, parenteral nutrition including ?-3 fatty acids can result in additional clinical benefits over the use of standard lipid emulsions, such as reductions in infection rates and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Clinical and experimental evidence is reviewed regarding lipid emulsion use in a variety of hospitalized patient groups, including surgical, critically ill, sepsis, trauma, and acute pancreatitis patients. Practical aspects of lipid emulsion use in critically ill patients are also considered, such as how to determine and fulfill energy expenditure, how and when to consider parenteral nutrition, duration of infusion, and safety monitoring.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) occurs in ≤12% of pediatric recipients of liver transplantation (LT). Known complications of PVT include portal hypertension, allograft loss, and mortality. The management of PVT is varied. A single-center, case-control study of pediatric LT recipients with portal vein (PV) changes after LT was performed. Cases were categorized as early PVT (if PVT was detected within 30 days of transplantation) or late PVT (if PVT was detected more than 30 days after transplantation or if early PVT persisted beyond 30 days). Two non-PVT control patients were matched on the basis of the recipient weight, transplant indication, and allograft type to each patient with PVT. Thirty-two of the 415 LT recipients (7.7%) received 37 allografts and developed PVT. In comparison with control patients, a higher proportion of patients with PVT had PVT present before LT (13.3% versus 0%, P = 0.01). Patients with early PVT usually returned to the operating room, and 9 of 15 patients (60%) had PV flow restored. Patients with late PVT had lower white blood cell (4.9 [1000/?L] versus 6.8 [1000/?L], P < 0.01) and platelet counts (140 [1000/?L] versus 259 [1000/?L], P < 0.01), an elevated international normalized ratio (1.2 versus 1.0, P < 0.001), and more gastrointestinal bleeding (25% versus 8.3%, P = 0.03) compared to controls. Patients with PVT were also less frequently at the expected grade level (52% versus 88%, P < 0.001). The patient survival rates were 84%, 78%, and 78% and 91%, 84%, and 79% for cases and controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The allograft survival rates were 90%, 80%, and 80% for cases and 94%, 89%, and 87% for controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. In conclusion, patients with early and late PVT had preserved allograft function, and there was no impact on mortality. Patients diagnosed with early PVT often underwent operative interventions with successful restoration of flow. Patients diagnosed with late PVT experienced variceal bleeding, and some required portosystemic shunting procedures. Academic delays were also more common. In late PVT, the clinical presentation dictates care because the optimal management algorithm has not yet been determined. Multi-institutional studies are needed to confirm these findings and improve patient outcomes. Liver Transpl 19:315?321, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a persistent or recurrent fever for which the underlying source has not been identified despite diagnostic investigation. In people, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) alone or in combination with computed tomography (CT) is often beneficial in detecting the source of fever when other diagnostics have failed. Veterinary reports describing use of these modalities in animals with fever of unknown origin are currently lacking. Aims of this retrospective case series were to describe 18F-FDG-PET or 18F-FDG-PET/CT findings in a group of dogs with fever of unknown origin. Dogs presenting to a single center between April 2012 and August 2015 were included. A total of four dogs met inclusion criteria and underwent either positron emission tomography (n = 2) or positron emission tomography/CT (n = 2) as a part of their diagnostic investigation. All subjects underwent extensive diagnostic testing prior to 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Initial diagnostic evaluation failed to identify either a cause of fever or an anatomic location of disease in these four dogs. In each dog, positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT was either able to localize or rule out the presence of focal lesion thereby allowing for directed sampling and/or informed disease treatment. Follow up 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans performed in two patients showed improvement of observed abnormalities (n = 1) or detected recurrence of disease allowing for repeated treatment before clinical signs recurred (n = 1). Fever resolved after specific treatment in each dog. Findings from the current study supported the use of positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT as adjunctive imaging modalities for diagnosis and gauging response to therapy in dogs with fever of unknown origin.

AB  - Abstract Alterations of blood rheology (hemorheology) are important for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention of many diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, sickle cell anemia, thromboembolism, trauma, inflammation, and malignancy. However, real-time in vivo assessment of multiple hemorheological parameters over long periods of time has not been reported. Here, we review the capabilities of label-free photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal (PT) flow cytometry for dynamic monitoring of hemorhelogical parameters in vivo which we refer to as photoacoustic and photothermal blood rheology. Using phenomenological models, we analyze correlations between both PT and PA signal characteristics in the dynamic modes and following determinants of blood rheology: red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, deformability, shape (e.g., as in sickle cells), intracellular hemoglobin distribution, individual cell velocity, hematocrit, and likely shear rate. We present ex vivo and in vivo experimental verifications involving high-speed PT imaging of RBCs, identification of sickle cells in a mouse model of human sickle cell disease and in vivo monitoring of complex hemorheological changes (e.g., RBC deformability, hematocrit and RBC aggregation). The multi-parameter platform that integrates PT, PA, and conventional optical techniques has potential for translation to clinical applications using safe, portable, laser-based medical devices for point-of-care screening of disease progression and therapy efficiency. ? 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry
