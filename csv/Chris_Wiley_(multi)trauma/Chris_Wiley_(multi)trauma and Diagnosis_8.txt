AB  - Summary The differences among diagnosis, diagnostic formulations and classification, and between clinical and research classifications, are discussed. The current impossibility of basing classification on brain circuitry is noted. It is argued that both dimensional and categorical approaches are useful, and should be combined because they provide different information. The validation of diagnostic categories is reviewed in relation to age trends and sex differences; familiality and genetics; psychosocial correlates; long-term course; drug response; cognitive impairments; and biological findings. A 3-level organisational structure is supported.

AB  - Abstract Background There is limited evidence describing the long-term outcomes of severe pelvic ring fractures. The aim of this study was to describe the longer term independent living and return to work outcomes following severe pelvic ring fracture. Methods Adult survivors to discharge from two major trauma centres with AO/Tile type B and C fractures were followed up at 6, 12 and 24-months post-injury to capture functional (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOS-E]) and return to work data. Multivariable, mixed effects models were used to identify predictors of outcome. Results A total of 111 of 114 (97%) cases were followed up. The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.9 (18.9) years, 77% were male, 81% were transport-related and 90% were multi-trauma patients. Further, 11% were managed conservatively, 10% with external fixation and 79% with open reduction and internal fixation. At 24 months, 77% were living independently (GOS-E > 4) and 59% had returned to work. Higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were associated with lower risk-adjusted odds of return to work (P = 0.04) and independent living (P = 0.06). Post-operative infection was associated with living independently (P = 0.02). Conclusion Despite the severity of the injuries sustained, 77% of severe pelvic ring fracture patients were living independently and 59% had returned to work, 2-years post-injury. Fracture type and management were not key predictors of outcome. Large-scale multi-centre studies are needed to fully understand the burden of severe pelvic ring fractures and to guide clinical management.

AB  - Summary An animal trauma triage (ATT) scoring system was devised to provide stratification of veterinary trauma patient populations based upon severity of injury. A retrospective population of 101 trauma patients and a prospective population of 88 patients were used to evaluate the predictive power of the ATT scoring system for survival seven days after initial presentation of the emergency service. In Both groups, the mean ATT score for survivors was significantly lower than the mean ATT score for non-survivors. In a logistic regression mode, the ATT score was found to be a significant predictor of the likelihood of survival seven days after initial presentation for both populartions. Each point increase in the ATT score resulted in a 2.3?2.6 times decreased likelihood of survival. The ATT scoring system is a useful objective classification scheme for predicting the likelihood to survive a traumatic incident and can serve as prototype for severity of injuroy scoring systems for the veterinary trauma patient.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injury of the esophagus is extremely uncommon. The aims of this study were to use the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS) database to identify clinical factors predictive of esophageal trauma, and to report the morbidity and mortality of this injury. A cross-sectional review of patients presenting to 20 Level I trauma centers in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2010 was performed. We compared clinical and demographic variables between patients with and without esophageal trauma both prior to and after arrival in the emergency room (ER). Primary mechanism of injury and clinical outcomes were analyzed. There were 231?694 patients and 327 (0.14%) had esophageal trauma. Patients with esophageal trauma were considerably younger than those without this injury. The risk of esophageal trauma was markedly increased in males (odds ratio [OR] = 2.62 [CI 1.98?3.47]). The risk was also increased in African Americans (OR = 4.61 [CI 3.65?5.82]). Most cases were from penetrating gunshot and stab wounds. Only 34 (10.4%) of esophageal trauma patients underwent an upper endoscopy; diagnosis was usually made by CT, surgery, or autopsy. Esophageal trauma patients were more likely to require surgery (35.8% vs. 12.5%; P < 0.001). Patients with esophageal trauma had a substantially higher mortality than those without the injury (20.5% vs. 1.4%; P < 0.005). In logistic regression modeling, traumatic injury of the esophagus (OR = 3.43 [2.50?4.71]) and male gender (OR = 1.52 [1.46?1.59]) were independently associated with mortality. For those patients with esophageal trauma, there was an association between trauma severity and mortality (OR = 1.10 [1.07?1.12]) but not for undergoing surgery within the first 24 hours of hospitalization (OR = 0.84; 0.39?1.83). Our study on traumatic injury of the esophagus is in concordance with previous studies demonstrating that this injury is rare but carries considerable morbidity (?46%) and mortality (?20%). The injury has a higher morbidity and mortality when the thoracic esophagus is involved compared to the cervical esophagus alone. The injury most commonly occurs in younger, Black males suffering gunshot wounds. Efforts to control gun violence in Pennsylvania are of paramount importance.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The effectiveness of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) has been assumed from low quality studies with multiple biases. This review aimed to (i) evaluate the association between the institution of an MTP and mortality and (ii) determine the effect of MTPs on transfusion practice post trauma. Methods A systematic review of studies that examined patient outcomes before and after the institution of an MTP in the same centre was conducted. The design and results of each study were described. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes from each study were pooled. Results There were eight studies that satisfied inclusion criteria with marked heterogeneity in study populations (I2 = 72.1%, P = 0.001). Two studies showed significantly improved mortality following implementation of an MTP, and six studies showed no significant change. Pooled OR for the effect of an MTP on short-term mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.48?1.11). The effect of MTPs on transfusion practice was varied. Conclusion Despite the popularity of MTPs and directives mandating their use in trauma centres, in before?after studies, MTPs have not always been associated with improved mortality. Evidence-based standardization of MTPs, improved compliance and analysis of broader endpoints were identified as areas for further research.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The objective was to determine if hospital admission of children with blunt abdominal trauma for observation of possible intraabdominal injury (IAI) is necessary after a normal abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in the emergency department (ED). Methods:? The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of children less than 18?years of age with blunt abdominal trauma who underwent an abdominal CT scan in the ED. Abdominal CT scans were obtained with intravenous contrast but no oral contrast. The decision to hospitalize the patient was made by the attending emergency physician (EP) with the trauma or pediatric surgery teams. An abnormal abdominal CT scan was defined by the presence of any visualized IAI or findings suggestive of possible IAI (e.g., intraperitoneal fluid without solid organ injury). Patients were followed to determine if IAI was later diagnosed and the need for acute therapeutic intervention if IAI was present. Results:? A total of 1,295 patients underwent abdominal CT, and 1,085 (84%) patients had normal abdominal CT scans in the ED and make up the study population. Seven-hundred thirty-seven (68%) were hospitalized, and 348 were discharged to home. None of the 348 patients discharged home and 2 of the 737 hospitalized patients were identified with an IAI after a normal initial abdominal CT. The IAIs in patients with normal initial CT scans included a 10-year-old with a mesenteric hematoma and serosal tear at laparotomy and a 10-year-old with a perinephric hematoma on repeat CT. Neither underwent specific therapy. The negative predictive value (NPV) of a normal abdominal CT scan for IAI was 99.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?99.3% to 100%). Conclusions:? Children with blunt abdominal trauma and a normal abdominal CT scan in the ED are at very low risk of having a subsequently diagnosed IAI and are very unlikely to require a therapeutic intervention. Hospitalization of children for evaluation of possible undiagnosed IAI after a normal abdominal CT scan has a low yield and is generally unnecessary.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - Summary Tranexamic acid is used both pre-hospital and in-hospital as an antifibrinolytic drug to treat or prevent hyperfibrinolysis in trauma patients; dosing, however, remains empirical. We aimed to measure plasma levels of tranexamic acid in patients receiving pre-hospital anti-hyperfibrinolytic therapy and to build a population pharmacokinetic model to propose an optimised dosing regimen. Seventy-three trauma patients were enrolled and each received tranexamic acid 1 g intravenously pre-hospital. A blood sample was drawn after arrival in the emergency department, and we measured the plasma tranexamic acid concentration using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and modelled the data using non-linear mixed effect modelling. Tranexamic acid was administered at a median (IQR [range]) time of 43 (30?55 [5?135]) min after trauma. Plasma tranexamic acid levels were determined on arrival at hospital, 57 (43?70 [20?148]) min after pre-hospital administration of the drug. The measured concentration was 28.7 (21.5?38.5 [8.7?89.0]) ?g.ml?1. Our subjects had sustained severe trauma; injury severity score 20 (16?29 [5?75]), including penetrating injury in 2.8% and isolated traumatic brain injury in 19.7%. The pharmacokinetics were ascribed a two-compartment open model with body-weight as the main covariate. As tranexamic acid concentrations may fall below therapeutic levels during initial hospital treatment, we propose additional dosing schemes to maintain a specific target blood concentration for as long as required. This is the first study to investigate plasma level and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after pre-hospital administration in trauma patients. Our proposed dosing regimen could be used in subsequent clinical trials to better study efficacy and tolerance profiles with controlled blood concentrations.

Design, setting Retrospective analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database data from 92 Australian ICUs for the 6-year period, 2010?2015. Participants Patients older than 17 years of age admitted to public hospital ICUs with a primary diagnosis of trauma. Main outcome measures ICU and overall hospital lengths of stay, hospital discharge destination, and ICU and overall hospital mortality rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Results 23 804 people were admitted to Australian public hospital ICUs after major trauma; 1754 (7.4%) were Indigenous Australians. The population-standardised incidence of admissions was consistently higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians (847 per million v 251 per million population; incidence ratio, 3.37; 95% CI, 3.19?3.57). Overall hospital mortality rates were similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82?1.31). Indigenous patients were more likely than non-Indigenous patients to be discharged to another hospital (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72?0.96) less likely to be discharged home (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04?1.31). Conclusion The population rate of trauma-related ICU admissions was substantially higher for Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients, but hospital mortality rates after ICU admission were similar. Indigenous patients were more likely to be discharged to a another hospital and less likely to be discharged home than non-Indigenous patients.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents findings of a common MMPI profile configuration for a small forensic sample (n = 16) of persons traumatized by life-threatening civilian events or as a consequence of combat in the Vietnam War. All subjects were involved in lawsuits in which the issue of compensation, medical benefits, or criminal disposition and sentencing were important concerns. A review of the existing empirical studies using this full MMPI scale as well as the MMPI post-traumatic subscale are discussed. In comparing the civilian and veteran samples on the MMPI clinical, validity, and subscales a number of statistically significant differences were found by analyses of variance and mean comparison tests of the data. While the profile configuration of both groups were similar (elevations on F, 8 and 2 scales), the Vietnam Veteran sample had significantly higher elevations. It was concluded that identifying an MMPI trauma profile and its variations may did in the diagnosis and assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

This study assessed expert consensus on the traumatic potential of a broader range of adverse life events, and differences in symptom manifestation and behavioural symptom equivalents of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Method The present authors conducted a three-step Delphi survey using a mixed-methods design. Twenty-nine expert raters participated in the survey, and 16 persisted to the final round. Consensus was calculated using the interquartile range. Results Traumatic potential was attributed to adverse life events, particularly revolving around sexuality and autonomy. DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD were rated as partially adequate, with behavioural symptom expression being the main difference to the general population. Conclusion The range of traumatic events should be broadened for people with intellectual disabilities. A specific subset of events need to be defined in future research. Detection of PTSD depends upon determining specific symptom correlates of challenging behaviour.

AB  - Abstract The meaning of trauma within psychology has for a long time been viewed mostly from a ?pathologising? standpoint. Viewed as pathology, people's trauma may become understood using a singular lens thereby leaving out broader contextual (social, environmental, political, historical, economical etc.) aspects that have been shown to play a role in the subjective experience of various forms of suffering. Psychology has for a long time been quick to diagnose victims of traumatic experiences from an individualistic perspective, almost always positioning the ?problem? within the person. As a result of the Vietnam War, World Wars I and II and the Holocaust, the rise in the diagnosing of PTSD gave way to the labelling of trauma. Within psychology, post-traumatic stress disorder has become the way to operationalise suffering, and I would like to argue that this occludes how suffering lives in a family, a community and in gendered bodies. The gendering of trauma continues to be a silenced space. There is a need to highlight and acknowledge the gendered nature of suffering which begs for trauma to be understood in context and not as an isolated act or occurrence affecting the individual. Women have remained, and in many ways continue to remain, silenced with minimal opportunities to name the world for themselves. This paper seeks to provide a critical analysis of the notion of trauma (and its intersection with gender) that arises from conflict and post-conflict situations.

AB  - This is the first controlled study of an expressive arts group intervention with unaccompanied minor asylum seeking children. The aim of the study was to examine whether such an intervention may alleviate symptoms of trauma and enhance life satisfaction and hope. One hundred forty five unaccompanied minor refugee boys with their stated age between 15 and 18 were allocated into a 10 session 5 weeks manualized expressive arts intervention (EXIT) or a life as usual (LAU) control group. The participants were assessed at onset and 4 times over a period of 25 months with a battery of instruments measuring post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), general psychological distress (HSCL-25A), current life satisfaction (CLS) and expected life satisfaction (ELS). The instruments were presented in the participants? native languages, using touch-screen laptops and the computer program Multilingual Computer Assisted Interview (MultiCASI). There were significant time by group interactions in favor of the EXIT group for PTSS and CLS. At the end of the follow up the EXIT group had higher life satisfaction and hope for the future than the LAU group. A manualized EXIT group intervention can have a beneficial effect on helping minor refugee boys to cope with symptoms of trauma, strengthen their life satisfaction and develop hope for the future. Our findings support previous studies showing that the arts may help people in reconstructing meaning and connection with others by focusing on resources and creativity.

AB  - Abstract ? Displacement injuries of permanent teeth are an increasing emergency in the dental office. Children and adolescents are particularly prone to dental trauma due to participation in risky activitiess. Repositioning or replantation with subsequent stabilization by a dental splint is the standard of care for most displaced or avulsed permanent teeth. Non-rigid fixation allowing physiologic tooth mobility has been shown to be desirable for periodontal healing. A flexible splint of short duration appears to reduce the risk of dentoalveolar ankylosis or external replacement resorption. Different splinting techniques are currently recommended for stabilization of repositioned or replanted teeth, including a wire-composite splint, an orthodontic bracket splint or a resin splint. Each splinting option has its specific advantages and shortcomings. This paper describes a new splinting technique which offers improved comfort and handling to the patient and dentist alike.

AB  - In this paper we map out what we are calling a ?geopolitics of trauma? by examining the role of trauma in transnational refugee regimes and the individualisation of geopolitical relations through mental health diagnosis and service provision. Focusing on one site of entry into the international regime of refugee administration, we present findings from fieldwork that we conducted in August, 2015 in Turkey with NGOs and IGOs involved in the protection, mental health and psychosocial service provision, and resettlement of refugees. The findings that we present demonstrate the challenges of refugee care and management on the front lines in Turkey and the significance of mental health diagnosis, treatment and documentation in the early stages of refugee administration. We suggest that practices of refugee screening and resettlement are imbued with traumatic stressors and trace how trauma intersects with the administration of refugees in different sites and at different times. We argue that the protracted situation of refugees in Turkey (many of whom will wait eight years for their Refugee Status Determination interview) and the multiple interviews and demands for documentation through which a displaced person applies for refugee status and third-country resettlement become sites of ongoing traumatisation for the refugee subject. Further, in the practices of screening and documentation, we can trace the medicalisation of the refugee subject as not only a question of care but also a practice of legibility on which the state and international organisations base their decisions about inclusion and exclusion. The geopolitics of trauma thus emerges not only in cartographies of war, displacement and resettlement, but also in the minute details and performative demands of the refugee determination and resettlement process.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To determine the utility of the ED physical examination and laboratory analysis in screening hospitalized pediatric blunt trauma patients for intra-abdominal injuries (IAIs). Methods: The authors reviewed the records of all patients aged <15 years who sustained blunt traumatic injury and were admitted to a Level 1 trauma center over a four-year period. Patients were considered high-risk for IAI if they had any of the following at ED presentation: decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 15), abdominal pain, tenderness on abdominal examination, or gross hematuria. Patients without any of these findings were considered moderate risk for IAI. The authors compared moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs with regard to physical examination and laboratory findings obtained in the ED. Results: Of 1,040 children with blunt trauma, 559 (54%) were high-risk and 481 (46%) were moderate-risk for IAI. 126 (23%) of the high-risk and 22 (4.6%) of the moderate-risk patients had IAIs. Among moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs, those with IAIs were more likely to have abdominal abrasions (5/22 vs 34/459, p = 0.008), an abnormal chest examination (11/22 vs 86/457, p = 0.01), higher mean serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (604 U/L vs 77 U/L, p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (276 U/L vs 39 U/L, p = 0.002), higher mean white blood cell (WBC) counts (16.3 K/mm3 vs 12.8 K/mm3, p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of >5 RBCs/hpf on urinalysis (7/22 vs 54/427, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs in initial serum concentrations of amylase, initial hematocrit, drop in hematocrit >5 percentage points in the ED, or initial serum bicarbonate concentrations. Conclusion: In children hospitalized for blunt torso trauma who are at moderate risk for IAI, ED findings of abdominal abrasions, an abnormal chest examination, and microscopic hematuria as well as elevated levels of AST and ALT, and elevated WBC count are associated with IAI.

AB  - Summary Treatment paradigms for bleeding and major vascular injury have evolved with the rise of endovascular surgery. Just over 2% of trauma patients suffer a vascular injury. The decision for endovascular or open intervention should be guided by the patient's clinical status, anatomy of the injury, and the resources available. Early endovascular procedures for solid organ injury are independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk after controlling for major confounders, including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival. In all-comers, the arterial injuries are transection (35%), occlusion (17%), partial transection/flow limiting defect (25%), pseudoaneurysm (9.0%), and other injuries including intimal defects (23%). Over half of the patients can be managed with non-operative management with a low 4% failure rate and conversion to intervention. Definitive endovascular and open repair were used in <10% and <25% of all patients, respectively, presenting to level 1 trauma centers.
