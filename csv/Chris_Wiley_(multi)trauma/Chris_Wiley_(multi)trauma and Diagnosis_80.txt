AB  - There is increasing interest in the psychological effects of violence and disaster in both adults and children, although much remains to be understood. Siblings of children who have undergone such experiences have been little studied. Such siblings may be bereaved or may experience changes in family circumstances, or may develop psychological sequelae. They may be affected by legal procedures and media coverage. This new understanding of the needs of siblings may have implications for service development, including health and education.

AB  - Objective To critically evaluate whether open fracture fixation is a significant risk factor for latent osteosarcoma development. Study Design Case?control study. Sample Population Dogs undergoing open fracture repair and dogs diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Methods Records were retrieved from the Veterinary Medical Database VMDB (1970?2000) for dogs undergoing surgical repair of a fracture and dogs diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Dogs with open reduction of joint luxation, dogs diagnosed with bacterial cystitis, and dogs diagnosed with urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma (UBTCC) were queried as comparison populations. Relative risk for osteosarcoma development was determined. Results From a population of 19,041 fractures treated surgically, 15 of those dogs subsequently appeared in the VMDB with osteosarcoma affecting the same bone. The relative risk of a fracture repair and associated orthopedic implants and osteosarcoma occurrence was equivalent to the relative risk of open joint reduction and osteosarcoma occurrence (95% confidence interval; 0.998?1.00). The relative risk of having bacterial cystitis and appearing again in the VMDB with UBTCC was higher than the risk of open fracture repair and a subsequent diagnosis of osteosarcoma (P?<?.02). Conclusion The incidence of fracture-related osteosarcoma may be significantly less than previously estimated based on cases queried from the VMDB. Although possible cases of implant-associated osteosarcoma were identified, their occurrence was rare. Elective implant removal for the purpose of reducing the risk of osteosarcoma after fracture repair may not be warranted and merits further investigation.

AB  - Summary Acute pain follows surgery, diagnostic procedures, or trauma. In addition, there are many medical conditions that cause acute inflammatory pain. Acute pain after surgery or a diagnostic intervention is preventable with the pre-emptive use of analgesics. Acute pain from trauma cannot be pre-empted, and its treatment may require the use of combinations of drugs and larger dosages. The drugs used to treat acute pain can be divided into five main classes: opioids, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), α-2 adrenoceptor agonists, and miscellaneous drugs or adjuncts. Most opioids have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system and, consequently, are often used in protocols for dogs suffering from cardiovascular disease. The most common adverse effects reported are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Physical therapy techniques including passive range of motion, massage, ultrasound, low-level laser, and acupuncture can be useful adjuncts to pharmaceutical treatment of acute pain in dogs.

AB  - Abstract The human dimensions of medical care were highlighted by such pioneering figures as Cicely Saunders, Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, and Jimmie Holland and their tireless advocacy helped to build an evidence base for psychosocial and palliative interventions. In that spirit, we studied physical and psychological distress in advanced cancer and modeled pathways to distress in this population. We considered acute stress disorder as the prototype for psychological disturbances following the acute onset of life-threatening disorders, showing that it occurred in one-third of patients after the diagnosis of acute leukemia. To treat and prevent these symptoms, we developed Emotion and Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE), an integrated psychotherapeutic and early palliative intervention. We showed that EASE reduced both traumatic stress and physical suffering in these patients and a large multi-center trial is now underway. We also identified symptoms of depression and hopelessness n one quarter of patients with metastatic and advanced cancer, with worsening toward the end of life. To alleviate this distress, we developed a brief supportive-expressive therapy, referred to as Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM). We showed in a large RCT that CALM improves depression, distress related to dying and death, and preparation for the end of life. We have now launched a global initiative involving 20 sites to date across North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia to have CALM implemented routinely in cancer care. Such initiatives are needed to move psychosocial care in cancer from evidence to implementation and to fulfill the dream of Jimmie Holland that cancer care be as humanistic as it is effective.

Partial aneurysmectomy was employed in one case and a temporary to permanent shunt graft in the other two. The simplicity of the techniques is such that they may be used in hospitals which are not equipped for extracorporeal perfusion.

AB  - Abstract Many combat veterans with PTSD have co-occurring symptoms of other forms of psychopathology; however, there have been limited studies examining personality disorders among this population. The few extant studies typically have assessed only two or three personality disorders or examined a small sample, resulting in an incomplete picture and scope of comorbidity. This study assessed all DSM-III-R personality disorders in 107 veterans in a specialized, inpatient unit. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders, 79.4% of the participants were diagnosed with at least one personality disorder: 29.9% received only one diagnosis, 2l.5% had two, 15.9% had three, and 12.1% had four or more. The most frequent single diagnoses were Avoidant (47.2%), Paranoid (46.2%), Obsessive-Compulsive (28.3%), and Antisocial (15.1%) personality disorders.

AB  - Objective.? To examine whether major depressive episodes (MDEs) are associated with an increased risk of migraine in the general population and to examine whether migraine is associated with an increase risk of MDE. Background.? Population-based cross-sectional studies have consistently reported an association between migraine and depression. However, longitudinal studies about this potentially bidirectional association are inconsistent. Methods.? This retrospective cohort study used 12 years of follow-up data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey (15,254 respondents, age >12). Stratified analysis, logistic regression, and proportional hazard modeling were used to quantify the effect of migraine on subsequent MDE status and vice versa. Results.? After adjusting for sex, age, and other chronic health conditions, respondents with migraine were 60% more likely (HR 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.9) to develop MDE compared with those without migraine. Similarly adjusting for sex and age, respondents with MDE were 40% more likely (HR 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.9) to develop migraine compared with those without MDE. However, the latter association disappeared after adjustment for stress and childhood trauma. Conclusions.? The current study provides substantial evidence that migraine is associated with the later development of MDEs, but does not provide strong causal evidence of an association in the other direction. Environmental factors such as childhood trauma and stress may shape the expression of this bidirectional relationship; however, the precise underlying mechanisms are not yet known.

AB  - Background/aim Legibility is important for functional, handwritten communication. Deficits in legibility can impair occupational performance following stroke or trauma. Few instruments are available to assess adult handwriting legibility during rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to compare inter-rater reliability of a new four-point legibility rating instrument with two existing instruments, and describe scale structure and item difficulty of each instrument. Methods Three trained raters scored 60 handwriting samples using: (i) a Four-Point Scale (FPS); (ii) the modified Evaluation Tool of Children's Handwriting (mETCH); and (iii) the new modified FPS. Rater concordance and exact agreement were investigated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC3,1), multi-rater kappa (?) and Krippendorff's alpha (α). Cronbach's alpha was calculated to examine internal consistency reliability, and Rasch modelling was used to examine scale structure and item difficulty. Results Rater concordance for the FPS was fair (ICC3,1 = 0.37); exact agreement was poor (? = 0.19; α = 0.19). Rater concordance for the two mETCH subtests was fair to moderate (ICC3,1 = 0.39?0.50), but with no exact agreement (? < 0.00). Rater concordance for three subtests of the modified FPS was slight to moderate (ICC3,1 = 0.16?0.51); exact agreement ranged from nil to fair (? = ?0.06?0.30; α = ?0.05?0.30). Rasch modelling confirmed internal consistency of instruments, but was low between-rater consistency (rater severity variability). Conclusions A reliable instrument for measuring change over time remains elusive. In the meantime, these instruments can be used by individual clinicians to diagnose and rate legibility.

Methods An anonymous survey of all ACEM Fellows (FACEMs) listed on the ACEM researcher database was conducted between January and March 2013. Results Of 108 FACEMs invited to participate, 54 (50%) responded. Over half of respondents (61%) had a higher research degree but only a minority (24%) had funded research positions. The top research categories identified as priorities were resuscitation, trauma, cardiology, ED ultrasound, acute behavioural disturbance and geriatrics. The most common specific sub-categories included anterior chest pain, fluid resuscitation in trauma, and drug therapy for both atrial fibrillation and acute behavioural disturbance. Several specific research questions related to chest pain, resuscitation/sepsis, stroke, paediatrics and pulmonary embolus. Conclusion The findings provide guidance and support for research areas amenable to collaborative multicentre clinical research within emergency medicine. Discussion rounds are planned to translate these perceived research priorities to actual priorities.

AB  - Background Child mental health services and related agencies are faced with an increasing challenge in responding to the influx of refugee children around the world. There is strong evidence on the prevalence and complexity of these children's mental health problems and broader needs. Aims To review the research literature on risk and protective factors, and associated mental health interventions for refugee children. Methods Peer-reviewed studies were included for the period 2004?2017; if they included refugee, asylum-seeking or internally displaced children under 18 years; and adopted a quantitative design. Vulnerability and protective factors for refugee children were considered in this context, followed by the respective types of interventions at pre-, peri- and postmigration stage, and across high- and low-/middle-income countries. Eighty-two peer-reviewed studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Results The existing body of literature is largely based on identifying risk factors among children with mental health problems and predominantly designing trauma-focused interventions to reduce their symptomatic distress. Recent research and services have gradually shifted to a broader and dynamic resilience-building approach based on ecological theory, that is at child, family, school, community and societal level. There is increasing evidence for the implementation and effectiveness of multimodal interventions targeting all these levels, despite the methodological constraints in their evaluation. Conclusions In high-income countries, child mental health services need to collaborate with all agencies in contact with refugee children, establish joint care pathways, and integrate trauma-focused interventions with family and community approaches. In low- and middle-income countries, where specialist resources are sparse, resilience-building should aim at maximising and upskilling existing capacity. A six-dimensional psychosocial model that applies to other children who experience complex trauma is proposed.

AB  - Abstract Coelomic fluid aspiration has been utilized in echinoderms in research and clinical settings. Detailed procedural descriptions for coelomic fluid sampling in sea urchins (class Echinoidea) are lacking, and samples are prone to contamination. The objectives of this study were to (1) standardize a technique for coelomic fluid collection in long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum that optimizes the diagnostic quality of the sample utilizing diagnostic imaging, (2) identify coelomic fluid bacterial isolates (using Biolog GEN III MicroLog and 16s rDNA sequencing), and (3) compare positive cultures to animal weight, holding time prior to sampling, water temperature, and gross fluid appearance. Seventy Diadema antillarum from the Florida Keys collected in two groups (March and September 2015) were utilized. Positive cultures for bacterial contamination were identified in 5% and 44%, respectively, of animals in the sampling groups. Vibrio spp. was the predominant genus identified. Positive cultures were more frequent in the group with smaller-sized animals, increased holding times, and elevated water temperatures. Deviation from clear-pink gross coelomic fluid appearance did not reliably predict bacterial contamination. A standardized technique for coelomocentesis was defined. The use of the proposed coelomocentesis methodology may facilitate improved health evaluations of sea urchins and may be applicable to research, conservation efforts, and disease investigations.

To assess how parents of these infants cope with this ambiguous situation. Methods:? Parents of 11 children with Ambiguous Diagnosis (group AD) were compared with parents of 11 children diagnosed with CF through neonatal screening [group Cystic Fibrosis Diagnosis (CFD)] and with parents of 11 Healthy Control children (group HC) matched for gender and age. Results:? The emotional reaction to the inconclusive result was less pronounced in AD than in CFD (p?=?0.003), and AD parents considered their infants as healthy as controls. Parents? anxiety about their child?s health is stronger in CFD than in AD (p?<?0.05) and HC (p?<?0.001). Long-term emotional distress was rated similarly in AD and CFD, and greater than in HC (p?=?0.0003). The parent/child relationship was less influenced in AD than in the CF group (p?=?0.03). Seven AD and CFD parents changed their family planning projects. Conclusion:? Inconclusive neonatal screening results appear to be understood and associated with lower anxiety levels than CF diagnosis. Concern about the child?s health is similar to healthy controls and lower than in parents of CF children.

Methods This nested case?control study was based on Finnish population records for 1996?2007. Cases from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register were diagnosed with developmental disorders of speech and language, academic skills and coordination by the end of 2012. We identified 28 192 cases and 106 616 matched controls. Results Children were more likely to be diagnosed with developmental disorders if they had an immigrant mother than children with two Finnish-born parents, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.3 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.2?1.4, an immigrant father (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1?1.3) or two immigrant parents (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3?1.6). The level of development of the parental country of origin was not associated with receiving a diagnosis. Conclusion Children of immigrant parents were more likely to be diagnosed with developmental disorders and the association was strongest with regard to speech and language disorders. There were similar adjusted odds ratios for mothers, fathers and both parents. The development level of the country of origin was irrelevant.

AB  - Summary This chapter aims to comprehensively detail the aetiology and development of endodontic-periodontal lesions, with particular emphasis on the diagnosis, management, and long-term prognoses of the affected teeth, especially when the furcation region is involved. Because of the anatomical and vascular interconnections, periodontium and endodontium can influence each other during function and should therefore be considered as one biological unit. Periodontal disease progression can lead to the exposure and bacterial contamination of the accessory canals, more frequent in the apical third of the tooth and at the furcation. It seems to be widely accepted that periodontitis and periodontal therapy can induce pathological changes in the pulp. Because of their anatomical and functional interconnection, pulp and periodontium can be simultaneously affected in what appears to be a single periodontal lesion. Endodontic treatment is mandatory before resective therapy whenever the tooth is vital or the previous endodontic treatment is incongruous.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Despite a policy of zero tolerance towards workplace violence (WPV) in Australian public hospital EDs, the incidence of WPV continues to increase. The aim of this study was to characterise security responses to WPV within an adult level 4 ED. Methods A retrospective single-centre review of episodes of WPV perpetrated by adults occurring within the ED was conducted between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015. Cases were identified using a prospectively recorded security register that records all events of security personnel attendance. The presence of police officers on initial presentation was the primary exposure variable. Results There were 1853 violent episodes committed by 1224 patients requiring security intervention during the study period, with half the episodes (n =?916; 49%) involving perpetrators who had committed at least two or more violent acts during the study period. Most cases (n =?1057, 57%; 95% CI: 55?59) occurred in the absence of police presence. Only 144 (7.8%) cases were managed by the presence of security personnel without physical security interventions. Conclusions EDs should not rely on police response to prevent or handle violence. The finding of a high proportion of events being perpetrated by repeat offenders indicate that data sharing between EDs for identification of perpetrators of WPV can be useful for prevention of future episodes. ACEM policy for WPV in EDs should encompass further details on security credentialing and preventive strategies towards minimisation of WPV in the Australian EDs.

AB  - Background Professional guidelines encourage physicians to provide children with as much information regarding their health as deemed developmentally and emotionally appropriate. However, empirical research indicates that in clinical practice, an open discussion with children about cancer is often lacking. This study explores impeding factors to and possible strategies for open communication of cancer diagnosis to children from the perspectives of parents and physicians. Procedure Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 parents of children with cancer and 10 treating oncologists. The patient sample was obtained from three pediatric units in Romania. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and interpreted using thematic analysis. Inductive open-coding procedures identified participants' accounts regarding their experiences with cancer diagnosis and treatment. Final themes were selected by grouping codes that formed a pattern in the data. Results An interplay of mainly three different factors?information overload and emotional turmoil, lack of knowledge and skills for disclosing the diagnosis, and assumptions about burdening the child when discussing cancer?restricted parent?patient communication and subsequently affected physician?patient exchanges. Oncologists recommended open communication at diagnosis, but left the final decision to the parents. They adapted their communication style with patients to parents' preference. Conclusions Although physicians need to respect the wishes of children's legal representatives, they also have a duty to promote patients' best interests. We recommend that physicians employ a proactive stance in ensuring that children with cancer are appropriately informed about their diagnosis. In case of parents' arduous objections to full disclosure, an ethical consultation should be considered. Pediatr Blood Cancer ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
