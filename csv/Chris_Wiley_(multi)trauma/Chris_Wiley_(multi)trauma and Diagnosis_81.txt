AB  - Abstract The smile is both an action coordinated by the facial muscles and the ultimate smiling pose. Facial analysis has been largely standardized in the fields of dentistry, cosmetic facial surgery, and corrective jaw surgery on the basis of the principle of symmetry, observations on common facial proportions, cephalometric research, and quantitative norms for facial structures and relationships. Achieving ideal smile aesthetics relies on accurate diagnosis. Careful analysis of the static and active relationships of the lips, dentition, and periodontium is required. Dentofacial deformities must be accounted for and the surgery should be designed to best address each issue identified. Case examples are shown depicting various smile types before and after intervention. The majority of cases entailed orthognathic surgery for correction, often comprehensive, multi-jaw surgery, with adjunctive management of the lips and muscles when indicated. The smile should be enhanced in almost every successful orthognathic intervention, but certainly is not always perfect.

AB  - Objectives: We devised a method of irradiating a fresh traumatic tattoo with long pulse alexandrite laser in conjunction with the use of a dynamic cooling device (DCD) to minimize the injury of the epidermal layer before the occurrence of pigmentation in the deep layer of the skin, when the wound is not completely epithelialized. Methods: A 4-year-old girl suffered a burn injury and deposition of fuel residues in a diameter of 5?cm on the left cheek by backfire of a motorcycle muffler. The patient was treated with an ointment at a hospital for about 10 days, and then referred to our hospital. On initial visit, removal of foreign bodies was attempted by brushing but with little success. Accordingly, long pulse alexandrite laser treatment was performed four times in total at intervals of about one week. On the initial irradiation DCD was not used, but was used on all subsequent treatments thereafter for the protection of the epidermal layer. Results: Since remarkable pigment reduction was observed after the laser irradiation, the treatment was stopped. Follow-up was performed while the lesion was shielded from light. Conclusion: Since the long pulse alexandrite laser with the DCD conveniently enables continuous irradiation of pigments in a short time while minimizing damage to the epidermis, its therapeutic effect can be expected. However, great care is needed during the treatment to prevent scarring.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a diverse pathologic process, defined as the formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Splenic ectopic pregnancy refers to the implantation of the oosperm in the spleen. If not diagnosed early, the results of this phenomenon would almost certainly be splenic rupture, which is equivalent to the spontaneous rupture of the spleen. If the patient has no history of trauma, it is difficult to diagnose this condition early and an explicit diagnosis is often obtained by exploratory laparotomy. We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and hemorrhagic shock. Under emergency general anesthesia, gynecologist and hepatobiliary surgeons worked together to conduct an exploratory laparotomy. It was confirmed during surgery that this was ectopic pregnancy in the spleen, which caused rupture of the spleen. Hence, splenectomy was conducted. Postoperative recovery was good.

AB  - Background:? A growing number of studies indicate that low income, African American men and women living in urban environments are at high risk for trauma exposure, which may have intergenerational effects. The current study employed psychophysiological methods to describe biomarkers of anxiety in children of traumatized mothers. Methods:? Study participants were recruited from a highly traumatized urban population, comprising mother?child pairs (n?=?36) that included school-age children. Mothers were assessed for childhood abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, as well as symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The children were measured for dark-enhanced startle responses and heart-rate variability. Results:? Dark-enhanced startle was found to be higher in children whose mothers had high levels of childhood physical abuse, as compared to children whose mothers had low levels of physical abuse. During the habituation phase of the startle experiment, children whose mothers had high levels of childhood emotional abuse had higher sympathetic system activation compared to children of mothers with low emotional abuse. These effects remained significant after accounting for maternal symptoms of PTSD and depression, as well as for the child?s trauma exposure. Conclusion:? These results demonstrate that children of mothers who have history of childhood physical and emotional abuse have higher dark-enhanced startle as well as greater sympathetic nervous system activation than children of mothers who do not report a history of childhood physical and emotional abuse, and emphasize the utility of physiological measures as pervasive biomarkers of psychopathology that can easily be measured in children.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a powerful tool for medical screening and diagnosis, where a small capsule is swallowed and moved by means of natural peristalsis and gravity through the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine.

AB  - Diabet. Med. 28, 1074?1077 (2011) Abstract Aims? The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) Consensus Panel recommends new criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes. We evaluated the clinical and metabolic characteristics, and pregnancy outcome, in women previously classifiable as ?normal? according to the 4th International Workshop Conference on gestational diabetes criteria, but reclassified as ?abnormal? according to the new recommendations. Methods? Using the new IADPSG criteria, 3953 pregnancies were retrospectively reclassified as 1815 women with normal glucose tolerance and 2138 with gestational diabetes, 112 (2.8%) of whom would have been classified as normal according to the older criteria. Results? Of the 2138 women classified as abnormal by the new criteria, the 112 women now reclassified as abnormal were younger and had a lower pre-pregnancy BMI than the 2026 women who had also been classified as abnormal by the previous criteria. The 100-g oral glucose tolerance test showed significantly higher glucose levels in these 112 women than in the 1815 women reclassified as normal (P?<?0.0001). Caesarean section was significantly more frequent (P?<?0.01) and the ponderal index for the newborn significantly higher in these reclassified women than in those classified as normal (P?<?0.0001), and their basal glucose levels correlated significantly with the ponderal index (P?<?0.05). Conclusion? The new criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes identified a group of women previously classifiable as normal according to the 4th International Workshop Conference criteria, but revealing metabolic characteristics and pregnancy outcomes resembling those of women who would have been considered to have gestational diabetes by the previous criteria.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the 30 day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and re-presentation rates of non-specific chest pain (NSCP) patients following four different disposition pathways and to contrast re-presentation rates of patients with NSCP with those for all other patients presenting to the ED. Methods Cases were derived from the ED database for two large teaching hospitals where patients aged 18 or over were triaged between 2009 and 2016, and their diagnosis on leaving the ED was NSCP. Statewide 30 day rates of MACE and ED re-presentations were calculated, and multivariable logistic regression analysis identified significant predictors of both. Results A total of 40?183 cases were included; 16?014 discharged directly from the ED, while the remainder were admitted under Cardiology (n?=?7286), General Medicine (n?=?7739) or an ED observation unit (n?=?4086). Compared to discharge directly from the ED, admission was associated with a decreased 30 day re-presentation rate (OR?=?0.857; 95% CI 0.795?0.923; P?<?0.001). However, there was no significant difference in adjusted re-presentation between admitting units. The rates of 30 day MACE were higher in admitted patients, particularly in those admitted to general medicine; however, this difference was accounted for by differing patient characteristics. Conclusion Despite a slightly increased rate of re-presentation in patients with NSCP sent home from the ED, we conclude that there is minimal advantage in admitting many patients who lack a diagnosis for their chest pain. For a selected patient population, discharge from the ED may become a safe and cost-effective approach. A prospective randomised study is required.

Methods A patient presented with T2 and T3 vertebral body fractures visible on recumbent CT. Supine and upright plain x-rays with additional swimmer's views were deemed suboptimal prior to mobilization. The default configuration of the O-arm was modified to enable imaging in the upright position. Results Images utilizing the O-arm were satisfactory and anatomic alignment confirmed in an upright position. It is believed that this is the first time the O-arm has been used for upright diagnostic imaging (off-label application). Excellent visualization of the cervicothoracic junction and upper thoracic regions was obtained in the desired upright position. Conclusion The O-arm was used successfully to image spinal trauma in the upright position and may represent a new application of the device, potentially fulfilling a frequently unmet medical imaging need.

Method: Six hundred and sixty-eight patients were reliably assessed with diagnostic interviews for DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders to create five groups: Schizotypal (STPD), Borderline (BPD), Avoidant (AVPD), Obsessive-Compulsive (OCPD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) without personality disorder (PD). Results: Mean number of Axis I lifetime diagnoses was 3.4; STPD and BPD groups had more diagnoses than AVPD, OCPD, and MDD groups. Significant Axis I co-occurrences emerged for Social Phobia/AVPD, PTSD/BPD and Substance Use/BPD. Mean number of co-occurring PDs was 1.4; STPD had more than BPD group which had more than AVPD and OCPD groups. Significant PD co-occurrence emerged for: STPD/ Paranoid and Schizoid PDs, BPD with Antisocial and Dependent PDs, and lower frequency for OCPD/Antisocial PD. Conclusion: Diagnostic co-occurrences generally followed base rates, while significant departures resemble those of controlled literature.

AB  - Abstract Aims Exposure to extraordinary traumatic experience is one acknowledged risk factor for drug use. We aim to analyse the influence of potentially life-changing childhood stressors, experienced second-hand, on later drug use disorder in a national population of Swedish adolescent and young adults (aged 15?26 years). Design We performed Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, complemented with co-relative pair comparisons. Setting Sweden. Participants All individuals in the Swedish population born 1984?95, who were registered in Sweden at the end of the calendar year that they turned 14 years of age. Our follow-up time (mean 6.2 years; range 11 years) started at the year they turned 15 and continued to December 2011 (n?=?1?409?218). Measurements Our outcome variable was drug use disorder, identified from medical, legal and pharmacy registry records. Childhood stressors, as per DSM-IV stressor criteria, include death of an immediate family member and second-hand experience of diagnoses of malignant cancer, serious accidental injury and victim of assault. Other covariates include parental divorce, familial psychological wellbeing and familial drug and alcohol use disorders. Findings After adjustment for all considered confounders, individuals exposed to childhood stressors ?parental death? or ?parental assault? had more than twice the risk of drug use disorder than those who were not [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.63 (2.23?3.09) and 2.39 (2.06?2.79), respectively]. Conclusions Children aged under 15 years who experience second-hand an extraordinary traumatic event (such as a parent or sibling being assaulted, diagnosed with cancer or dying) appear to have approximately twice the risk of developing a drug use disorder than those who do not.

AB  - Five centimeter segments of the linea alba in mature, female, mixed breed dogs were incised and then approximated with either stainless steel fascial staples or size 0 polypropylene suture material. Breaking strength of the linea alba closures was determined at 0 (Phase I, 18 dogs) and at 7,14, and 31 days (Phase II, 18 dogs). Histology and videointeractive planar morphometry were used to evaluate healing of the linea alba. Breaking strength and histologic and morphometric variables were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance in a split plot design. In a clinical trial, 20 cm linea alba incisions were approximated with stainless steel fascial staples after elective ovariohysterectomy in mature, female, mixed breed dogs (Phase III, eight dogs). The dogs were evaluated at 1, 2, 7,14, 31, 90, and 180 days. Linea alba incisions approximated with polypropylene suture material were significantly stronger than linea alba incisions approximated with stainless steel fascial staples on day 0. There was no significant difference between breaking strength values, histologic, and morphometric appearance of linea alba incisions closed with stainless steel fascial staples or polypropylene suture material when compared 7,14, and 31 days after surgery. All of the dogs in the clinical trial appeared to be normal at all evaluation times. Approximation of linea alba incisions with stainless steel fascial staples compares favorably to closure with a simple continuous pattern of polypropylene suture material with regard to breaking strength, clinical, histologic, and morphometric appearance.

AB  - Background: Data on periodontal conditions in adolescents in the Dominican Republic are scarce. The aim of the present crosssectional study was to estimate the prevalence of periodontal attachment loss among Dominican adolescents. This study did not attempt to classify the disease into aggressive and chronic periodontitis. Methods: A random sample of 2,007 Dominican adolescents was obtained. A probability, weighted sample was selected using a complex, multi-stage probability sampling design. The study was clustered in 26 schools and 106 classes. The study subjects were clinically examined under field conditions by a single calibrated examiner who measured gingival recession and probing depth at six sites per tooth, with subsequent calculation of clinical periodontal attachment level for each site. Results: The prevalence of clinical attachment loss â‰¥1 mm was 49.5%, with the prevalence ranging between 48.7% and 50.2%, depending on age and gender. Clinical attachment loss â‰¥2 mm was found in 15% of the students and attachment loss â‰¥3 mm in 4.0% of the students. Logistic regression model revealed that only age significantly increased the probability of having clinical attachment loss. Conclusion: We conclude that clinical attachment loss is common in adolescents in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, suggesting the necessity for improved standards of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these lesions.

AB  - Objective To assess the outcome of canine splenic lymphoma treated with splenectomy and to evaluate prognostic factors, including involvement of other sites, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the effect of World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?28). Methods Medical records (1995?2011) of dogs with a histological diagnosis of splenic lymphoma and treated by splenectomy submitted by Veterinary Society of Surgical Oncology members were reviewed. Included were dogs treated with or without adjuvant therapy. Overall survival, disease-free interval, and cause of death were determined. Prognostic factors and the WHO histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma were evaluated with respect to outcome. Results Dogs with splenic lymphoma treated by splenectomy had a 1-year survival rate of 58.8%, after which no animals died of their disease. B cell lymphoma held a better prognosis for survival than other variants of splenic lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma were the most common B cell lymphoma subtypes in our study. Hemoabdomen and clinical signs related to splenic lymphoma, including abdominal distention, lethargy, and anorexia, were poor prognostic indicators, whereas disease confined to the spleen was a positive prognostic indicator. Pre- or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide a survival benefit. Conclusion Based on our sample population, splenectomy alone was an effective treatment for splenic lymphoma in cases with disease confined to the spleen. Chemotherapy may not improve survival in cases of lymphoma restricted to the spleen.

AB  - Summary The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Neuropsychobiology Commission gave the charge to provide practical guidance for health professionals for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Using a consensus review of the literature, an international group of clinician-researchers in epilepsy, neurology, neuropsychology, and neuropsychiatry evaluated key management approaches for PNES. These included the following: presentation of the diagnosis, early phase treatment, psychological and pharmacologic interventions, and maintenance management. The aim of this report is to provide greater clarity about the range and current evidence base for treatment for patients with PNES, with the intention of improving the care of patients with PNES and patients who develop PNES as a comorbidity of epilepsy.

AB  - Nutrition support has become widely recognized as an essential component of optimal care for acutely ill patients. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral routes when possible. However, prescribed enteral nutritional regimens are sometimes met with side effects and even complications. These adverse events have been collectively termed ?intolerance,? and forms of intolerance occur in a spectrum from bothersome at least to life threatening when most severe. Here we discuss nutritional access and its maintenance, introduce and define intolerance, and then review the current literature with regard to principal forms of enteral nutrition intolerance.

AB  - Abstract High mortality rates have been reported for methadone in both adults and children. We aimed to determine the pattern of toxicity, possible underlying diseases and treatment challenges in patients referred to our centre with early diagnosis of methadone toxicity and who later died. Medical files of all methadone-poisoned patients who had been admitted to a referral centre of toxicology between March 2011 and March 2016, died during the hospital stay and sent for autopsy to Legal Medicine Organization were retrospectively evaluated. In a total of 94 patients, autopsy findings and laboratory evaluations showed that cause of death was pure methadone toxicity in 57 (60.6%). Other causes of death were ischaemic heart disease in ten, co-ingestions (toxicities including methadone) in eight, brain haemorrhage, multi-organ failure and pneumosepsis (each in four), meningitis/encephalitis in three and head trauma and other toxicities (other than methadone but including an opioid, each in two) patients. Time of cardiopulmonary arrest was significantly different between those with pure methadone toxicity and those who died due to other causes (p = 0.01). Patients who had died due to co-ingestions and other toxicities were younger (p = 0.029) and took more bolus doses of naloxone (p = 0.042). In methadone users, especially in older ages and those with trivial response to naloxone administration, loss of consciousness should not be strictly attributed to methadone toxicity. In such patients, thorough evaluation for other possible causes of loss of consciousness is mandatory.
