AB  - Jafarzadeh H, Abbott PV. Review of pulp sensibility tests. Part ?: general information and thermal tests. International Endodontic Journal, 43, 738?762, 2010. Abstract A major, and essential, part of the diagnostic process for pulp disease is the use of pulp sensibility tests. When diagnosing pulp pain, these tests can be used to reproduce the symptoms reported by the patient to diagnose the diseased tooth as well as the disease state. However, a major shortcoming with these tests is that they only indirectly provide an indication of the state of the pulp by measuring a neural response rather than the vascular supply, so both false positive and false negative results can occur. The relevant literature on pulp sensibility tests in the context of endodontics up to January 2009 was reviewed using PubMed and MEDLINE database searches. This search identified papers published between November 1964 and January 2009 in all languages. Thermal tests have been used as an integral part of dental examinations. Two types of thermal tests are available, one uses a cold stimulus and the other uses a hot stimulus, and each has various methods of delivery. If these tests are used properly, injury to the pulp is highly unlikely. A review of the literature regarding the rationale, indications, limitations, and interpretation of thermal tests, the value of these diagnostic tests, as well as a discussion of the important points about each of these tests is presented.

AB  - Objective To assess the outcome of canine splenic lymphoma treated with splenectomy and to evaluate prognostic factors, including involvement of other sites, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the effect of World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?28). Methods Medical records (1995?2011) of dogs with a histological diagnosis of splenic lymphoma and treated by splenectomy submitted by Veterinary Society of Surgical Oncology members were reviewed. Included were dogs treated with or without adjuvant therapy. Overall survival, disease-free interval, and cause of death were determined. Prognostic factors and the WHO histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma were evaluated with respect to outcome. Results Dogs with splenic lymphoma treated by splenectomy had a 1-year survival rate of 58.8%, after which no animals died of their disease. B cell lymphoma held a better prognosis for survival than other variants of splenic lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma were the most common B cell lymphoma subtypes in our study. Hemoabdomen and clinical signs related to splenic lymphoma, including abdominal distention, lethargy, and anorexia, were poor prognostic indicators, whereas disease confined to the spleen was a positive prognostic indicator. Pre- or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide a survival benefit. Conclusion Based on our sample population, splenectomy alone was an effective treatment for splenic lymphoma in cases with disease confined to the spleen. Chemotherapy may not improve survival in cases of lymphoma restricted to the spleen.

AB  - Summary This case report provides a clinical description of an epithelioid variant of haemangiosarcoma in a horse. Haemangiosarcomas are rare neoplasms in equids, and only recently have the pathological aspects of the epithelioid variant in horses been described. Despite performance of cytology and surgical biopsy, the ante mortem diagnosis was incorrect in this case, demonstrating the common problem with diagnosing this neoplasm due to the lack of overt vascular differentiation. Due to the deteriorating condition of the patient, no antineoplastic treatment was attempted. A post mortem computed tomography helped characterise the invasive nature of the tumour. Only with post mortem sampling was the diagnosis of epithelioid variant of haemangiosarcoma discovered.

AB  - Summary The past few decades have seen major advances in multidisciplinary obstetric care and management of gynecological conditions in women with bleeding disorders. Awareness of the impact of bleeding disorders has improved among the obstetric and gynecological community. Undiagnosed bleeding disorders can be the underlying cause for a significant proportion of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. They may also be the cause or a contributory factor for other gynecological problems, such as dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, and endometriosis. Hemostatic assessment should be considered in women referred for menstrual abnormalities if they have a positive bleeding history as quantified by bleeding assessment tools. The reproductive choices and options for prenatal diagnosis are also expanding for families with hemophilia with a drive toward achieving a non-invasive approach. Current non-invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques are limited to identification of fetal gender. Research is ongoing to overcome the specific diagnostic challenges of identifying hemophilia mutations, utilizing free fetal DNA circulating in maternal plasma. The management of obstetric hemorrhage has recently evolved to include a greater focus on the identification of and early treatment for coagulation disorders. Deficiencies in certain hemostatic variables are associated with progression to more severe bleeding; therefore, specific interventions have been proposed to target this. Evidence is still lacking to support such strategy, and future research is required to assess the efficacy and the safety of these hemostatic interventions in women with persistent PPH.

AB  - Summary Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) often occurs in patients with associated autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, but it can also occur in patients without other associated autoimmune disease. Studies of women with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-related complications show that women with thrombotic complications of APS have higher rates of pre-term delivery. Women with APS need close monitoring throughout pregnancy. Uterine artery Doppler scanning is recommended at 20-24 weeks, to check for evidence of bilateral uterine arterial notching, which has been shown to be predictive of placental dysfunction in women with APS. If bilateral notching is detected, serial growth scans are performed to monitor for intrauterine growth restriction. Patients present with multi-organ failure due to widespread thrombosis, and there is an associated high mortality rate. They require aggressive management, usually in an intensive care setting, with a combination of steroids, anticoagulation and/or plasma exchange.

AB  - We conducted an exploratory, qualitative study investigating experiences of women who had developed breast cancer under the age of 40 and who were identified as BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. These germline mutation carriers face an increased lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer and an increased risk for a primary ovarian cancer. Thirteen women who fit this criteria participated in three focus groups conducted at a major cancer center in the UK during Spring 2003. We asked broad, open-ended questions that allowed for a wide range of responses about their cancer and genetic testing experiences, physical and psycho-social concerns, family and partner reactions and their need for social support. The women expressed feelings of devastation, loneliness, feeling different and isolation, ambivalence about having to support family members, worries about partner's anxiety and depression, and anxiety about talking to family members, especially children. These feelings were stronger after the cancer diagnosis and compounded by the genetic test results that occurred at a later time. We also found that, at least temporarily, the women experienced what we call ?social separation??emotional distance from, or dissonance with groups they interact with or are part of, e.g., family and friends, frequently leading to a reduction in communication or a change in previously unstated, but accepted normal interaction. We concentrate on a few characteristics of social separation?feelings of aloneness, isolation and separation, use of silence and verbal discretion, the relationship between estrangement and kinship interaction and norm disruption, and are looking at social patterns of interpersonal relationships that may occur when risk and illness statuses are new and framing and feeling rules have not as yet been clearly developed due to a cultural lag.

AB  - Objectives The current study examined whether various types of rumination are distinguishable and the effects of personal growth initiative (PGI) on posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress, and depression through adaptive and maladaptive rumination. Method Sample included 292 college students who experienced a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Results Intrusive and deliberative rumination were found to be distinct factors. However, brooding and reflection, thought to be separate aspects of depression, were a single factor. PGI was positively associated with growth and negatively associated with depression for both genders, and a negative relationship was found between PGI and posttraumatic stress among women. Indirect effects of PGI were found on posttraumatic stress and growth through different forms of rumination. These relations did not change after including the covariates (i.e., time since the trauma, direct exposure, and intentional harm). Conclusion The study provides new insight integrating rumination from the depression literature in the context of trauma and a potential benefit in applying PGI in alleviating pathology after a PTE and facilitating growth.

AB  - Abstract This is the continuation of an article that presents a generic four-quadrant ground map for working with conflict. Four key tasks of conflict transformation and proactive peacebuilding are explored: Q1.?Personal resources Q2.?Interpersonal and intercultural issues Q3.?Bio-psycho-social determinants Q4.?Organizational and systemic dimensions Quadrant 1, which maps personal resources, and Quadrant 2, which deals with the interpersonal and intercultural dimensions of conflict, were covered in the previous issue of this journal. In this issue I present the remaining two quadrants of the ground map: Quadrant 3, which addresses bio-psycho-social determinants of conflict, and Quadrant 4, which covers the systemic and organizational dimensions of conflict. This concludes the first conceptual part of this four-quadrant framework for understanding and working with conflict. In Part Two of this framework this conceptual ground map is applied to generate four practical steps towards transforming conflict on the road to peace: Step 1.?Diagnosis: what is going on here ? both good and bad? Step 2.?Prognosis: what are the options for change? Step 3.?'Treatment': what are the real-time possibilities for change? Step 4.?Maintenance: what will be needed to maintain these gains (stability under stress)? Part Three of this four-quadrant framework sets out common topics in a curriculum for peace work that addresses the theory and practice of conflict transformation by peaceful means. This includes: 1. Understanding root causes of conflict and other conflict contributing factors. 2. Theoretical approaches to understanding violence: structural, cultural and direct violence. 3. Mapping conflict positions, interests, needs, attitudes and behaviours of the actors, stakeholders and ?conflict entrepreneurs? involved in the conflict. 4. ?Multi-track diplomacy?, conflict settlement, management, and sustainable reintegration of conflict actors, (re)construction of infrastructure and sustainable development through institution building and wealth creation. I conclude by outlining four essential qualities for peace builders: The capacity to: 1 witness pain, distress and suffering. 2 hear complaints made by either party, connect emotionally with their pain and offer listening and understanding in a compassionate and intelligent way. 3 target those peacebuilding interventions that have the greatest leverage. 4 implement coherent partnership working across all four conflict quadrants. In the Appendix I introduce the recent international initiative for creating ministries or departments for peace in government. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Azygos vein aneurysm is a rare disease. Surgical resection is usually performed when it ruptures. To avoid the thromboembolism, procedures that do not touch or push the aneurysm are recommended. Herein, we report a case of idiopathic azygos vein aneurysm. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for right lateral chest pain. Chest enhanced multi-detector CT revealed an azygos vein aneurysm in the posterior mediastinal space. No thrombus in the aneurysm was detected before surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed to treat the aneurysm. The patient was discharged from the hospital 4?days after surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was a good option to treat an azygos vein aneurysm, and an enhanced multi-detector CT was useful for performing surgery safely.

AB  - Abstract High mortality rates have been reported for methadone in both adults and children. We aimed to determine the pattern of toxicity, possible underlying diseases and treatment challenges in patients referred to our centre with early diagnosis of methadone toxicity and who later died. Medical files of all methadone-poisoned patients who had been admitted to a referral centre of toxicology between March 2011 and March 2016, died during the hospital stay and sent for autopsy to Legal Medicine Organization were retrospectively evaluated. In a total of 94 patients, autopsy findings and laboratory evaluations showed that cause of death was pure methadone toxicity in 57 (60.6%). Other causes of death were ischaemic heart disease in ten, co-ingestions (toxicities including methadone) in eight, brain haemorrhage, multi-organ failure and pneumosepsis (each in four), meningitis/encephalitis in three and head trauma and other toxicities (other than methadone but including an opioid, each in two) patients. Time of cardiopulmonary arrest was significantly different between those with pure methadone toxicity and those who died due to other causes (p = 0.01). Patients who had died due to co-ingestions and other toxicities were younger (p = 0.029) and took more bolus doses of naloxone (p = 0.042). In methadone users, especially in older ages and those with trivial response to naloxone administration, loss of consciousness should not be strictly attributed to methadone toxicity. In such patients, thorough evaluation for other possible causes of loss of consciousness is mandatory.

AB  - Objective To identify factors associated with a history of suicide attempt in medical students. Methods A Web-based survey was sent out to a sample of medical students. A multi-predictor Poisson regression was performed to identify factors associated with a history of suicide attempt. In addition, an elastic net regularization was used to build a risk calculator to identify students at risk for attempted suicide. Results A total of 4,840 participants were included in the study. Prevalence of suicide attempts in the sample was 8.94%. Risk factors associated with past suicide attempt in the multi-predictor Poisson regression were as follows: female gender (P < 0.001); homosexuality (P < 0.001); low income (P = 0.026); bullying by university peers (P = 0.006); childhood (P = 0.001) or adult (P = 0.001) trauma; family history of suicide (P = 0.005); suicidal ideation within the last month (P < 0.001); daily tobacco use (P = 0.037); and being at severe risk for alcohol abuse (P = 0.023). Our elastic net model performed well with an AUC of 0.83. Conclusions This study identifies a number of key factors associated with a history of suicide attempts among medical students. Future longitudinal studies should assess the causal relationship between these factors and suicide attempts. Additionally, these results demonstrate that current available data on suicide attempts among medical students can be used to develop an accurate risk algorithm.

AB  - Abstract Maltreatment of children is a major public-health and social-welfare problem but socio-demographic variability has received little attention. This work addresses such variability in a general population cohort and associations with depression. Analyses were based on the cross-sectional SHIP-LEGEND examination among 2265 adults (29?89 years). Childhood maltreatment was multi-dimensionally assessed with the German 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ): emotional neglect; emotional abuse; physical neglect; physical abuse; sexual abuse. Non-linear associations between CTQ responses and age were assessed with fractional polynomials and cubic splines. Scale properties were analysed with confirmatory factor analyses and item response models. Associations between childhood maltreatment domains and depression [Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)] were assessed. The majority (58.9%) reported events indicative of at least mild levels of childhood maltreatment. CTQ subscales showed characteristically different non-linear associations to age across the five studied domains, indicating methodological issues like recall bias and the influence of seminal events. Psychometric scale properties were acceptable to good for all subscales except for physical neglect. Associations to depression measures varied systematically across socio-demographic strata. We conclude that socio-demographic variability is a major issue when studying self-reported childhood maltreatment in a community sample. This needs to be taken into account for the study of associations to psychiatric key outcomes. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background Ultrasonography is an effective diagnostic tool for identifying fetal urinary tract anomalies (UTA). Serious obstructive or dysgenetic abnormalities are often clearly detected and their implications well known. Less clear is the meaning of borderline (asymptomatic at birth) UTA, including: mild pyelectasis (MP), unilateral renal agenesis (URA), unilateral multicystic kidney (UMK) and ectopic kidney (EK). Method We determined the outcome of pregnancies and long-term renal function in 120 cases of prenatally detected borderline UTA. A prospective protocol was proposed to the parents which comprised ultrasound evaluation every 3?months until the age of 24?months, and renal function assessment in case of suspected worsening of prenatal findings. Results A total of 120 fetuses had a borderline UTA (MP n?=?58, URA n?=?14, UMK n?=?32, EK n?=?16). Eighteen of them showed some postnatal complication including: associated anomalies (3 cases), need for surgical intervention (6 cases), vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR, 5 cases) and repeated infection (4 cases). Conclusions Fetal pyelectasis, rarely requires neonatal intervention if the diameter of pelvis is included between 5 and 10?mm in the second trimester. Nevertheless, the risk of associated chromosome abnormalities should be ruled out if other risk factors are present. Unilateral multicystic kidney carries a high risk of nephrectomy and contralateral VUR, whereas unilateral agenesis or ectopic kidneys seem to carry limited, if any, negative implications, with the exception of possible undetected, associated anomalies.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Leakage of serum proteins into the brain parenchyma has been repeatedly used as evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in experimental and human studies. However, there is no consensus in the literature concerning this phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have examined this question by comparing frontal lobe sections in seven groups of patients: Multi-infarct dementia (n= 6), AD with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, age-matched controls with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, controls with neurodegenerative diseases other than AD, and young controls (n= 10). An additional series compared prospectively followed patients with a diagnosis of either multi-infarct dementia (n= 5) or AD (n= 4). Albumin was detected in white-matter astrocytes in all cases, without significant variation in intensity. In addition, diverse combinations of neurons, astrocytes, and (in AD patients) senile plaques were present in the cerebral cortex in an inconsistent manner. Semiquantitative analysis showed no statistically significant differences among groups. Anti-IgG labeled astrocytes in infarcts only. Complement C3c component was detected in rare amyloid plaques in a minority (15%) of AD cases. Selective labeling of AD-specific lesions in a patchy manner was observed for serum amyloid P. We conclude that there is no immunohistochemical evidence of alteration of the BBB in Alzheimer's disease with or without vascular factors or in old age. Serum amyloid P binds avidly to AD lesions, but our findings are consistent with leakage through the BBB during the agonal or immediate postmortem period. Finally, no specific pattern of abnormality in the BBB was detected in multi-infarct dementia.

AB  - Objective To describe and compare a large population of dogs that had pancarpal arthrodesis (PCA) using either a hybrid dynamic compression plate (HDCP) or a CastLess Plate (CLP). Study Design Multicenter, retrospective, cohort study. Animals Dogs (n?=?240; 261 PCA). Methods Medical records (2000?2012) from 12 UK orthopedic centers were reviewed for dogs that had PCA to document signalment, diagnosis, arthrodesis method, and complication rates. Follow-up data were used to compare outcome (lameness evaluation and radiographic healing) after use of HDCP and CLP plates. Results PCA was performed with HDCP in 125 cases, CLP in 105, and by other techniques in 31. Carpal hyperextension injury was the most common diagnosis in HDCP and CLP groups. Surgical site infection (18.3%) was the most common postoperative complication. There was no difference in intra- (11% HDCP, 21% CLP) or postoperative (34% HDCP, 41% CLP) complication rates. Use of external coaptation did not affect postoperative complication rates or outcome. External coaptation related complications occurred in 32% HDCP and 18% CLP (P?=?.02). At median follow-up, most dogs were classified as having no or mild lameness (73% HDCP, 83% CLP) and there was radiographic healing in 40% HDCP and 46% CLP (P?=?.8) cases. Conclusions CLP and HDCP may both be used successfully to achieve pancarpal arthrodesis. Adjunctive external coaptation does not appear to have a measurable clinical benefit but is associated with morbidity.

AB  - Summary Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.
