AB  - Abstract Functional chronic visceral pain (FCVP) is one of the most common causes of morbidity in the general population. Pain perceived within the abdomen may occur due to a range of different mechanisms according to the organ and their afferent pathways. Advances in our understanding of the complexities of FCVP could lead to the exploitation of contemporary research in order to develop and utilize our understanding of neurobiological and psychobiological visceral mechanisms in a clinical setting. This progression, together with increasing amounts of epidemiological and gender based information concerning specific abdominal pain syndromes can allow us to develop assessment tools that go beyond disease only analysis and move toward a more comprehensive assessment model so that patients may have access to expert or multidisciplinary management sooner, rather than later. Based on current evidence, one must consider the main contributors to pain, whether it is nociceptive, neuropathic or psychosocial or as is common with FCVP, a combination of all three. Aim.? This comprehensive assessment model should encompass not only systematic evaluation for reliable communication, but should also progress toward idiographic diagnosis relating to the uniqueness of the patient. This model should be practical in a multidisciplinary setting, taking into account the multi-faceted nature of this presentation.

AB  - Summary Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) performed by emergency and critical care (ECC) specialists or residents in training improves differentiation of cardiac (C) versus non-cardiac (NC) causes of respiratory distress in dogs compared to medical history and physical examination alone. Design Prospective cohort study (May 2014 to February 2016). Setting University hospital. Animals Thirty-eight dogs presenting with respiratory distress. Interventions FOCUS. Measurements and Main Results Medical history, physical examination, and FOCUS were obtained at presentation. Emergency and critical care clinicians, blinded to any radiographic or echocardiographic data, categorized each patient (C vs NC) before and after FOCUS. Thoracic radiography (within 3 h) and echocardiography (within 24 h) were performed. Percent agreement was calculated against a reference diagnosis that relied on agreement of a board-certified cardiologist and ECC specialist with access to all diagnostic test results. Reference diagnosis included 22 dogs with cardiac and 13 dogs with noncardiac causes of respiratory distress. In 3 dogs a reference diagnosis was not established. Prior to FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8?98.9) and 53.9% (25.1?80.8), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 27 of 35 dogs (77.1%). Two C and 6 NC cases were incorrectly categorized. Following FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 95.5% (77.2?99.9) and 69.2% (38.6?90.9), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 30 of 35 dogs (85.7%). Three dogs with discrepant pre-FOCUS diagnoses were correctly re-categorized post-FOCUS. One C and 4 NC cases remained incorrectly categorized. No correctly categorized dogs were incorrectly re-categorized following FOCUS. The proportions of dogs correctly classified pre- versus post-FOCUS were not significantly different (P = 0.25). Conclusions FOCUS did not significantly improve differentiation of C vs NC causes of respiratory distress compared to medical history and physical examination alone.

AB  - Abstract ???Crown fractures account for the highest percentage of all traumatic injuries in the permanent dentition. This review paper will discuss the different types of crown fracture, from the uncomplicated to complicated, including crown-root fractures. It will focus on two different aspects: the pulp, with an attempt to correlate epidemiological, experimental, histopathological and clinical studies, so that the clinician can better understand the underlying processes accounting for success or failure to maintain pulp vitality. Also, we will consider the restoration: knowledge about bonding to dentin and new material is evolving extremely quickly making it difficult for the clinician to keep up with the developments. If handled properly, prognosis of the pulp, after traumatic crown fracture, is good. Prognosis of the restoration has also improved considerably over the last few years, and it appears that this trend will continue in the future.

AB  - Background:? Diagnoses of paediatric bipolar disorder have increased over the last two decades in the United States, where high levels of comorbidity with ADHD have also been reported. Aims:? To explore how British clinicians apply these diagnoses. Method:? We compared 378 young people under the age of 18 who received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and/or ADHD from a large NHS mental health trust between 1992 and 2007. Results:? Children with bipolar disorder were rare in this sample (n?=?35, 1.0%), particularly under the age of 13 (n?=?9, 0.3%). Children with bipolar disorder presented more often with affective and psychotic symptoms than children with ADHD. Irritability was common in both disorders. Core ADHD symptoms were prevalent in both conditions but occurred in a greater proportion of children with ADHD. Conclusion:? Our findings suggest that psychiatrists in England use the traditional adult criteria of bipolar disorder rather than the broader criteria being adopted by some practitioners in the US.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - Primary urethral carcinoma (PUC) is a rare malignancy accounting for <1% of genitourinary cancers, with a predilection for men and African-Americans. The sites and histology of urethral carcinoma vary by gender and anatomical location. Squamous cell carcinoma is most common among both genders but adenocarcinomas are noted in 15?35% of cases among women. Obstructive or irritative symptoms and haematuria are common modes of presentation. Clinical evaluation includes cystourethroscopy with biopsy and examination under anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging provides a highly effective method to image the primary tumour while def?ning the potential involvement of surrounding structures. Most tumours are localised, with regional metastases to nodal sites seen in up to 30% of cases in both genders, while distant metastases at presentation are rare (0?6%), but occur in up to 40% of cases with recurrent disease. Among men, the two most important prognostic factors are disease location and stage. Low-stage tumours (T1?2) and tumours involving the fossa navicularis or the penile urethra have a better prognosis than higher stage tumours (>T2 or N+) and lesions involving the bulbomembranous urethra. In women, in addition to stage and location, the size of the tumour has also prognostic implications. While surgery and radiation therapy (RT) are of benefit in early stage disease, advanced stage PUC requires multimodal treatment strategies to optimise local control and survival. These include induction chemotherapy followed by surgery or RT and concurrent chemoradiation with or without surgery. The latter strategy has been used successfully to treat other human papillomavirus-related cancers of the vagina, cervix and anus and may be of value in achieving organ preservation. Given the rarity of PUC, prospective multi-institutional studies are needed to better define the optimal treatment approach for this disease entity.

This chapter will attempt to discuss the tools and diagnostic tests involved in this process, and current practice parameters regarding emergent evaluation and initial assessment. We outline a strategy for evaluation of seizures that includes a discussion of accurate diagnosis, etiology, and assessment of recurrence risk in order to determine appropriate management and counseling. This covers history-taking, assessment of comorbidities, and physical examination. Additional neurodiagnostic assessments are also considered, including EEG, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing.

The search included DSM-IV/IIIR diagnoses and alternative terms for the disorders to provide a complete assessment. Generally it was found that major disorders and those with neurophysiological components were investigated a great deal (there were over 10,000 articles for both major depression and schizophrenia) while there were few articles concerning rare or newly introduced disorders. Within diagnostic groups certain disorders received the preponderance of research attention. Factors related to the degree to which a mental disorder is investigated are discussed. These findings should stimulate consideration of whether clinical research is directing its efforts in a way that best promotes understanding of the nature and treatment of mental disorders. ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Estimate the incidence rate and provide basic descriptive epidemiologic characteristics of plunging ranulas in a multi-ethnic population. Study Design Case series with chart review. Methods The study group comprised all Counties Manukau Health (CMH, Manukau City, Auckland, New Zealand) patients presenting to the CMH Department of Otolaryngology with a diagnosis of plunging ranula from January 2001 to December 2013, as recorded in the departmental case register. Non-CMH domicile patients were excluded. South Auckland comprised the base population, as serviced by CMH. The 2006 New Zealand census data was used for population demographics. Results A total of 134 cases of plunging ranula were identified. The overall annual crude incidence rate was 2.4 per 100,000 person-years. The gender specific incidence rate for males was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5. 3.9) and for females was 2.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.6). The overall age-adjusted annual incidence rate was 2.6 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.1, 3.0). The age-adjusted incidence was highest among Maori (6.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 4.9, 8.4), followed by Pacific Island (4.4 per 100,000, 95% CI 3.2, 5.6), Asian (0.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.2, 1.2), and European population (0.6 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8). Conclusion We have quantified for the first time the age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates for plunging ranula by gender and ethnicity. The results show a likely underlying genetic predisposition for this condition, possibly with a superimposed environmental acquired factor relating to external, minor blunt trauma to the neck.

AB  - Objective In this trial, we compared the relative efficacy of dialogical exposure group treatment using Gestalt empty-chair method with a supportive group in the treatment of symptoms stemming from traumatic loss in a post-war society. Methods One-hundred and nineteen women whose husbands were either killed or registered as missing during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were quasi-randomized to seven sessions of group treatment with dialogical exposure or to an active control condition. Results Both interventions resulted in significant improvement from baseline to post-treatment for both kinds of loss, in terms of post-traumatic symptoms, general mental health and grief reactions, with the exception of depression and traumatic grief in the control condition. Regarding mean effect sizes (Cohen's d), pre-treatment to post-treatment improvements were moderate (d?=?0.56) for the dialogical exposure group and small (d?=?0.34) for the supportive group. Treatment gains were maintained at least until the 1-year follow-up. In controlled comparisons, dialogical exposure was superior concerning traumatic grief (Cohen's d?=?0.37) and post-traumatic avoidance (d?=?0.73) at post-treatment. Conclusions Results show that short-term dialogical exposure group treatment was moderately effective in treating traumatically bereaved women. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Research attests to high levels of symptoms among post-war civil populations, in particular, when a loved one was killed, which can lead not only to trauma reactions but also to severe separation distress. Grieving the loss of a loved one is hampered if the death remains unconfirmed. Unconfirmed loss could be conceptualized as unfinished business in terms of Gestalt therapy, which offers empty-chair dialogue for resolving unfinished business and grief. Dialogical exposure therapy (DET) supports the client in gaining awareness of and expressing his or her inner dialogues concerning the traumatic event, using Gestalt empty-chair method. Short-term DET was effective in treating traumatically bereaved women but showed little additional effects in comparison with a supportive group treatment, so further research is warranted.

AB  - Summary Developed by art therapists in 1982, the Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS) is a standardized three-picture art interview for use with adolescents and adults. Each of the three DDS tasks taps a different capacity: cognitive, symbolic, and affective. This helps the art therapist to assess the client's issues, defenses, and strengths. DDS can be used for individual use, and also for group art therapy sessions. Art therapy students can administer DDSs and work with the pictures and the patients' process in a clinical setting. Some art therapists collect DDSs for donation to the archive, some start study groups or provide supervision, some perform research, and some teach the results. A small group is putting forth a lot of effort on behalf of the field of art therapy as a whole, from which all benefit. The art interview can be administered for assessment and effective treatment with clients from any country/culture.

AB  - Abstract Neurotrauma in the form of traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts more Americans annually than Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease combined, yet few researchers have used neuroproteomics to investigate the underlying complex molecular events that exacerbate TBI. Discussed in this review is the methodology needed to explore the neurotrauma proteome?from the types of samples used to the mass spectrometry identification and quantification techniques available. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in neurotrauma, as applied for immediate TBI biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of how the brain responds to trauma. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of neurotrauma on society. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 25:380?408, 2006

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to appraise the current regional practices of screening, diagnosis and follow-up of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) because the approach to GDM is frequently inconsistent. Material and Methods A 21-item questionnaire was distributed to physicians taking care of pregnant women in seven hospitals in the United Arab Emirates and one hospital in Oman. Besides assessing their attitudes towards testing for GDM, the questionnaire assessed familiarity with the Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome study and the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups GDM guidelines. Results One hundred and forty-eight (93%) of the 159 questionnaires distributed to the medical doctors (106 [72%] obstetricians and 42 [28%] internists) were returned. For GDM screening, six hospitals used five different tests; two hospitals utilized one single test. For GDM diagnosis, six hospitals employed the 2-h, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (four different criteria) while two hospitals used the 3-h, 100-g OGTT (single criteria). For post-delivery follow-up, the 2-h, 75-g OGTT and fasting plasma glucose were accepted by 103 (70%) and 38 (26%) of the 148 medical doctors, respectively. Ninety-eight (69%) of 143 responding physicians were aware of the Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome study, while 85 (61%) of 140 responders were familiar with the guidelines of the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups; this knowledge was independent of specialty, seniority, academia, years in practice or country trained. Conclusions Although this study is parochial, its implications are global; that is, further education of caregivers would make the discordant approach to GDM (within and between hospitals) more harmonious and improve the obstetric care of pregnant women.

AB  - Summary This case report describes a geriatric gelding with a 2 month history of fast-growing masses within the parotid and submandibular regions. The horse was dyspnoeic on presentation and upper airway endoscopy revealed partial airway obstruction at the level of the pharynx, secondary to a space-occupying mass. Cytological evaluation of multiple fine-needle aspirates obtained from the masses were suggestive of salivary gland neoplasia, therefore the horse was subjected to humane euthanasia. A computed tomographical scan was obtained post mortem and revealed a large multi-lobulated mass involving both guttural pouches, resulting in 80% occlusion of the naso- and oropharynx. Histopathology confirmed a parotid salivary gland carcinoma (papillary-cystic type). Salivary gland tumours are extremely rare in horses, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Treatment of these malignancies proves to be challenging, requiring complete parotidectomy or surgical debulkment, in combination with adjunctive therapy.

AB  - Background and purpose This study aimed to assess the predictive value of multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on survival in a large cohort of patients with motor neuron disease (MND), in combination with clinical and cognitive features. Methods Two hundred MND patients were followed up prospectively for a median of 4.13 years. At baseline, subjects underwent neurological examination, cognitive assessment and brain MRI. Grey matter volumes of cortical and subcortical structures and diffusion tensor MRI metrics of white matter tracts were obtained. A multivariable Royston?Parmar survival model was created using clinical and cognitive variables. The increase of survival prediction accuracy provided by MRI variables was assessed. Results The multivariable clinical model included predominant upper or lower motor neuron presentations and diagnostic delay as significant prognostic predictors, reaching an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of a 4-year survival prediction of 0.79. The combined clinical and MRI model including selected grey matter fronto-temporal volumes and diffusion tensor MRI metrics of the corticospinal and extra-motor tracts reached an AUC of 0.89. Considering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients only, the clinical model including diagnostic delay and semantic fluency scores provided an AUC of 0.62, whereas the combined clinical and MRI model reached an AUC of 0.77. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that brain MRI measures of motor and extra-motor structural damage, when combined with clinical and cognitive features, are useful predictors of survival in patients with MND, particularly when a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is made.
