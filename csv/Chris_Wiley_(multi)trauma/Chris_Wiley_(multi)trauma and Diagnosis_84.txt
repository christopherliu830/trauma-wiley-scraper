AB  - Abstract Objective To document the outcome of dogs with appendicular primary bone tumors treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) and concurrent stabilization. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Eighteen dogs with presumptive or definitive diagnosis of appendicular osteosarcoma. Methods Medical records of dogs with appendicular primary bone tumors treated with SRT and stabilization were reviewed for signalment, preoperative staging and diagnostics, radiation dose, stabilization method, and outcome. Results The distal radius was affected in 13/18 cases. Osteosarcoma or sarcoma was confirmed cytologically or histologically in 15/18 cases. Seven dogs were diagnosed with a pathological fracture at the time of treatment, and 11 were considered at high risk for pathological fracture. Dogs received a single dose (n?=?5) or 3 doses (n?=?13) of SRT. Surgical stabilization was performed under the same anesthetic event as the final dose of SRT in 10 dogs. Stabilization was achieved with a bone plate (n?=?15) or interlocking nail (n?=?3). Seventeen dogs received adjuvant chemotherapy. Complications occurred in 16/17 dogs, 15/17 of those being considered major complications. Four dogs experienced more than one complication. Infection was the most common complication, diagnosed in 15/17 cases, and considered as a major complication in 13/15 cases. Postoperative fracture was recorded as a major complication in 3 cases. Nine dogs were amputated at a median of 152 days. The median survival time was 344 days. Conclusion Treatment of bone tumors with SRT and concurrent stabilization was associated with a prohibitively high complication rate in dogs. Alternative methods for limb salvage should be considered for dogs at risk for pathologic fracture.

AB  - Objective: To report outcome in dogs after internal fixation of a sarcoma-related pathologic fracture of the appendicular skeleton. Study Design: Multi-institutional case series. Animals: Dogs (n=16). Methods: Medical records of participating VSSO members were reviewed for dogs with pathologic fracture associated with a confirmed bone sarcoma of the appendicular skeleton repaired by external or internal fixation. Dogs were included if they had a histological diagnosis of osteosarcoma or sarcoma and excluded if they had radiation before fracture. Data collected were analyzed for signalment, fracture location, staging performed, method of fracture fixation, histopathology, adjunctive treatment and outcome. Results: Signalment and fracture location of 16 dogs that met the inclusion criteria was similar to dogs with appendicular OSA without fracture. One of 14 dogs had pulmonary metastasis and 3 of 5 dogs had bone metastasis. Bone plate or interlocking nail were used for repair in 12 dogs. Limb use immediately after surgery in 13 dogs was good (4), weight-bearing but lame (7) and non-weight bearing (2). Adjunctive therapy was administered in 5 dogs (chemotherapy, 3; radiation, 4; pamidronate, 3). Survival time ranged from 18 to 897 days; median survival was 166 days. Conclusions: Repair of pathologic fracture can result in palliation and prolonged survival.

AB  - Summary Jaw fractures occur commonly in cats and dogs as a result of vehicular trauma, falls from heights, or by, objects, dog fights, and/or an altercation with another animal. With jaw fracture repair it is essential to maintain normal occlusion. The goal of the jaw fracture repair is to return the patient's mouth to normal function as soon as possible. Multi-modal analgesia must be applied to prevent pain in the patient. The use of tape muzzles or commercial nylon muzzles is suitable and sufficient for certain jaw fractures in some patients. Nylon or tape muzzles are also a nice additional support for other types of jaw fracture repair. Interdental bonding, interdental wiring, and acrylic reinforcement are other options for jaw fracture repair that are relatively inexpensive and not as technically challenging as some of the more invasive methods of jaw fracture repair, and are considered adequate in many jaw fracture cases.

AB  - Establishing methods for ascertainment of dementia and cognitive impairment that are accurate and also cost-effective is a challenging enterprise. Large population-based studies often using administrative data sets offer relatively inexpensive and reliable estimates of severe conditions including moderate to advanced dementia that are useful for public health planning, but they can miss less severe cognitive impairment which may be the most effective point for intervention. Clinical and epidemiological cohorts, intensively assessed, provide more sensitive detection of less severe cognitive impairment but are often costly. In this article, several approaches to ascertainment are evaluated for validity, reliability, and cost. In particular, the methods of ascertainment from the Health and Retirement Study are described briefly, along with those of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS). ADAMS, a resource-intense sub-study of the Health and Retirement Study, was designed to provide diagnostic accuracy among persons with more advanced dementia. A proposal to streamline future ADAMS assessments is offered. Also considered are algorithmic and Web-based approaches to diagnosis that can reduce the expense of clinical expertise and, in some contexts, can reduce the extent of data collection. These approaches are intended for intensively assessed epidemiological cohorts where goal is valid and reliable case detection with efficient and cost-effective tools.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

We begin the chapter with a discussion of the epidemiology of PXE, and then present clinical aspects. Next, we consider the initial diagnosis of PXE, as well as prenatal diagnosis and diagnostic tests. Since PXE is a genetically predetermined disorder, we present extensive discussion of genetic factors. Later, we discuss the three biochemical abnormalities recognized in PXE. The chapter concludes with a section on the management of the PXE followed by a discussion of recent developments.

AB  - Abstract Neck pain and whiplash injuries are a common presentation to the ED, and a frequent cause of disability globally. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of musculoskeletal neck pain in the ED. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years addressing acute neck pain assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate levels of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2080 articles, of which 51 were included (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?13 systematic reviews and n?=?16 guidelines). Consistent evidence was found to support the use of ?red flags? to screen for serious pathologies, judicious use of imaging through clinical decision rule application and promotion of functional exercise coupled with advice and reassurance. Clinicians may also consider applying risk-stratification methods, such as using a clinical prediction rule, to guide patient discharge and referral plans; however, the evidence is still emerging in this population. This rapid review provides clinicians managing neck pain in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on acute occupational trauma in agriculture resulting from a wound or immediate damage by sudden one-time application of external force. It provides a general description of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries in agriculture and discusses the unique attributes of farm and agriculturally related trauma. Furthermore, the chapter provides: injury statistics and epidemiological data, rescue and medical treatment considerations, and illustrative injury descriptions. It helps to provide an understanding of how agricultural injuries occur and assisting in anticipating medical implications and prevention opportunities. The injury scenarios given in the chapter should enhance understanding of agents, events, causes, treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of acute traumatic injuries. These scenarios are augmented with special considerations for those who are first on the scene, first responders and rescue personnel, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and transport personnel, emergency medical treatment providers, primary care providers, secondary/tertiary care providers, and providers of rehabilitation services.

AB  - Summary This chapter highlights similarities and differences between brain changes after adversity, on the one hand, and those found in psychotic and dissociative disorders, on the other, and differences between psychotic and dissociative disorders in these areas. Among the dissociative disorders, it focuses on dissociative identity disorder (DID), dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS), other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The hippocampus is central to functions, including memory, spatial navigation, cognitive maps, negative feedback control of the HPA stress axis, and integrated conscious experience or 'construction' of the external world. The amygdala is composed of many different nuclei and is involved in a variety of functions, including fear conditioning, memory, perception, and attention. Abnormal frontal lobe functioning and structures have been consistently found in psychotic disorders. There is clearly evidence that the extent and severity of abuse in persons with DID is greater than that reported by persons with psychotic disorders.

AB  - Abstract In this monograph, we briefly review the rationale for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for psychiatric illness, beginning with current noninvasive treatment options and progressing to the evolution and success of DBS as a therapy. This discussion will focus on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) particularly, as these are the only two diagnoses that have been subjected to adequately controlled DBS trials to date. The majority of the essay then describes the significant limitations that DBS is currently facing and emerging approaches to address them. This will lead into a discussion of new technologies such as patient-specific modeling of electric fields and closed-loop DBS systems and how we can best utilize these to increase our understanding of DBS and the overall efficacy of this novel therapy.

AB  - Summary.? Providing comprehensive care, counselling and support to haemophilic patients, and their parents have always been quite complex for haemophilia treatment centres. Nowadays, starting with recent developments in genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis and carrier testing, the psychological burden on patients and parents might possibly have increased, compared with even the recent past. The emotional strains and worries associated with a possibly affected newborn and his care through childhood and adolescence may also have a grievous impact on couple dynamics and marital relationship. The impact may be even higher in families in which haemophilia is newly diagnosed. The main psychological problems faced by parents and then by affected individuals are herein chronologically reviewed, starting from genetic counselling before conception through childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Aware of the psychosocial burden on patients and their families associated with haemophilia, from prenatal diagnosis and carrier testing until later stages of life of the affected individual, a board of Italian haemophilia specialists and psychologists is designing and organizing an innovative network of psychological support services in some Italian haemophilia centres and promoting specific educational programmes in this setting.

AB  - Abstract Forty-six patients with pyogenic liver abscess have been treated at Paul Brousse Hospital between 1966 and 1986. The overall mortality was 24 per cent, all 11 deaths occurring in 24 patients seen prior to 1978 when there was often a considerable delay in the diagnosis of liver abscess (mean 90 ± 71 days). In seven patients the diagnosis was not made until post-mortem examination. The mainstay of treatment was surgical drainage. Since 1978 high resolution imaging techniques for the liver, and in particular ultrasound, have been available. The diagnostic delay has been significantly reduced (mean 28±20 days, P<0.01). Patients are receiving definitive treatment at an earlier stage in the evolution of the disease process, with fewer established complications prior to treatment (P < 0.05). Percutaneous drainage under ultrasound control is the preferred initial drainage procedure in high-risk patients. There have been no deaths in 22 patients treated for pyogenic liver abscess since 1978 (P<0.001).

AB  - Summary Paragangliomas (phaeochromocytomas) can present with life-threatening catecholamine-induced crises: hypertensive crisis; atrial and ventricular arrhythmias; hypotensive crisis; and multi-organ crisis. Crises may be triggered by administration of drugs, such as dopamine antagonists, or anaesthetic agents. Manipulation of the tumour is likely to trigger a crisis in a patient without sufficient alpha-adrenergic blockade and exclusion of catecholamine excess is necessary prior to surgery on any tumour located at a site typical for paragangliomas. Dedicated cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) of the adrenal glands should be undertaken to localize the tumour. Alpha blockade using phenoxybenzamine at an initial dose of 10mg 12-hourly PO should be initiated once the diagnosis is confirmed. This carries a risk of inducing profound hypotension and is best undertaken as an inpatient. Beta blockade to control tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia may safely be commenced once adequate alpha blockade is in place.
