AB  - The interrater reliability, confidence and ease of use of ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research were assessed in the Republic of Korea as part of the field trials of World Health Organization collaborative study. A total of 279 patients were diagnosed according to the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research. Interrater reliability, calculated by kappa statistics, was found to be between 0.74 and 0.91 on 2-character categories and between 0.64 and 0.90 on 3-character categories except schizotypal disorder (F21). On the 4-character categories, the agreement in the affective states between raters was lower. The reasons are discussed based on cultural differences.

AB  - We present a young man who developed fat embolism syndrome following a fractured femoral shaft. By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess emergency department (ED) doctors? knowledge of radiation doses associated with diagnostic imaging and to describe their practice with regard to informing patients of risk. Design, participants and setting: Prospective, questionnaire-based observational study in May 2009 among all 110 doctors in the EDs of a 570-bed teaching hospital and a 200-bed district hospital. Main outcome measures: Percentage knowledge score; and frequency of discussing radiation risk with patients, based on responses to three scenarios rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS), where a score of 100 indicates doctors would always discuss it. Results: 96 doctors (87%) completed the questionnaire. The overall mean knowledge score was 40% (95% CI, 38%?43%). Senior doctors scored somewhat higher than junior doctors, but not significantly (42% v 39%; P = 0.75). Over three-quarters of doctors (78%) underestimated the lifetime risk of fatal cancer attributable to a single computed tomography scan of the abdomen. Most doctors (76%) reported never having had any formal training on risks to patients from radiation exposure. The frequency at which doctors would inform patients of the risk of radiation varied greatly depending on the clinical scenario (mean VAS scores, between 38 and 90). Conclusion: Emergency doctors in our sample had a varied knowledge of the risks from radiation exposure, but overall knowledge was poor. Staff should receive education, and the diagnostic imaging request process may need to include information on radiation doses and risks.

AB  - Objectives To describe the clinical presentation, MRI findings and outcome in dogs with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin. Materials and Methods Dogs were included in this retrospective study if they had complete medical records, complete neurological examination, MR imaging, cerebellomedullary cerebrospinal fluid sample consistent with eosinophilic pleocytosis and negative infectious disease testing. Results Eleven dogs were included with a median age of 22·0?months (range 7·6 to 92·0?months). Nine breeds were represented. Neurological abnormalities included obtundation (n=10), menace response deficits (n=9), proprioceptive deficits (n=7), ataxia (n=7) and seizures (n=2). Neuroanatomical localisation was multi-focal (n=4), central vestibular system (n=4), diffuse forebrain (n=2) or left trigeminal/facial nerves (n=1). Seven dogs had peripheral eosinophilia. Ten dogs had bilateral symmetrical lesions affecting the cortical grey matter, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuating inversion recovery images and iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images with associated meningeal contrast enhancement. MRI findings were consistent with diffuse meningitis and atrophy or necrosis of cortical grey matter. One dog had increased contrast uptake in the left trigeminal nerve. Ten dogs receiving corticosteroids survived to discharge, with seven also receiving cytarabine arabinoside. Median survival time was 762?days. Clinical Significance Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affects younger larger-breed dogs, with the majority having suspected diffuse cerebrocortical meningitis and cortical (polio)encephalitis, which can be identified on MRI. Response to immunosuppressive treatment is good in the medium to long term, although further studies are required in this area.

AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract Clinical investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been limited by diagnostic inaccuracy. We employed explicit clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify subjects with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). In a consecutive series of 26 postmortem examinations from this sample, AD was histologically verified in all subjects and was the priMarchy dementing illness. Seventeen of the 26 SDAT subjects had been diagnosed when only mildly demented. Two control subjects were examined neuropathologically; AD was absent in both. We conclude that research clinical diagnostic criteria for SDAT, even in its mild stage, are valid.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case of 7 year-old female entire domestic short-haired cat with hair loss. It provides practical information in an easy-to-reference, well-illustrated format, so that students and practicing veterinarians can develop their clinical dermatology skills and test their knowledge. Flea bite hypersensitivity is the most likely diagnosis. Other causes of alopecia due to excessive grooming, apart from Demodex gatoi, cannot be ruled out at this stage. Performing a robust food trial needs commitment and perseverance from an owner, and atopic dermatitis is a diagnosis made by exclusion. A pragmatic approach is to assess the response to robust flea control before undertaking a food trial. The prognosis is good, if fleas can be effectively controlled on an ongoing basis. The chapter offers questions with detailed answers to enhance knowledge of differential diagnoses, diagnostic tools, and treatment options.

AB  - Abstract Several notable developments in adult liver transplantation in the US occurred in 2015. The year saw the largest number of liver transplants to date, leading to reductions in median waiting time, in waitlist mortality for all model for end-stage liver disease categories, and in the number of candidates on the waiting list at the end of the year. Numbers of additions to the waiting list and of liver transplants performed in patients with hepatitis C virus infection decreased for the first time in recent years. However, other diagnoses, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis, became more prevalent. Despite large numbers of severely ill patients undergoing liver transplant, graft survival rates continued to improve. The number of new active candidates added to the pediatric liver transplant waiting list in 2015 was 689, down from a peak of 826 in 2005. The number of prevalent pediatric candidates (on the list on December 31 of the given year) continued to decline, to 373 active and 195 inactive candidates. The number of pediatric liver transplants peaked at 613 in 2008 and was 580 in 2015. The number of living donor pediatric liver transplants increased to its highest level, 79, in 2015; most were from donors closely related to the recipients. Pediatric graft survival rates continued to improve.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the clinical characteristics, types of vascular ring anomalies (VRA), operative findings, complications, and survival after surgical treatment of cats with VRA. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional case series. Animals Client- or shelter-owned cats presenting to academic, referral veterinary institutions. Methods Medical records of cats with VRA that underwent surgical treatment were reviewed. Signalment, relevant medical history, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, complications, and survival were recorded. Results Twenty cats with VRA were included. Vascular ring anomalies were most commonly (75% [15/20]) diagnosed in cats less than 1?year old, with no breed or sex predilection. Regurgitation was the most common clinical sign, present in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. A persistent right aortic arch was diagnosed in 17 of 20 (85%) cats, with concurrent aberrant left subclavian artery in four of the cats. Surgical treatment was associated with survival to discharge in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. Persistent clinical signs were reported in nine of 13 (69%) cats, and radiographic evidence of megaesophagus persisted in four of 13 (31%) cats, with a median follow-up of 275?days after discharge. Conclusion Persistent right aortic arch was the most commonly diagnosed VRA in cats in this series, although multiple anomalies were observed. Surgical treatment of VRA in cats was associated with a high survival to discharge, although persistence of clinical signs and megaesophagus was noted in 69% and 31% of the cats, respectively. Clinical significance Surgical treatment of VRA in cats is associated with a high survival rate; however, persistence of clinical signs is an expected outcome.

AB  - Abstract The suspicion of an abnormality of the central nervous (CNS) system raises difficult questions for the clinician and the family and will inevitably lead to considerable anxiety. These questions include what it means for the child's future, whether it can be treated and whether it will happen again in subsequent pregnancies. For many disorders accurate prenatal diagnosis remains elusive, as even with fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), early recognition and characterisation are simply not possible because of the immature state of brain development at that stage of pregnancy. The natural history of many prenatally diagnosed CNS disorders remains to be elucidated which means that an accurate prognosis cannot be given in all cases. We review the current state of knowledge regarding the investigation, management and prognosis of the most common and important CNS malformations. We also discuss the post-natal management of these conditions both in the neonate and subsequent pregnancies for the families. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on generic principles associated with managing child abuse and neglect in the acute situation including recognition, urgent interventions and referral. Child abuse should always be considered as a potential differential diagnosis. It can often be rapidly excluded but if it is not thought about, it will be missed. The assessment of all children should follow the standard?<?C?>?ABCDE and full medical assessment approach. A full history should be taken as in any medical assessment. There are some specific issues to consider if child abuse or neglect is on the list of differential diagnoses. The chapter summarizes these issues. At the end of the medical assessment the diagnosis may be clear. Healthcare professionals must be familiar with the medicolegal aspects of their work. They will in most cases cover the following: court orders to enable emergency protection, child assessment, residence, and police protection; and consent to examination.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess outcome of phacoemulsification in cats. Methods Records of 71 cats (82 eyes) from five referral centers were reviewed. Groups were divided by cause of cataract (congenital/juvenile [n = 32], traumatic [n = 33], and secondary to uveitis [n = 6]), and group comparisons were performed for the most common complications: postoperative ocular hypertension (POH), uveitis, corneal ulceration, synechia/dyscoria, and posterior capsular opacity (PCO) in three different time periods: immediately postoperatively, at 1-90 days, and at >90 days. Results Median follow-up was 198 days (interquartile range 64-518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12-month follow-up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%). At 1-90 days, uveitis in 41/81 eyes (50.6%) remained the most common complication, followed by synechia/dyscoria in 21/81 eyes (25.9%), corneal ulceration in 16/81 eyes (19.7%), and PCO in 15/81 eyes (18.5%). At >90 days, PCO in 17/47 eyes (36.1%), followed by synechia/dyscoria in 16/47 eyes (34%), was the most common complications. The number of eyes with synechia/dyscoria in the trauma group was higher (13/33 [39.3%]) than in the congenital/juvenile group (5/31 [16.1%]) at 1-90 days (P = .039). No statistical difference was found for the other group comparisons. Three eyes in total were enucleated owing to endophthalmitis, post-traumatic ocular sarcoma, and secondary glaucoma. Conclusion Uveitis in the short-term and PCO and synechia/dyscoria in the long-term were the most common complications following phacoemulsification in cats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the nature of multinucleated and mononuclear cells from peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 40 cases of PGCG were immunohistochemically stained for vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin, CD68, S-100 protein, lysozyme. leucocyte common antigen (LCA), factor VIII-retated antigen and muscle cell actin. Six cases of PGCG were also studied by transmission etectron microscopy. RESULTS: Vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin and CD68 were expressed in both the mononuclear and multinucleated giant cells. Dendritic mononuclear cells, positive for 5?100 protein, were noted in 67.5% of the lesions, whereas lysozyme and leucocyte common antigen were detected in occasional mononuclear cells. Ultrastructural examination showed mononuclear cells with signs of phagocytosis and sometimes interdigitations with similar cells. Others presented non-specific characteristics and the third type exhibited cytoplasmic processes and occasional Birbeck granules. Some multi-nucleated giant cells showed oval nuclei, abundant mitochondria and granular endoplasmic reticulum whereas others presented with irregular nuclei and a great number of cytoplasmic vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: lmmunohistochemical and ultrastructural results suggest that PGCGs of the jaws are composed mainly of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system and that Langerhans cells are present in two thirds of the lesions.

AB  - Abstract Aim? Acute haemorrhagic rectal ulcer (AHRU) is characterized by sudden onset of painless and massive rectal bleeding in elderly bedridden patients who have serious illness. Endoscopic diagnosis and management of AHRU is, however, still controversial. We retrospectively investigated 95 AHRU patients to elucidate the clinical characteristics, endoscopic findings and haemostatic strategies. Method? Between January 1999 and March 2007, 95 patients were diagnosed with AHRU in our hospital. Medical records and colonoscopy files were reviewed. Clinical features, colonoscopic findings, haemostatic treatment and outcome of the patients were evaluated. Results? Eighty per cent of the patients were bedridden at the onset. The most frequent underlying disorder was cerebrovascular disease (36.8%). Hypoalbuminaemia (<?3.5?g/dl) was seen in 92.6% of the patients. Endoscopic findings of AHRU were classified as circumferential ulcer (41.1%), linear or nearly round small ulcer(s) (44.2%), circumferential and small ulcer(s) (7.4%) and Dieulafoy-like ulcer (7.4%). Primary endoscopic haemostatic treatment was performed in 45.3% of cases. Recurrent bleeding occurred in 24.2% of patients. Permanent haemostasis was achieved by secondary endoscopic treatment in 82.6% of re-bleeding patients. Conclusion? Understanding the typical clinical and endoscopic findings and careful endoscopic examination are important for the accurate diagnosis of AHRU, and endoscopic haemostatic therapy may be effective for bleeding patients.
