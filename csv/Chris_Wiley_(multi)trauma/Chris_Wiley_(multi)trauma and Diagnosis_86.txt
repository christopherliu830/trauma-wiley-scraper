AB  - Abstract Objective Although the survival outcomes among women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are very favorable, little is known about the long-term impact of their cancer experience. This study identifies the extent of positive and negative impacts of cancer and factors associated with this, amongst long-term survivors of endometrial cancer. Methods Australian women diagnosed with endometrial cancer (N?=?632) were sent questionnaires at the time of diagnosis and 3?5?years later. Hierarchical multiple regression models were used to examine whether a range of variables at diagnosis/treatment predicted subsequent scores on the Impact of Cancer Scale, which examines positive (e.g. health awareness) and negative (e.g. appearance concerns) impacts amongst cancer survivors. Results Overall, women had a higher mean score for the positive than negative impact scales (M?=?3.5 versus M?=?2.5, respectively). An intermediate grade of endometrial cancer, a prior diagnosis of cancer and lower levels of education were significant, but weak, predictors of higher scores on the positive impact scale. Higher scores on the negative impact scale were predicted by a higher grade of cancer, poor physical and mental health, a younger age, being single or having lower levels of education. Conclusions The study demonstrates that factors that predict positive impact in cancer survivors differ to those that predict negative impact, suggesting that interventions to optimize cancer survivors' quality of life will need to be multi-dimensional, and this supports the need for tailored intervention.

AB  - Abstract We present a case of 80-year-old man who had headache of 1?day duration and gross subdural haemorrhage in the absence of any history of noticeable trauma, leading to descending transtentorial herniation and secondary brain stem haemorrhages called Duret haemorrhages. It is rare to find a Duret haemorrhage on imaging. This case has been presented to highlight the rarity of the condition and the unusual posterior location of the bleed and also the universally fatal nature of these haemorrhages. Relevant literature is reviewed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lungs are allocated to adult and adolescent transplant candidates (aged ? 12 years) on the basis of age, geography, blood type compatibility, and the lung allocation score (LAS), which reflects risk of waitlist mortality and probability of posttransplant survival. In 2013, the most adult candidates, 2394, of any year were added to the list. Overall median waiting time for candidates listed in 2013 was 4.0 months. The preferred procedure remained bilateral lung transplant, representing approximately 70% of lung transplants in 2013. Measures of short-term and longterm survival have plateaued since the implementation of the LAS in 2005. The number of new child candidates (aged 0-11 years) added to the lung transplant waiting list increased to 39 in 2013. A total of 28 lung transplants were performed in child recipients, 3 for ages younger than 1 year, 9 for ages 1 to 5 years, and 16 for ages 6 to 11 years. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was associated with higher survival rates than cystic fibrosis or other diagnosis (pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). For child candidates, infection was the leading cause of death in year 1 posttransplant and graft failure in years 2 to 5.

AB  - Routine infertility investigations in the male and female include imaging techniques such as ultrasonography and endoscopy (fertiloscopy). However, these techniques lack the resolution to localize vital sperm or to reveal detailed morphological analysis of the oviduct which is often the cause of infertility in females. Therefore we set out to evaluate the efficiency of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a diagnostic imaging tool for micron-scale visualization of the male and female genital tract. Using the bovine as a model, the optical features of the TelestoTM, GanymedeTM (both Thorlabs) and NirisTM (Imalux) OCT imaging systems were compared.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the nutrition support in critically ill patients. The negative acute phase proteins are albumin and transferrin. Their serum concentrations fall immediately after the injury, in proportion to its severity. They are used to monitor the nutritional status of acutely ill patients. Areas of intense clinical investigation in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may eventually be shown to be of great value are cancer patients in general, sepsis and trauma, and general perioperative support to prevent or correct malnutrition. Although protein restriction was historically used to reduce risk from hepatic encephalopathy, such a strategy may worsen nutrition status, decrease lean muscle mass, and ironically lead to less ammonia removal. Many interacting biologic and clinical factors are responsible for the development of malnutrition in critically ill and injured hospitalized patients and also the hypercatabolic states associated with trauma, sepsis, cancer, and surgical interventions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to validate a newly developed tool that can predict the risk of failure to heal of a venous leg ulcer in 24?weeks. The risk assessment tool was validated, and performance of the tool was assessed using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) analysis. Retrospective and prospective validation was conducted through multi-site, longitudinal studies. In the retrospective study (n?=?318), 30% of ulcers did not heal within 24?weeks, with the tool demonstrating an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.93, P?<?.001) for the total score. In the prospective study across 10 clinical sites (n?=?225), 31% (n?=?68) of ulcers did not heal within 24?weeks. Participants were classified with the RAT at enrolment as being at low risk (27%), moderate risk (53%) or high risk (20%) of delayed healing; the proportion of wounds unhealed at 24?weeks was 6%, 29% and 59%, respectively. Validation results of the total score indicated good discrimination and goodness of fit with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.85, P?<?.001). Validation of this risk assessment tool offers assurance that realistic outcomes can be predicted for patients, and scores can guide early decisions on interventions to address specific risk factors for failing to heal, thus promoting timely healing.

AB  - In comparison to hypotonia, hypertonia is less commonly expressed in the neonatal period. The scientific literature on the causes of neonatal hypertonia is scant, with no suggested diagnostic algorithm easily available to clinicians. Aetiologies include conditions affecting the central nervous system and spine, and rare peripheral neuromuscular disorders leading to hypertonia. Aetiology onset may be antepartum, peripartum with either transient hypertonia or persistent hypertonia which may appear later, or from a postnatal event/disease. This review discusses neonatal hypertonia and a diagnostic approach to neonatal hypertonia is suggested.

AB  - The research literature on relational betrayal in a committed relationship has focused on the resulting trauma from the betrayal; however, few studies investigated the potential for posttraumatic growth following a relational betrayal. This study investigated the presence of posttraumatic growth in relationally betrayed women. The research focused on women's perceptions of the relational betrayal, and factors that facilitated posttraumatic growth. Results indicated relationally betrayed women perceived the betrayal as a traumatic event, to the extent that some met criteria for PTSD diagnosis. The passage of time was significant corollary to posttraumatic growth when moderated by a PTSD diagnosis. Finally, certain resources were reported to be more helpful than others in the development of posttraumatic growth. Clinical implications are presented.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND Psychological morbidity has been proposed as a source of distress in cancer patients. This study aimed to: 1) determine the prevalence of diagnosable psychiatric illnesses, and 2) describe the mental health services received and predictors of service utilization in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS This was a cross-sectional, multi-institutional study of 251 eligible patients with advanced cancer. Eligibility included: distant metastases, primary therapy failure, nonpaid caregiver, age ≥20 years, stamina for the interview, English or Spanish-speaking, and adequate cognitive ability. Trained interviewers administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) modules for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and a detailed questionnaire regarding mental health service utilization. RESULTS Overall, 12% met criteria for a major psychiatric condition and 28% had accessed a mental health intervention for a psychiatric illness since the cancer diagnosis. Seventeen percent had discussions with a mental health professional; 90% were willing to receive treatment for emotional problems. Mental health services were not accessed by 55% of patients with major psychiatric disorders. Cancer patients who had discussed psychological concerns with mental health staff (odds ratio [OR] = 19.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.90?41.50) and non-Hispanic white patients (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.01?7.43) were more likely to receive mental health services in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS Advanced cancer patients experience major psychiatric disorders at a prevalence similar to the general population, but affected individuals have a low rate of utilizing mental health services. Oncology providers can enhance utilization of mental health services, and potentially improve clinical outcomes, by discussing mental health concerns with their patients.

AB  - Lymphoma is reported to be the most common nasal and second most common intracranial neoplasm in cats. Intracranial lymphoma may occur as a primary central nervous system lymphoma or as part of multi-centric disease. Two cats were presented with histopathologically confirmed nasopharyngeal lymphoma and concurrent mass within the middle fossa of the cranial cavity, with magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of direct communication. Both cats demonstrated evidence of bilateral oculomotor nerve deficits and upper respiratory tract noise. In one cat, bilateral optic nerve deficits were also present. The magnetic resonance imaging features were similar in both cases and demonstrated a contrast-enhancing intracranial mass on the ventral aspect of the middle fossa of the cranial cavity and an adjacent mass arising from the dorsal aspect of the nasopharynx. Lymphoma should be included as an important differential diagnosis in cats presented with middle cranial fossa syndrome (in particular ophthalmoplegia) and stertor.

AB  - The identification and interpretation of brain damage resulting from a non-missile head injury is often not easy with the result that the most obvious structural damage identified postmortem may not be the most important in trying to establish clinico-pathological correlations. For example patients with a fracture of the skull, quite severe cerebral contusions or a large intracranial haematoma that is successfully treated can make an uneventful and complete recovery if no other types of brain damage are present. However, not infrequently more subtle forms of pathology are present and ones that can only be identified microscopically. A systematic and pragmatic approach through the autopsy is therefore required and one that recognises the need for tissue to be retained in ways that are appropriate for cellular and molecular studies.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - We reviewed the literature for disease-specific markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and evaluated their diagnostic and prognostic relevance in neurological diseases. High tau protein in combination with low amyloid ? levels has a high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (90%) for Alzheimer?s disease (AD) against normal aging and can predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD. The detection of 14-3-3 has a high sensitivity (80?90%) and specificity (90%) for the diagnosis of CJD. Low or undetectable CSF hypocretin-1 (orexin-1) levels constitute a diagnostic biomarker for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Detection of beta-2-transferrin indicates CSF contamination in oto- and rhinorrhoe with a sensitivity of >79% at a specificity of 95% similar to the beta-trace protein (sensitivity >90%, specificity 100%). However, beta-trace protein is faster and cheaper to perform. Possible future biomarkers are: elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor are relatively sensitive (51?100%) and specific (73?100%) for leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors and are associated with a poor prognosis in this condition. Elevated CSF neurofilament (Nf) levels probably reflect acute neuronal degeneration. The prognostic value of CSF Nf levels is highest in acute conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute optic neuritis and neuromyelitis optica.

AB  - Summary Pediatric anesthesiologists care for children with penetrating trauma from nonpowder (BB and pellet) guns. We present the case of a 9-year-old boy who required urgent median sternotomy for cardiac tamponade after sustaining a close-range BB gun injury to the chest. After summarizing the epidemiology of nonpowder gun injuries in children, we clarify the nomenclature, ballistics, and mechanisms of these guns, discuss the tendency to minimize these kinds of injuries, explain bullet embolization, and review (by body area) current clinical management issues.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.
