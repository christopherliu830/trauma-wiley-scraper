AB  - Abstract There is a critical and growing need for emergency physicians and emergency medicine resources worldwide. To meet this need, physicians must be trained to deliver time-sensitive interventions and life-saving emergency care. Currently, there is no internationally recognized, standard curriculum that defines the basic minimum standards for emergency medicine education. To address this lack, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) convened a committee of international physicians, health professionals and other experts in emergency medicine and international emergency medicine development, to outline a curriculum for foundation training of medical students in emergency medicine. This curriculum document represents the consensus of recommendations by this committee. The curriculum is designed with a focus on the basic minimum emergency medicine educational content that any medical school should be delivering to its students during their undergraduate years of training. It is designed, not to be prescriptive, but to assist educators and emergency medicine leadership in advancing physician education in basic emergency medicine content. The content would be relevant, not just for communities with mature emergency medicine systems, but also for developing nations or for nations seeking to expand emergency medicine within current educational structures. We anticipate that there will be wide variability in how this curriculum is implemented and taught, reflecting the existing educational milieu, the resources available, and the goals of the institutions' educational leadership.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a robust, non-invasive means of defining aspects of human neurochemistry. After more than two decades, it is clear that in addition to its scientific interest, MRS has diagnostic value in tumor diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic outcome, dementia diagnosis and prognosis, multiple sclerosis, infections, trauma, development, stroke, perinatal ischemia, xenobiotics and inborn errors (as determined from a meta-analysis included in this paper). However, in many healthcare systems, a new radiological technique requires evidence-based medicine (EBM) before it is recommended for reimbursement. Much of the reason why MRS is thought to be non-reimbursable in the USA is due to recent announcements that this 15-year-old technique is still considered ?investigational? by these EBM assessments. An analysis is presented of the technology assessments that brought about this situation. Based on the conclusions of the EBM assessments, strategies are suggested that involve all entities responsible for spectroscopy including the scientists' role in ensuring the future for clinical spectroscopy.

AB  - Background: A therapeutic model for supporting families of children with a chronic illness or disability is described. The model presupposes that the chronic illness and/or disability of a child constitutes a trauma for the entire family. Method: This paper describes a therapeutic model currently in practice and links it back to psychological dynamics addressed through the clinical interventions and the principles that underlie the model of service. Results: Service delivery comprises the interventions; counselling, psychological first aid, projects, peer groups, parent mentoring, social events and community education. The model is family centred, non-illness specific, preventative, non-linear and flexible. Conclusions: The interventions offered in the model aim to address the psychological dynamics of hope, empowerment, reconnection, coping/resilience and reframing.

AB  - Summary As an acute intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation/embolus injures the spinal cord to some degree, and may present as a traumatic incident, approach to diagnosis and management will be presented as an injury. Patients with spinal cord and vertebral injury or disease can exhibit myriad pain levels, in addition to frustration and anxiety. This anxiety and frustration can compound the pain level and pain scoring of a patient and should be taken into consideration. Before offering anti-anxiolytic medications, consider pain level and provide appropriate analgesia. Anesthesia-induced relaxation of the muscles that may be tensed to protect the injured area and inattentive handling of the patient during positioning for intubation, movement on/off gurneys, positioning for imaging/procedures can worsen the patient's pain and may even exacerbate the injury. Pathology may be due to ischemia, inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tumours or extradural compression resulting in persistent or intermittent somatic or visceral neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview for assessing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic status and symptom severity. In the 10 years since it was developed, the CAPS has become a standard criterion measure in the field of traumatic stress and has now been used in more than 200 studies. In this paper, we first trace the history of the CAPS and provide an update on recent developments. Then we review the empirical literature, summarizing and evaluating the findings regarding the psychometric properties of the CAPS. The research evidence indicates that the CAPS has excellent reliability, yielding consistent scores across items, raters, and testing occasions. There is also strong evidence of validity: The CAPS has excellent convergent and discriminant validity, diagnostic utility, and sensitivity to clinical change. Finally, we address several concerns about the CAPS and offer recommendations for optimizing the CAPS for various clinical research applications.

AB  - Currently the most sensitive method for localizing lung cancers in central airways is autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) in combination with white light bronchoscopy (WLB). The diagnostic accuracy of WLB + AFB for high grade dysplasia (HGD) and carcinoma in situ is variable depending on physician's experience. When WLB + AFB are operated at high diagnostic sensitivity, the associated diagnostic specificity is low. Raman spectroscopy probes molecular vibrations and gives highly specific, fingerprint-like spectral features and has high accuracy for tissue pathology classification. In this study we present the use of a real-time endoscopy Raman spectroscopy system to improve the specificity. A spectrum is acquired within 1 second and clinical data are obtained from 280 tissue sites (72 HGDs/malignant lesions, 208 benign lesions/normal sites) in 80 patients. Using multivariate analyses and waveband selection methods on the Raman spectra, we have demonstrated that HGD and malignant lung lesions can be detected with high sensitivity (90%) and good specificity (65%).

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes several clinical prediction rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) rule was created to help emergency clinicians to determine whether PE should be part of the differential diagnosis when the clinician is really not sure whether testing is even merited. Patients investigated for PE in a hospital ward are likely to have a higher Wells score for PE, and a smaller proportion will score 'PE unlikely'. Rule application relies on accurate recall of individual components, a detailed understanding of each component definition, the conversion of positive and negative findings into points, and tallying of the total score. The clinician then has to convert the final score into a dichotomous category. Finally, a prospective study from France demonstrated that deviation from standardised diagnostic PE protocols resulted in a 6% increase in mortality when compared to those who had appropriate protocol driven investigation.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

Patients and methods : 233 patients (males 115, females 118, median age 28?years, range 15?87?years) who underwent appendicectomy were evaluated. Methods:?? Patients were categorized in to 3 groups retrospectively based on the Alvarado score. Group I: score 7?10 (n = 154), Group II: score 4?6 (n = 66), Group III: score < 3 (n = 13). Negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of CRP which was performed at the time of admission was calculated. Results:?? Overall, 169 of 233 (72.5%) had histopathological confirmation of acute appendicitis. In Group I it was 134 patients (87%), Group II: 35 patients (53%) and none of patients in Group III. NPV and PPV for Group I was 29.6% and 85.5%, Group II was 65% and 80% respectively. Conclusion:?? The CRP level improves the predictive value of diagnosing acute appendicitis in the equivocal group of Alvarado 4?6. Patients in this group with a normal CRP should be further investigated before proceeding to appendicectomy.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a description of a physiological finding rather than a diagnosis. Pulmonary arterial pressure is the result of interactions among pulmonary blood flow (right ventricular cardiac output), pulmonary vascular impedance and post-capillary pressure (typically reflecting left atrial pressure). When elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure (systolic/diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure > ?30/19 mmHg at rest) are accompanied by increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial hypertension may be considered secondary to left-heart failure. Introduction of Doppler methods to diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension has increased the awareness of the prevalence and importance of pulmonary arterial hypertension dogs with left-heart failure. Increasing understanding of the mechanism of development of pulmonary venous hypertension and reactive pulmonary arterial hypertension in dogs with left-heart disease has led to the development of successful additive therapies for progressive clinical signs in the setting of chronic therapy for congestive heart failure due to left-sided valvular and myocardial dysfunction. Because effective therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to chronic left-sided cardiac dysfunction are now available, screening for pulmonary arterial hypertension should be a regular part of the Doppler echocardiographic examination in a clinical setting of chronic therapy for left-sided congestive heart failure due to valvular or myocardial disease.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate risk factors associated with cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs. Methods: Retrospective case-control study: medical records of a first-opinion veterinary practice were searched for dogs diagnosed with cranial cruciate ligament rupture (1995 to 2007). For each case, six unaffected dogs were randomly selected from all dogs presenting that day for comparison. Multi-variable binary logistic regression was performed to assess the association of variables on likelihood of cruciate rupture. Results: Frequency of cranial cruciate ligament rupture was 1·19% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·02 to 1.36%]. West Highland white terriers (n=17), Yorkshire terriers (n=14) and Rottweilers (n=11) were at significantly increased risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (P≤0·002). Rottweilers were at five times greater risk compared with other pure breeds (OR 5·12, 95% CI 2·281 to 11·494, P<0·001), obesity quadrupled the risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (OR 3·756, 95% CI 1·659 to 8·502, P=0·001) and females were twice as likely to suffer cranial cruciate ligament failure compared to males (OR 2·054, 95% CI 1·467 to 2·877, P<0·001). Dogs less than two years old were statistically less likely to sustain cranial cruciate ligament rupture than dogs older than eight years (OR 0·246, 95% CI 0·127 to 0·477, P<0·001). There was no significant difference in median weights (in kilograms) of neutered dogs, compared to their entire counterparts in either the case group (P=0·994) or in the control group (P=0·630). There was also no significant difference in body condition (-underweight/normal weight/overweight/obese) of neutered versus entire dogs among the cases (P=0·243), or the controls (P=0·211). Clinical Significance: Cranial cruciate ligament rupture is more likely in Rottweilers and in female dogs, older dogs and obese dogs. Following multi-variable analysis, it was established that neutering was not associated with increased risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture.

AB  - Objective This longitudinal study investigated the temporal relationship patterns between disability and mental health after injury, with a focus on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Method We conducted a multi-sited longitudinal cohort study with a large sample of hospital patients admitted after injury (N = 1,149, mean age = 37.9, 73.6% male). Data were collected prior to discharge from hospital, and follow-up assessments took place 3 and 12 months postinjury. A cross-lagged structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the prospective relationship between posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms and disability while controlling for demographic characteristics and objective measures of injury severity. Results Acute depression significantly predicted 3-month disability, and 3-month PTSD severity significantly predicted 12-month disability. Premorbid disability had a significant effect on acute anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, and 3-month depression but disability after the injury did not predict 12-month psychopathology. Conclusions We did not find a reciprocal relationship between disability and psychopathology. Rather we found that depression played a role in early disability while PTSD played a role in contributing to long-term delays in the recovery process. The results of this study highlight the need for mental health screening for symptoms of PTSD and depression in the acute aftermath of trauma, combined with early intervention programs in injury populations.

AB  - Background. To evaluate the diagnostic methods and to elucidate the etiology of intrauterine fetal death. Material and methods. A prospective study was conducted on all intrauterine fetal deaths occurring in Stockholm County in 1998?99. During a 24-month period, 188 cases of intrauterine fetal death with gestational ages of ≥ 22?weeks were investigated in accordance with structured test protocol. All information from antenatal and delivery records as well as all test results were entered in to an Internet-based database for continuous evaluation. Results. A presumptive explanation to the stillbirth was established in 91% of the cases. The most common factors associated with intrauterine fetal death could be identified as infections (24%), placental insufficiency/intrauterine growth restriction (22%), placental abruption (19%), intercurrent maternal conditions (12%), congenital malformations (10%), and umbilical cord complications (9%). Conclusions. A relevant test protocol in cases of intrauterine fetal death reduces the number of unexplained cases to a minimum. An Internet-based register on test results of fetal deaths may enable a continuous evaluation of the diagnostic tools and etiologic factors in an ever-changing panorama. The results from the present study can serve as a base for a case-control study in Sweden.
