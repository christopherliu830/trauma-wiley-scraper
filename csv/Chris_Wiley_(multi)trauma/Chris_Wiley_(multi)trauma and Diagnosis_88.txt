AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Women's sexual pain disorders include dyspareunia and vaginismus and there is need for state-of-the-art information in this area. Aim.? To update the scientific evidence published in 2004, from the 2nd International Consultation on Sexual Medicine pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of women's sexual pain disorders. Methods.? An expert committee, invited from six countries by the 3rd International Consultation, was comprised of eight researchers and clinicians from biological and social science disciplines, for the purpose of reviewing and grading the scientific evidence on nosology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of women's sexual pain disorders. Main Outcome Measure.? Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. Results.? A comprehensive assessment of medical, sexual, and psychosocial history is recommended for diagnosis and management. Indications for general and focused pelvic genital examination are identified. Evidence-based recommendations for assessment of women's sexual pain disorders are reviewed. An evidence-based approach to management of these disorders is provided. Conclusions.? Continued efforts are warranted to conduct research and scientific reporting on the optimal assessment and management of women's sexual pain disorders, including multidisciplinary approaches. van Lankveld JJDM, Granot M, Weijmar Schultz WCM, Binik YM, Wesselmann U, Pukall CF, Bohm-Starke N, and Achtrari C.

AB  - Abstract Imaging should only be undertaken if it is likely to influence patient management. The dose of ionising radiation to the patient should be considered. Requesting the appropriate imaging method requires an understanding of the pathological process. Plain x-ray should still generally be the first imaging technique; exceptions include some forms of superficial tendinopathy, in which ultrasound may be more appropriate, and situations where radiation exposure is contraindicated, such as in a pregnant patient. The cost of the examination to the patient and the community should also be considered (eg, ultrasound v magnetic resonance imaging).

AB  - Abstract Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, segmental, non-atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory disease of the musculature of arterial walls, leading to stenosis of small and medium-sized arteries, mostly involving renal and cervical arteries. As a result of better and more systematic screening, it appears that involvement of the splanchnic vascular bed is more frequent than originally assumed. We review epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture as well as diagnosis and treatment of visceral artery (VA) FMD. The clinical picture is very diverse, and diagnosis is based on CT-, MR- or conventional catheter-based angiography. Involvement of VAs generally occurs among patients with multi-vessel FMD. Therefore, screening for VA FMD is advised especially in renal artery (RA) FMD and in case of aneurysms and/or dissections. Treatment depends on the clinical picture. However, the level of evidence is low, and much of the common practice is extrapolated from visceral atherosclerotic disease.

AB  - Summary Due to its increased presence in the press and on television, the diagnosis of lipedema is on the way to becoming a trendy diagnosis for those with thick legs. Despite this, one must recognize that lipedema is a very rare disease. It is characterized by disproportional obesity of the extremities, especially in the region of the hip and the legs, hematoma development after minimal trauma, and increased pressure-induced or spontaneous pain. Aids for making the correct diagnosis are (duplex) sonography, the waist-hip index or the waist-height index and lymphoscintigraphy. Important differential diagnoses are constitutional variability of the legs, lipohypertrophy in obesity, edema in immobility, edema in chronic venous insufficiency and rheumatic diseases. The symptom-based therapy of lipedema consists of conservative (compression, manual lymphatic drainage, exercise) and surgical treatments (liposuction). Until now there is no curative therapy. Obesity is an important risk factor for the severity and prognosis of lipedema. Further studies for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of lipedema and in the end possible curative treatments are urgently needed.

AB  - Abstract Pulpal healing patterns were studied in a clinical material of 637 luxated and 95 root-fractured permanent incisors followed routinely for up to 11 years. It was found that pulpal healing patterns could generally be divided into 3 groups according to the degree of injury sustained by the pulp: little, moderate or severe. Thus after luxation injuries, pulp survival could be without radiographic change (PS), with pulp canal obliteration (PCO) or nonhealing (pulp necrosis (PN)). After root fracture, similar healing patterns could be observed: healing by hard tissue union of fragments (HT), by connective tissue union of fragments (CT) or by nonunion due to interposition of granulation tissue between fragments (GT) resulting from PN of the coronal fragment. In both trauma situations, healing or nonhealing could be determined by type of luxation injury, stage of root development and type of fixation used (forceful application of orthodontic bands vs. passively applied acid-etch fixation). Pulpal healing complications (PN or GT) were based on clinical findings (coronal discoloration, loss of pulpal sensibility) and radiographic findings (resorption processes of the lamina dura at the root apex or at the level of the root fracture). However, in both injury groups the same changes could also be seen to be intermediate steps in the pulpal healing process. Based on findings from these studies, hypotheses for the mechanics of pulpal healing are proposed as well as guidelines for acute and later treatment of dental luxations, root fractures and the diagnosis of healing complications.

AB  - Abstract In 2017, 1492 patients were added to the pancreas transplant waiting list, 964 listed as active, a slight increase from 2016. This is significant because for the first time in the past decade, the steady downward trend in additions to the waiting list has been reversed. Proportions of pancreas donors with cerebrovascular accident as cause of death decreased, with a concomitant increase in proportions with anoxia and head trauma. This is partly a result of the national opioid crisis, and it reflects increasing use of younger donors for pancreas transplant. The 2017 outcome report remains compromised by previous variation in reporting graft failure. Although the OPTN Pancreas Transplantation Committee has approved more precise definitions of pancreas graft failure, implementation of these definitions took place recently, and the data are not reflected in this report.

Multi-detector CT of the abdomen showed discontinuity of the sigmoid colon near the broad ligament on the left side. We assigned a provisional diagnosis of an internal hernia progressing through a defect in the broad ligament. SILS revealed a total broad ligament defect on the left side but no signs of ischemic, necrotic bowel. We successfully repaired the broad ligament defect with suturing. At the 2-month follow-up, the patient remained well with no signs of recurrence. This case appears to be the first report of a broad ligament hernia successfully diagnosed and repaired by SILS.

AB  - To determine whether there are clinical and epidemiological differences between familial and non-familial Alzheimer's disease, we studied 151 patients with the clinical diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT). Eighty-four index patients (56%) had at least one relative with reported DAT-type memory loss; the remaining 67 did not. For comparison, patients with a positive family history were grouped into a suspected familial DAT (FDAT), and those with a negative family history were grouped into a suspected non-familial DAT (NFDAT). There were no significant differences between FDAT and NFDAT patients with respect to age of symptom onset, survival time, rate of cognitive decline, motor function, behavioral signs or symptoms, head trauma, thyroid dysfunction, maternal age, or birth order. There were no significant differences between pedigrees of FDAT and NFDAT patients in respect to the prevalence of Down's syndrome or age of mortality. To examine a more ?familial? set of FDAT patients, an FDAT subgroup (F2DAT) consisting of 33 index patients with two or more affected relatives with DAT-type memory loss was compared to the 67 NFDAT patients in a similar analysis. No significant differences were found. However, NFDAT index patients had a higher reported prevalence of head trauma than those patients in the F2DAT subgroup (NFDAT 22%, F2DAT 7%, OR = 4.2, CI = 0.9?20.0, P = 0.08). Thus severe head trauma may be a more important etiological factor in the non-familial form of DAT. To better examine this tendency, future studies should be conducted utilizing a larger number of pedigrees and familial criteria which account for the number of persons at risk and the age at onset of disease.

AB  - Despite a significant increase in the amount of research being conducted on the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders, there has been little assessment of the utilization of this new wealth of information by the primary care physician. It was hypothesized that there would be a wide variation in physicians' knowledge of dementing disorders and the procedures used to diagnose these disorders. To quantitate the present status of primary care physicians' knowledge of dementing disorders and to investigate possible relationships between this knowledge and different physician and practice characteristics, 50 general internists and family practitioners from Winnebago County, Illinois, were interviewed regarding their recall of causes of dementia, procedures used in diagnosing these diseases, treatment recommendations, and comfort in making a differential diagnosis. Results revealed a wide variation in both physicians' familiarity with the causes of dementia as well as the procedures used in making the diagnosis. Although a majority (80%) of the physicians reported some degree of confidence in making a differential diagnosis of dementing disorders, a significant trend was found between physician age and comfort in making the diagnosis, with age being directly correlated with comfort. This was in spite of a significant negative association between physician age and immediate recall of causes of dementia. These data imply that younger physicians are entering the work force with at least better immediate recall of information on dementing disorders, but they have had little opportunity to become comfortable with that knowledge due to a generally smaller geriatric population in their practice. Secondly, despite good recall of specific causes of dementia, younger physicians were no more likely to evaluate patients using mental status testing. In fact, only 42% of physicians mentioned mental status testing as a procedure with only 12% mentioning using any formal mental testing procedure. Although these data reflect favorably on the medical education system's incorporation of geriatric medicine classes in the curriculum, they also imply that dissemination of the information to the present physician population and subsequent use is still problematic.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have successfully classified 86% of malignant melanomas using a relative-color segmentation method, by feature extraction from photographic images in the automatic identification of skin tumors. These studies were extended by applying the relative-color method to dermoscopic images of melanoma grouped with melanoma in situ and clark nevus lesions in dermoscopic images allow more control over lighting variations, which contribute to lesion misclassification. Dermoscopic images then enable a more detailed examination of the structure of skin lesions, provide much more structural detail within lesions, and contain visual information that cannot be seen in photographic images. This present work extends the previous studies by applying relative-color feature extraction to dermoscopic images to differentiate among melanoma, seborrheic keratoses and Reed/Spitz nevi. Objective: To develop a method for automatically differentiating among malignant melanoma, seborrheic keratoses and Reed/Spitz nevi, using digitized, color, dermoscopic images. Methods: Images underwent preprocessing, tumor segmentation, feature extraction and tumor classification. The relative-color method was used in the segmentation stage. Classification was accomplished by taking the inner products of model tumor feature vectors with test-image tumor vectors followed by the nearest-neighbor classification method. Results: The classification rates of melanoma, seborrheic keratoses and Reed/Spitz nevi images mixed together, were 60%, 58.3% and 80%, respectively. Classification of melanoma and Reed/Spitz nevi mixed, were 70% and 90%, respectively. Classification rates were the best when melanoma was being differentiated from seborrheic keratoses. These rates were 100% and 88.9%, respectively. Conclusion: Dermoscopic rather than photographic images were preprocessed, using a hair-removal technique. They were then converted to relative-color images, which were segmented using the principal components transform and median split, followed by morphological filtering. After processing, the multi-dimensional tumor feature space described herein was used to differentiate the tumors. The high success rates for differentiating seborrheic keratoses from melanoma show that the use of dermoscopic images has a strong promise in enabling prescreening, as well as automated assistance and significant improvement in tumor diagnosis in clinics.

AB  - Introduction ? Current clinical diagnosis of dementia diseases mostly relies exclusively on the symptom picture, but there is no clear dividing line between the symptoms per se and the pathological changes. Discussion ? The above indistinctness characterizes the current most widely used definitions and classification systems for dementia diseases. There is also a lack of integration, as different categories of doctors conceptualize the dementia syndrome differently, and the various existing classification systems put the emphasis on different aspects of dementia diseases. Conclusion ? As a first step towards an up-to-date classification of dementia diseases, a distinction between symptoms and pathological changes should be made. A second step is to find patterns both of biological markers and of neuropsychiatric symptoms that are linked to the various pathological changes of the disease.

AB  - Objective Disruption to endochondral ossification leads to delayed and irregular bone formation and can result in a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders known as osteochondrodysplasias. These genetic disorders arise through disturbances in the complex processes of skeletal growth causing development of unsightly skeletal deformities. Methods? Each syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of detailed clinical and radiographic assessment. Lower limb deformities were the prime presenting feature. Results Here are presented three patients with diverse genetic syndromes, namely Wolcott?Rallison syndrome (WRS), Kniest dysplasia (KD) and Desbuquois dysplasia (DS). Genetic testing was performed in the patients with WRS and DS. The diagnosis of KD was made purely on a clinical and radiographic basis. Variable orthopaedic interventions to realign these patients' lower limbs were implemented with the aim of improving their balance and gait. Conclusions The aim of this paper is twofold. The first part is to outline the importance of diagnosing the causes of various skeletal abnormalities in patients with osteochondrodysplasias by phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The second part is to demonstrate our techniques for surgical corrections in patients with joint laxity and malalignment and show how far techniques for growth modulation, re-alignment and ligament reconstruction have advanced.

AB  - Background:? Specific features and diagnostic boundaries of childhood bipolar disorder (BD) remain controversial, and its differentiation from other disorders challenging, owing to high comorbidity with other common childhood disorders, and frequent lack of an episodic course typical of adult BD. Methods:? We repeatedly examined children meeting DSM-IV criteria for BD (excluding episode-duration requirements) and analyzed their clinical records to evaluate age-at-onset, family history, symptoms, course, and comorbidity. Results:? Of 82 juveniles (aged 10.6?±?3.6?years) diagnosed with BD, 90% had a family history of mood or substance-use disorders, but only 10% of patients had been diagnosed with BD. In 74%, psychopathology was recognized before age 3, usually as mood and sleep disturbances, hyperactivity, aggression, and anxiety. At onset, dysphoric-manic and mixed presentations were most common (48%), euphoric mania less (35%), and depression least (17%). Subtype diagnoses were: BP-I (52%)?>?BP-II (40%)?>?cyclothymia (7%). DSM episode-duration criteria were met in 52% of cases, and frequent shifts of mood and energy were common. Limitations:? Partly retrospective study of clinically diagnosed referred outpatients without a comparison group. Conclusions:? Pediatric BD is often mis- or undiagnosed, although it often manifests with mood lability and sleep disturbances early in life. DSM BD criteria inconsistent with clinical findings require revision for pediatric application.

AB  - Summary Ideally, strategies or measures which correspond as closely as possible to the results of the diagnostic analysis will be chosen and enacted. This chapter focuses on the complex matters and provides some guidance about developing or selecting strategies for change and ensuring they match the characteristics of the innovation, target groups and setting to create the most effective intervention possible. Systematic and rigorous methods are needed to enhance the linkage between identified barriers and change strategies. The chapter explores several of such methods. In order to select the best strategy for the change at hand, it is recommended to supplement the problem analyses with the use of scientific literature on effective change in patient care.

AB  - Summary This study prospectively evaluates whether a previously established adverse outcome score (the Geneva prognostic score) predicts 3 and 12-month overall mortality among the patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) by a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Five hundred twenty-three consecutive patients who had CTPA for suspected PE were recruited prospectively from March 2003 to October 2004. The Geneva prognostic score was calculated for all patients. Twelve-month follow up was completed in all patients in December 2005. There were 105 patients diagnosed with PE. The mean score was 2.71 (standard deviation (SD) 1.25) for those patients who had died (n?=?7) and 1.14 (SD 1.19) for those patients who were alive (n?=?98) at 3-month follow up (P?<?0.001). The mean scores were 2.69 (SD 0.95) for those who had died (n?=?13) and 1.04 (SD 1.15) for those patients who were alive (n?=?92) at 12-month follow up (P?<?0.001). At 3-month follow up, among the 88 patients with a score of 2 or less, three patients (3.4%) died and among 17 patients with a score of greater than 2, four patients (23.5%) died (P?=?0.01). At 12-month follow up, five patients (5.7%) with a score of 2 or less died and eight patients (47.1%) with a score of three or more died (P?<?0.0001). The Geneva prognostic score stratifies patients with low and high risk for overall mortality at 3 and 12?months among patients diagnosed with PE by CTPA.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the survival of 54 cats with histologically confirmed feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) treated in UK general practice and to determine factors predictive for survival. Methods: Cases were identified from consecutive samples submitted for histological diagnosis. Observational and survival data were collated retrospectively from submitting practices. Immunohistochemical analysis of cyclooxygenase (COX) expression variables was available using previously published data. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation for overall survival and Cox proportional hazards regression for potential explanatory variables were performed. Results: The overall median survival time was 44 days [95 per cent confidence interval (CI): 31?79] and 1 year survival was 9·5 per cent. Variables associated with survival were whether the cat was pedigree [hazard ratio (HR)=8·17, 95 per cent CI: 1·96?34·12], whether the cat received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy after diagnosis (HR=0·46, 95 per cent CI: 0·21?0·98) and whether the COX-1 staining distribution was patchy rather than diffuse (HR=0·25, 95 per cent CI: 0·08?0·014). Clinical Significance: This study suggests that although the prognosis for inoperable FOSCC remains poor, palliative treatments may offer a survival advantage that compares favourably with more aggressive treatment methods. Further work is needed to evaluate NSAID therapy in this disease, in particular to determine whether the potential survival advantage is because of an analgesic or anticancer effect or both. COX-1 distribution patterns may have a role as a prognostic indicator in this disease.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Interforaminal implant surgery requires anatomical knowledge of the area and adequate information on the location of the various landmarks of significance such as the mental foramen, the anterior loop of the inferior alveolar nerve and the mandibular incisive canal. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a relatively new imaging modality that provides a multi-dimensional view of the facial skeleton with, in most instances, lower radiation dose to the patient compared to medical CT. The present study aims to use CBCT to identify and measure variation in the presence and extent of the anterior loop of the inferior alveolar nerve. This information may be used to provide recommendations to the surgeon without access to a 3D scan of the dento-alveolar region. Material and methods Ninety-three patients scanned with a Newtom VG device for a variety of clinical indications were included in this retrospective study. Using the multiplanar capabilities of the device's software the prevalence and length of the anterior loop was assessed. Results The results show that an anterior loop could be identified in 48% of the cases with a mean length (range) of 0.89 mm (0?5.7). Conclusions In almost half of the surveyed cases an anterior loop was present. Even though in 95% of the study cases the loop was <3 mm, a 100% safety margin in the placement of anterior mandibular implants, in the absence of a CBCT scan, would only be achieved with a distance of 6 mm between the anterior border of the mental foramen and the most distal interforaminal implant fixture.
