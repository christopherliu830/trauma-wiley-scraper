AB  - Abstract Background Depression is common in young people, has a marked negative impact and is associated with self-harm and suicide. Preventing its onset would be an important advance in public health. Objectives To determine whether psychological or educational interventions, or both, are effective in preventing the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's trials registers (CCDANCTR) were searched at the editorial base in July 2010. Update searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ERIC were conducted by the authors in September 2009. Conference abstracts, reference lists of included studies and reviews were searched and experts in the field contacted. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of psychological or educational prevention programmes, or both, compared with placebo, any comparison intervention, or no intervention for young people aged 5 to 19 years-old, who did not currently meet diagnostic criteria for depression or who were below the clinical range on standardised, validated, and reliable rating scales of depression, or both, were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and rated their quality. Sample sizes were adjusted to take account of cluster designs and multiple comparisons. We contacted study authors for additional information where needed.  Main results Fifty-three studies including 14,406 participants were included in the analysis. There were only six studies with clear allocation concealment, participants and assessors were mostly not blind to the intervention or blinding was unclear so that the overall risk of bias was moderately high. Sixteen studies including 3240 participants reported outcomes on depressive diagnosis. The risk of having a depressive disorder post-intervention was reduced immediately compared with no intervention (15 studies; 3115 participants risk difference (RD) -0.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.14 to -0.05; P<0.0003), at three to nine months (14 studies; 1842 participants; RD -0.11; 95% CI -0.16 to -0.06) and at 12 months (10 studies; 1750 participants; RD -0.06; 95% CI -0.11 to -0.01). There was no evidence for continued efficacy at 24 months (eight studies; 2084 participant; RD -0.01; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.03) but limited evidence of efficacy at 36 months (two studies; 464 participants; RD -0.10; 95% CI -0.19 to -0.02). There was significant heterogeneity in all these findings. There was no evidence of efficacy in the few studies that compared intervention with placebo or attention controls. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence from this review that targeted and universal depression prevention programmes may prevent the onset of depressive disorders compared with no intervention. However, allocation concealment is unclear in most studies, and there is heterogeneity in the findings. The persistence of findings suggests that this is real and not a placebo effect.  Plain Language Summary Psychological and educational interventions for preventing depression in children and adolescents Depressive disorder is common and has a major impact on the functioning of young people. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of programmes designed to prevent its onset. We found that, compared with no intervention, psychological depression prevention programmes were effective in preventing depression with a number of studies showing a decrease in episodes of depressive illness over a year. There were some problems with the way the studies were done but despite this the results are encouraging. We found data to support both targeted and universal programmes, which is important as universal programmes are likely to be easier to implement. We recommend that further research be undertaken to identify the most effective programmes and to test these in the real world.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the survival of 54 cats with histologically confirmed feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) treated in UK general practice and to determine factors predictive for survival. Methods: Cases were identified from consecutive samples submitted for histological diagnosis. Observational and survival data were collated retrospectively from submitting practices. Immunohistochemical analysis of cyclooxygenase (COX) expression variables was available using previously published data. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation for overall survival and Cox proportional hazards regression for potential explanatory variables were performed. Results: The overall median survival time was 44 days [95 per cent confidence interval (CI): 31?79] and 1 year survival was 9·5 per cent. Variables associated with survival were whether the cat was pedigree [hazard ratio (HR)=8·17, 95 per cent CI: 1·96?34·12], whether the cat received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy after diagnosis (HR=0·46, 95 per cent CI: 0·21?0·98) and whether the COX-1 staining distribution was patchy rather than diffuse (HR=0·25, 95 per cent CI: 0·08?0·014). Clinical Significance: This study suggests that although the prognosis for inoperable FOSCC remains poor, palliative treatments may offer a survival advantage that compares favourably with more aggressive treatment methods. Further work is needed to evaluate NSAID therapy in this disease, in particular to determine whether the potential survival advantage is because of an analgesic or anticancer effect or both. COX-1 distribution patterns may have a role as a prognostic indicator in this disease.

AB  - Summary Diseases that are defined in adults as sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted in children in a nonsexual (e.g. intrauterine infections or vertical transmission) and sexual way (voluntary and unvoluntary sexual contacts). A better term for these diseases in children from a clinical and forensic medical point of view would be ?sexually transmittable diseases?. Dealing with a child with a STD requires particular care and expertise, concerning the diagnosis of the disease, the correct determination of the mode of transmission and the way in which the diagnosis and mode of transmission are discussed with the child and the parents.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? Our aim was to determine the obstetrics outcomes of patients with positive 1-h glucose challenge test (GCT), but negative diagnostic test for gestational diabetes. Methods:? Pregnancy records of 409 pregnants were reviewed. Patients were screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with one-hour 50?g glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24?28?weeks of gestation. Patients with glucose challenge tests values?≥?130?mg/dL were refered for the 3?h, 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Positive GCT but negative for OGTT group (Group A) were compared retrospectively with the group of negative GCT (Group B) for obstetrics outcomes. Result:? GDM and impared glucose tolerance (IGT) were diagnosed in 33 (7.6%) and 46 (10.5%) patients, respectively. We identified 141 (34.4%) patients with positive GCT but negative for OGTT (Group A) and 189 (46.2%) patients with negative GCT (Group B). Gestational weight gain, polyhydramnios, family history of diabetes mellitus were significantly higher in group A than group B (P?<?0.05). Prevalance of preterm labor, hypertension, cesarean delivery, mean birthweight, proportion of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care unit were similar in both groups. Conclusion:? There are some differences for pregnancy outcomes between pregnants with positive GCT but negative for OGTT and negative GCT. These patients should be followed up carefully during the antepartum and intrapartum period.

AB  - Objective To evaluate mid-term radiographic and functional outcomes of tibial plateau fracture (TPF) patients treated with the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) technique and to find predictive factors of clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective, single-center study was performed enrolling a consecutive series of patients with diagnosis of TPF. All subjects were treated by ORIF between January 2010 and December 2015 at our level-1 healthcare trauma center. The inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 75?years; ORIF technique used for articular TPF, type 41-B and 41-C, isolated or with associated injuries. The patients were divided in two groups, according to fracture patterns and compared. Their characteristics, radiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded. Radiographs 12?months after surgery were evaluated for reduction and alignment, and radiographs at 24?months to describe post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Functional outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and the American Knee Society score (AKSS) questionnaires. Return to work and sport activities were also investigated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, and the statistical significance was defined as two-tailed P <?0.05. Results Forty-five patients were included, 29 males and 16 females; the mean age was 54.5?years. The mean follow-up was 57.18?months (range, 26?94). There were AO 41-B fractures (partial articular fractures) in more than half of the patients (66.67%), while the remaining 15 had AO 41-C fractures (complete articular fractures). The sub-type AO 41-B3 was the most common, reported in 62.22% of patients. The mean KOOS score was 69.0. Mean AKSS and SF-36 PCS scores were 79.0 and 41.4, respectively. There were significant relationships between age and functional results (KOOS ADL, Sport, QoL, and SF-36 PCS) and between BMI and KOOS Pain, ADL, Sport, and QoL. No differences were found between the two types of fractures regarding quality of reduction and alignment. AO 41-C TPF tend to develop PTOA more frequently with respect to 41-B fractures, while type AO 41-C TPF had the worst clinical outcomes. We found that the presence of an articular step-off and the malalignment of the tibial axis after surgery were predictive of daily pain felt by patients. PTOA was predictive of a worse AKSS. The overall complication rate was 13.33%: 1 superficial wound infection, 1 deep vein thrombosis, and 4 cases of transitory deficit of the common peroneal nerve. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that early radiographic features may be predictive for pain perceived by patients at mid-term follow-up.

AB  - Summary Helminth infections of the CNS are often accidental during migration of larvae or eggs. The lesions can be severe and rapidly fatal. These diseases are common to humans and animals, transmitted by a great variety of vectors or intermediate hosts, and have diverse modes of transmission. Clinical signs depend on the number and location of the parasites in the CNS and on the host immune response. Because there are no specific clinical signs, diagnosis can be difficult and histopathological identification of the parasites remains the gold standard of diagnosis. This chapter highlights the diversity of Helminths infecting humans, their importance in public health, their morphological characteristics, life cycle, epidemiologic data, pathologic characteristics, and diagnostic criteria.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation in Bernese mountain dogs. Methods: Seven Bernese mountain dogs (four males and three females) were diagnosed with cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation by magnetic resonance imaging. The following data were evaluated retrospectively: (1) abnormalities of the cervical vertebral column and spinal cord, (2) spinal cord compression, (3) intervertebral disc degeneration and herniation, (4) severity of clinical signs pretreatment and after treatment, (5) type of treatment and (6) outcome. Results: Spin echo T1-weighted and T2-weighted images disclosed multi-level, extradural compressive spinal cord lesions (ventral, dorsolateral or both) spanning from intervertebral disc spaces C3-4 to C6-7. In all seven dogs, T2-weighted images disclosed one or more intramedullary hyperintensities associated with extradural spinal cord compression. Surgery was performed in five dogs. Two dogs were managed medically. The prognosis for surgical or conservative management in Bernese mountain dogs was similar to cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation in other breeds. Clinical Significance: Cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation is an important differential diagnosis for young to middle-aged Bernese mountain dogs with a C1-5 or C6-T2 neuroanatomic localisation. Dorsolateral spinal cord compression associated with articular process hypertrophy was the most common feature of cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation in the seven Bernese mountain dogs evaluated.

AB  - Abstract Objective To quantify and describe alcohol-related presentations to our ED, as part of the binational Alcohol Harm in Emergency Departments study. Methods A prospective observational study at Royal Perth Hospital of every patient attending ED for the 168-h period commencing 08.00?hours Monday 1 December 2014. Patient presentations were classified as alcohol-related (alcohol-positive) using predefined criteria. These patients were compared to alcohol-negative patients on a range of demographic and clinical descriptors. Results Two hundred and thirteen (15.2%) of 1403 patients screened were alcohol-positive. Compared with alcohol-negative patients, alcohol-positive patients were more likely to be male (148/213, 69.5% vs 636/1190, 53.4%, P?<?0.001) and younger (mean 38 years vs 48 years, P?<?0.001). They were more likely to arrive in police custody (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3?9.5, P?=?0.005), and be admitted to the State Adult Major Trauma Unit (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1?8.3, P?<?0.001). Forty-two (19.7%) of 213 patients had injuries suspected to be caused by an alcohol-affected third party. The ED length of stay and admission rate were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions 15.2% of patient presentations over the study week were alcohol-related. These patients were more likely to present with injury; one in five having injuries suspected to be caused by a third party affected by alcohol. This is a significant public health problem.

AB  - Summary Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) consists of a constellation of potentially life-threatening pathologies that include aortic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma (IMH), and penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU). Moderate to severe hypertension is a universal risk factor for AAS. Diagnosis of AAS requires a high index of suspicion when individuals present with acute onset retrosternal pain radiating to the back. Echocardiography provides a rapid means of assessment in the diagnosis of aortic dissection. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can also provide information about structures affected by AAS. Intravenous antihypertensives are key for all patients presenting with AAS, particularly in those with aortic dissection to reduce flap mobility and propagation, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The general concepts of the management of AAS include intensive monitoring and blood pressure normalization to prevent involvement of the ascending aorta or visceral vessels, as well as aortic rupture.

AB  - Summary Ocular manifestations may develop in many systemic diseases of horses; however, signs may not be observed unless ophthalmological examination is specifically undertaken. Recognition and assessment of ocular lesions in horses with systemic disease is desirable to facilitate diagnosis and determination of treatment options and diagnosis for both the underlying systemic disease and ocular manifestations. The purpose of this article is to review systemic diseases of horses that may have ocular signs as part of the disease process. Systemic diseases are discussed in categories of pathways for development of ocular signs, namely immunological disease, neurological disease or local/systemic spread of disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To investigate the nature and acuity of medical presentations of patrons and staff attending the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (M2006) venues and festival live sites. Design and setting:? Retrospective case series chart audit of patients who were managed by St John Ambulance during the M2006. Participants:? Patients who presented requiring first-aid review or treatment at any of the 21 designated event venues or 16 live sites during their prescribed operating hours between 15 March 2006 and 26 March 2006. Main outcome measures:? Provisional diagnosis and ambulance transport to hospital. Results:? A total of 3514 presentations occurred during the study period, of which 2279 (64.9%, 95% CI, 63.3%?66.4%) occurred at event venues. Headaches, soft tissue injuries, blisters and other wounds accounted for 64.1% (95% CI, 62.5%?65.73%) of presentations. A total of 303 patients were referred for further medical care, including 69 patients (1.96%, 95% CI, 1.54%?2.49%) who required transport to hospital via ambulance. Traumatic injuries accounted for 42.0% (95% CI, 30.5%?54.5%) of patients transported by ambulance to hospital. The patient presentation rate across all venues was 0.857 per 1000 patrons. The transport to hospital rate was 0.0186 per 1000 patrons. Conclusions:? The majority of first-aid presentations during the M2006 were of low acuity and treatment resulted in return of patrons to the event, with only a small number requiring ambulance transport to hospital.

AB  - Objective: To describe the rates of serious bacterial illness (SBI) in children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with first-time uncomplicated febrile seizures. Methods: The ED visits from seven Chicago metropolitan area hospitals (two tertiary pediatric EDs, five community general EDs) for all pediatric patients seen between July 1995 and December 1997 with a discharge diagnosis including the term ?seizure? were retrospectively identified. Records of patients who met criteria for simple, first-time febrile seizure were reviewed (age 6-60 months; temperature ≥38.0°C; single, generalized, tonic?clonic seizure <20 minutes; absence of known central nervous system disease). Rates of bacteremia, urinary tract infection, bacterial meningitis, and pneumonia were determined. Results: Four hundred fifty-five children were identified who had first-time simple febrile seizures. The study participants had a mean age of 21 months and a mean temperature of 39.6°C, and 64% were male. Seventy-three percent were seen in a community hospital setting. Blood cultures were obtained for 315 children (69%). Four children (1.3% [95% CI = 0.1% to 2.5%]) were bacteremic, all with Streptococcus pneumoniae; the rate of bacteremia did not differ in the subset at highest risk for bacteremia (6-36 months, temperature >39°C). No demographic or laboratory data distinguished the bacteremic children from those with negative blood cultures. One hundred seventy-one children (38%) had urine cultures obtained; 5.9% [95% CI = 2.4% to 9.4%] of the cultures grew >100,000 colony-forming units/mL of a single pathogenic organism. One hundred thirty-five children (30%) had cerebrospinal fluid cultures performed. None of these cultures grew a bacterial pathogen [95% CI = 0% to 2.2%]. Two hundred eight children (45.7%) had chest x-rays performed; 12.5% [95% CI = 10.2% to 14.8%] (n= 26) of the x-rays were read as consistent with pneumonia by the radiologist at the treating institution. None of the blood cultures performed on children with abnormal radiographs were positive (cultures drawn on 23 of 26 patients, 88%). Stool cultures were performed on 14 children (3.1%); two cultures (14.3% [95% CI = 0% to 32.6%]) grew a bacterial pathogen, both Shigella. Conclusions: Rates of SBI in this multi-institution population of children with first-time simple febrile seizures were low and are consistent with those published in the literature for febrile children without seizures.

AB  - Most congenital conditions have low prevalence, but collectively they occur in a few percent of all live births. Congenital conditions are rarely encountered in anthropological studies, not least because many of them have no obvious effect on the skeleton. Here, we discuss two groups of congenital conditions that specifically affect the skeleton, either qualitatively or quantitatively. Skeletal dysplasias (osteochondrodysplasias) interfere with the histological formation, growth and maturation of skeletal tissues leading to diminished postural length, but the building plan of the body is unaffected. Well- known skeletal dysplasias represented in the archeological record include osteogenesis imperfecta and achondroplasia. Dysostoses, in contrast, interfere with the building plan of the body, leading to e.g. missing or extraskeletal elements, but the histology of the skeletal tissues is unaffected. Dysostoses can concern the extremities (e.g., oligodactyly and polydactyly), the vertebral column (e.g., homeotic and meristic anomalies), or the craniofacial region. Conditions pertaining to the cranial sutures, i.e., craniosynostoses, can be either skeletal dysplasias or dysostoses. Congenital conditions that are not harmful to the individual are known as anatomical variations, several of which have a high and population-specific prevalence that could potentially make them useful for determining ethnic origins. In individual cases, specific congenital conditions could be determinative in establishing identity, provided that ante-mortem registration of those conditions was ensured. Clin.

AB  - Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreas by an autoimmune response. Due to ethical and practical difficulties, the features of the destructive process are known from a small number of observations, and transcriptomic data are remarkably missing. Here we report whole genome transcript analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction (qRT?PCR) and correlated with immunohistological observations for four T1D pancreases (collected 5 days, 9 months, 8 and 10 years after diagnosis) and for purified islets from two of them. Collectively, the expression profile of immune response and inflammatory genes confirmed the current views on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes and showed similarities with other autoimmune diseases; for example, an interferon signature was detected. The data also supported the concept that the autoimmune process is maintained and balanced partially by regeneration and regulatory pathway activation, e.g. non-classical class I human leucocyte antigen and leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B1 (LILRB1). Changes in gene expression in islets were confined mainly to endocrine and neural genes, some of which are T1D autoantigens. By contrast, these islets showed only a few overexpressed immune system genes, among which bioinformatic analysis pointed to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) (CXCR4) chemokine pathway activation. Remarkably, the expression of genes of innate immunity, complement, chemokines, immunoglobulin and regeneration genes was maintained or even increased in the long-standing cases. Transcriptomic data favour the view that T1D is caused by a chronic inflammatory process with a strong participation of innate immunity that progresses in spite of the regulatory and regenerative mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Over the last 15 years, cone beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging has emerged as an important supplemental radiographic technique for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning, especially in situations which require an understanding of the complex anatomic relationships and surrounding structures of the maxillofacial skeleton. CBCT imaging provides unique features and advantages to enhance orthodontic practice over conventional extraoral radiographic imaging. While it is the responsibility of each practitioner to make a decision, in tandem with the patient/family, consensus-derived, evidence-based clinical guidelines are available to assist the clinician in the decision-making process. Specific recommendations provide selection guidance based on variables such as phase of treatment, clinically-assessed treatment difficulty, the presence of dental and/or skeletal modifying conditions, and pathology. CBCT imaging in orthodontics should always be considered wisely as children have conservatively, on average, a three to five times greater radiation risk compared with adults for the same exposure. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the operation of CBCT equipment as it relates to image quality and dose, highlight the benefits of the technique in orthodontic practice, and provide guidance on appropriate clinical use with respect to radiation dose and relative risk, particularly for the paediatric patient.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Summary Liver disease in children differs greatly from that in adults. An infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (CHB) or a suspected inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) requires a referral to a specialist liver centre. Patients with liver disease require regular nutritional assessment. The frequency of assessment is determined by the stage and severity of liver disease. The causes of acute liver failure (ALF) include: infective (hepatitis A, B or C, cytomegalo-virus); IMD including haemochromatosis, galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia; toxins/drugs, (parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy or paracetamol overdose); and irradiation (radiotherapy). There are many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). The chance of requiring liver transplantation increases with advancing age and liver disease progression. Pancreatitis is the result of inflammation within the parenchyma of the pancreas; causes for pancreatitis in children differ from those of adults. Nutrition support is particularly important in acute pancreatitis caused by trauma.

AB  - Abstract The task of this paper is to present a message of caution regarding the overgeneralized reliance on the NICE (2005) and CREST (2003) recommendations for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults in the United Kingdom. The socio-political and ethnocultural context of Northern Ireland is used as a foundation to explore the generalizibility of guideline recommendations. It is argued that clinicians should be mindful of the degree to which they generalize from the recommendations of these guidelines to their clinical work because (1) questions regarding the heterogeneity of PTSD raise as yet unaddressed empirical questions about the generalizability of treatments to all PTSD presentations and (2) ethnocultural and socio-political factors have not yet played a dominant role in randomized outcome studies of treatment efficacy.?Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract In dogs, the stifle is a frequently injured joint. The diagnosis of stifle joint disorders is generally based on a history of lameness, physical examination, and radiography. For decades, radiography has been the most often-used medical imaging technique to diagnose stifle disorders and has been proven very useful in its clinical work-up. Computed tomography (CT) has proven to be extremely sensitive in demonstrating calcified or bony structures, and also allows demonstration of the soft tissues when the correct windowing has been applied. Under general anesthesia, the dogs are scanned in ventral recumbency with both stifles extended and scanned simultaneously. Care should be taken to position them symmetrically. With single-slice CT, the X-ray beam is angled parallel to the surface of the tibial plateau; the scan range should cover the whole joint, from the proximal pouches from the distal third of the femur to the proximal fifth of the length of the tibia.
