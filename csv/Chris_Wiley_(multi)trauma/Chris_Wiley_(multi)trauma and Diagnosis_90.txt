AB  - Aim:? To evaluate the usefulness of urodynamic study in young men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Methods:? We reviewed the charts of 50 men with LUTS aged 50 years and below. Those with neurological diseases, urethral trauma or strictures were excluded. All underwent multichannel urodynamic studies (UDS). The pre- and post-UDS diagnoses and treatment modalities were compared. Results:? Mean age was 38.1?years (17?49). The main pre-UDS diagnoses included prostatitis in seven (14%), overactive bladder in seventeen (34%) and benign prostatic hyperplasia in nine (18%). Pre-UDS management ranged from anticholingeric agents for thirteen (26%), α-adrenergic antagonists for nine (18%), antibiotics for six (12%). Abnormal UDS were noted in 36 (72%), including detrusor overactivity in 9 (18%), detrusor underactivity/acontractility in 5 (10%) and bladder outlet obstruction in 21 (42%). Fourteen (28%) had primary bladder neck dysfunction and five (10%) had benign prostatic hyperplasia. Post-UDS management included anticholingeric agents for ten (26%), α-adrenergic antagonists for seventeen (34%), catheterization for four (10%), behavioral therapy for three (6%), surgery for three (6%). None were prescribed antibiotics. Following UDS, the diagnosis had to be updated in 40 (80%) and concomitant change in management was required in 34 (68%). Conclusion:? Young men presenting with LUTS have different underlying etiologies. Clinical diagnosis and treatment are often empiric and inaccurate. Urodynamic study is useful in the evaluation of this group of patients as it aids in arriving at an accurate diagnosis and guides treatment therapy.

AB  - Abstract Over the last 15 years, cone beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging has emerged as an important supplemental radiographic technique for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning, especially in situations which require an understanding of the complex anatomic relationships and surrounding structures of the maxillofacial skeleton. CBCT imaging provides unique features and advantages to enhance orthodontic practice over conventional extraoral radiographic imaging. While it is the responsibility of each practitioner to make a decision, in tandem with the patient/family, consensus-derived, evidence-based clinical guidelines are available to assist the clinician in the decision-making process. Specific recommendations provide selection guidance based on variables such as phase of treatment, clinically-assessed treatment difficulty, the presence of dental and/or skeletal modifying conditions, and pathology. CBCT imaging in orthodontics should always be considered wisely as children have conservatively, on average, a three to five times greater radiation risk compared with adults for the same exposure. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the operation of CBCT equipment as it relates to image quality and dose, highlight the benefits of the technique in orthodontic practice, and provide guidance on appropriate clinical use with respect to radiation dose and relative risk, particularly for the paediatric patient.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

AB  - Objective The study explored how non-Indigenous psychologists enact clinical and cultural competence in their work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients, with a particular focus on client assessment, diagnosis, and interventions. Method Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 12 non-Indigenous psychologists from across Australia experienced in working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in diverse geographic and organisational contexts. Results Thematic analysis of the data revealed five primary themes associated with the engagement, assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and management of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. Central to the findings was the need for adaptability and flexibility, a willingness to step outside psychology's traditional functions and formalities, the importance of adopting relationship-centred, trauma-informed, and client-specific approaches, the development of cultural competence as a journey rather than a destination, and the place for innovative and solutions-focused practice in building the knowledge and evidence base. Conclusion This study demonstrates how non-Indigenous psychologists can adapt their practice to incorporate culturally sensitive approaches when working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients.

AB  - Summary Necropsies were performed on 496 horses that had a fatal injury or illness at a California racetrack during the period February 20th 1990 to March 1st 1992. The primary cause of death was categorised by breed, activity at time of injury or illness and organ system affected. Most of the submissions were Thoroughbred horses (432) and Quarter Horses (46). Most of the injuries occurred while racing (42%) and in training sessions (39%); with fewer non-exercise (12%) and accident (7%) related injuries or illnesses. Musculoskeletal injuries accounted for 83% of the Thoroughbred and 80% of the Quarter Horse submissions. The Thoroughbred horses incurred 306 fractures with 263 in the limbs and 90% of those in the forelimbs. The proximal sesamoid bone(s), third metacarpal bone and humerus were the most common bones fractured in Thoroughbred horses and Quarter Horses. Other major causes of death included respiratory, digestive and multi-organ system disorders.

AB  - Abstract Urinary diversion techniques are commonly required in the emergency room to correct life-threatening electrolyte and metabolic derangements resulting from urinary tract obstruction or leakage. These techniques may be permanent or temporary; temporary techniques are most often utilized in the ER to avoid long periods of anesthesia or sedation in critically ill animals as part of damage control surgical techniques. The most commonly used diversion technique is urethral catheterization. However, depending on the location of obstruction or trauma, other techniques such as cystostomy tubes or abdominal drainage catheters may be indicated. The implementation of interventional radiology in veterinary patients has also provided many alternative techniques within this setting.

AB  - Abstract Background This study is the first to evaluate an assessment aid for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) according to both Class-I evidence standards of American Academy of Neurology and De Novo requirements of US Food and Drug Administration. The assessment aid involves a method to integrate an electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarker, theta/beta ratio (TBR), with a clinician's ADHD evaluation. The integration method is intended as a step to help improve certainty with criterion E (i.e., whether symptoms are better explained by another condition). Methods To evaluate the assessment aid, investigators conducted a prospective, triple-blinded, 13-site, clinical cohort study. Comprehensive clinical evaluation data were obtained from 275 children and adolescents presenting with attentional and behavioral concerns. A qualified clinician at each site performed differential diagnosis. EEG was collected by separate teams. The reference standard was consensus diagnosis by an independent, multidisciplinary team (psychiatrist, psychologist, and neurodevelopmental pediatrician), which is well-suited to evaluate criterion E in a complex clinical population. Results Of 209 patients meeting ADHD criteria per a site clinician's judgment, 93 were separately found by the multidisciplinary team to be less likely to meet criterion E, implying possible overdiagnosis by clinicians in 34% of the total clinical sample (93/275). Of those 93, 91% were also identified by EEG, showing a relatively lower TBR (85/93). Further, the integration method was in 97% agreement with the multidisciplinary team in the resolution of a clinician's uncertain cases (35/36). TBR showed statistical power specific to supporting certainty of criterion E per the multidisciplinary team (Cohen's d, 1.53). Patients with relatively lower TBR were more likely to have other conditions that could affect criterion E certainty (10 significant results; P ≤ 0.05). Integration of this information with a clinician's ADHD evaluation could help improve diagnostic accuracy from 61% to 88%. Conclusions The EEG-based assessment aid may help improve accuracy of ADHD diagnosis by supporting greater criterion E certainty.

AB  - Abstract Background Hyperglycaemia has been associated with adverse outcomes in several different hospital populations. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between admission blood glucose level (BGL) and outcomes in all patients admitted through the emergency department. Methods This study was a retrospective observational cohort study from an Australian tertiary referral hospital. Patients admitted in the first week of each month from April to October 2012 had demographic data, co-morbidities, BGL, intensive care unit admission, length of stay and dates of death recorded. Factors associated with outcomes were assessed by multi-level mixed-effects linear regression. Results Admission BGL was recorded for 601 admissions with no diagnosis of diabetes and for 219 admissions diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In patients with no diagnosis of diabetes, admission BGL was associated with in-hospital and 90-day mortality (P < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, BGL greater than 11.5?mmol/L was significantly associated with increased mortality at 90 days (P < 0.05). In patients with T2DM increased BGL on admission was not associated with in-hospital or 90-day mortality but was associated with length of hospital stay (?: 0.22 days/mmol/L; 95% confidence interval 0.09?0.35; P < 0.001), although this association was lost on multivariable analysis. In patients with T2DM, increased coefficient of variation of BGL was also positively associated with length of hospital stay in an almost dose-dependent fashion (P < 0.001). Conclusion Admission BGL was independently associated with increased mortality in patients with no diagnosis of diabetes. Glycaemic variability was associated with increased length of hospital stay in patients with T2DM.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Of 100 patients consecutively admitted to a rehabilitation hospital, 25 were cognitively impaired. On two brief tests of intellectual function, they scored below the criteria selected by the originators of those tests for clinically significant mental impairment. Nineteen of the 25 had vascular disease of the heart, brain, or peripheral vessels; two had cardiac valvular disease; three had head trauma; and one was mentally retarded. Mental impairment appears to be relatively common among the hospitalized elderly who do not carry the primary diagnosis of ?dementia? or ?organic brain syndrome.? It appears to be particularly common among those with cardiovascular disease, even without frank stroke. Brief mental status examinations should be part of the routine evaluation of such patients.

AB  - Summary In this pictorial essay, we showcase the imaging and pathological findings of a variety of giant breast lesions. Some lesions such as lipomas and hamartomas contain fibrous, glandular and lipomatous tissues and can have characteristic mammographic appearances. Other lesions (e.g. simple cysts, fibroepithelial lesions and some malignancies) may be mammographically indistinguishable and ultrasound (US) may be helpful in further characterisation, for example, by demonstrating posterior enhancement with simple cysts, cystic and solid components in papillary lesions, internal septations on haematomas and abscesses, solid homogeneity or heterogeneity in fibroepithelial lesions and increased vascularity in neoplastic, inflammatory or infective lesions. A diagnostic needle biopsy may be performed in some cases; however, with larger and heterogeneous lesions, there is an increased possibility of diagnostic inaccuracy due to limited sampling, such that full excision of the lesion may be advisable to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - The validity of a Dutch self-report inventory of dyslexia was ascertained in two samples of students. Six biographical questions, 20 general language statements and 56 specific language statements were based on dyslexia as a multi-dimensional deficit. Dyslexia and non-dyslexia were assessed with two criteria: identification with test results (Sample 1) and classification using biographical information (both samples). Using discriminant analyses, these criteria were predicted with various groups of statements. All together, 11 discriminant functions were used to estimate classification accuracy of the inventory. In Sample 1, 15 statements predicted the test criterion with classification accuracy of 98%, and 18 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 97%. In Sample 2, 16 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 94%. Estimations of positive and negative predictive value were 89% and 99%. Items of various discriminant functions were factor analysed to find characteristic difficulties of students with dyslexia, resulting in a five-factor structure in Sample 1 and a four-factor structure in Sample 2. Answer bias was investigated with measures of internal consistency reliability. Less than 20 self-report items are sufficient to accurately classify students with and without dyslexia. This supports the usefulness of self-assessment of dyslexia as a valid alternative to diagnostic test batteries. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background.  Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design.? This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods.? Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21?40?years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results.? Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion.? When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate relationships between heart rate and clinical variables in healthy dogs and dogs examined at a referral hospital. Methods Clinical data were extracted from the electronic patient records of a first opinion group (5000 healthy dogs) and a referral hospital (5849 dogs). Univariable and multi-variable general linear models were used to assess associations between heart rate and clinical characteristics. Separate multi-variable models were constructed for first opinion and referral populations. Results In healthy dogs, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0·001) but was higher in Chihuahuas. The mean difference in heart rate between a 5 and 55?kg dog was 10·5 beats per minute. In dogs presenting to a referral hospital, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0·001) and the following breeds; border collie, golden retriever, Labrador retriever, springer spaniel and West Highland white terrier and positively associated with age, admitting service (emergency and critical care, emergency first opinion and cardiology) and the following breeds; Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier and Yorkshire terrier. Clinical Significance Bodyweight, age, breed and disease status all influence heart rate in dogs, although these factors account for a relatively small proportion of the overall variability in heart rate.

AB  - Purpose To implement and optimize a new approach for susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) generation from multi-echo multi-channel image data and compare its performance against optimized traditional SWI pipelines. Materials and Methods Five healthy volunteers were imaged at 7 Tesla. The inter-echo-variance (IEV) channel combination, which uses the variance of the local frequency shift at multiple echo times as a weighting factor during channel combination, was used to calculate multi-echo local phase shift maps. Linear phase masks were combined with the magnitude to generate IEV-SWI. The performance of the IEV-SWI pipeline was compared with that of two accepted SWI pipelines?channel combination followed by (i) Homodyne filtering (HPH-SWI) and (ii) unwrapping and high-pass filtering (SVD-SWI). The filtering steps of each pipeline were optimized. Contrast-to-noise ratio was used as the comparison metric. Qualitative assessment of artifact and vessel conspicuity was performed and processing time of pipelines was evaluated. Results The optimized IEV-SWI pipeline (σ?=?7?mm) resulted in continuous vessel visibility throughout the brain. IEV-SWI had significantly higher contrast compared with HPH-SWI and SVD-SWI (P?<?0.001, Friedman nonparametric test). Residual background fields and phase wraps in HPH-SWI and SVD-SWI corrupted the vessel signal and/or generated vessel-mimicking artifact. Optimized implementation of the IEV-SWI pipeline processed a six-echo 16-channel dataset in under 10?min. Conclusion IEV-SWI benefits from channel-by-channel processing of phase data and results in high contrast images with an optimal balance between contrast and background noise removal, thereby presenting evidence of importance of the order in which postprocessing techniques are applied for multi-channel SWI generation.

AB  - Abstract An exponential increase in the prevalence of neurological disorders requires substantial steps to be taken for their prevention and treatment. Neurodiagnostic biomarkers are gaining momentum presently in order to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of neurodegenerative disorders, to precisely assess their advancement and to monitor the efficiency of therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the primary focus of the present review is the recent development in this field of neurodiagnostic biomarkers, and the current state of biomarker exploration in the context of various neurodegenerative diseases. This review encompasses an updated and detailed account of specific (?-Amyloid, Tau and Phospho-tau 181, Tar-DNA binding protein-43, Progranulin, a-synuclein, Clusterin, etc) and non-specific (genetic, synaptic, inflammatory and coagulation) neurodiagnostic biomarkers and the recent advances in this growing field. This comprehensive review also suggests the utilization of neurodiagnostic markers in network approaches and personalized medication that will eventually improvise the existing diagnostic and therapeutic complexities of neurodiagnostic biomarkers.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).
