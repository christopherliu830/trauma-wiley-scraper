AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the abdominal and abdominal vascular injury. The presence of a seat belt sign (SBS) on the abdomen is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal injuries. In adult populations, the presence of an SBS increases the risk of intra-abdominal injury twofold to eightfold. An SBS may be even more concerning in pediatric patients where rates of intra-abdominal injury can be increased as much as twelvefold. Damage-control surgery (DCS) has been applied to many surgical conditions including nontraumatic abdominal surgery, vascular surgery, and orthopedic surgery. For the trauma patient in extremis with noncompressible abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is gaining popularity as an alternative to resuscitative thoracotomy and aortic clamping. Abdominal compartment syndrome can affect many body systems including neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and genitourinary.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper examines and offers a critique of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), underlying principles and assumptions, and the nature and consequences of its nosological framework. The reason for this critique is to look at the rationale for some of the diagnostic categories and also why some categories are retained, including some of the long-standing diagnostic groups, such as schizophrenia. It is not the intention here to rehearse the problems of biological psychiatric thinking, nor argue the strengths and weaknesses of the DSM-IV-TR in its definitions and descriptions of particular syndromes and illnesses. The ideas presented here derive from a range of previous research that argued that the DSM-IV-TR colludes in a system of psychiatric care in which all people, by virtue of characteristically human foibles and idiosyncrasies, are potentially classifiable into a variety of diagnostic mental health categories. In the present study, it was argued that because of resource constraints, professional dispute, and public concern, the major criterion for attracting a formal diagnosis is not classifiability according to the DSM-IV-TR, but rather, that of ?social risk?, defined in terms of risk to oneself and/or others and embodying obvious social control functions. Here, we expand and develop some of these ideas, and relate them more specifically to insights offered by critical or deconstructive psychology and the development of the forthcoming the DSM-V.

AB  - Abstract Epistaxis or nosebleed refers to bleeding from the nostrils, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx. Occasional cases may present with torrential lethal hemorrhage. Three cases are reported to demonstrate particular features: Case 1: A 51-year-old woman with lethal epistaxis with no obvious bleeding source; Case 2: A 77-year-old man with treated nasopharyngeal carcinoma who died from epistaxis arising from a markedly neovascularized tumor bed; Case 3: A 2-year-old boy with hemophilia B who died from epistaxis with airway obstruction in addition to gastrointestinal bleeding. Epistaxis may be associated with trauma, tumors, vascular malformations, bleeding diatheses, infections, pregnancy, endometriosis, and a variety of different drugs. Careful dissection of the nasal cavity is required to locate the site of hemorrhage and to identify any predisposing conditions. This may be guided by postmortem computerized tomographic angiography (PCTA). Despite careful dissection, however, a source of bleeding may never be identified.

AB  - Military personnel may encounter morally injurious events that lead to emotional, social, and spiritual suffering that transcend and/or overlap with mental health diagnoses (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]). Advancement of scientific research and potential clinical innovation for moral injury (MI) requires a diversity of measurement approaches. Drawing on results from the bifactor model in Currier et al.'s (2017) psychometric evaluation of the Expressions of Moral Injury Scale-Military version (EMIS-M), this study validated a four-item short form of the instrument with two samples of veterans with a history of war-zone service. Namely, despite the reduced number of items, the EMIS-M-Short Form (SF) yielded favourable internal consistency and comparable levels of convergent validity with theoretically related constructs (e.g., PTSD and struggles with morality and ultimate meaning) as the full-length version. Notwithstanding the possible utility of distinguishing between self- and other-directed forms of MI, factor analytic results further revealed that the EMIS-M-SF was best conceptualized with a unidimensional factorial model that might allow for a general assessment of MI-related outcomes. Overall, these initial results suggest that the EMIS-M-SF may hold promise as a short, reliable, and valid assessment of overall outcomes related to a possible MI.

Current diagnostic systems are criticised because of their atheoretical consensus-driven approach, and some suggestions are made about possible theoretical systems that could be used for classification and diagnosis. A summary is presented of some of the epidemiological conundrums that studies of depression across the lifespan have presented. Further issues for the underlying theories and for the practical treatment of depression are presented.

The three groups were strikingly similar with respect to demographics and years of emergency service. The I-880 group reported higher exposure, greater immediate threat appraisal, and more sick days. The three groups did not differ on current symptoms. For the sample as a whole EMT/ Paramedics reported higher peritraumatic dissociation compared with Police. EMT/ Paramedics and California road workers reported higher symptoms compared with Police and Fire personnel. Nine percent of the sample were characterized as having symptom levels typical of psychiatric outpatients. Compared with lower distress responders, those with greater distress reported greater exposure, greater peritraumatic emotional distress, greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater perceived threat, and less preparation for the critical incident.

AB  - Background The significance of an increased nuchal translucency measurement (NT) in relation to the fetal karyotype and pregnancy outcome has been evaluated in multiple pregnancies. Methods 115 multiple pregnancies with 252 fetuses, including 100 pairs of twins (70 pairs with dichorionic placentas and 30 pairs with nonochorionic placenta), 9 sets of triplets, 5 sets of quadruplets, and one set of quintuplets, were considered. Results NT was greater than 95th centile in one fetus in 10 out of 70 cases of dichorionic twin pregnancies (14%), in two sets of quadruplets, in 7 out of 30 monochorionic twin pregnancies (23.3%). NT greater than 95th centile in both fetuses was found in one dichorionic twin pregnancy. Two cases of trisomy 21 and one 47, XXY were found. NT greater than 95th centile in 2/2 fetuses with trisomy 21 (one dichorionic twin pregnancy and one tetrachorionic pregnancy), and not enlarged in the 47, XXY (trichorionic triplet pregnancy). A case of skeletal dysplasia and one goldenhar syndrome were found among the 10 cases of increased NT in dichorionic pregnancies. Three intrauterine deaths of both fetuses, one congenital heart disease and a case of twin-to-twin transfusion occurred in 7 cases of increased NT in monochorionic pregnancies. Conclusions An enlarged NT in multiple pregnancies indicates fetuses at risk for chromosomal abnormalities and fetal malformation, as well as monochorionic twin pregnancies at higher risk for an adverse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Abstract Recent advances in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery have changed the traditional therapeutic algorithms by altering indications, timing and patterns of referral for subsequent surgical treatment. The traditional longitudinal sternomy incision has been the surgical approach of choice for multi-vessel coronary revascularisation. Drawbacks of this incision include potential postoperative morbidity, which translates to a prolonged postoperative length of stay. The combination of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting (a hybrid approach) is an alternative therapeutic method for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Recent advances in percutaneous interventions have attempted to address the problem of re-stenosis, initially through the deployment of bare metal intra-coronary stents and, more recently, with drug-eluting stents. Developments in coronary revascularisation have focused on reducing both surgical invasiveness and trauma. Patients with significant co-morbid pathologies, the ones undergoing re-interventions, and especially the elderly may benefit from such hybrid procedures by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and midline sternotomy. Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized cardiothoracic surgery by increasing patient satisfaction and by reducing surgical trauma, hospital stay and consequently overall costs. There are however limitations. Robot assisted surgery endeavours to minimise these technical hindrances and so allow better and more accurate surgical practice whilst minimising surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract Elevated serum procalcitonin (PCT) level has been reported to be a diagnostic index in systemic bacterial infections, but it can also increase in some non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Stevens?Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare immune-mediated cutaneous mucosal reaction which is susceptible to bacterial infections and may have elevated PCT levels. The value of serum PCT has not been assessed in series of SJS/TEN patients. We aimed to investigate the PCT levels in SJS/TEN patients with systemic bacterial infections (systemic infected group), with skin surface bacterial infections (skin surface infected group) and without infections (non-infected group), to assess whether PCT was a valuable indicator for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 42 inpatients with SJS/TEN were retrospectively analysis. The receiver?operator curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of PCT for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that PCT levels in the systemic infected group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CRP between the three groups. The cut-off PCT level of 0.65 ng/mL calculated by ROC had optimal diagnostic efficacy, with sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 89.7%, respectively. PCT and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis were positively correlated (P < 0.05). In conclusion, PCT is a valuable index and superior to CRP in detecting systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The level of PCT can partially reflect the severity of the disease.

AB  - There is an increasing number of inherited disorders in which excessive telomere shortening underlies the molecular defect, with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) being the archetypal short telomere syndrome. DC is classically described as a mucocutaneous triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy and abnormal skin pigmentation. However, excessive telomere shortening can affect almost any organ system, so the clinical manifestations are protean, including developmental delay, cerebellar hypoplasia, exudative retinopathy, aplastic anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis, head and neck cancer and dental abnormalities, and may be multi-systemic. Undiagnosed patients may be seen by essentially any medical subspecialist. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure appropriate management, and for initiating investigations to identify affected family members. Treatment is often supportive, with transplantation offering cure for pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. Higher rates of mortality and morbidity with transplantation often require regimen alterations, underscoring the need for correct diagnosis. Short telomeres result from mutations in genes essential for telomere maintenance (e.g. genes encoding subunits of the telomerase enzyme complex). Disease severity reflects not only the severity of the defect, but also the inheritance of short telomeres, giving rise to incomplete penetrance and genetic anticipation. Attendees of the inaugural Australian Short Telomere Syndrome Conference were updated on the current scientific and clinical understanding of these disorders, and discussed the best approach for management of these patients in the Australian context. This review will include recommendations from the conference and aims to increase awareness of short telomere disorders.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after kidney transplantation is 15-fold increased. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is one of the known risk factors. We performed a small pilot study to assess the role of non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for intensified screening in renal transplant recipients with ACKD. Renal ultrasound was used to assess the native kidneys of 215 renal transplant recipients. Thirty patients with 54 kidneys, fulfilling the criteria of ACKD, underwent non-enhanced MRI at 1.5T using T2- and T1-weighed as well as diffusion-weighted sequences with a high spatial resolution. Among the 54 kidneys assessed by both methods, three RCCs were identified (6%). Of those, one RCC was detected by both imaging methods (33%), while two RCCs were diagnosed by MRI alone (67%). MRI identified an additional four proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cysts that did not fulfill the criteria for RCC but were classified as suspicious. All of these lesions were stable in size and appearance in follow-up studies. In conclusion, non-enhanced MRI was more sensitive than ultrasound in identifying RCCs and lesions suspicious for RCC and thus appears to be a useful secondary screening tool in patients with ACKD after renal transplantation.

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - Abstract.? Bounameaux H (Division of Angiology and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland). Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions (Review). J Intern Med 2010; 268: 218?231. Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2?3. This initial period of 3?months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit?risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

AB  - Summary Background During 2016?2018, 15 critically ill neonatal foals with acute respiratory distress associated with Chlamydia psittaci infection were presented to three referral hospitals in New South Wales. Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with the development of neonatal respiratory disease. Objectives To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C. psittaci infection in neonatal foals. Study design Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C. psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. Results Thirteen foals with C. psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36 h of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of nonsurviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C. psittaci was achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). Main limitations Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C. psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. Conclusions Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and a personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection.

AB  - Laser treatment is held to prevent the development of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, or CIN, into invasive carcinoma of the cervix. Recent work has found that such treatment represents a considerable emotional upset in the lives of many women. In this study, the impact of treatment was further investigated, using a control group to separate the effects of diagnosis from those of treatment. The main findings showed that the diagnosis of CIN is traumatic. Women experience high levels of intrusive thoughts and avoidance, and in response to perceived threats to their health, and existing beliefs about themselves, they also experience high levels of anger. An impact of treatment over and above that of diagnosis was not found. From the interview data, diagnosis has its traumatic impact through women's understanding of CIN's association with cervical cancer, a potentially life-threatening disease. Interview data also suggest that body image and sexual relationships suffer following diagnosis because of CIN's postulated causal relationship to the sexually transmitted wart virus. Fear of the progression of CIN to cervical cancer is consistent with the medical model which provides the rationale for preventative laser treatment. It is speculated that once women are diagnosed as having CIN, the spectre of cancer is raised and their anxiety may be such that being monitored and not immediately treated may cause them great distress.
