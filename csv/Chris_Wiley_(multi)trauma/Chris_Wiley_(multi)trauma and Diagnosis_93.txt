AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - Summary Background During 2016?2018, 15 critically ill neonatal foals with acute respiratory distress associated with Chlamydia psittaci infection were presented to three referral hospitals in New South Wales. Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with the development of neonatal respiratory disease. Objectives To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C. psittaci infection in neonatal foals. Study design Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C. psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. Results Thirteen foals with C. psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36 h of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of nonsurviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C. psittaci was achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). Main limitations Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C. psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. Conclusions Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and a personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection.

AB  - Laser treatment is held to prevent the development of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, or CIN, into invasive carcinoma of the cervix. Recent work has found that such treatment represents a considerable emotional upset in the lives of many women. In this study, the impact of treatment was further investigated, using a control group to separate the effects of diagnosis from those of treatment. The main findings showed that the diagnosis of CIN is traumatic. Women experience high levels of intrusive thoughts and avoidance, and in response to perceived threats to their health, and existing beliefs about themselves, they also experience high levels of anger. An impact of treatment over and above that of diagnosis was not found. From the interview data, diagnosis has its traumatic impact through women's understanding of CIN's association with cervical cancer, a potentially life-threatening disease. Interview data also suggest that body image and sexual relationships suffer following diagnosis because of CIN's postulated causal relationship to the sexually transmitted wart virus. Fear of the progression of CIN to cervical cancer is consistent with the medical model which provides the rationale for preventative laser treatment. It is speculated that once women are diagnosed as having CIN, the spectre of cancer is raised and their anxiety may be such that being monitored and not immediately treated may cause them great distress.

(DC 0-3) and parental questionnaires, CBCL and ITSC. In total, 138 infants (aged 0?3) went through the diagnostic procedure. Sixty-eight per cent were diagnosed within Axis I, with regulatory disorder, disorder of affect and traumatic stress disorder being the most frequent diagnoses. In addition, 48% were classified as having a relationship disorder according to Axis II, with an additional 40% being considered to be at risk of developing a relationship disorder. The mothers? and fathers? ratings of their children's externalized and sensitivity problems were in agreement with the clinicians, but the ratings of internalized problems as well as relationship problems presented a more complex pattern.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although tuberculosis is mainly managed medically today, thoracic surgery continues to play a key role in its diagnosis and treatment in selected subgroups of patients. In certain scenarios such as multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, advanced tuberculous empyema and symptomatic bronchial stenosis, modern thoracic surgery may represent the only effective means of management in selected patients. Advances in thoracic surgery in recent years, in particular the use of Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery, not only reduce postoperative morbidity for individual patients, but may potentially allow a wider range of tuberculosis patients to benefit from surgery. Respiratory physicians and thoracic surgeons should continue to work together to ensure that tuberculosis patients who may benefit from surgery are identified for prompt and effective intervention.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims To (1) describe the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU), (2) describe trends and associated consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use in South Africa for January 1997 to December 1999 and (3) outline selected policy implications identified by SACENDU participants. Methods A descriptive epidemiological study of AOD indicators based on data gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, trauma units and quantitative studies of target groups such as school students and arrestees. Networks were established in five sentinel sites to facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results Over time alcohol has been the most frequently reported primary substance of abuse across sites. Trauma and psychiatric data highlight the burden associated with alcohol abuse. Cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone), alone or in combination, are the most frequently reported illicit drugs of abuse, generally comprising the largest proportions of drug-related arrests, drug-related psychiatric diagnoses and drug-positive trauma patients. From 1997 to 1999, a significant increase in indicators for cocaine/crack and heroin occurred in two sites. Ecstasy (MDMA) use, alone or in combination with other substances, is reported among young people. Conclusions A broad range of globally abused substances is present in South Africa and the use and burden of illicit substances appears to be increasing. This points to the importance of ongoing monitoring of AOD trends. Through regular, systematic data collection the SACENDU project has made available more evidence-based information to direct AOD abuse policy and practice and has had an impact on research agendas.

AB  - Summary The use of flow cytometry (FCM) in the study of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) is particularly important. It is able to reliably discriminate between true clonal proliferations and the reactive lymphocytosis seen as a response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Before any potentially clonal disorder can be categorized, it is important to have a basic understanding of T and B-cell lymphoid ontogeny. The pattern of surface cluster differentiation (CD) antigen expression indicates the degree of maturity, the possible relationship with the lymph node germinal centre and sometimes the function of the normal cell from which a malignant population is derived. Many lymphoproliferative disorders and exfoliating lymphoid lymphomas can be encountered in clinical practice. These disorders are extremely different in their biological basis, presentation, morphology and immunophenotype. An accurate diagnosis can only be made when all these characteristics are carefully considered together and not assessed in isolation.

AB  - Summary A 74-year-old woman presented with an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titre-negative, treatment-responsive Wegener's granulomatosis confined to the integument. She initially presented with a painful left postauricular nodulo-ulcerative lesion with chronically discharging sinuses. This lesion was effectively treated with a short, 3-month course of cyclophosphamide and 24 months of oral prednisone. After 5 months in remission, she developed further similar ulcers, in addition to painless nodules on her ankles and feet bilaterally. These lesions resolved with an extra 32 months of high-dose oral prednisone therapy before complete remission. At most recent review, there was no evidence of disease recurrence 21 months after ceasing all active treatment. Histology demonstrated a granulomatous inflammation. No systemic disease progression to the upper respiratory tract, lung or kidney was detected. This case highlights the importance of being aware of atypical or partial presentations of Wegener's granulomatosis. This diagnosis needs to be considered with patients presenting with a culture-negative chronic ulcer, where malignancy and trauma have been excluded. This will avoid unnecessary surgery and ensure early diagnosis and effective treatment of a disease that is disfiguring and usually fatal if inappropriately treated.

AB  - Summary Oral (OP) and nail (NP) pigmentations may occur simultaneously in physiological or pathological conditions, and may be a sign of underlying syndromic conditions that necessitate further investigation and treatment. Interestingly, the nail unit and oral cavity show a clinical parallelism that may help the clinician to conduct a correct examination and reach a prompt diagnosis. Both OP and NP can manifest clinically with focal or diffuse involvement and are due to external factors (exogenous pigmentation, drug-induced pigmentation) or endogenous factors (racial pigmentation, post-inflammatory pigmentation, nevi, genetic conditions and other disorders). The most concerning differential diagnosis is melanoma. Here we report the pathogenetic basis of OP and NP, together with the description of similar clinical features. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to summarize and describe the causes of pigmentation of both the oral cavity and the nail unit.

AB  - At a workshop coordinated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer and Precancer in the UK issues related to terminology, definitions and classification of oral precancer were discussed by an expert group. The consensus views of the Working Group are presented here. The term, ?potentially malignant disorders?, was recommended to refer to precancer as it conveys that not all disorders described under this term may transform into cancer. Critically evaluating all definitions proposed so far for oral leukoplakia, the Working Group agreed that the term leukoplakia should be used to recognize ?white plaques of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer?. An outline was proposed for diagnosing oral leukoplakia that will prevent other oral white disorders being misclassified as leukoplakia. The Working Group discussed the caveats involved in the current use of terminology and classification of oral potentially malignant disorders, deficiencies of these complex systems, and how they have evolved over the past several decades. The terminology presented in this report reflects our best understanding of multi-step carcinogenesis in the oral mucosa, and aspires to engender consistency in use.

AB  - Scurvy is a rarely seen disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. We present a case of scurvy in a 65-year-old man. The patient reported heavy alcohol abuse over the last several years. He also reported that his diet consisted of cheese pizzas only. On physical examination, he was noted to have spontaneous ecchymosis of his lower extremities (denying any history of trauma); poor dentition; and corkscrew hairs on his chest, abdomen, and legs, with associated perifollicular petechia. Punch biopsy of his skin lesions revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation, with some focal perifollicular erythrocyte extravasation. A serum ascorbic acid level was<0.12 mg/dL (normal range, 0.20?1.9 mg/dL). A diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency was made. The patient was successfully treated with 1 g/d vitamin C for the first 5 days, followed by a dose of 500 mg/d. Though scurvy is rarely seen in modern times, it is important to identify who is at risk and to recognize the clear and classic signs and symptoms associated with scurvy. Failure to diagnose this disease can potentially lead to expensive and unnecessary medical tests, as well as missing a very simple treatment that can prevent infection and even death.

This is a benign, non-neoplastic lesion that has some radiographic and histological similarities to malignant bone tumours of this region. The importance of biopsy in making the diagnosis is emphasised because surgical treatment of central giant cell granuloma by resection or curettage usually resolves these lesions.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains how to establish a dental health screening program within modern sport. Common dental diseases can manifest as tooth surface loss, dental caries, and periodontal disease, which may severely compromise the longevity and restorative status of a patient's dentition in later life. The outer surface of a tooth is a highly protective mineralized enamel layer, which covers the inner dentine structure. Saliva has a crucial role in tooth protection due to its chemical composition, and the physical and mechanical effects of saliva flow. A mouth guard is a key feature in dental trauma impact minimisation and prevention of orofacial injuries. The main rationale for screening is to identify members of the public likely to have a particular disease and to either confirm or exclude the disease. After screening completion the dental professional will need to collate the data and identify the 'at risk athletes and dentitions'.

AB  - Objective To describe a large population of dogs with a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism at the time of death in North American veterinary teaching hospitals, and to identify comorbid conditions associated with hyperadrenocorticism. Materials and Methods Retrospective cohort study of 1519 dogs with hyperadrenocorticism from a population of 70,574 dogs reported to the Veterinary Medical Database. Signalment, presence or absence of hyperadrenocorticism, aetiology of hyperadrenocorticism (if described), frequency of select comorbidities and causes of death were evaluated in dogs with and without hyperadrenocorticism. Results Hyperadrenocorticism was more frequent in females. Neutering was associated with a minor, but significant, increase in the odds of hyperadrenocorticism. Hyperadrenocorticism was the presumed cause of death of 393 (25∙9%) of affected dogs. When aetiology was specified (527 dogs, corresponding to 34∙7% of the cases), pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism [387 (73∙4%) out of 527 dogs] was more common than functional adrenocortical tumour [136 (25∙8%) out of 527 dogs). Hyperadrenocorticism was over-represented in certain expected (miniature poodle, dachshund) and unexpected (Irish setter, bassett hound) breeds compared with the population at large. Of the select comorbidities investigated, dogs with hyperadrenocorticism were at increased risk for concurrent diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, hypertension, gall bladder mucocoele and thromboembolic disease compared with dogs without hyperadrenocorticism. Clinical Significance Hyperadrenocorticism is significantly associated with certain comorbid conditions but is not a major cause of mortality in affected dogs. Documented patterns now provide targets for prospective clinical research.

This international study aims to describe the epidemiology of dyspnoea presenting to EDs in the South East Asia-Pacific region, to compare disease patterns across regions, to understand how conditions are investigated and treated, and to assess quality of care. Methods/Design This is a prospective, interrupted time series cohort study conducted in EDs in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia of consecutive adult patients presenting to the ED with dyspnoea as a main symptom. Data were collected over three 72 h periods in May, August and October 2014 (autumn, winter and spring), and included demographics, comorbidities, mode of arrival, usual medications, pre-hospital treatment, initial assessment, ED investigations, treatment in the ED, ED diagnosis, disposition from ED, in-hospital outcome and final hospital diagnosis. The primary outcomes of interest are the epidemiology and outcome of patients presenting to ED with dyspnoea. Secondary outcomes of interest are seasonal and geographic comparisons of diagnoses and outcomes, disease-specific descriptions of epidemiology, investigation, treatment and disposition, and compliance with treatment guidelines. Discussion This novel study will explore dyspnoea from the viewpoint of the patient's symptom (shortness of breath) rather than that of a single disease. The results will provide robust data about the epidemiology, investigation, treatment and disposition of this diverse patient group. The obtained data also have the potential to inform service planning and to quantify the proportion of patients with mixed cardiac and respiratory disease.

International Endodontic Journal, 43, 1143?1151, 2010. Abstract Aim? To present a case that used spiral computerized tomography (CT) to locate and successfully remove a fractured endodontic instrument lying beyond the apical foramen using a surgical approach. Summary? The fracture of an endodontic instrument beyond the apical foramen is rare. In this case report, after an attempt to remove a fractured instrument failed, a multi-slice spiral computerized tomography (MSCT) was used for diagnosis and treatment planning. The fractured segment was precisely located and found in the soft tissue and successfully removed by surgery. For the successful removal of a fractured endodontic instrument beyond the apical foramen, the following are necessary: (i) knowledge of the cause of fracture and how to plan treatment; (ii) determining the precise location of the fractured segment using CT; and 3) skilful operation. Key learning points? ?? Fractured endodontic instruments might lie within the soft tissue. ?? Computerized tomography is an effective diagnostic aid for localizing the precise position of fractured instruments.

AB  - Summary Advanced medical imaging is beginning to make inroads into the practice of forensic pathology and medicine, including the associated disciplines of odontology and anthropology. Computed tomography (CT) imaging, in particular, has become a useful tool in medico-legal death investigation in many forensic institutes, and has wide applications in the field of forensic odontology. This chapter will discuss the development of CT imaging, its migration into the realm of forensic practice, and current uses of this technology in the conduct of post-mortem examinations. Particular emphasis will be given to its application to odontology in the areas of age estimation, identification, trauma analysis and Disaster Victim Identification.

AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an increasingly common problem. We hypothesized that VTE occurs most commonly in tertiary care settings and that the pattern of associated illnesses may have changed from earlier reports. Methods The Kids' Inpatient Database 2006 was utilized to identify children ≤18 years old with in-hospital VTE. Children were identified by the presence of thrombosis specific ICD-9-CM diagnosis or procedure codes. Remaining ICD-9-CM codes were utilized to categorize patients by acute or chronic illness. The incidence of in-hospital VTE by hospital type, age, gender, race, and disposition were estimated. Results Over 4,500 children met the inclusion criteria (188/100,000 discharges). Most VTE discharges (67.5%) were from children's hospitals (RR 5.09; 95% CI 4.76; 5.44). Underlying chronic illnesses were associated with most VTE (76.2%), most commonly: cardiovascular (18.4%), malignancy (15.7%), and neuromuscular disease (9.9%). VTE not associated with chronic illness were most often idiopathic (12.6%), followed by infections (9.5%), and trauma (9.1%). The greatest proportions of children with VTE were infants (23.1%) and adolescents (37.8%). However, when standardized against the entire database of discharges, infants were least likely to develop VTE (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.43; 0.52), while adolescents were at highest risk (RR 1.89; 95% CI 1.73; 2.07). Hospitalizations ending with death were more likely to include VTE (RR 6.16; 95% CI 5.32; 7.13). Conclusions Pediatric VTE is most commonly seen in tertiary care. Adolescents are at greatest risk to develop in-hospital VTE. Patients whose hospitalization ended with death are at much greater risk to develop VTE.

AB  - Summary Medical records of 143 dogs with pulmonary contusion secondary to motor vehicular trauma were evaluated retrospectively to determine length of hospitalization, oxygen supplementation, and associated injuries. Therapeutic interventions, including the dose of intravenous fluid administration, the use of antibiotics, and the use of glucocorticoids were recorded. Initial thoracicradiographs were reviewed, and pulmonary contusion was graded as mild, moderate or severe. Pulmonary contusion severity was compared to use of supplemental oxygen, oxygen administration time, hospitalization time, and the presence or absence of fractures. The length of hospital stay and the survival rate was calculated. The mean respiratory rate at admission was 55 ± 22 breaths per minute. Concurrent thoracicinjuries were common, and included pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Fifty-two percent ofdogs received oxygen supplementation for a median of 35 hours. The median hospitalization time was 48 hours. Forty (28%) dogs were treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days, and forty- five (31%) were administered glucocorticoids. Two (1%) dogs developed pulmonary infection. Dogs with more severe thoracic radiographic changes on presentation were more likely to receiveoxygen, received oxygen for longer periods of time, and had a longer hospitalization time. Eighty-two percent of dogs survived to hospital discharge.
