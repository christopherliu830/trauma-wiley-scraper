AB  - Summary Medical records of 143 dogs with pulmonary contusion secondary to motor vehicular trauma were evaluated retrospectively to determine length of hospitalization, oxygen supplementation, and associated injuries. Therapeutic interventions, including the dose of intravenous fluid administration, the use of antibiotics, and the use of glucocorticoids were recorded. Initial thoracicradiographs were reviewed, and pulmonary contusion was graded as mild, moderate or severe. Pulmonary contusion severity was compared to use of supplemental oxygen, oxygen administration time, hospitalization time, and the presence or absence of fractures. The length of hospital stay and the survival rate was calculated. The mean respiratory rate at admission was 55 ± 22 breaths per minute. Concurrent thoracicinjuries were common, and included pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Fifty-two percent ofdogs received oxygen supplementation for a median of 35 hours. The median hospitalization time was 48 hours. Forty (28%) dogs were treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days, and forty- five (31%) were administered glucocorticoids. Two (1%) dogs developed pulmonary infection. Dogs with more severe thoracic radiographic changes on presentation were more likely to receiveoxygen, received oxygen for longer periods of time, and had a longer hospitalization time. Eighty-two percent of dogs survived to hospital discharge.

AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an increasingly common problem. We hypothesized that VTE occurs most commonly in tertiary care settings and that the pattern of associated illnesses may have changed from earlier reports. Methods The Kids' Inpatient Database 2006 was utilized to identify children ≤18 years old with in-hospital VTE. Children were identified by the presence of thrombosis specific ICD-9-CM diagnosis or procedure codes. Remaining ICD-9-CM codes were utilized to categorize patients by acute or chronic illness. The incidence of in-hospital VTE by hospital type, age, gender, race, and disposition were estimated. Results Over 4,500 children met the inclusion criteria (188/100,000 discharges). Most VTE discharges (67.5%) were from children's hospitals (RR 5.09; 95% CI 4.76; 5.44). Underlying chronic illnesses were associated with most VTE (76.2%), most commonly: cardiovascular (18.4%), malignancy (15.7%), and neuromuscular disease (9.9%). VTE not associated with chronic illness were most often idiopathic (12.6%), followed by infections (9.5%), and trauma (9.1%). The greatest proportions of children with VTE were infants (23.1%) and adolescents (37.8%). However, when standardized against the entire database of discharges, infants were least likely to develop VTE (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.43; 0.52), while adolescents were at highest risk (RR 1.89; 95% CI 1.73; 2.07). Hospitalizations ending with death were more likely to include VTE (RR 6.16; 95% CI 5.32; 7.13). Conclusions Pediatric VTE is most commonly seen in tertiary care. Adolescents are at greatest risk to develop in-hospital VTE. Patients whose hospitalization ended with death are at much greater risk to develop VTE.

AB  - Background Disruptions in emotion regulation are a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology. However, scant research has examined whether emotion regulation strategies are related to the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among youths exposed to trauma. We investigated whether pretrauma emotion regulation strategies prospectively predicted PTSD symptom onset after the 2013 Boston Marathon terrorist attack among adolescents and whether these associations were moderated by the degree of exposure to media coverage of the attack. Methods A sample of 78 Boston-area adolescents (mean age = 16.72 years, 65% female) who previously participated in studies assessing emotion regulation and psychopathology were recruited following the terrorist attack. Within 4 weeks of the attack, we assessed self-reported PTSD symptoms and attack-related media exposure via an online survey. We examined the association of pretrauma emotion regulation strategies with PTSD symptom onset after adjustment for pretrauma internalizing symptoms and violence exposure. Results Greater pretrauma engagement in rumination predicted onset of PTSD symptoms following the attack. Adolescents who engaged in catastrophizing also had greater PTSD symptoms postattack, but only when exposed to high levels of media coverage of the attacks; the same pattern was observed for adolescents who engaged in low levels of cognitive reappraisal. Conclusions Engagement in specific emotion regulation strategies prior to a traumatic event predicts the onset of PTSD symptoms among youths exposed to trauma, extending transdiagnostic models of emotion regulation to encompass trauma-related psychopathology in children and adolescents.

AB  - ABSTRACT A young labrador dog had a rapidly enlarging osteolytic lesion of the left maxillary bone. The histological diagnosis was central giant cell granuloma. This is a benign, non-neoplastic lesion that has some radiographic and histological similarities to malignant bone tumours of this region. The importance of biopsy in making the diagnosis is emphasised because surgical treatment of central giant cell granuloma by resection or curettage usually resolves these lesions.

AB  - Abstract Appropriate deliberate clinical inertia refers to the art of doing nothing as a positive clinical response. It includes shared decision-making to improve patient care with the use of clinical judgement. We discuss common clinical scenarios where the use of deliberate clinical inertia can occur. The insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulae, investigating patients with suspected renal colic and the investigation of low risk chest pain are all opportunities for the thoughtful clinician to ?stand there? and use effective patient communication to avoid low value tests and procedures. Awareness is key to identifying these opportunities to practice deliberate clinical inertia, as many of the situations may be so much a part of our environment that they are hidden in plain view.

AB  - Summary A 24-hour-old male Shetland pony was presented for evaluation of unilateral hindlimb lameness of unknown duration. Physical and radiographic findings confirmed a diagnosis of medial luxation of the patella. A traumatic or congenital aetiology was suspected but could not be confirmed. Surgical correction of the luxation, using a modified recession trochleoplasty technique, was carried out. At 6 months follow-up, no discernbile lameness could be observed. In the literature, descriptions of medially luxated patellae in equids are rare. Published reports describing the use of peri- and intra-articular surgical techiques for the correction of luxated patellae in equids are widely available. The modified recession trochleoplasty employed in this case may offer advantages over previously published techniques.

AB  - Summary Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) is a progressive and painful disease syndrome that affects aged horses. It affects incisor, canine and infrequently cheek teeth, and is characterised by gingival inflammation, oedema and recession, calculus deposition, feed accumulation, subgingival swellings with or without associated draining tracts, bulbous enlargement of teeth, tooth mobility, associated periodontal disease, tooth fracture and/or tooth loss. The aetiology of EOTRH is likely to be multi-factorial. However, histopathological findings consistently suggest an aetiological contribution of initial biomechanical stresses and strains, followed by secondary involvement of micro-organisms. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, age and radiographic changes including lytic changes, widening or loss of the periodontal ligament, hypercementosis, tooth fracture and alveolar bone loss. Treatment of EOTRH is not currently possible, but the condition can be managed to some degree, quite successfully for many years in some cases. However, the disease is progressive and invariably results in extraction of the tooth or teeth involved. The prognosis is most probably guarded at best and poor in most cases; however, complete removal of affected teeth carries a good prognosis for an improved quality of life in the short to medium term.

AB  - Richter syndrome (RS) is associated with chemotherapy resistance and a poor historical median overall survival (OS) of 8?10 months. We conducted a phase II trial of standard CHOP-21 (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone every 21 d) with ofatumumab induction (Cycle 1: 300 mg day 1, 1000 mg day 8, 1000 mg day 15; Cycles 2?6: 1000 mg day 1) (CHOP-O) followed by 12 months ofatumumab maintenance (1000 mg given 8-weekly for up to six cycles). Forty-three patients were recruited of whom 37 were evaluable. Seventy-three per cent were aged >60 years. Over half of the patients received a fludarabine and cyclophosphamide-based regimen as prior CLL treatment. The overall response rate was 46% (complete response 27%, partial response 19%) at six cycles. The median progression-free survival was 6·2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4·9?14·0 months) and median OS was 11·4 months (95% CI 6·4?25·6 months). Treatment-naïve and TP53-intact patients had improved outcomes. Fifteen episodes of neutropenic fever and 46 non-neutropenic infections were observed. There were no treatment-related deaths. Seven patients received platinum-containing salvage at progression, with only one patient obtaining an adequate response to proceed to allogeneic transplantation. CHOP-O with ofatumumab maintenance provides minimal benefit beyond CHOP plus rutuximab. Standard immunochemotherapy for RS remains wholly inadequate for unselected RS. Multinational trials incorporating novel agents are urgently needed.

AB  - Objective To characterize the configuration of incomplete proximal fractures of the proximal phalanx (P1) in horses not used for racing and compare radiographic with computed tomography (CT) findings. Study Design Historical cohort. Animals Twenty-four horses with incomplete fractures of P1. Methods Medical records of horses not used for racing diagnosed with an incomplete proximal fracture of P1 based on clinical and radiographic examination and confirmed by CT between 2008 and 2013 were retrieved. Radiographs and CT studies of these horses were analyzed using a subjective grading system and by measuring variables that characterized fracture configuration. Results Twenty-four horses were included (20 Warmbloods) with a mean age of 9.5 years and mean body weight of 574?kg. Fourteen forelimbs and 10 hind limbs were affected. Mean duration of lameness was 8.7 weeks. Computed tomography was superior to radiography in both identifying the fracture and determining fracture size and location. On CT, 92% of fractures were located in the mid-sagittal plane. Mean proximodistal length of the fracture was 13?mm. Fractures were frequently not bicortical. Fractures in forelimbs were located significantly more dorsally than fractures in hind limbs. A distinct fracture pattern with 2 subchondral lines running parallel in close proximity to each other was identified in 54% of cases. Conclusion Incomplete proximal fractures of P1 have significant variation in their configurations, especially their dorsopalmar/-plantar location. Computed tomography examination allowed clear identification of the fracture configurations and was superior to radiography.

AB  - We report a case of acute aorto-right ventricular fistula following transcatheter bicuspid aortic valve replacement and subsequent percutaneous closure. The diagnosis and treatment of this rare complication is illustrated through multi-modality imaging. We hypothesize that the patient's heavily calcified bicuspid aortic valve anatomy led to asymmetric deployment of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) prosthesis, traumatizing the right sinus of Valsalva at the distal edge of the TAVR stent and ultimately fistulized to the right ventricle. The patient acutely decompensated with heart failure five days after TAVR and underwent emergent intervention. The aorto-right ventricular fistula was closed using an 18-mm septal occluder device with marked clinical recovery. Transcatheter closure is a viable treatment option for acute aorto-right ventricular fistula. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background. There is little information about oncotherapy-related dental development in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Objective.? The objective of this study was to compare bone age (BA) and dental age (DA) to chronological age (CA) in childhood ALL survivors. Methods.? We retrospectively reviewed hand?wrist and panoramic radiographs of patients treated on contemporary single institution protocols for ALL between 1991 and 2004. We recorded patient demographics, therapeutic protocol, CA, DA, and BA. The cohort was divided into three categories based on age at diagnosis (< 6 years, 6?9 years, > 9 years). Results.? Of 73 patients, 39 (53.4%) were boys; 55 (75.3%) were Caucasian. Median CA at diagnosis was 4.5 years (range: 0.1?11.0 years); time to study was 4.1 years (range: 0.3?11.4 years). BA was normal in 61 (83.6%), delayed in 10 (13.7%), and advanced in 2 (2.7%). DA was normal in 41 (56.9%), delayed in 8 (11.1%), and advanced in 23 (31.9%). Abnormal BA, abnormal DA, and discrepancy between BA and DA are not statistically significantly associated with investigated patient or treatment factors. Conclusions.? DA may be altered in 43.1% of patients treated for ALL. A large prospective study is warranted to better define our observations and to determine their impact on dental and orthodontic management.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum is site to a wide spectrum of tumours and tumour-like conditions. The nomenclature of many of these conditions has evolved over recent years and there persists many morphological and immunophenotypical similarities between these tumours and non-neoplastic lesions. Primary tumours of the peritoneum are regarded as those with primary peritoneal manifestation in the absence of a visceral origin. They may be classified according to their probable histogenetic cell of origin: mesothelial, sub-mesothelial mesenchymal and uncertain (uncommitted stem cells). Accurate diagnosis is important for clinical prognostic and therapeutic reasons and, for malignant mesothelioma, for medicolegal reasons. The most common tumours to involve the peritoneal tissues are secondary tumours, especially carcinomatosis from primary gastrointestinal tract or ovarian neoplasms. Tumour-like lesions arising in the peritoneum encompass a variety of cysts of the omentum and mesentery, and pseudo-tumours as well as diverse metaplastic conditions. In this chapter there is a review of the various conditions, with emphasis on the diagnostic features and role of ancillary investigations that may be of value in discriminating between different lesions.

AB  - An 11-year-old, female, spayed cocker spaniel was presented with dysphonia caused by a solitary laryngeal mass. Excisional biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made on the basis of histological examination. Further investigations showed no signs of systemic involvement. Coarse fractionated radiation therapy failed to control the tumour. Therapy was successfully instituted with a conventional combination chemotherapy protocol over a period of 14 months. The dog remains disease free 30 months after diagnosis. Most solitary, extramedullary plasmacytomas in dogs arise in the gastrointestinal tract, with fewer reports in other sites. The larynx is an uncommon sight of involvement in any species, and to the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this tumour type in the canine larynx. In contrast to the therapeutic benefits reported in humans, the combination of surgery and radiation therapy was unsuccessful in this case, although sustained remission was gained following chemotherapy.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents various eye diseases of the goat, such as blindness, cyclopia, tumours of the eyelids, and mycoplasma. There is strong evidence that Mycoplasma conjunctivae is a major causal agent of keratoconjunctivitis in the United Kingdom. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) can cause a mucopurulent conjunctivitis in goats. The cornea of goats is commonly traumatised, often by stalks of hay or straw; overlarge tags on the ears of Angora kids may irritate the eye and the eye will also be damaged when entropion is present. Treatment involves correcting or removing the cause of the trauma and then treating the resultant conjunctivitis or corneal damage. Photosensitisation from whatever cause will affect the head, resulting in swelling of unpigmented skin of the muzzle, drooping ears, and swollen eyelids. Affected animals should be removed from exposure to sunlight and any possible photosensitising substance.

AB  - Several very rare forms of dementia are associated with characteristic focal atrophy predominantly of the frontal and/or temporal lobes and currently lack imaging solutions to monitor disease. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) is a recently developed technique providing quantitative relaxivity maps and images with various tissue contrasts out of a single sequence acquisition. This pilot study explores the utility of MRF-based T1 and T2 mapping to discover focal differences in relaxation times between patients with frontotemporal lobe degenerative dementia and healthy controls. 8 patients and 30 healthy controls underwent a 3 T MRI including an axial 2D spoiled gradient echo MRF sequence. T1 and T2 relaxation maps were generated based on an extended phase graphs algorithm-founded dictionary involving inner product pattern matching. A region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of T1 and T2 relaxation times was performed with FSL and ITK-SNAP. Depending on the brain region analyzed, T1 relaxation times were up to 10.28% longer in patients than in controls reaching significant differences in cortical gray matter (P = .047) and global white matter (P = .023) as well as in both hippocampi (P = .001 left; P = .027 right). T2 relaxation times were similarly longer in the hippocampus by up to 19.18% in patients compared with controls. The clinically most affected patient had the most control-deviant relaxation times. There was a strong correlation of T1 relaxation time in the amygdala with duration of the clinically manifest disease (Spearman Rho = .94; P = .001) and of T1 relaxation times in the left hippocampus with disease severity (Rho = .90, P = .002). In conclusion, MRF-based relaxometry is a promising and time-saving new MRI tool to study focal cerebral alterations and identify patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration. To validate the results of this pilot study, MRF is worth further exploration as a diagnostic tool in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a ?research framework? because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of ? amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that ?-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Bipolar disorder is marked by progressive symptomatic changes, which have been linked with episode-related structural findings?particularly in the prefrontal cortex. However, few studies have examined neurofunctional and neurochemical effects of disease burden. In this study, we compared first- and multi-episode bipolar individuals. We hypothesized that the latter would demonstrate evidence of neurophysiological differences consistent with a model of progressive functional degradation of these networks. Methods First- and multi-episode manic bipolar subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) including a continuous performance task with emotional distractors, and in single-voxel (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A priori fMRI regions-of-interest (ROI) included structures comprising prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks; (1H)MRS voxels were placed within bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both ROI and voxel-based brain activation in response to emotional stimuli, and neurochemical concentrations derived from (1H)MRS were compared across bipolar groups. Results Multi-episode bipolar subjects showed relatively lower regional activation across prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks, including bilateral VLPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, putamen, caudate, and amygdala. Exploratory whole-brain, voxel-based analysis suggested additional areas of lower activation extending into Brodmann area 22, posterior parietal regions, and right thalamus. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations were also relatively lower in the ACC of multi-episode subjects. Conclusions Disease burden, exemplified by multiple affective episodes is associated with evidence of widespread decrements in affective network activity. Lower ACC NAA concentration is similarly consistent with a model of progressive functional deficits. These findings support the functional significance of previously observed progressive structural changes throughout these regions.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?When life-threatening bleeding occurs in patients on warfarin, timely reversal becomes imperative. In the USA, warfarin effect is commonly reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The use of FFP is complicated by delays in correction, volume overload and often, inadequate correction. Objective:?Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a protocol for rapid administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in the setting of the urgent need for reversal of warfarin. Methods/patients:?We instituted a policy for rapid delivery and administration of PCC. Appropriate patients received 25?50?U?kg?1 of PCC. The prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratios (INR) was recorded before and immediately after dosing, and 24?h postdosing. Patients requiring surgical interventions were cleared for the operating room (OR) immediately. Fifty-eight patients were treated, with a median age of 75.5?years (range 26?92). Results:?The median INR on presentation was 3.8 (1.4?52.8). Immediately following PCC administration the median INR was 1.3 (0.9?5.7), only two patients with INRs exceeding 2.0. The benefit was maintained at 24?h with a median INR of 1.5 (1.1?3.4). Four patients experienced thrombotic events during their hospitalization, (two deep vein thrombosis, two non-q-wave myocardial infarction) although none was attributed to PPC therapy. Conclusions:?PCC administration is an effective treatment modality for the correction of warfarin anticoagulation in the urgent setting. Advantages over FFP include more timely correction, absence of volume overload and potentially more complete correction. Broader use of PCC in this setting appears to be appropriate.

AB  - Abstract Many Americans own guns to protect themselves against other people, but there is evidence that both victimization and gun access increase suicide risk. We conducted qualitative interviews with informants of 17 suicide cases in New Orleans of the 60 who died between January 2015 and April 2016 to understand the relationship between past trauma, gun access and storage, and suicide. Nine cases had experienced a past trauma, including three who had recently had a family member killed by homicide. Eight died via firearm; of those, seven owned the guns they used to take their lives and stored them locked (but loaded) at home or in their cars. Preventing community violence and addressing its sequelae may be important for reducing suicides. A multi-pronged strategy consisting of policies, education, and marketing will likely be needed to address the risk of suicide conferred by gun access.
