AB  - Objective To report the signalment, presenting clinical signs, surgical complications, histologic diagnosis, postoperative complications, and outcome of dogs and cats undergoing pneumonectomy. Study Design Retrospective case series; multicenter study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n=17) and cats (n=10). Methods Signalment, clinical signs, side affected, surgical data, preoperative diagnostic tests (including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, cytologic diagnosis, chest radiographs, and computed tomography), histologic diagnosis, surgical complications, adjunctive therapy, and date and cause of death were collected from records of dogs and cats that underwent pneumonectomy. Survival estimates and complication were assessed. Results Seventeen animals had a left-sided pneumonectomy performed (12 dogs, 5 cats) and 10 animals had a right-sided pneumonectomy (5 dogs, 5 cats). Fourteen animals were diagnosed with neoplasia (52%). The overall incidence of complications for dogs and cats were 76 and 80%, respectively, with major complications in 41 and 50%, respectively. Respiratory complications (persistent pleural effusion, oxygen dependence, persistent increased respiratory rate, or coughing) were the most frequent complications. No animals died or were euthanatized intraoperative or within the first 24 hours postoperative. One dog (6%) and 2 cats (20%) died, or were euthanatized in the first 2 weeks postoperative. Conclusion Based on this case series, right and left pneumonectomy can be performed with low perioperative mortality in dogs and cats, with some animals experiencing prolonged survival.

AB  - Objective To (1) describe minimally invasive transurethral antegrade and retrograde techniques for the placement of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) to reestablish urethral patency in cats with non-urolith urethral obstructions and (2) to report the procedural complications, incontinence rates, and long-term effectiveness in maintaining a patent urethra. Study Design Case series. Animals Cats (n?=?8). Methods Signalment, history, clinical signs, physical examination, severity of stranguria and incontinence, clinicopathologic data, diagnostic procedures performed, diagnosis, interventional technique, type and dimensions of stent placed, complications and final outcome of 8 cats treated with SEMS for the management of urethral strictures or masses are presented. Each cat was followed for ≥12 months. Follow-up information was obtained from the medical record or by telephone interview of the owner and/or referring veterinarian. Results Four cats were continent after stent placement, 2 were moderately incontinent, and 2 were severely incontinent. Long-term follow-up (median, 462 days) was available. At follow-up, 5 cats were alive and 3 had been euthanatized at 88, 233, and 305 days. Long-term outcome, as assessed by the authors, was good (1) to excellent (3) in 4 cats, and fair (2) to poor (2) in 4 cats. Owner reported outcomes were excellent in 3/8, good to excellent in 1/8, good in 2/8, and poor in 2/8. Conclusion Palliative stenting of urethral obstructions is a minimally invasive method to re-establish urethral patency in cats.

AB  - Clear cell hidradenoma is a benign eccrine tumor with nodular-cystic architecture, ductal differentiation and poroid cytology. Squamous islands occurring in eccrine neoplasms are classified into three types, according to their location, histologic characteristics and degrees of cellular atypia. Type I squamous islands resemble normal epidermis and are present in the superficial to middle portion of eccrine poromas. Type II squamous islands are localised in the deeper portion of eccrine poromas and show lumen formation suggestive of acrosyringeal differentiation. Type III squamous islands show atypical features and are limited to malignant eccrine tumors. A 55-year-old man was biopsied for a dermal nodule on his left arm. The initial shave biopsy revealed the surface of an intradermal cystic nodule with numerous whorls and horn pearls of squamatization, reminiscent?of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; however, no cytologic atypia, necrosis or mitotic activity were identified; focal clear cell and ductal differentiation were also present. Complete excision revealed clear cell hidradenoma with extensive mixed type I and type II squamous islands. The presence of whorls and pearls of squamoid cells is a rare finding in clear cell hidradenoma that, moreover, in the setting of a superficial biopsy, may be a diagnostic pitfall.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that enhances image contrast by using the susceptibility differences between tissues. It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity. This article reviews the basic principles of SWI, its clinical and research applications, the mechanisms governing brain susceptibility properties, and its practical implementation, with a focus on brain imaging.

AB  - Abstract Low back pain is one of commonest problems prompting a visit to the family physician. Up to 5% of patients with chronic low back pain in the primary care setting are diagnosed as having spondyloarthritis, which includes the prototype disease ankylosing spondylitis. Making a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is often delayed for years, leading to significant pain, impairment of quality of life, disability and productivity loss. A recent breakthrough in the treatment of spondyloarthritis is the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha biologics, which lead to rapid relief of pain and inflammation, and improvement in all clinical parameters of the disease. Patients with early spondyloarthritis often respond better than those with late established disease. With proper recognition of inflammatory back pain, and the use of magnetic resonance imaging, spondyloarthritis can now be diagnosed much earlier before features are evident on plain radiographs. Referral to the rheumatologist based on onset of back pain (> 3 months) before the age of 45 years, and an inflammatory nature of the pain, or the presence of human leukocyte antigen-B27, or sacroiliitis by imaging, have been confirmed in multi-center international studies to be a pragmatic approach to enable early diagnosis of spondyloarthritis. This referral strategy has recently been adopted by the Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology for primary care physicians and non-rheumatology specialists.

AB  - Summary The gold standard for the diagnosis of esophageal disease is esophagoscopy. This can aid in simultaneous diagnosis and treatment. The major risk associated with esophageal foreign body retrieval is esophageal perforation. This complication is uncommon but can be exacerbated by devitalized esophageal tissue, delayed intervention (chronic foreign bodies), bone foreign bodies, use of rigid instrumentation, pushing of foreign objects aborally, and excessive insufflation of the esophagus. Many tools exist for potential extraction of the foreign body, including endoscopic equipment, laparoscopic equipment, and balloon dilators. Proximal esophageal foreign bodies can be amendable to removal with rigid instrumentation in select cases, though this holds greater risk, as the instruments are not directed through the working channel of the endoscope. The prognosis following the removal of an esophageal foreign body is excellent. Complications following the procedure are uncommon and complete resolution f signs due to associated esophagitis are expected.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the prevalence of canine chronic pancreatitis in first-opinion practice and identify breed associations or other risk factors. Methods: Three sections of pancreas were taken from 200 unselected canine post-mortem examinations from first-opinion practices. Sections were graded for inflammation, fibrosis and other lesions. Prevalence and relative risks of chronic pancreatitis and other pancreatic diseases were calculated. Results: The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis was 34 per cent omitting the autolysed cases. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, collies and boxers had increased relative risks of chronic pancreatitis; cocker spaniels had an increased relative risks of acute and chronic pancreatitis combined. Fifty-seven per cent of cases of chronic pancreatitis were classified histologically as moderate or marked. Forty-one per cent of cases involved all three sections. Dogs with chronic pancreatitis were more commonly female and overweight, but neither factor increased the relative risk of chronic pancreatitis. There were breed differences in histological appearances and 24·5 per cent of cases were too autolysed to interpret with an increased relative risk of autolysis in a number of large breeds. Clinical Significance: Chronic pancreatitis is a common, under-estimated disease in the first-opinion dog population with distinctive breed risks and histological appearances.

AB  - Background:? If a clinician has to make decisions on diagnosis and treatment, he or she is confronted with a variety of causal theories. In order to compare these theories a neutral terminology and notational system is needed. The Causal Modelling framework involving three levels of description ? biological, cognitive and behavioural ? has previously been used to compare causal accounts for dyslexia and autism. Method:? In this article we present this framework and explore its application to four causal theories of conduct disorder. We discuss the problems we encountered in this application and evaluate both the framework and the theories of conduct disorder. Conclusions:? It was possible to capture parts of the theories of conduct disorder in the Causal Modelling framework but a multi-model approach may be necessary for the alternative theories of conduct disorder we evaluate. The application of the framework helps to see the relationships among the various theories of aspects of conduct disorder and demonstrates the need for more explicitness in the causal theories.

AB  - Abstract Clinical and empirical studies have documented significant alterations in self-related thought in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To our knowledge, however, few studies have examined self-referential cognition by analyzing survivors? written impact statements in individuals whose PTSD is due to interpersonal trauma. In the current study, we performed a linguistic analysis of impact statements (i.e., descriptions of how the trauma has affected the survivors? views of themselves, others, and the world) collected at the start of therapy from women with PTSD that was due to interpersonal trauma, with the goal of determining whether PTSD symptom clusters were associated with altered self-referential thought. We found that higher levels of PTSD-related hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with diminished self-related word use, after controlling for depression severity, f2 = .31. Similarly, diminished negative self-related word use was associated with higher levels of hyperarousal symptoms, f2 = .47. Our findings align with previous research that has provided evidence for a diminished sense of self in PTSD. These results may help inform targeted interventions aimed at improving social-affective functions in PTSD and other psychiatric conditions.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to compare the sperm morphology and nuclear sperm quality (sperm aneuploidy and DNA fragmentation) in two groups of globozoospermic patients: DPY19L2-mutated patients (n = 6) and SPATA16-mutated patients (n = 2). Results for these two groups were also compared to a group of fertile men (n = 25). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed for chromosomes X, Y and 18. Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Sanger sequencing was performed for mutations screening of DPY19L2 and SPATA16 genes. Sperm analysis revealed a classic phenotype of total globozoospermia in DPY19L2-mutated group and a particular phenotype characterised by a predominance of double/multiple round-headed (39.00 ± 4.2%) and multi-tailed spermatozoa (26.00 ± 16.97%) in SPATA16-mutated group. FISH analysis showed a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in globozoospermic patients compared to controls (p < 0.05), and a higher rate was observed in SPATA16-mutated group compared to DPY19L2-mutated group (p < 0.05). DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in globozoospermic men compared to controls (p < 0.001), and there is no statistically significant difference between the two globozoospermic groups. We showed that SPATA16 defects could be associated with an abnormal meiosis leading to a particular morphological sperm defect of double/multiple round-headed and multi-flagella and a higher sperm aneuploidy rate than in case of DPY19L2-defects in classic globozoospermia.

AB  - Abstract The close proximity of pelvic organs makes the genitourinary system susceptible to injury during major pelvic surgery. Iatrogenic injury remains the most common cause of lower urinary tract trauma. Recent modifications in surgical technique, such as sharp mesorectal incision and nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, have decreased the incidence of many of these complications. Genitourinary complications due to pelvic surgery remain common, however, and as new surgical advancements are made, new complications may present. An understanding of the prevention, recognition, and treatment of urologic complications is important for every surgeon performing major pelvic surgery. Semin. Surg.

AB  - Abstract A brain-dead patient is unconscious, has lost the capacity to breathe (apnoea) and requires mechanical respiration; even with full supportive treatment his heart will soon stop, usually only after a few days. The widely accepted definition of brain death (BD) equates it with death of a person and renders legally the removal of organs for transplantation. Evidence-based criteria for the clinical diagnosis of BD and the use of confirmatory tests are available. A patient in the vegetative state is unconscious but has his eyes open and can breath on his or her own, but requires artificial feeding, automatic-vegetative functions and some active functions of the severely damaged brain being preserved. Its diagnosis is based on repeated clinical observations and modern neuroimaging tests. Given adequate treatment persons in a vegetative state can survive for years and may recover towards the minimally conscious state or even can regain (in)complete recovery. Key Concepts: Brain death is the expression of irreversible loss of brain function. Brain death is a precisely defined clinical diagnosis based on generally accepted criteria. When the clinical diagnosis is unequivocal, no additional confirmatory tests (angiography, electroencephalography, transcranial Doppler sonography or magnetic resonance angiography) are necessary. Causes of brain death are traumatic brain injury, cerebral haemorrhage and systemic hypoxia, and frequently associated with brain oedema and raised intracranial pressure damaging the brainstem. The widely accepted legal definition of brain death equates it with death of a person. Brain death diagnosis depends on adequate observation times (6?24?h or more), and its declaration has to be made by two adequately experienced physicians. Unequivocal diagnosis of brain death generally renders legally the removal of organs for transplantation. The vegetative state consists of continuing unconsciousness with no evidence of awareness and no possibility for communication, with the eyes open, spontaneous breathing and preserved brainstem autonomic functions. Causes of the vegetative state are various types of severe acute brain damage (head injury, systemic hypoxia or encephalitis) or progressive brain damage (terminal states of Alzheimer or Huntington disease, demyelinating, metabolic, inflammatory diseases or severe malformations). The diagnosis of the vegetative state depends on repeated clinical examinations and demands considerable skills; it can be supported by electroencephalography and modern neuroimaging methods showing severe drop of cerebral metabolism. Given adequate treatment, persons in a vegetative state can survive for years and some may recover towards the minimal conscious state or may even show (in)complete recovery with various degrees of incapacity.

AB  - Angiosarcoma is a rare form of soft tissue sarcoma. Primary small intestinal angiosarcomas are especially uncommon. The clinical presentations of small intestinal angiosarcomas vary but gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a frequent finding. We present a case of persistent GI bleeding of unknown etiology culminating in operative exploration demonstrating a primary small intestinal angiosarcoma. A discussion of the diagnosis, pathology, and management of angiosarcoma with a review of the current literature is provided including molecular genetics, difficult cases, and current treatment options.

AB  - Background Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) of a selectively growth-retarded (IUGR) monochorionic (MC) twin is associated with high morbidity/mortality in the appropriately grown (AGA) twin. Selective laser photocoagulation (SLPCV) allows precise separation of the circulations of both twins. The aim of this study was to assess SLPCV in the treatment of MC-IUGR. Methods Patients with previable MC-IUGR were offered SLPCV. Absent or reverse end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery of the IUGR twin was also required for entry. Communicating vessels were identified endoscopically as deep artery-to-vein or superficial artery-to-artery or vein-to-vein as previously described. The communications were photocoagulated with Nd:YAG laser. Results SLPCV was performed in 11 patients (GA mean = 20.9?weeks). Survival of both fetuses was n?=?5 (45%), IUFD of the IUGR twin alone was n?=?4 (36%) and IUFD of the AGA twin alone was n?=?2 (18%). There were no dual losses, or adverse effects of an IUFD on the surviving twin. Previously undescribed superficial artery-to-vein anastomosis occurred in three patients. Conclusions SLPCV can effectively create a ?functionally dichorionic? placenta. SLPCV allows the AGA twin to avoid the adverse effects associated with IUFD of the IUGR twin. Unexpected IUFD of the AGA twin may reflect more complex placentation. A new type of vascular communication, superficial artery-to-vein, may have important pathophysiologic implications.
