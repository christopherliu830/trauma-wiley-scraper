AB  - Abstract Background Prevalence of emotional, behavioral, and psychiatric outcomes in child and adolescent survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on a chemotherapy-only protocol were not well defined. Methods Self- and parent-reported emotional and behavioral symptoms were assessed for 161 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (51.0% female; mean [SD] age 12.1[2.6] years; 7.5[1.6] years post-diagnosis). Age- and sex-adjusted scores were calculated for standardized measures and compared with 90th percentile of norms. Frequencies of survivor psychiatric disorders from structured diagnostic interviews with parents were compared with the general population. Parent emotional distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed. Associations between child symptoms/disorders and parent distress were examined with log-binomial models, adjusting for highest parent education. Results Compared with population expectations (10%), more survivors self-reported symptoms of inattention (27.9; 95% CI, 21.0%-35.7%), hyperactivity/impulsivity (26.0%; CI, 19.2%-33.6%), and oppositional-defiant behavior (20.1%; CI, 14.1%-27.3%). Parents reported survivors with more symptoms of inattention (23.6%; CI, 17.2%-31.0%), higher frequencies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (10.3% vs 2%) and oppositional defiant disorder (16.0% vs 9.5%), but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (7.1% vs 7.8%) or generalized anxiety disorder (3.2% vs 4.1%), compared with national norms. Parent-report of child anxiety disorders was associated with parent self-reported emotional distress but not survivor self-report of anxiety. Conclusion A significant minority of survivors have long-term psychiatric morbidity, multi-informant assessment is important to understand these symptom profiles and to inform selection of appropriate interventions. Interventions targeting inattention and oppositional behavior in children and emotional distress in parents are warranted in families with survivors who display behavioral problems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to validate a newly developed tool for predicting the risk of recurrence within 12 months of a venous leg ulcer healing. Performance of the tool to predict recurrence within a 12-month period was assessed using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) analysis. Multi-site retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies were undertaken to validate a risk assessment tool for the recurrence of venous leg ulcers within 12?months. In the retrospective study (n =?250), 55% of venous leg ulcers recurred within 12?months, and the risk assessment total score had excellent discrimination and goodness of fit with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90, P <?.001). The prospective study (n =?143) observed that 50.4% (n =?63) of venous leg ulcers recurred within 12?months of healing. Participants were classified using the risk assessment tool as being at low risk (28%), moderate risk (59%), and high risk (13%); the proportion of wounds recurring at 12?months was 15%, 61%, and 67% for each group, respectively. Validation results indicated good discrimination and goodness of fit, with an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82, P <?.001). Validation of this risk assessment tool for the recurrence of venous leg ulcers provides clinicians with a resource to identify high-risk patients and to guide decisions on adjunctive, tailored interventions to address the specific risk factors to decrease the risk of recurrence.

AB  - ABSTRACT The ability to form biofilm on the surface of implanted devices is often considered the most critical virulence factor possessed by Staphylococcus epidermidis in its role as an opportunistic pathogen in orthopaedic device-related infection (ODRI). Despite this recognition, there is a lack of clinical evidence linking outcome with biofilm forming ability for S. epidermidis ODRIs. We prospectively collected S. epidermidis isolates cultured from patients presenting with ODRI. Antibiotic resistance patterns and biofilm-forming ability was assessed. Patient information was collected and treatment outcome measures were determined after a mean follow-up period of 26 months. The primary outcome measure was cure at follow-up. Univariate logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance on treatment outcome. A total of 124 patients were included in the study, a majority of whom (n?=?90) involved infections of the lower extremity. A clear trend emerged in the lower extremity cohort whereby cure rates decreased as the biofilm-forming ability of the isolates increased (84% cure rate for infections caused by non-biofilm formers, 76% cure rate for weak biofilm-formers, and 60% cure rate for the most marked biofilm formers, p?=?0.076). Antibiotic resistance did not influence treatment cure rate. Chronic immunosuppression was associated with a statistically significant decrease in cure rate (p?=?0.044). Clinical significance: The trend of increasing biofilm-forming ability resulting in lower cure rates for S. epidermidis ODRI indicates biofilm-forming ability of infecting pathogens does influence treatment outcome of infections of the lower extremity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract We address the comparison of results between two diagnostic tests applied multiple times to the same subjects. The estimand of interest is the sensitivity of the combined test (primary and adjunct) relative to a primary test. Analytical methods are first described that assume independence between the multiple observations within a subject. In order to account for the within-subject correlation introduced by the multiple measurements, analytical approaches for correlated, categorical response data are described. In the discussion of these methods, we pay particular attention to the presence of a structural zero which results from the decision rule for the combination of diagnostic tests. In a simulation study, we compare the finite sample performances of all analytical approaches in terms of confidence interval coverage rates and median lengths. Our methods are cast in the context of a diagnostic bronchoscopy technology for the detection of lung cancer. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract This report discusses the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care and the overall effect on caregivers and society. It also examines the challenges encountered by health care providers when disclosing an AD diagnosis to patients and caregivers. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have AD; 5.1 million are age ≥65 years, and approximately 200,000 are age <65 years and have younger onset AD. By mid-century, the number of people living with AD in the United States is projected to grow by nearly 10 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops AD every 67 seconds. By 2050, one new case of AD is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year, and the estimated prevalence is expected to range from 11 million to 16 million. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from heart disease, stroke and prostate cancer decreased 14%, 23% and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from AD increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which AD contributes (or deaths with AD) is likely much larger than the number of deaths from AD recorded on death certificates. In 2015, an estimated 700,000 Americans age ≥65 years will die with AD, and many of them will die from complications caused by AD. In 2014, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.9 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $217 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2015 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with dementia are expected to be $226 billion. Among people with a diagnosis of AD or another dementia, fewer than half report having been told of the diagnosis by their health care provider. Though the benefits of a prompt, clear and accurate disclosure of an AD diagnosis are recognized by the medical profession, improvements to the disclosure process are needed. These improvements may require stronger support systems for health care providers and their patients.

AB  - Abstract During brain development, a population of uniform embryonic cells migrates and differentiates into a large number of neural phenotypes ? origin of the enormous complexity of the adult nervous system. Processes of cell proliferation, differentiation and programmed death of no longer required cells, do not occur only during embryogenesis, but are also maintained during adulthood and are affected in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease states. As neurogenesis is an endogenous response to brain injury, visible as proliferation (of to this moment silent stem or progenitor cells), its further stimulation can present a treatment strategy in addition to stem cell transfer for cell regeneration therapy. Concise techniques for studying such events in vitro and in vivo permit understanding of underlying mechanisms. Detection of subtle physiological alterations in brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis can be explored, that occur during environmental stimulation, exercise and ageing. Here, we have collected achievements in the field of basic research on applications of cytometry, including automated imaging for quantification of morphological or fluorescence-based parameters in cell cultures, towards imaging of three-dimensional brain architecture together with DNA content and proliferation data. Multi-parameter and more recently in vivo flow cytometry procedures, have been developed for quantification of phenotypic diversity and cell processes that occur during brain development as well as in adulthood, with importance for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Objectives Our group has already demonstrated that patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL) improves in the first 6 months after their first appointment at memory assessment services (MASs), but the sustainability of such gains is unknown. We aimed to describe changes in patients' HRQL at 12 months after their first MAS appointment and to examine associations with patient and MAS characteristics. Methods We collected data from 702 patients and 452 lay caregivers at the first appointment and 12 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relationships of change in HRQL (self-reported and proxy-reported) with patients' characteristics and use of post-diagnostic interventions, and multilevel models were used to analyse the relationships of HRQL with MAS characteristics. Results In the whole group, self-reported HRQL improved over 12 months (+3.5 points, 95% CI 2.7 to 4.2). Among people diagnosed with dementia, improvement in HRQL was more than double that among those with mild cognitive impairment or no diagnosis. Proxy-reported HRQL improved only in those diagnosed with dementia (+1.2 points, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.2). Changes in HRQL were not associated with any patient characteristics. The only feature of MASs associated with larger improvements in HRQL was the presence of advisory and support staff. Conclusions Improvements in HRQL observed at 6 months are maintained up to 1 year after the first MAS appointment, more so among those who receive a diagnosis of dementia. Continued follow-up will determine if the improvement is even longer lasting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To identify clinical findings and predisposing conditions associated with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in ambulatory patients being evaluated for PE. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted. A standardized multicomponent data collection form was administered to ambulatory subjects being evaluated for PE. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed or excluded using a combination of scintillation lung scanning, lower-extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography, and selective use of pulmonary angiography. Results: Data collection was completed for 170 subjects, with 26 (15%) cases of PE. Subjects with PE were significantly older (56 vs 41 years, 99% CI for difference of 15 years [6 to 25 years]), were more likely to report unexplained dyspnea (92% vs 69%. 99% CI for difference of 23% [7% to 40%]), and waited longer after symptom onset to seek medical evaluation (73 vs 36 hours, 99% CI for difference of 37 hours [I1 to 63 hours]). No difference was found for multiple variables commonly associated with PE. Assignment to risk categories was of limited diagnostic utility. For example, low-risk assignment yielded 85% sensitivity, 20% specificity; high-risk assignment: 31% sensitivity, 85% specificity, with diagnostic accuracy below 80% in both categories. Conclusions: Among outpatients selected for evaluation for PE, further risk stratification demonstrated poor diagnostic utility. Clinical features alone cannot be used to differentiate presence or absence of PE in at-risk ambulatory patients. Key words: pulmonary embolism; diagnosis; outpatient; risk; clinical features.

AB  - Summary Odontogenic cysts occur in tooth-bearing regions of the jaw and are lined by odontogenic epithelium, including residual dental lamina, reduced enamel epithelium, and remnants of the epithelial root sheath. This chapter discusses the specific types of odontogenic cysts. It also discusses specific radiologic features as they pertain to a particular type of odontogenic cyst. Histopathologic examination plays a critical role in the diagnosis of odontogenic cysts. When sampled with the cyst lining as part of a biopsy sample, bone within the cyst wall is usually mildly proliferative, organized woven bone. The pathogenesis is initiated by endodontic disease, which is followed by inflammation at the root apex, bone loss, proliferation of residual epithelium, and fluid transport into the lumen of an epithelium-lined cavity. The risk of tumor development within odontogenic cysts is regularly referenced in both the human and veterinary literature on odontogenic cysts.

AB  - Background Vesicoamniotic shunting may be difficult or impossible in selected cases of fetal lower obstructive uropathy (LOU). The purpose of this paper is to describe the performance of fetal hydrolaparoscopy (FHL) and endoscopic fetal cystotomy (EFC) in fetuses with complicated LOU. Method FHL-EFC was performed in one patient with a markedly thickened bladder that could not be entered percutaneously. A peritoneoamniotic shunt was also placed. FHL-EFC was performed in a second patient with a collapsed bladder from a previous vesicocentesis, as vesicoinfusion resulted in further ascites. Fetal cystoscopy was performed after EFC, and posterior urethral valves were ablated with YAG-laser. A vesicoamniotic shunt was inserted. Results Adequate bladder drainage was obtained in both cases. The first baby required bilateral nephrostomies and a permanent cystotomy at birth, and is scheduled for a bladder expansion procedure at one year of age. The second patient had premature rupture of membranes and fetal demise from treatment of this complication 5?days after the original procedure. Conclusion FHL-EFC can be performed in complicated LOU cases. The procedure involves the creation of a defect in the bladder dome under direct endoscopic visualization within a hydroperitoneum. Peritoneo or vesicoamniotic shunting, or ablation of posterior urethral valves may then be performed. FHL-EFC should be reserved only for complicated cases of LOU where conventional vesicoamniotic shunting is not possible.

Major challenges include the obtaining of high-quality data sets based on assays that are rapid, reliable, and inexpensive, but still highly sensitive and easy to perform. The microsphere-based flow cytometric technology is a platform that is currently entering the diagnostic market. This article reviews the development and the applications of microsphere-based flow cytometric platforms in basic and applied proteomic research, and discusses bead-based assays used in clinical applications.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the cardiovascular and thoracic surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be indicated for extreme cases in patients with massive anterior mediastinal masses, but resection of this mass without prior tissue diagnosis would not be an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Cardiopulmonary bypass is rarely necessary for management of lung injury. The requirement for high-dose anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass would present prohibitive risk and would likely be associated with a dismal neurological outcome. All patients undergoing intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treatment must be assessed with frequent neurovascular examinations. Benign etiologies include superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis, mediastinal fibrosis, and complications of intravascular devices and catheters. Several operative techniques have been described for damage control of thoracotomy to control hemorrhage and decrease operative time and transfusion requirements, as well as improving survival.

AB  - Autism commonly aggregates in families, with twin studies estimating heritability to be around 80%. Subclinical autism-like characteristics have also been found at elevated rates in relatives of autistic probands. Physical and psychiatric conditions have been reported at elevated rates in autistic children and adults, and also in their relatives. However, to date, there has been no exploration of how aging may affect this pattern. This study examined cross-sectional data from the ongoing online PROTECT study. A total of 20,220 adults aged 50?years and older reported whether they have an autistic first-degree relative. In total, 739 older adults reported having an autistic first-degree relative (AFDR group) and 11,666 were identified as having no family history of any neurodevelopmental disorder (NFD group). The AFDR group demonstrated significantly higher frequencies of self-reported psychiatric diagnoses and a greater total number of co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses than the NFD group. Furthermore, the AFDR group reported elevated current self-report symptoms of depression, anxiety, traumatic experience, and post-traumatic stress than the NFD group. By contrast, few differences between AFDR and NFD groups were observed in physical health conditions, and no differences were observed in the total number of co-occurring physical health diagnoses. These findings suggest that adults who have an AFDR may be at greater risk of poor mental, but not physical, health in later life. Older adults with autistic relatives may benefit from close monitoring to mitigate this susceptibility and to provide timely intervention. Autism Res 2020. ? 2020 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary Children and adults with an autistic relative have been found to experience more psychiatric difficulties than those with no family links to autism. However, a few studies have explored what happens when these individuals get older. Examining over 20,000 adults age 50+, we found that older adults with an autistic relative experienced elevated rates of most psychiatric conditions but not physical conditions. Older adults with autistic relatives may benefit from close monitoring to mitigate this susceptibility and to provide timely intervention.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to test the value of sonographic staging of twin?twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in predicting the outcome of patients treated with amniocentesis or selective laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels (SLPCV). Methods TTTS was defined as a deep vertical pocket (DVP) in the recipient twin of >?8?cm and in the donor twin <?2?cm. TTTS was staged as follows: Stage I: bladder of donor visible; Stage II: bladder of donor not visible; Stage III: critically abnormal Dopplers; Stage IV: hydrops; Stage V: demise. Patients were treated with amniocentesis or SLPCV. Results There were a statistically significant difference by stage for at least one survivor between the two techniques (Chi-square = 2.63, p?=?0.05), but analysis was limited by sample size (amniocentesis n?=?9, SLPCV n?=?70). In the amniocentesis group there was an 83% (n?=?5) survival rate for two survivors in Stage I and no survivors (n?=?3) in stages II or III. In the SLPCV group, at least one fetus survived 83% of the time, regardless of stage. Conclusion Our preliminary data suggests that analysis of survival data by in TTTS needs stratification by stage. Early stages may be amenable to treatment with amniocentesis, while later stages may not benefit. SLPCV is uniformly effective, regardless of stage, but may not be warranted in early stages of TTTS.
