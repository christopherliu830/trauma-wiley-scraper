AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - Abstract:? In presenting clinical case material for a panel on archetypes and/or primal phantasies an initial discussion of archetypes as emergent phenomena organizing ?moments of complexity? is given1. The relationship of such moments to ?moments of meeting? as developed by the Boston Change Process Study Group is commented on and explored within the context of the case. A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having a severe trauma history is offered for discussion. Several unusual, enigmatic events are detailed to illustrate the occurrence of moments of complexity. Dreams highlighting psychological transformation stemming from a changing relationship to emerging archetypal material related to a psychotic process in the patient are offered to further detailed moments of complexity.

AB  - Abstract The situation for people with mental health problems as a group of disabled people who experience targeted violence and abuse is a complex one. Disabled people, particularly those with mental health problems, are at higher risk of targeted violence and hostility with few effective evidence-based prevention and protection strategies. Achieving effective safeguarding for adults with mental health problems is characterised by differential attitudes to and understandings of abuse by safeguarding practitioners, as well as systemic issues arising from multi-agency working. ?Keeping Control? was a 16-month user-led, co-produced exploratory qualitative study into service user experiences of targeted violence and abuse that was examined in the context of Care Act 2014 adult safeguarding reforms in England. User-controlled interviews of mental health service users (N = 23) explored their experiences and concepts of targeted violence and abuse, prevention and protection. Preliminary findings from these interviews were discussed in adult safeguarding and mental health stakeholder and practitioner focus groups (N = 46). The data were also discussed via two facilitated Twitter chats (responses N = 585 and N = 139). Mental health service users? experiences and concepts of risk from others, vulnerability and neglect can be different to those of practitioners but should be central to adult safeguarding. Histories of trauma, multi-factorial abuse; living with fear and stigma as well as mental distress; the effects of ?psychiatric disqualification? and individual blaming should be addressed in adult safeguarding in mental health. Fragmented responses from services can mean a person becomes ?lost in the process?. Staff can feel disempowered, afraid or lacking in confidence to ?speak up? for individuals in complex service systems with poor communication and lines of accountability. Adult safeguarding practitioners and stakeholders need to be confident, accessible and respond quickly to service users reporting incidents of targeted violence and abuse particularly in closed environments such as wards or supported housing.

AB  - A ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality encountered in infants and children. Many of them survive through adulthood before diagnosis. Two-thirds of the cases involve the membranous part of the septum. In the absence of an interventricular shunt or concomitant cardiac surgery, guidelines for surgical intervention or resection of isolated aneurysms of the membranous septum are not well established. In this report, we discuss a multi?imaging modality approach for the diagnosis and assessment of membranous ventricular septal aneurysms and review the experts' consensuses for follow-up and treatment strategies.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of the study was to examine validity and diagnostic accuracy of the single-item Faces Anxiety Scale for the purposes of preoperative anxiety screening. Background Anxiety is common in most patients expecting surgery interfering with patients' recovery. Valid and reliable measures for situations with limited time for assessment are needed. Design A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to collect the data from both self-report and rating instruments. Methods We enrolled 90 consecutive patients admitted for surgery in a university-affiliated hospital from January 2013 to June 2013. Patients were administered the anxiety state subscale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and they were presented the Faces Anxiety Scale. At the same time, patients' anxiety was rated by a nurse. Results The correlations among scores of self-report instruments, rating scale, and the Faces Anxiety Scale were high and statistically significant. Of the Faces Anxiety Scale cut-off scores tested, the cut-off score > 2 has an optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion The Faces Anxiety Scale is valid and easy to administer. The scale is useful in settings where fast and precise screening is necessary.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Continuous monitoring of blood use and feedback on transfusions are effective in decreasing inappropriate blood transfusions. However, traditional methods of monitoring have practical challenges, such as the limited availability of experts and funding. Administrative data including a patient classification system may be employed for risk-adjusted assessment of hospital-wide blood use. Materials and Methods? We conducted an audit of blood use at two hospitals and determined proportions of appropriate blood use at each hospital. We then used administrative data of 587?045 cases provided by 73 hospitals to develop two mathematical models to calculate risk-adjusted use of blood products. The first model is a logistic regression model to predict the percentage of transfused patients. Patient demographics, surgery and diagnostic groups were utilized as predictors of transfusion. The second model is a case-mix adjusted model which predicts hospital-wide use of units of blood products from the distribution of diagnosis-related groups. For each model, the observed to expected (O/E) ratio of blood use in each hospital was calculated. We compared resultant ratios with proportions of appropriate blood use in two of the hospitals studied. Results? Both models showed good prediction abilities. O/E ratios calculated using the two models were relevant to proportions of appropriate transfusions. Conclusions? Risk-adjusted assessments of blood product use based on administrative data allow hospital-wide evaluation of transfusion use. Comparing blood use between different hospitals contributes toward establishing appropriate transfusion practices.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with high mortality. In an increasingly medico-legal world, there are major concerns about missing a diagnosis like that of a PE, which has serious consequences. The probability of finding a PE is higher in patients who have inherent risk factors for developing such thromboembolic problems. These groups of patients most commonly include those with an underlying malignancy. Cancer is one of the most thrombogenic conditions, and there are several publications which confirm the very strong association between thrombosis and malignancies, including treatment-resistant thrombosis. The groups of patients who are diagnosed with incidental/sub-segmental PE are likely to have an increased baseline risk of PE, due to their co-existing illnesses or reduced mobility. Incidental and sub-segmental PEs are an increasing problem in the current era. Patients with these diagnoses require anticoagulation if they have co-existing lower limb thrombosis, associated thrombotic risk factors or cardio-respiratory diseases, in the absence of any contraindications.

AB  - Abstract XXYY syndrome occurs in approximately 1:18,000?1:40,000 males. Although the physical phenotype is similar to 47,XXY (tall stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and infertility), XXYY is associated with additional medical problems and more significant neurodevelopmental and psychological features. We report on the results of a cross-sectional, multi-center study of 95 males age 1?55 with XXYY syndrome (mean age 14.9 years), describing diagnosis, physical features, medical problems, medications, and psychological features stratified by age groups. The mean age of diagnosis was 7.7 years. Developmental delays and behavioral problems were the most common primary indication for genetic testing (68.4%). Physical and facial features varied with age, although hypertelorism, clinodactyly, pes planus, and dental problems were common across all age groups. Tall stature was present in adolescents and adults, with a mean adult stature of 192.4 cm (SD 7.5; n?=?22). Common medical problems included allergies and asthma (>50%), congenital heart defects (19.4%), radioulnar synostosis (17.2%), inguinal hernia and/or cryptorchidism (16.1%), and seizures (15%). Medical features in adulthood included hypogonadism (100%), DVT (18.2%), intention tremor (71%) and type II diabetes (18.2%). Brain MRI (n?=?35) showed white matter abnormalities in 45.7% of patients and enlarged ventricles in 22.8%. Neurodevelopmental and psychological difficulties were a significant component of the behavioral phenotype, with developmental delays and learning disabilities universal but variable in severity. Twenty-six percent had full-scale IQs in the range of intellectual disability (MR), and adaptive functioning was significantly impacted with 68% with adaptive composite scores <70. Rates of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD (72.2%), autism spectrum disorders (28.3%), mood disorders (46.8%), and tic disorders (18.9%), were elevated with 55.9% on psychopharmacologic medication overall. Recommendations for evaluation and treatment are summarized. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Contents The profile and function of blood and uterine leukocytes were evaluated in 14 dairy cows that spontaneously recovered from postpartum endometritis (mild, n=6 and heavy, n=8; general health not affected). From a minimum of 2 weeks before parturition until 6 weeks postpartum, blood samples were obtained twice weekly for leukocyte counts and leukogram determination and once weekly for flow cytometry assessment of polimorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) phagocytic capacity and oxidative burst activity. Uterine fluid-stained smears, obtained twice weekly from parturition until fluid was present in the uterus, were used for determination of the percentage of PMN, of phagocytizing PMN (phago-PMN) and of the mean number of phagocyted bacteria per phagocytizing PMN (phagocytic index; PI). Uterine swabs were obtained twice weekly from parturition until 35?days postpartum for bacteriological examination. The time of endometritis diagnosis was similar in cows with mild or heavy endometritis but the latter cows had a significantly longer persistence of the infection and of the isolation of Gram-negative anaerobes from the uterus. However, the effect of group (mild versus heavy) was not significant for all the blood and uterine parameters analysed. The effect of sampling day (within group effect) was significant (p<0.01 to p<0.00001) for all parameters, except for the blood monocyte count and the blood PMN phagocytic capacity, in which only a tendency for significance was observed (p<0.1). The effect of the interaction group???sampling day was significant only for the blood monocyte count. The phago-PMN and the PI were significantly correlated (r=0.70, p<0.001). A significant correlation was also observed between the uterine fluid phago-PMN and the blood PMN oxidative burst activity (r=?0.41, p<0.05). At the spontaneous recovery, the blood PMN oxidative burst activity was significantly higher (p<0.05) and the percentage of intrauterine phago-PMN and the PI were significantly lower (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively) than at diagnosis of endometritis. These results suggest that a decrease in blood PMN oxidative burst activity until the first week postpartum could be associated with an increased susceptibility to early postpartum endometritis. The later increase in this parameter as well as the increase in the intrauterine fluid phago-PMN and PI, might favour the spontaneous resolution of endometritis.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To evaluate and compare psychological distress in long-term survivors of solid tumors diagnosed in childhood and their siblings, and to identify significant correlates of psychological distress. Procedure Adult survivors (2,778) of solid tumors diagnosed in childhood and 2,925 siblings completed a long-term follow-up questionnaire assessing symptoms associated with depression, somatization, and anxiety, as well as demographic, health, and medical information. Results Overall, a large majority of siblings and survivors reported few, if any, symptoms of psychological distress. In the aggregate, solid tumor cancer survivors reported significantly higher levels of global distress as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), as well as higher levels of somatization and anxiety, when compared to siblings. However, when compared to population norms, both survivors and siblings reported lower levels of global and dimensional distress. Female gender, lower educational and income attainment, perceived poor health status and reports of current health problems all were associated with reporting psychological distress symptoms for both survivors and siblings. Among survivors, having a limb amputation was associated with reporting fewer symptoms of global and dimensional distress. Conclusion Poor health status, low levels of income, education, and employment appear to be predictors of distress for survivors of solid tumors. Thus, interventions that promote health and facilitate educational advancement, income attainment and social interaction to minimize isolation and maximize social support may reduce psychological distress and promote quality of life for childhood cancer survivors.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report intraoperative and major postoperative complications in dogs treated surgically for epiglottic retroversion (ER), compare the incidence of major postoperative complications between procedures, and report survival of surgically treated dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Sample population Fifty dogs treated with 78 procedures. Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed and surgically treated for ER from 2003 to 2017 at 11 institutions were reviewed. Complications were divided into intraoperative and major postoperative complications. Results Intraoperative complications occurred during 2 of 78 (2.6%) procedures. Thirty-six major postoperative complications were documented in 22 dogs after 36 of 74 (48.7%) procedures. Postoperative complications occurred after 7 of 12 (58.3%) nonincisional epiglottopexy, 23 of 43 (53.5%) incisional epiglottopexy, 2 of 4 (50%) partial epiglottectomy, 2 of 12 (16.7%) subtotal epiglottectomy, and 2 of 3 (66.7%) other surgical procedures. Epiglottopexy failure was the most common major postoperative complication. The incidence of major postoperative complications did not differ between procedures (P = .1239), although, when combined, epiglottopexy procedures (30/55) had a higher incidence of complications than epiglottectomy procedures (4/16; P = .048). Thirty (60%) dogs were alive at a median of 928 days (range, 114-2805), 8 (16%) were lost to follow-up after 411 days (range, 43-1158), and 12 (24%) were dead/euthanized after 301.5 days (range, 3-1212). Median survival time was not reached after a median of 716 days. Conclusion Although intraoperative complications were uncommon, major postoperative complications were common, especially after epiglottopexy procedures. Clinical significance Although surgical treatment of ER is associated with a high rate of major postoperative complications, especially epiglottopexy procedures, long-term survival can be achieved.

AB  - Summary The discovery in the mid-1970s that maternal serum maternal serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are increased on average in pregnancies affected by fetal neural tube defects (NTDs) ushered in the modern era of antenatal screening. By far the most frequent of these is Down syndrome (DS), with a birth prevalence in the absence of prenatal diagnosis and elective abortion. There is a fundamental difference between screening and diagnostic tests, despite the fact that the same terms are used to describe their results. For chromosomal abnormalities these investigations involve hazardous invasive procedures, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis, and occasionally percutaneous umbilical cord sampling, to obtain material for prenatal diagnosis. Most experience with serum screening for DS is in the second trimester, where it became a natural extension to established AFP screening programs for NTDs, largely at 15-19 weeks? gestation.

AB  - Abstract Background Sharing anonymised ED data with community agencies to reduce alcohol-related injury and assaults has been found effective in the UK. This protocol document outlines the design of an Australian multi-site trial using shared, anonymised ED data to reduce alcohol-related harm. Design and Method Nine hospitals will participate in a 36 month stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. After a 9 month baseline period, EDs will be randomised in five groups, clustered on geographic proximity, to commence the intervention at 3 monthly intervals. ?Last-drinks? data regarding alcohol use in the preceding 12?h, typical alcohol consumption amount, and location of alcohol purchase and consumption, are to be prospectively collected by ED triage nurses and clinicians at all nine EDs as a part of standard clinical process. Brief information flyers will be delivered to all ED patients who self-report risky alcohol consumption. Public Health Interventions to be conducted are: (i) information sharing with venues (via letter), and (ii) with police and other community agencies, and (iii) the option for public release of ?Top 5? venue lists. Outcomes Primary outcomes will be: (i) the number and proportion of ED attendances among patients reporting recent alcohol use; and (ii) the number and proportion of ED attendances during high-alcohol hours (Friday and Saturday nights, 20.00?06.00 hours) assigned an injury diagnosis. Process measures will assess logistical and feasibility concerns, and clinical impacts of implementing this systems-change model in an Australian context. An economic cost?benefit analysis will evaluate the economic impact, or return on investment.

AB  - Background Middle turbinate edema could be a characteristic feature of aeroallergen sensitization. In this study we sought to determine the diagnostic characteristics of middle turbinate edema as a marker of inhalant allergy. Methods A cross-sectional diagnostic study was performed on patients who had undergone nasal endoscopy and allergy testing. Allergy status was determined by positive serology or epicutaneous testing. Endoscopy was reviewed by blinded assessors for middle turbinate head edema. Appearance was graded as either normal, focal, multifocal, diffuse, or polypoid edema. Receiver-operator (ROC) analysis, likelihood ratio (LR), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were determined. Results One hundred eighty-seven patients representing 304 nasal cavities were assessed (42% female, age 39.74 ± 14.7 years, 57% allergic). Diffuse edema (PPV 91.7%/LR = 8) and polypoid edema (PPV 88.9%/LR = 6.2) demonstrated the strongest association with inhalant allergy. Multifocal edema was used as a cut-off to represent inhalant allergy from ROC analysis, which demonstrated 94.7% specificity and 23.4% sensitivity. The PPV for multifocal was 85.1% and LR = 4.4. Conclusion Middle turbinate edema is a useful nasal endoscopic feature to predict presence of inhalant allergy and, although not sensitive, has excellent PPV.

AB  - Abstract Food allergy (FA) is recognized as a growing public health burden affecting 5%-10% of children worldwide. Several unique features specific to FA elicit high levels of emotional distress and anxiety in patients and caregivers, the first among all the possibility of a life-threatening reaction. Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in patients with chronic disease, but remain undertreated despite significant negative consequences on patient health. This review aimed to offer a comprehensive overview of literature data on FA and anxiety of the last two decades. A review of the medical and psychological literature from the year 2000 (MEDLINE, PubMed and PsycINFO) was done using the keywords ?anxiety? and ?food allergy.? Clinical implications for disease management, various manifestations in different target groups, proper interventions and possible explanations on the nature of the association between FA and anxiety have been discussed, as well as limitations and further research directions. The relationship between FA and anxiety is attributed to FA-specific fears and anxiety, rather than a general propensity towards anxiety. Some anxiety?short-lived and related to key events?is to be expected and may even be helpful if it sustains allergen avoidance and preparedness to emergency. However, some data reported that increased anxiety did not improve adherence. Rather, high levels of anxiety have been demonstrated counterproductive and related to maladaptive coping. Further research is needed to elucidate the association between FA and anxiety, especially to understand biopsychosocial directions of the underlying mechanisms and to build proper, effective, standardized protocols of intervention. Clinicians must be aware of the association between FA and anxiety, understand their role in recognizing maladaptive anxiety and encouraging to seek psychological support when needed.

AB  - Proteomics and systems biology have significantly contributed to biomarker discovery in the field of brain injury. This study utilized 2D-DIGE-PMF-MS as a preliminary screen to detect biomarkers in a rat model of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). Brain-specific systems biology analysis of brain tissue identified 386 proteins having a fold change of more than 2, of which 321 proteins were increased and 65 were decreased 24 h after PBBI compared to sham controls. The majority of upregulated proteins were cytoskeletal (10.5%), nucleic acid binding (9.3%), or kinases (8.9%). Most proteins were involved in protein metabolism (22.7%), signal transduction (20.4%), and development (9.6%). Pathway analysis indicated that these proteins were involved in neurite outgrowth and cell differentiation. Semiquantitative Western blotting of 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after PBBI indicated ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (a proposed traumatic brain injury biomarker in human clinical trials), tyrosine hydroxylase, and syntaxin-6 were found to be consistently elevated in brain tissue and cerebral spinal fluid after PBBI compared to sham controls. Combining proteomics and brain-specific systems biology can define underlying mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and provide valuable information in biomarker discovery that, in turn, may lead to novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract Objective Age-related policies allow adolescents to access paediatric and adult EDs. Anecdotally, paediatric and adult EDs report challenges when caring for older and younger adolescents, respectively. Our aim was to describe the characteristics of an adolescent population attending an adult ED, co-located with a tertiary paediatric ED. Methods The Westmead Hospital ED database was accessed for 14.5?17.9?years old presentations between January 2010 and December 2012. Patient diagnosis coding (SNOMED) was converted to ICD-10. De-identified data were transferred into Microsoft Excel with analysis performed using spss V22. Results There were 5718 presentations made to the Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia ED by 4450 patients, representing 3.3% (95% CI 3.2?3.4) of total visits from all patients 14.5?years and above. The mean age of the sample was 16.6?years (male 51.8%). Presentations triaged as level 4 or 5 represented 61.0% (95% CI 58.7?61.3) of visits. The proportion of patients who did not wait to receive care was 13.8% (95% CI 12.9?14.7), which was significantly higher than adult rates (P?<?0.01). There were 279 unscheduled return visits (visits made <72?h of discharge) representing 4.9% (95% CI 4.4?5.8) of all presentations. Injury was the most common diagnosis (30.2%, 95% CI 28.8?31.6). Chronic physical illness and alcohol-related visits comprised 2.1% (95% CI 1.7?2.5) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.6?1.0) of adolescent presentations, respectively. Conclusion Contrary to reported staff perceptions, adolescent chronic physical illness presentations were not a major burden. Alcohol was likely under-recorded as a contributing factor to presentations.

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.
