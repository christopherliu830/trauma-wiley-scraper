AB  - Abstract Background Successful dissemination of the new classification of periodontitis is facilitated by emphasis on the basic ground rules, clarification of ambiguities, and identification of ?gray zones? where thoughtful application of the guidelines by an informed, experienced clinician is paramount to arrive at a correct Stage and Grade. Methods Highlighted ground rules are (1) Stage is a patient-based, not a tooth-based concept, therefore, a single Stage is assigned per patient; (2) Stage can shift upward over time, if the periodontal status deteriorates, but the initially assigned Stage is retained even after improvement post-therapy; (3) the complexity factors that determine Stage must be evaluated collectively, not in isolation, to arrive at a clinically meaningful assessment; (4) a single Grade is assigned to a patient based on a deliberate evaluation of the ?biological fabric? of the case, in terms of history of/risk for further progression, interplay of risk factors, and the two-way effects of periodontitis or its treatment on general health; (v) shift of Grade over time is possible towards either direction, after thorough, collective, evaluation of changes in the above parameters. Exemplified gray zones include a radiographically intact patient with minimal attachment loss in older age; presence of ?frank? periodontitis affecting a single tooth; and assessment of factors that do/do not lead to increased complexity of therapy. Conclusion Differentiating between Stage I/II versus Stage III/IV periodontitis is relatively uncomplicated; further distinction between Stages and correct assignment of Grade requires nuanced, thorough interpretation of a broad array of findings by a knowledgeable clinician.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:? Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a leading cause of early morbidity and mortality in lung transplantation. We sought to identify risk factors for PGD using the United Network for Organ Sharing/International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (UNOS/ISHLT) Registry. Methods:? A total of 6984 lung transplants between 1994 and 2002 were available for analysis. Potential risk factors were tested for association with PGD and multivariable logistic regression was applied to adjust for confounding. Results:? The overall incidence of PGD was 10.7% (95% CI 9.9?11.4). In multivariable analyses, factors independently associated with PGD were donor age >45?yr (p?<?0.001); donor head trauma (p?=?0.03); recipient body mass index >25?kg/m2 (p?=?0.005); recipient female gender (p?=?0.001); use of Eurocollins preservation solution (p?=?0.001); single lung transplant (p?=?0.005); increased ischemic time (p?<?0.001); and elevated recipient pulmonary artery systolic pressure at transplant (p?<?0.001). Recipient transplant diagnosis was strongly associated with PGD, with primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension (p?<?0.001 for both), and idiopathic (p?<?0.001) or secondary pulmonary fibrosis (p?=?0.011) as significant and independent risk factors for PGD. Conclusions:? Risk factors for PGD in the UNOS/ISHLT registry are consistent with prior smaller studies. Recipient, donor, and therapy variables are independently associated with PGD, as defined in a large registry.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.

AB  - A nine-month-old Labrador retriever was referred to the Clinica Veterinaria Privata San Marco because of frequent headshaking and downward turning of the right ear. Clinical examination revealed that there was no external acoustic meatus in the right ear. Computed tomography confirmed that the vertical part of the right auditory canal ended blindly, providing a diagnosis of external auditory canal atresia. Cytological examination and culture of fluid from the canal and the bulla revealed only aseptic cerumen; for this reason, it was assumed that the dog was probably affected by a congenital developmental deformity of the external auditory canal. Reconstructive surgery was performed using a ?pull-through? technique. Four months after surgery the cosmetic and functional results were satisfactory.

AB  - Summary Motor neuron diseases are hereditary and acquired neurodegenerative diseases associated with selective degeneration of the upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Unfortunately, there is no single test that is highly sensitive and specific for motor neuron disease, with the exception of the genetic confirmation of the inherited motor neuron diseases. The diagnosis of most motor neuron diseases is based on the combination of the clinical history, physical examination, electrophysiology, imaging, and serology.

AB  - Summary Intestinal hyperammonaemia in horses is a syndrome putatively caused by increased intestinal production and/or absorption of ammonia that clinically manifests as severe neurological abnormalities often in conjunction with signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction but without evidence of hepatic compromise. Ingestion of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a novel primary condition that may predispose to development of the syndrome as described in this issue. Treatment of the condition is symptomatic and aimed at decreasing blood ammonium concentrations by reducing further production and absorption, reducing brain oedema and preventing self-inflicted trauma. Prognosis for survival is guarded, particularly in cases with severe gastrointestinal lesions, and is influenced by the ability to control clinical signs.

AB  - Summary Dementia is a common clinical syndrome in the elderly that presents significant diagnostic challenges. Dementia is the result of many diseases, but dividing the pattern of impairment into cortical and subcortical etiologies is useful in increasing the accuracy of diagnosis. Diseases that cause subcortical dementia include small vessel cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Subcortical dementias are characterized by apathy, inattention and psychomotor slowing. The prototypical cortical dementia is Alzheimer's disease. This chapter discusses the clinical features of subcortical dementias such as the Parkinson-plus syndromes, stroke, spinocerebellar ataxia, normal pressure hydrocephalus and frontal lobe dementias and how to distinguish these disorders from Alzheimer's disease and depression.

AB  - SUMMARY Esophageal perforation is uncommon and traditionally has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to perform a 13-year retrospective review of the cases managed in our district general hospital. Thirty-four cases of esophageal perforation diagnosed between 1995 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 20 males and 14 females with a median age of 64 (range 23?86) years. The etiology of the perforations were Boerhaave's syndrome (n= 19), therapeutic endoscopy (n= 9), diagnostic endoscopy (n= 2), gastric lavage injury (n= 1), foreign body (n= 1), blunt chest trauma (n= 1), and spontaneous tumor perforation (n= 1). Only 11 cases (32%) had evidence of surgical emphysema upon examination. In 50% of cases, another clinical diagnosis was initially suspected. Twenty-four were treated surgically and 10 cases managed non-operatively. Surgical treatment included thoracotomy with primary repair (n= 9), T-tube drainage (n= 7), emergency esophagectomy (n= 1), or intra-operative stent insertion (n= 1). Four cases had primary repair and fundal wrap via abdominal approach without thoracotomy. Two patients were treated with washout and drainage only. Eight patients died overall (in-hospital mortality 23.5%). Esophageal perforations are often initially misdiagnosed and the majority do not have surgical emphysema. There are a wide variety of methods to manage esophageal perforation. Management tailored to the location and size of perforation, degree of contamination, and underlying cause appears to result in a reasonable prognosis.

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - Abstract Background and aim: The purpose of the present investigation is to provide an analysis of previous works on the epidemiology of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from six countries throughout Latin America, to forecast the future HCV prevalence trends in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Puerto Rico, and to outline deficiencies in available data, highlighting the need for further research. Methods: Data references were identified through indexed journals and non-indexed sources. Overall, 1080 articles were reviewed and 150 were selected based on their relevance to this work. When multiple data sources were available for a key assumption, a systematic process using multi-objective decision analysis (MODA) was used to select the most appropriate sources. When data were missing, analogues were used. Data from other countries with similar risk factors and/or population compositions were used as a proxy to help predict the future trends in prevalence. Results: The review indicates that the dominant genotype is type 1. HCV prevalence in the analysed countries ranges from 1 to 2.3%. The Latin American countries have been very proactive in screening their blood supplies, thus minimizing the risk of transmission through transfusion. This suggests that other risk factors are set to play a major role in continued new infections. The number of diagnosed and treated patients is low, thereby increasing the burden of complications such as liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The HCV prevalence, according to our modelling is steady or increasing and the number of infected individuals will increase. Conclusions: The results herein reported should provide a foundation for informed planning efforts to tackle hepatitis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the type and prevalence of incidental findings from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of the maxillofacial region. Findings are divided into those that require (i) intervention/referral, (ii) monitoring, and (iii) no further evaluation. Methods Three hundred consecutive CBCT scans conducted in the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Clinic from January 1 to August 31, 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Findings were categorized into airway, soft tissue calcifications, bone, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), endodontic, dental developmental, and pathological findings. Results A total of 272 scans revealed 881 incidental findings (3.2 findings/scan). The most prevalent was airway findings (35%) followed by soft tissue calcifications (20%), bone (17.5%), TMJ (15.4%), endodontic (11.3%), dental developmental (0.7%), and pathological (0.1%). 16.1% required intervention/referral, 15.6% required monitoring, and the remainder (68.3%) required neither. Conclusion This study underscores the need to thoroughly examine all CBCT volumes for clinically significant findings within and beyond the region of interest.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective Theories of posttraumatic growth suggest that some degree of distress is necessary to stimulate growth; yet, investigations of the relationship between stress and growth following trauma are mixed. This study aims to understand the relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms and posttraumatic growth in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients. Method 165 AYA patients aged 14?39 years at diagnosis completed standardized measures of posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth at 12 months following diagnosis. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing and regression were used to examine linear and curvilinear relationships between posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth. Results No significant relationships between overall posttraumatic stress severity and posttraumatic growth were observed at 12-month follow-up. However, curvilinear relationships between re-experiencing (a posttraumatic stress symptom) and two of five posttraumatic growth indicators (New Possibilities, Personal Strengths) were observed. Conclusion Findings suggest that re-experiencing is associated with some aspects of posttraumatic growth but not others. Although re-experiencing is considered a symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder, it also may represent a cognitive process necessary to achieve personal growth for AYAs. Findings call into question the supposed psychopathological nature of re-experiencing and suggest that re-experiencing, as a cognitive process, may be psychologically adaptive. Opportunities to engage family, friends, cancer survivors, or health care professionals in frank discussions about fears, worries, or concerns may help AYAs re-experience cancer in a way that enhances their understanding of what happened to them and contributes to positive adaptation to life after cancer.

AB  - Abstract Background Obesity is common in the equine population and it has been associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality in humans. The effect of increased body mass index (BMI) on the incidence of surgical site infections has not been investigated in horses. Objectives To determine whether horses with increased body fat, as estimated by BMI, are more likely to develop post-operative complications, particularly incisional complications, following emergency ventral midline celiotomy. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional clinical study. Methods Medical records of horses >2 years old presenting with colic that underwent ventral midline celiotomy between January 2010 and September 2018 with follow-up of a minimum of 30 post-operative days were reviewed. Extracted data included signalment, operative details and outcome. BMI was calculated by dividing the patient's weight (kg) by the withers height squared (m2). Results In all, 287 horses fit inclusion criteria. Incisional complication prevalence was 23.7%. Horses with incisional complications had a higher BMI (median 203.6 kg/m2, IQR = 191.5-217.4) compared with those without (median 199.1 kg/m2, IQR = 184.7-210.2) (P = .03). Multi-variable analysis of the effects of age, sex, breed and presence of metabolic disease on the association between BMI and risk of incisional complications, identified a tendency towards increased risk with a higher BMI, but statistical significance decreased to P = .07. Breed had an association with BMI (P < .01), but not with incisional complication risk. Main limitations BMI as an estimate of body fat has limitations. Retrospective studies with reliance on owners reporting data and complete medical records is imperfect. When the data were subjected to multi-variable analysis, the trend towards an increased incidence of incisional complications in horses with higher BMI persisted but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion Higher BMI may increase the risk for the development of incisional complications in horses following emergency ventral midline celiotomy.

AB  - Summary The origin of neuropathic pain may be difficult to diagnose unless an obvious predisposing lesion or injury to the nervous system is easily identified, or a genetic predisposition exists. Understanding the physiology and events that occur in the nervous system, originating from poorly managed acute pain, chronic pain or from primary lesions within the nervous system is important, as individual mechanisms causing pain are targets for therapeutic consideration. Some lesions may be amenable to surgical therapy, whereas others will require specific pharmacological intervention. In the human setting, the diagnosis of neuropathic pain may be based solely on history and examination findings as judged by an experienced clinician. The chapter illustrates examples of the more common clinical conditions causing neuropathic neck and back pain in cats and dogs. Prior to, and often during, any surgical procedure, various different analgesics and analgesic modalities can be used to reduce the inciting nociceptive afferent impulse.

AB  - Abstract Encephalitis is a complex neurological syndrome caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. The management of encephalitis is challenging because: the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy is broad; there is often rapid disease progression; it often requires intensive supportive management; and there are many aetiologic agents for which there is no definitive treatment. Patients with possible meningoencephalitis are often encountered in the emergency care environment where clinicians must consider differential diagnoses, perform appropriate investigations and initiate empiric antimicrobials. For patients who require admission to hospital and in whom encephalitis is likely, a staged approach to investigation and management is preferred with the potential involvement of multiple medical specialties. Key considerations in the investigation and management of patients with encephalitis addressed in this guideline include: Which first-line investigations should be performed?; Which aetiologies should be considered possible based on clinical features, risk factors and radiological features?; What tests should be arranged in order to diagnose the common causes of encephalitis?; When to consider empiric antimicrobials and immune modulatory therapies?; and What is the role of brain biopsy?

AB  - Abstract Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) causes adverse pregnancy outcomes that can be averted by treatment from 24?28 weeks? gestation. Assessing and treating women for overt diabetes in pregnancy (ODIP) at the first antenatal clinic booking is now recommended in international guidelines. As a consequence, women with milder hyperglycaemia are being diagnosed and treated for early GDM, but randomised controlled trial (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of such treatment have not been undertaken. The Treatment Of Booking Gestational diabetes Mellitus (TOBOGM) study is a multi-centre RCT examining whether diagnosing and treating GDM diagnosed at booking improves pregnancy outcomes. Methods and analysis: 4000 adult pregnant women (< 20 weeks? gestation) at risk of ODIP will be recruited from 12 hospital antenatal booking clinics and referred for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 800 women with hyperglycaemia (ie, booking GDM) according to the 2014 Australasian Diabetes-in-Pregnancy Society criteria for pregnant women at 24?28 weeks? gestation will be randomised to immediate treatment for GDM (intervention) or to no treatment (control), pending the results of a second OGTT at 24?28 weeks? gestation. Antenatal and GDM care will otherwise follow local guidelines. Randomisation will be stratified by site and OGTT glycaemic risk strata. The primary pregnancy outcome is a composite of respiratory distress, phototherapy, birth trauma, birth before 37 weeks? gestation, stillbirth or death, shoulder dystocia, and birthweight ≥ 4.5 kg. The primary neonatal outcome is neonatal lean body mass. The primary maternal outcome is pre-eclampsia. Ethics approval: South Western Sydney Local Health District Research and Ethics Office (reference, 15/LPOOL/551). Dissemination of results: Peer-reviewed publications, scientific meetings, collaboration with research groups undertaking comparable studies, discussions with guideline groups and policy makers.

AB  - In this study, mapping of ultrashort T2 and T2* of acutely isolated porcine menisci at B0?=?9.4?T was investigated. Maps of T2 were measured from a slice through the pars intermedia with a spin echo-prepared two-dimensional ultrashort-TE T2 mapping technique published previously. T2* mapping was performed by two-dimensional ultrashort-TE MRI with variable acquisition delay. The measured signal decays were fitted by monoexponential, biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fitting functions. The occurrence of Gaussian-like signal decays is outlined theoretically. The quality of the curve fits was visualized by mapping the value δ = abs(1 ? ?2red). For T2* mapping, the Gaussian-exponential fit showed the best performance, whereas the monoexponential and biexponential fits showed regionally high values of δ (δ > 20). Interpretation of the Gaussian-exponential parameter maps was found to be difficult, because a Gaussian signal component can be related to mesoscopic (collagen texture) or macroscopic (slice profile, shim, sample geometry) magnetic field inhomogeneities and/or residual 1H dipole?dipole couplings. It seems likely that an interplay of these effects yielded the observed signal decays. Modulation of the T2* signal decay caused by chemical shift was observed and addressed to fat protons by means of histology. In the T2 measurements, no modulation of the signal decay was observed and the biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fits showed the best performance with comparable values of δ. Our results suggest that T2 mapping provides the more robust method for the characterization of meniscal tissue by means of MRI relaxometry. However, mapping of ultrashort T2, as performed in this study, is time consuming and provides less signal-to-noise ratio per time than the mapping of T2*. If T2* mapping is used, pixel-wise monitoring of the fitting quality based on reduced ?2 should be employed and great care should be taken when interpreting the parameter maps of the fits.

AB  - Background? Continued haemorrhage remains a major cause of mortality in massively transfused patients, many of whom develop coagulopathy. When reviewing transfusion practice for these patients at our hospital, more than 10% received a suboptimal transfusion therapy and survivors had a higher platelet count than non-survivors. We therefore speculated whether the blood bank could improve its service and hence improve the outcome. Methods? The blood bank introduced monitoring the delivery of blood products and contacted the clinician provided there was an imbalance in the transfusion practice. For massively bleeding patients, transfusion packages, encompassing 5 red blood cells, 5 fresh frozen plasma and 2 platelet concentrates was introduced to improve haemostatic competence. The thrombelastograph (TEG) was implemented, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy. Results The fraction of suboptimally transfused patients declined from > 10% to < 3%. The transfusion package administered intraoperatively to patients operated for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in decreased postoperative transfusion requirements and improved 30-day survival (66% vs. 44%) compared to controls. ?Only performing TEG in patients with a significant bleeding as judged by the anaesthetist reduces the number of analyses by ~85%, whereas those patients with coagulopathy remain identified. The TEG showed 97% predictability in identifying a surgical cause of bleeding in postoperative patients. Ten percent of the massively bleeding trauma patients had hyperfibrinolysis as the major cause of bleeding, whereas 45% were hypercoagulable. Conclusion? The initiatives from the blood bank has improved the transfusion practice and, hence, survival in massively transfused patients at our hospital.
