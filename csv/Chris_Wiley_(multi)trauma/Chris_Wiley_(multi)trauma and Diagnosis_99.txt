AB  - Background? Continued haemorrhage remains a major cause of mortality in massively transfused patients, many of whom develop coagulopathy. When reviewing transfusion practice for these patients at our hospital, more than 10% received a suboptimal transfusion therapy and survivors had a higher platelet count than non-survivors. We therefore speculated whether the blood bank could improve its service and hence improve the outcome. Methods? The blood bank introduced monitoring the delivery of blood products and contacted the clinician provided there was an imbalance in the transfusion practice. For massively bleeding patients, transfusion packages, encompassing 5 red blood cells, 5 fresh frozen plasma and 2 platelet concentrates was introduced to improve haemostatic competence. The thrombelastograph (TEG) was implemented, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy. Results The fraction of suboptimally transfused patients declined from > 10% to < 3%. The transfusion package administered intraoperatively to patients operated for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in decreased postoperative transfusion requirements and improved 30-day survival (66% vs. 44%) compared to controls. ?Only performing TEG in patients with a significant bleeding as judged by the anaesthetist reduces the number of analyses by ~85%, whereas those patients with coagulopathy remain identified. The TEG showed 97% predictability in identifying a surgical cause of bleeding in postoperative patients. Ten percent of the massively bleeding trauma patients had hyperfibrinolysis as the major cause of bleeding, whereas 45% were hypercoagulable. Conclusion? The initiatives from the blood bank has improved the transfusion practice and, hence, survival in massively transfused patients at our hospital.

AB  - Abstract The main research goal has been to evaluate significant factors affecting the in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters T, T, T2, and 1H density. This approach differs significantly from other such projects in that the experimental data analysis is being performed while concurrently developing automated, computer-aided analysis software for such MRI tissue parameters. In the experimental portion of the project, statistical analyses, and a heuristic minimum/maximum discriminant analysis algorithm have been explored. Both methods have been used to classify tissue types from 1.5 Tesla transaxial MR images of the human brain. The developing program, written in the logic programming language Prolog, is similar in a number of ways to many existing expert systems now in use for other medical applications; inclusion of the underlying statistical data base and advanced statistical analyses is the main differentiating feature of the current approach. First results indicate promising classification accuracy of various brain tissues such as gray and white matter, as well as differentiation of different types of gray matter and white matter (e.g.: caudate-nucleus vs. thalamus, both representatives of gray matter; and, cortical white matter vs. internal capsule as representative of white matter). Taking all four tissue types together, the percentage of correct classifications ranges from 73 to 87%.

AB  - SUMMARY Based on experience of 16 horses showing spontaneous epistaxis, a description is given of a previously unrecognised disease. An encapsulated haematoma originates in or near the ethmoid labyrinth and gradually expands, first into the nasal cavity and then into the nasopharynx. The principal clinical sign is a slight, persistent, unilateral nasal discharge of blood or bloodstained mucus. Other signs can include respiratory obstruction, coughing, choking and facial swelling. Diagnosis may be confirmed by rhinoscopy, radiography and trephining the paranasal sinuses. Surgical resection of the haematoma and the affected ethmoid labyrinth has been carried out in 13 horses but the lesion has recurred in five. Histologically, the capsule of the haematoma is composed of respiratory epithelium and fibrous tissue, and the stroma contains blood, macrophages, multinucleate giant cells and some fibrous tissue. The cause of this disease is not yet understood. RÉSUMÉ L'étude de seize cas de chevaux montrant un épistaxis spontané, donne l'occasion de décrire une affection jusqu'alors inconnue. Un hématome encapsulé prend naissance soit dans, soit près du labyrinthe ethmoidien. Progressivement cet hématome se développe, d'abord dans la cavité nasale puis dans le naso pharynx. Le signe clinique principal est un léger écoulement nasal unilatéral et persistant composé de sang ou de mucus mêlé de sang. Parmi les autres signes de cette affection, on peut rencontrer ceux d'une obstruction respiratoire, ceux d'une pseudo-obstruction oesophagienne, parfois de l'oedème facial, et parfois de la toux. Le diagnostic peut être confirmé par rhinoscopie, par radiographie, et en trépanant les sinus paranaseaux. La résection chirurgicale de l'hématome et du labyrinthe ethmoidien atteint a été effectuée, mais, dans deux cas sur cinq, on a observé une récidive. D'un point de vue histologique, on a constaté que la capsule de l'hématome est formée d'épithelium respiratoire et de tissu fibreux, le stroma renferme du sang, des macrophages, des cellules géantes multinucléées et du tissu fibreux. La cause de cette maladie n'est pas encore connue. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Aufgrund von Erfahrungen bei 16 Pferden mit spontaner Epistaxis wird eine bisher nicht erkannte Krankheit beschrieben. Ein abgekapseltes Haematom entsteht im oder nahe am Ethmoid und breitet sich zuerst in die Nasenhöhle später dann in den Nasopharynx aus. Das hervorstechende klinische Zeichen ist ein leichter, persistierender, unilateraler, blutiger oder blutig-mucöser Nasenausfluss. Daneben können etwa Zeichen einer respiratorischen Obstruktion, Husten, Erstickungsanfälle und Gesichtsanschwellungen beobachtet werden. Die Diagnose kann bestätigt werden durch Rhinoskopie, Röntgen und Trepanation der paranasalen Höhlen. Die Resektion des Haematoms und des affizierten ethmoidalen Labyrinths wurde durchgeführt, aber bei zwei Fünftel der Patienten stellte sich ein Recidiv ein. Histologisch besteht die Haematomkapsel aus respiratorischem Epithel und fibrösem Gewebe und das Stroma enthält Blut, Makrophagen, multinukleäre Riesenzellen und etwas fibröses Gewebe. Die Ursache der Krankheit ist noch unbekannt.

AB  - Purpose To examine imaging utilization in a matched cohort of patients with and without implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and to project magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilization over a 10-year period. Materials and Methods The Truven Health MarketScan Commercial claims and Medicare Supplemental health insurance claims data were used to identify patients with continuous health plan enrollment in 2009?2012. Patients with ICDs were identified using ICD-9 and CPT codes, and matched to patients with the same demographic and comorbidity profile, but no record of device implantation. Diagnostic imaging utilization was compared across the matched cohorts, in total, by imaging categories, and in subpopulations of stroke, back pain, and joint pain. MRI use in the nonimplant group over the 4-year period was extrapolated out to 10 years for ICD-indicated patients. Results A cohort of 18,770 matched patients were identified; average age 65.5?±?13.38 and 21.9% female. ICD patients had significantly less MRI imaging (0.23 0.70 SD vs. 0.00 0.08 SD, P?<?0.0001) than nonimplant patients. Among patients with records of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (ICD 5%, nonimplant 4%) and accompanying diagnostic imaging, 44% of nonimplant patients underwent MRI vs. 1% of ICD patients (P?<?0.0001). Forecast models estimated that 53% to 64% of ICD-eligible patients may require an MRI within 10 years. Conclusion MRI utilization is lower in ICD patients compared to nonimplant patients, yet the burden of incident stroke/TIA, back, and joint pain suggests an unmet need for MR-conditional devices. J.

AB  - Objectives: To characterise dogs with meningomyelitis and to compare signalment, body temperature and vaccination status to a representative control group. Methods: Dogs with meningomyelitis were identified retrospectively. Signalment, history, vaccination status, body temperature, severity of neurological dysfunction (modified Frankel score), diagnostic procedures, aetiology, survival to discharge and long-term survival were analysed. Results: Affected dogs were younger (P<0·05) and more frequently hound or toy breeds (P<0·05) when compared with controls. Hound and toy breed dogs less than or equal to three years of age had a 13 times higher odds of meningomyelitis compared with other breeds (P<0·001). General proprioceptive ataxia, limb paresis and paraspinal hyperaesthesia were the most common clinical signs. Meningomyelitis of unknown aetiology and granulomatous meningomyelitis were the most common diagnoses. The median time to death or continued follow-up in dogs alive at discharge was 213 days. Meningomyelitis resulted in death or euthanasia in 14 of 28 dogs. Clinical signs improved or resolved in seven of 28 dogs. Clinical Significance: Meningomyelitis is a differential diagnosis for dogs with clinical signs of myelopathy. Young dogs and toy or hound breeds seem to be predisposed. Clinical signs of meningomyelitis improve or resolve in some dogs.

AB  - Abstract Background Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine. While AIS can progress during growth and cause a surface deformity, it is usually not symptomatic. However, in adulthood, if the final spinal curvature surpasses a certain critical threshold, the risk of health problems and curve progression is increased. Braces are traditionally recommended to stop curvature progression in some countries and criticized in others. They generally need to be worn full time, with treatment extending over years. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of bracing in adolescent patients with AIS. Search strategy The following databases (up to July 2008) were searched with no language limitations: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), CINHAL (from January 1982) and reference lists of articles. An extensive handsearch of the grey literature was also conducted. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies comparing braces with no treatment, other treatment, surgery, and different types of braces. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results We included two studies. There was very low quality evidence from one prospective cohort study with 286 girls that a brace curbed curve progression at the end of growth (success rate 74% (95% CI: 52% to 84%)), better than observation (success rate 34% (95% CI:16% to 49%)) and electrical stimulation (success rate 33% (95% CI:12% to 60%)). There is low quality evidence from one RCT with 43 girls that a rigid brace is more successful than an elastic one (SpineCor) at curbing curve progression when measured in Cobb degrees, but there were no significant differences between the two groups in the subjective perception of daily difficulties associated with wearing the brace. Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence in favour of using braces, making generalization very difficult. Further research could change the actual results and our confidence in them; in the meantime, patients' choices should be informed by multidisciplinary discussion. Future research should focus on short and long-term patient-centred outcomes, in addition to measures such as Cobb angles. RCTs and prospective cohort studies should follow both the Scoliosis Resarch Society (SRS) and Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) criteria for bracing studies. Plain Language Summary Braces for idiopathic scoliosis in adolescents Scoliosis is a condition where the spine is curved in three dimensions (from the back the spine appears to be shaped like an ?s?). It is often idiopathic, or having an unknown cause. The most common type of scoliosis is discovered at 10 years of age or older, and is defined as a curve that measures at least 10° (called a Cobb angle; measured on x-ray). Because of the unknown cause and age of diagnosis, it is called Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). While there are usually no symptoms, the appearance of AIS frequently has a negative impact on adolescents. Increased curvature of the spine can present health risks in adulthood and in the elderly. Braces are one intervention that may stop further progression of the curve. They generally need to be worn full time, with treatment lasting for two to four years. However, bracing for this condition is still controversial, and questions remain about how effective it is. This review included two studies; one multicenter international cohort study (a study where treatment groups were defined according to the centre where patients were treated) of 286 girls and a randomised controlled study (an experimental study that randomised the participants to treatment groups) of 43 girls. There is very low quality evidence that braces are more effective than observation (wait-and-see) or electrical stimulation in curbing the increases in the curves of the spine. There is low quality evidence that rigid braces are more effective than a soft, elastic one. Adverse effects of braces were not discussed. Limitations of this review include the sparse data and studies available, and the fact that available studies only included girls (even if there is only one male with scoliosis for every seven females), making it very difficult to generalize the results to males. Due to the very low quality of the evidence in favour of bracing, patients and their parents should regard these results with caution and discuss their treatment options with a multi-professional team. Further research is very likely to change the results and our confidence in them.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to describe emotion episodes during early and late psychotherapy sessions among women newly diagnosed with gynecological cancer and to examine whether the total number of emotion episodes during early and later sessions was associated with baseline psychological distress, dispositional emotion expressivity, and patient-rated therapeutic progress. Methods The study utilized data from an ongoing study examining the efficacy of two psychotherapy interventions, a coping and communication intervention and a supportive counseling intervention, for women diagnosed with gynecological cancer. Emotion episode coding was completed for the first and sixth psychotherapy sessions for each patient randomized to receive psychotherapy (N?=?173). Patients completed baseline survey measures of psychological distress and dispositional emotional expressivity and post-session ratings of therapeutic progress. Results The average number of emotion episodes was 7.4 in the first session and 5.2 episodes in the sixth session. In both sessions, the majority of emotion episodes contained only negative emotions and focused on a cancer-related topic. A higher number of emotion episodes in the first session was associated with higher psychological distress reported in the baseline survey (p?=?0.02). A higher number of emotion episodes in the sixth session was associated with a higher number of emotion episodes in the first session (p?<?0.001) and higher patient-rated progress as rated in the sixth session (p?=?0.016). Conclusion The findings highlight the importance of expressed emotions, particularly negative emotions about cancer-related topics, in therapeutic progress during psychotherapy among women diagnosed with gynecological cancer.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of 106 horses presenting with chronic colic examined over a 5 year period were reviewed. Chronic colic was defined as colic signs observed, daily for 3 days or longer, except when masked by analgesics. The diagnosed causes of chronic colic included colonic impaction (31%), peritonitis (16%), enteritis/colitis (7%), colonic displacement/torsion (6%) and lymphosarcoma (4%). A variety of other diseases were diagnosed in a small number of cases, including intestinal adhesions, ileal obstructions, grass sickness, liver disease, caecal impactions, thromboembolic disease, intussusceptions etc. No diagnosis was reached in 8% of cases. Diagnosis was relatively easily achieved in most cases of colonic impaction and peritonitis by results of transrectal palpation and evaluation of peritoneal fluid. Specific clinical features, transrectal palpation, abdominal paracentesis and laboratory evaluations of blood were helpful in the diagnosis of some of the other diseases, but exploratory laparotomy remained necessary in a few cases to achieve a diagnosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic odontoid fractures (TOFs) have been described as the most common injury affecting the C-spine in the elderly. Previous studies have identified degenerative changes and bone loss as important predisposing factors. However, their interaction and respective age-adjusted impact needs further clarification. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 5303 patients (aged ≥60 years) admitted to a level I trauma center between January 2008 and January 2016 who underwent CT imaging of the C-spine. Ninety-two patients with TOF and 80 patients with other cervical spine fractures (OCSF) were identified and a respective 3:1 age- and sex-matched control group without fractures after trauma was built. In all groups, cervical bone mineral density (cBMD) was determined using phantom calibration, and degenerative changes were evaluated in a qualitative manner. In all groups, the severity of degenerative changes of the C-spine increased with age (all p <?0.05) and was inversely correlated with cBMD (all p < 0.05). cBMD was the only significant predictor of a TOF in a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?3.066, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432?6.563 for cervical osteoporosis). An association between odontoid cysts and TOF reached significance only in Anderson and D'Alonzo (A 95% CI 1.012?1.890). Patients with OCSFs, compared with patients with TOFs, were younger (median 74 versus 83 years) and had a higher cBMD (median 208?mg/mL versus 172?mg/mL). No differences were observable when comparing cBMD and grades of degenerative changes between OCSFs and their control group (all p >0.1). Decreased cBMD is the major predisposing factor for the occurrence of TOF but not for OCSF in the elderly. The severity of odontoid cysts was found to be a cBMD-independent factor associated with A&D type II TOFs. However, degenerative changes in the odontoid neighboring joints seem to be an epiphenomenon of bone loss and older age but do not independently predispose for TOF. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) are the most frequent musculoskeletal pain syndromes. These conditions are often not distinct entities and may overlap. There is significant comorbidity of FMS with other functional somatic syndromes and mental disorders. Clinical assessment should therefore focus on the whole range of physical and somatic distress and associated disability. The clinical diagnosis of FMS and MPS is based on history (typical cluster of symptoms), complete physical examination and the exclusion of other somatic disease as cause of local, regional or widespread pain. There is strong evidence for the efficacy of aerobic exercise, balneotherapy, multidisciplinary therapy (exercise and psychological therapy) and specific pharmacological agents (amitriptyline, duloxetine, fluoxetine, milnacipran, paroxetine, pregabalin) in reducing some of the key symptoms of FMS. There is strong evidence for short term pain relief in MPS by needling and laser therapy; however, the role for these treatments in long term therapy awaits further research.

AB  - Aim Although advanced treatments are provided to improve outcomes after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation, the actual treatments in clinical settings have been insufficiently investigated. The aim of the current study is to describe the actual treatments carried out for out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation patients, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients, at critical care medical centers. Methods We registered consecutive adult patients suffering bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac origin, for whom resuscitation was attempted by emergency medical service personnel, who had ventricular fibrillation as an initial rhythm, and who were transported to critical care medical centers in Osaka from March 2008 to December 2008. This study merged data on treatments after transportation, collected from 11 critical care medical centers in Osaka with the prehospital Utstein-style database. Results During the study period, there were 260 bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation arrests of cardiac origin. Of them, 252 received defibrillations before hospital arrival, 112 (44.4%) were transported to critical care medical centers, and 35 had shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. At the critical care medical centers, 54% (19/35), 40% (14/35), and 46% (16/35) of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients were treated with extracorporeal life support, percutaneous coronary interventions, and therapeutic hypothermia, respectively, but their treatments differed among institutions. Some patients with prolonged arrest without prehospital return of spontaneous circulation who received advanced treatments had neurologically favorable survival, whereas approximately two-thirds of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients with advanced treatments did not. Conclusion This pilot descriptive study suggested that actual treatments for prehospital ventricular fibrillation patients differed between critical care medical centers. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of in-hospital advanced treatments for ventricular fibrillation including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) complications after cardiac surgery are uncommon, but are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as significant hospital resource utilization. Methods We analysed a prospectively collected database containing all adult cardiac surgery procedures performed from July 2001 to March 2011 at Monash Medical Centre and Jessie McPherson Private Hospital. Patients with post-operative GI complications were compared to patients without GI complications who were operated in the same period. Results The incidence of GI complications was 1.1% (61 out of 5382 patients) with an overall 30-day mortality of 33% (versus 3% in the non-GI complication group). The most common complications were GI bleeding, gastroenteritis and bowel ischaemia. Patients who had GI complications were significantly older, had higher incidence of renal impairment, chronic lung disease and anticoagulation therapy and were more likely to be in cardiogenic shock. Emergency procedures, combined coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery and aortic dissection cases were more common in the GI complication group. The GI complication group also had higher incidence of return to theatre, renal failure, stroke, septicaemia and multi-organ failure. Conclusions GI complications after cardiac surgery remain an uncommon but dreadful complication associated with high mortality. Our findings should prompt a high degree of clinical vigilance in order to make an early diagnosis especially in high risk patients. Further studies aiming to identify independent predictors for GI complications after cardiac surgery are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Löfgren's syndrome is an acute-onset presentation of sarcoidosis that can be easily missed in an ED setting. A case is reported of Löfgren's syndrome presenting as erythema nodosum with bilateral ankle oedema. Although rare, this diagnosis should be considered when examining a patient with erythema nodosum and articular symptoms.

AB  - Objectives To determine the computed tomographic stage of dogs with nasal tumours in a UK referral population, and whether stage, time to referral and treatment correlates with outcome. Methods Retrospective review of clinical records and computed tomography scans of dogs with nasal tumours. Results Dogs (n=78) presented to a referral practice in the UK with suspected nasal tumours are presented with more late stage tumours than dogs in the USA and Japan. Length of time from initial presentation to referral did not correlate with tumour stage at diagnosis. Median survival times for radiotherapy-treated dogs in this population are equivalent to those previously reported for late stage nasal tumours. Clinical Significance Dogs with nasal tumours are presented late in the course of disease in the North West of England. Dogs with clinical signs consistent with a nasal tumour should have timely imaging and biopsy, in order to make prompt treatment decisions. Although survival times are comparable with previous reports and radiotherapy is a valid treatment option for dogs with late stage disease, better outcomes are likely to be achievable with earlier treatment.

AB  - To the Editor: In 1993 Valparaíso San Antonio Health Service initiated an Organizational Development Programme that included all facilities, extending from the six major hospitals to the 26 primary care clinics of the region. The programme adopted Quality Management as its model, without discarding other concepts and methods of proven effectiveness (see Walton 1992; Al-Asaf 1993; Ishikawa 1993).?In 1994 the Health Service Council identified the emergency care system as a model in need of great improvement and considered the incorporation of pre-hospital care as a top priority. The challenge was to implement a new system, affordable with a small budget, with greater satisfaction for staff and users, better coordinated and more responsive to local needs (see Ministère de la Santé 1992). ?Quality management techniques were used to adapt and develop a new model, essentially designed by local staff, based on the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and other relevant literature (Burnett  Grijseels et al. 1996; Gwinnutt  Hu  Jabbour et al. 1996; Boyington 1995). A ?network? model rather than a centralized one was chosen and implemented at a very low direct cost, optimizing existing resources.
