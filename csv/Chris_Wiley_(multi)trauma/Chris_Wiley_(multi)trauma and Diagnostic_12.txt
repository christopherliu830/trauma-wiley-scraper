AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine cervical osteoarthritis is a common disease known to contribute to both neck pain and cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy. There are no published studies demonstrating the usefulness of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical osteoarthritis. Objectives To determine the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical articular process joint osteoarthritis. Study design Prospective cadaver study. Methods Latero-oblique radiographs and CT images were collected, and post mortem examinations performed, on 27 cadaver necks from Thoroughbred-type horses of various ages and sexes. Two equine clinicians independently reviewed each set of images for the presence of osteoarthritis. The authors, under the guidance of a veterinary pathologist, reviewed all articular process joints for bony changes indicative of osteoarthritis. Results The prevalence of osteoarthritis identified on CT images was 57.9% (Assessor A) and 23% (Assessor B). The prevalence of lesions identified on post mortem examination was 25.6%. Latero-oblique radiography showed a low sensitivity for identifying osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging (6.3?16.1%) and post mortem examination (2.2?4.4%). However, it showed a high specificity when compared to both CT imaging (92.1?97.8%) and post mortem examination (87.2?95.0%). The positive predictive value for identifying osteoarthritis was moderate (40.9?80.0%) when compared to CT imaging and poor (4.2?18.2%) when compared to post mortem examination. The negative predictive value was moderate when compared to both CT imaging (42.9?76.3%) and post mortem examination (78.0?79.8%). Conclusions Latero-oblique radiography has low sensitivity, but high specificity for the detection of cervical osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging and post mortem examination. Further investigation comparing the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography vs. laterolateral radiography would determine whether taking latero-oblique radiographs, which can be more difficult to obtain and interpret, is necessary for the diagnosis of cervical osteoarthritis in practice.

AB  - Abstract Vicarious trauma is referred to as the detrimental change in the manner that professionals understand and interpret material, as a result of exposure to second-hand traumatic material (McCann  however, after examining the goodness of fit of the two-factor model using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach, this study concluded that the two-dimensional model was not a good fit. Due to the poor goodness of fit of the two-factor model and the post hoc EFA resulting in a one-factor model, our data do not support the findings of Aparicio et al. (2013). Further, the findings suggest the VTS is an acceptable measure of vicarious trauma, as demonstrated by the high internal consistency and the single-factor loading.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early identification of surgical cases of colic is critical to improving outcome and welfare. There have been a number of studies on diagnostic tests for colic, evaluating a range of tests to differentiate between medical and surgical cases. Objectives To systematically review and appraise the evidence on diagnostic tests for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS quality assessment tool. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to equine colic; 976 related to diagnostic tests, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Of these, 16 papers reported on peritoneal fluid parameters, 21 on blood parameters, 10 on blood and peritoneal parameters, 3 on physical and blood parameters and one study on urine parameters. A range of different parameters were evaluated, with the majority of tests only being evaluated in single studies. None of the studies met QUADAS criteria 1 (representative spectrum of patients), 7/29 studies met criteria 2 (description of selection criteria) and 10/29 studies met criteria 9 (description of reference standard). Conclusions There are currently no published studies which use appropriate methodology to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test in differentiating medical and surgical colic. This made direct application of the QUADAS tool challenging; predominantly due to the lack of a pre mortem ?gold standard? reference diagnostic test for colic. Very few studies enrolled a randomised selection of patients and there was also a propensity to case?control study design, both increasing the risk of bias and under/overestimating diagnostic accuracy. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis' studentship is funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham.

AB  - Abstract: Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a cardio-specific myofibrillar protein known to be elevated early after heart transplantation and during cardiac allograft rejection. cTnT determination in heart allograft recipients showed elevated levels in patients with higher degrees of graft rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grades?≥3A?4). Subgroup analyses revealed demographic patient characteristics markedly improving the diagnostic efficiency of cTnT measurement for rejection monitoring, including male recipient gender, recipient age <60 yr, female donor gender and donor age?≥?33 yr. The clinical utility of these parameters was confirmed by longitudinal patient data and may help to select recipients most likely to benefit from cTnT rejection surveillance.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the social dimensions of war trauma and recovery through the examples of Mozambique, with a detailed focus on the Gorongosa, a district in the center of the country, and Uganda, specifically, Gulu district. Both countries are exemplary of how state actors and civilians struggle to come to terms with experiences of mass political violence as the result of prolonged conflict. The chapter briefly describes the dynamics of war violence and the human toll of violence in both countries. It analyzes changes in processes of social recovery over time through the introduction and consumption of new mass-media technologies as well as in response to emergent challenges in the post-war era. The chapter demonstrates that social recovery is a long-term negotiated endeavor and women, while being seriously persecuted and wronged by the various factions in war violence, also appear as central actors in diverse recovery mechanisms and collective actions.

Design, setting Retrospective analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database data from 92 Australian ICUs for the 6-year period, 2010?2015. Participants Patients older than 17 years of age admitted to public hospital ICUs with a primary diagnosis of trauma. Main outcome measures ICU and overall hospital lengths of stay, hospital discharge destination, and ICU and overall hospital mortality rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Results 23 804 people were admitted to Australian public hospital ICUs after major trauma; 1754 (7.4%) were Indigenous Australians. The population-standardised incidence of admissions was consistently higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians (847 per million v 251 per million population; incidence ratio, 3.37; 95% CI, 3.19?3.57). Overall hospital mortality rates were similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82?1.31). Indigenous patients were more likely than non-Indigenous patients to be discharged to another hospital (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72?0.96) less likely to be discharged home (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04?1.31). Conclusion The population rate of trauma-related ICU admissions was substantially higher for Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients, but hospital mortality rates after ICU admission were similar. Indigenous patients were more likely to be discharged to a another hospital and less likely to be discharged home than non-Indigenous patients.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma is an irreversible pathology which after occurrence is characterized by life long debilitating effects. The objective of the study was to measure the prevalence of trauma in anterior permanent teeth among children and associations with independent variables. A total of 453 5th and 6th grade Arab Eastern Jerusalem schoolchildren participated. Trauma, incisal overjet and lip competence were measured by one examiner in the schools. Reasons and location of trauma were assessed by telephone interviews with the parents. The total prevalence of dental trauma was 33.8%. Severe trauma prevalence (involving dentine) was 12.6%. Severe trauma was more prevalent among boys (OR?=?2.03, P?=?0.026); children with lip incompetence (OR?=?2.71, P?=?0.001); and those with an overjet of 4mm or more (OR?=?3.73, P?<?0.001). The main reported causes for dental trauma were falling (29.1%), sports (16.4%), violence (20%) and playing (20%). According to the parents? reports, more fall-related injuries were reported at home, more sport injuries at school, more ?playing? injuries ?outside? (P?<?0.001). Combination of results with a previous study among Jewish schoolchildren demonstrated: severe dental trauma was related to overjet (OR?=?1.73, P?=?0.002), lip incompetence (OR?=?2.19, P?<?0.001), gender (OR for males?=?1.54, P?=?0.005), but not to ethnicity (Arab or Jewish). The reasons for trauma observed in this study were potentially preventable. A community effort should therefore be pursued, with the aim of educating sports teachers, teachers, health personnel and schoolchildren regarding awareness of dental trauma prevention, with emphasis on utilizing mouthguards and early orthodontic intervention, when financially possible.

Our main aim was to assess the penetration of correct diagnostic and clinicopharmacological information into routine practice. A detailed analysis and discussion are given of data concerning reasons for hospital admission (therapeutic adjustment accounting for 27.3%; diagnostic ascertainment, 53.8%); characteristics of the disease, in terms of duration, clinical manifestations, and pattern of seizures; associated disorders; prevalence and criteria for the use of instrumental diagnostic procedures (EEG, brain scan, computed tomography, etc.); pattern of prescriptions of anticonvulsant drugs at admission and at discharge, with particular emphasis on specific drug choices by specialty; prevalence of single-drug therapy (41% at admission and 47.0% at discharge) versus polytherapy; degree of correspondence between recommended and observed dosage regimens (undertreatment being a more common problem than excessive dosing); and reporting of side effects. Although some of the findings of some recent studies are confirmed, this report documents the feasibility of a regular audit program of the performance of an entire health care system in the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Traumatic injury and its sequelae remain a major, unrecognized public health problem in North America. Traumatic injury is the principal cause of death in patients aged 1-44 years and the overall leading cause of life-years lost in the United States. Recognizing this, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in conjunction with other federal agencies, organized a conference in June 2000 to discuss the basic and clinical research needs that could lead to improved outcomes following cardiopulmonary or post injury resuscitation. The Post Resuscitative and Initial Utility of Life Saving Efforts (PULSE) Workshop resulted and eight work groups were established to focus on various aspects, including organ systems, pharmacology, epidemiology, and trauma. The Trauma Work Group recommendations are presented in this article. Despite the recognition of improved survival and outcome through advancements in trauma systems and trauma care, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support ratio for trauma research is only 0.10, compared with 1.65 for cancer research and a remarkable 3.51 for AIDS and HIV infection research. The successful federal HIV research program has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality over the last ten years at a cost of $1.4 billion per year. A coordinated trauma research program should aim to replicate the success achieved by such programs; however, a centralized federal ?home? for trauma research does not exist. Consequently, the existing limited research support is derived from NIH institutes in addition to other federal and state agencies. This report serves to describe some of the obstacles and outline various strategies and priorities for basic science, clinical, and translational trauma resuscitation research.

AB  - Diagnostic concordance of intraepithelial malignancy is generally only fair. Because the diagnosis of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma is not uniform and because such terms are not consonant with the nomenclature of other human epithelial malignancies, nomenclature revisions have been attempted. One hundred dermatopathologists were solicited to review 15 tissue sections representing a spectrum of varying thickness epidermal malignancy and to choose either actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma as the diagnosis. Among the 77 participating dermatopathologists intraclass correlation was high for what was perceived as actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma and their differentiation. Development of a two-tiered diagnostic system that retains our present diagnostic capabilities, but better fits the pathobiology of superficial epidermal malignancy is suggested.

AB  - Aim? Whole-body multislice CT-Scanning (MSCT) has become the primary imaging device in many European and North American trauma centres. We aim to present a new standardised protocol that has lead to a markedly improved diagnostic managment in an Australian metropolitan trauma centre. Methods? Based on growing evidence in the literature the MSCT is used as the primary imaging tool in severely injured patients and is routinely performed after completion of primary and secondary survey. The routine protocol consists of a non-contrast head and cervical spine CT, followed by a contrast chest, abdomen and pelvic CT. Apart from an initial chest X-Ray, routine X-ray trauma series are not performed anymore. The criteria for this whole-body MSCT are strictly limited to patients that required trauma team activation and can be sufficiently stabilised in the emergency room. Results? This adapted diagnostic algorithm has shown to be very fast and efficient. The average duration of initial management can be reduced significantly, in addition the number of initially missed injuries is markedly reduced. Conclusions? Primary whole-body MSCT has become a valuable diagnostic tool in the emergency management of severe trauma. A strictly followed protocol has been shown to be crucial to avoid overuse, in terms of radiation as well as exposing the unstable patient to an unnecessary high risk.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies showing the overall impact of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) on the treatment of critically ill patients in a general intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: A prospective observational study on the effects of MDCT on the treatment of patients in a 12-bed medical?surgical ICU in a university hospital providing tertiary care. Results: During the 9-month study period, there were 343 admissions with ICU length of stay longer than 48?h. Of these patients, 64 (19%) had had inconclusive findings with other modalities of radiological imaging, and they underwent altogether 82 MDCT examinations. Fifty examinations (61%) resulted in a change of treatment. The changes included 22 surgical interventions, 16 percutaneous or paranasal interventions, 15 changes of antimicrobial therapy, three withdrawals of active treatment, and four other changes of treatment. Eight patients underwent two and one patient underwent three changes of treatment. Twenty examinations (24%) were regarded as otherwise necessary for clinical decision-making, although no change in the treatment was indicated. Twelve examinations (15%) failed to provide any additional information relevant to the patient's treatment. Conclusion: Sixty-one percent of the MDCT examinations led to a change of treatment, and 24% of them otherwise contributed to or supported clinical decision-making, suggesting that MDCT examination is helpful in the case of general ICU patients, with inconclusive findings with other imaging modalities.

AB  - Summary Viscoelastic assays such as TEG? and ROTEM? are increasingly used to guide transfusion of blood products. The EXTEM assay maximum clot firmness (MCF) is a ROTEM measure available after 25?29 min used to guide early decisions. EXTEM A10, the clot firmness at 10 min, is an accepted early surrogate, but investigators differ on whether A5, the clot firmness at 5 min, is acceptable. We re-examined this in a retrospective observational analysis of 1146 trauma patients in one centre who had ROTEM data recorded. A5 and A10 both correlated well with maximum clot firmness, with Pearson coefficients of r = 0.92 and r = 0.96, respectively. The correlations of A5, A10 and maximum clot firmness with requirement for massive transfusion were all similarly high, with c-stats of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.90, respectively. The correlations with mortality were also similar but weaker, with c-stats of 0.67, 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. Using a previously validated cut-off of A5 < 35 mm to predict massive transfusion gave a sensitivity of 95%, specificity 83%, positive predictive value 9.3% and negative predictive value 100%. Using a value of A5 < 29 mm, for a pragmatic positive predictive value of 20%, gave a sensitivity of 67%, specificity 95% and negative predictive value 99%. Whether aiming for a high sensitivity or a strong predictive value, A5 was non-inferior to A10 and actually missed fewer cases needing massive transfusion. A5 has similar utility to both A10 and maximum clot firmness as an early measure of clot firmness, and a low A5 value is strongly predictive of the need for massive transfusion.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - In this paper we map out what we are calling a ?geopolitics of trauma? by examining the role of trauma in transnational refugee regimes and the individualisation of geopolitical relations through mental health diagnosis and service provision. Focusing on one site of entry into the international regime of refugee administration, we present findings from fieldwork that we conducted in August, 2015 in Turkey with NGOs and IGOs involved in the protection, mental health and psychosocial service provision, and resettlement of refugees. The findings that we present demonstrate the challenges of refugee care and management on the front lines in Turkey and the significance of mental health diagnosis, treatment and documentation in the early stages of refugee administration. We suggest that practices of refugee screening and resettlement are imbued with traumatic stressors and trace how trauma intersects with the administration of refugees in different sites and at different times. We argue that the protracted situation of refugees in Turkey (many of whom will wait eight years for their Refugee Status Determination interview) and the multiple interviews and demands for documentation through which a displaced person applies for refugee status and third-country resettlement become sites of ongoing traumatisation for the refugee subject. Further, in the practices of screening and documentation, we can trace the medicalisation of the refugee subject as not only a question of care but also a practice of legibility on which the state and international organisations base their decisions about inclusion and exclusion. The geopolitics of trauma thus emerges not only in cartographies of war, displacement and resettlement, but also in the minute details and performative demands of the refugee determination and resettlement process.
