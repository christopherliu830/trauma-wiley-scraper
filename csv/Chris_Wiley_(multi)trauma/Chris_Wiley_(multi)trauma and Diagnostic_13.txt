AB  - In this paper we map out what we are calling a ?geopolitics of trauma? by examining the role of trauma in transnational refugee regimes and the individualisation of geopolitical relations through mental health diagnosis and service provision. Focusing on one site of entry into the international regime of refugee administration, we present findings from fieldwork that we conducted in August, 2015 in Turkey with NGOs and IGOs involved in the protection, mental health and psychosocial service provision, and resettlement of refugees. The findings that we present demonstrate the challenges of refugee care and management on the front lines in Turkey and the significance of mental health diagnosis, treatment and documentation in the early stages of refugee administration. We suggest that practices of refugee screening and resettlement are imbued with traumatic stressors and trace how trauma intersects with the administration of refugees in different sites and at different times. We argue that the protracted situation of refugees in Turkey (many of whom will wait eight years for their Refugee Status Determination interview) and the multiple interviews and demands for documentation through which a displaced person applies for refugee status and third-country resettlement become sites of ongoing traumatisation for the refugee subject. Further, in the practices of screening and documentation, we can trace the medicalisation of the refugee subject as not only a question of care but also a practice of legibility on which the state and international organisations base their decisions about inclusion and exclusion. The geopolitics of trauma thus emerges not only in cartographies of war, displacement and resettlement, but also in the minute details and performative demands of the refugee determination and resettlement process.

AB  - Abstract The meaning of trauma within psychology has for a long time been viewed mostly from a ?pathologising? standpoint. Viewed as pathology, people's trauma may become understood using a singular lens thereby leaving out broader contextual (social, environmental, political, historical, economical etc.) aspects that have been shown to play a role in the subjective experience of various forms of suffering. Psychology has for a long time been quick to diagnose victims of traumatic experiences from an individualistic perspective, almost always positioning the ?problem? within the person. As a result of the Vietnam War, World Wars I and II and the Holocaust, the rise in the diagnosing of PTSD gave way to the labelling of trauma. Within psychology, post-traumatic stress disorder has become the way to operationalise suffering, and I would like to argue that this occludes how suffering lives in a family, a community and in gendered bodies. The gendering of trauma continues to be a silenced space. There is a need to highlight and acknowledge the gendered nature of suffering which begs for trauma to be understood in context and not as an isolated act or occurrence affecting the individual. Women have remained, and in many ways continue to remain, silenced with minimal opportunities to name the world for themselves. This paper seeks to provide a critical analysis of the notion of trauma (and its intersection with gender) that arises from conflict and post-conflict situations.

AB  - Reason for performing study Measurement of lactate in horses with colic has been described for over 20 years. Objectives To systematically review the evidence on the use of plasma and/or peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS scoring system. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to colic; 32 studies related to the use of lactate in the diagnosis of colic, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using QUADAS. Both papers investigated the use of plasma and peritoneal lactate to identify strangulating intestinal lesions. Both were cross-sectional studies, and together they evaluated a total of 71 horses with confirmed strangulating lesions. Appraisal of the studies using the QUADAS tool was performed. Both papers met QUADAS criteria relating to study design and data analysis, but the QUADAS tool did highlight some limitations in terms of sample and control groups in both papers. Data analysis varied, with one study developing a model to predict the presence of a strangulating lesion, which included peritoneal lactate and other measurements, and the other study assessing optimal predictive values associated with concentrations of peritoneal lactate. Both studies concluded that peritoneal lactate was a more useful diagnostic test than blood lactate. Conclusions Despite the large numbers of publications reporting use of lactate, only a small number used study designs considered suitable for evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy as proposed by the Cochrane Library. Although the current evidence is limited, there is agreement on the value of peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for strangulating intestinal lesions. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Introduction Evaluating responses of horses to diagnostic analgesia is subject to bias. Pelvic movement symmetry can be measured accurately with inertial sensors, but it is unclear which of the many symmetry measures best reflect changes. It was hypothesised that objective parameters mimicking commonly observed visual parameters used by veterinarians (difference between upward/downward sacral movement and between amplitudes of left and right tuber coxa motion) would show the largest, most consistent responses. Methods 13 horses underwent visual lameness scoring and independent gait assessment with inertial sensors during clinical lameness investigations. Multiple movement symmetry parameters were calculated and changes before/after diagnostic analgesia regressed against change in lameness grade. Confidence intervals of slopes of regression lines were assessed to identify significant changes. Results All parameters showed variation between horses and across lameness grades. Three measures documented a consistent increase in symmetry for each grade of change in lameness score: difference between sacral displacement minima, and upward movement difference and range of motion difference between the tubera coxae. A change in symmetry of 9?13% for each grade of increase in lameness can be expected. Conclusions The three most promising pelvic parameters for consistent quantification of changes due to diagnostic analgesia in the hindlimb of lame horses were identified. Difference in upward movement between left and right tuber coxae is the most sensitive but requires simultaneously focusing on pelvic and limb movements and may therefore be more difficult to assess visually. Showing a similar response to diagnostic analgesia, the difference in movement amplitude between left and right tuber coxae may be more easily perceived since it does not require simultaneous focus on limb movement. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?None declared.

AB  - This report describes the epidemiology of pedestrian injury in four inner metropolitan local government areas of Sydney. These data were obtained from the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales. The spectrum of injury and clinical outcome was defined in patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 admitted from the study area, during a 1 year period, to the four inner metropolitan teaching hospitals. The incidence of pedestrian death was 3.3 times the state average of 32/106/year. An average of 235 pedestrians, injured in the study area, were hospitalized each year during the period 1987?89. On average 24 pedestrians died each year, seven at the scene and 17 in hospital. Fifty patients (ISS > 15) were admitted to the four teaching hospitals during a 1 year period 1990?91. Forty-five were adults and five children. Multiplicity of injury was seen in 68% of patients. The pelvis and lower extremities were involved in 70%, the head in 66% and chest in 42%. The hospital mortality rate was 30% with five patients dying on the first day from blood loss and nine dying during subsequent days from head injury. This study has important implications for trauma service development. Successful clinical management of the severely injured pedestrian requires close co-operation between pre-hospital and hospital care providers. An integrated hospital trauma team response is mandatory to ensure appropriate management of what is often a shocked, hypoxic. head-injured patient.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of a chronic illness is described as an upsetting event that implies an emotional crisis for parents. Some are able to come to terms with their child's chronic condition and feel a sense of resolution, but for others, strong negative emotions persist through time. The present study examines diagnostic resolution among parents of teenagers with a transplant. The design was qualitative and involved individual interviews with nine parents. Five were donor to their child. Data were analyzed according to the principles of IPA. Early reactions to the diagnosis suggest that parents with an unresolved status experienced trauma. Many factors seem to contribute to diagnostic resolution such as good communication between spouses, positive relationship with the medical staff, and being the parent donor. For all parents, concerns over adherence are central to their relationship with their youth. Results call attention to the support needs of all parents and particularly those with an unresolved status.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

AB  - Objective. To report our experience in the assessment of splenic trauma with contrast-coded sonography and a second-generation contrast medium. Methods. From January to May 2002, 120 patients were studied with sonography for suspected splenic trauma. Twenty-five were selected for further imaging because of sonographic findings positive for splenic injury, findings positive for peritoneal fluid only, indeterminate findings, and negative findings with high clinical or laboratory suspicion. These patients underwent contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography. Results. Among the 25 patients studied, 6 had no spleen trauma at initial and follow-up evaluation. One patient had a hypoperfused spleen without parenchymal damage, and 18 had splenic injuries; these 19 patients were considered positive. Hemoperitoneum was identified by sonography, contrast-enhanced sonography, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography in 74% of the 19 positive cases. Perisplenic clots were recognized in 58% of the cases by computed tomography and in 42% by baseline and enhanced sonography. Splenic infarctions were found in 11% of cases by contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography; none was found by unenhanced sonography. Parenchymal traumatic lesions were identified in 12 of 18 patients with splenic injuries by unenhanced sonography, in 17 cases by contrast-enhanced sonography, and in all 18 cases by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. A minimal splenic lesion was found in the single patient with a false-negative contrast-enhanced sonographic finding. Contrast-enhanced sonography correlated appreciably better than unenhanced sonography in detecting injuries and in estimating their extent. Findings undetectable on unenhanced sonography were also noted: splenic hypoperfusion in 11% of positive cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography, contrast medium pooling in 21% of cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography, and contrast extravasation in 11% of cases on computed tomography and 5% on contrast-enhanced sonography. Conclusions. Contrast-enhanced sonography is a promising tool in the assessment of splenic trauma. In institutions where sonography is used as the initial procedure, this technique may increase its effectiveness.

AB  - Summary Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 h of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of ?hyperfibrinolysis? would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

AB  - Summary The effect of patient-controlled analgesia during the emergency phase of care on the prevalence of persistent pain is unkown. We studied individuals with traumatic injuries or abdominal pain 6 months after hospital admission via the emergency department using an opportunistic observational study design. This was conducted using postal questionnaires that were sent to participants recruited to the multi-centre pain solutions in the emergency setting study. Patients with prior chronic pain states or opioid use were not studied. Questionnaires included the EQ5D, the Brief Pain Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Overall, 141 out of 286 (49% 95%CI 44?56%) patients were included in this follow-up study. Participants presenting with trauma were more likely to develop persistent pain than those presenting with abdominal pain, 45 out of 64 (70%) vs. 24 out of 77 (31%); 95%CI 24?54%, p < 0.001. There were no statistically significant associations between persistent pain and analgesic modality during hospital admission, age or sex. Across both abdominal pain and traumatic injury groups, participants with persistent pain had lower EQ5D mobility scores, worse overall health and higher anxiety and depression scores (p < 0.05). In the abdominal pain group, 13 out of 50 (26%) patients using patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 11 out of 27 (41%) of those with usual treatment; 95%CI for difference (control ? patient-controlled analgesia) ?8 to 39%, p = 0.183. Acute pain scores at the time of hospital admission were higher in participants who developed persistent pain; 95%CI 0.7?23.6, p = 0.039. For traumatic pain, 25 out of 35 (71%) patients given patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 20 out of 29 (69%) patients with usual treatment; 95%CI ?30 to 24%, p = 0.830. Persistent pain is common 6 months after hospital admission, particularly following trauma. The study findings suggest that it may be possible to reduce persistent pain (at least in patients with abdominal pain) by delivering better acute pain management. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract:? Until the late 1960s, splenectomy was routinely performed in children who had sustained blunt splenic injury. There was based on the ability to perform splenectomy without obvious consequence; the cited 90?100% mortality for splenic trauma and the possibility of delayed rupture of the spleen. In contrast, contemporary findings in immunology and surgery demonstrated that non-operative management was not only feasible but desirable in view of the potential for overwhelming post-plenectomy infection. The history of universal splenectomy following blunt splenic trauma has been reviewed and we outline the findings that have resulted in the current standard of non-operative management following blunt splenic trauma.

AB  - Summary The restoration of a tooth or teeth damaged by trauma can be challenging. The hydrophobic dimethacrylate monomer or its derivations, such as urethane dimethacrylate (UMDA) form the basis of modern day composite resins. Other components include inhibitors, to prevent premature resin polymerisation and colour stabilizers. The reattachment approach can be used for both uncomplicated and complicated crown fractures. The concept of working from final form is crucial to allow the clinician to carefully control the composite build-up. The key to an aesthetic Class IV build-up can be broken down into four elements: shape, shade, surface texture, and polishing. The chapter presents the clinical sequence followed in the tooth restoration. Final bonding of the porcelain restoration can then be carried out to optimise the enamel, by etching for 30 seconds, washing, and drying thoroughly before applying bond and curing.

PY  - 1992
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but well recognized clinical entity which most often occurs on the trunk, perineum or legs following surgery or trauma. The condition is much less common in the head and neck and it is particularly uncommon in the midface/periorbital region. In almost all the cases occurring in the neck the condition follows obvious dental or oropharyngeal sepsis and in all the cases of the scalp there is a history of previous surgery or trauma. However, necrotizing fasciitis of the midface/periorbital region may lack any obvious traumatic aetiology or may follow relatively minor trauma. The diagnosis in these cases may not be suspected and treatment may be delayed with fatal consequences. Treatment by wide excision of all affected skin can lead to disastrous cosmetic consequences in facial disease and it is suggested that disease control can be achieved by raising wide based skin flaps with excision of the underlying necrotic tissue. The flaps are then returned onto normal muscle with much improved cosmetic results. This paper discusses the diagnosis and treatment of patients with necrotizing fasciitis of the face which has arisen without significant trauma.

AB  - Abstract Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a systems-focused philosophy of service delivery based upon principles of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety and trustworthiness that recognizes the pervasive impact of trauma across the human experience. In a grassroots effort, one organization developed an innovative, trauma-informed day program to meet the needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who were recently deinstitutionalized. The present study is intended to provide an initial conceptualization and preliminary assessment of TIC within IDD services in order to understand its impact among individuals and staff. The study sought to answer the following questions: Has the program's culture been stable over time? How have individuals? behaviors changed over time? What have been the experiences of the program's staff members with TIC? Through a mixed methods design, secondary data analysis and semi structured staff interviews were used to assess the impact of TIC. Findings revealed an initial strong presence of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety, and trustworthiness within the program's culture, with non significant changes at follow-up. Significant reductions were noted in overall challenging behavior, aggression, and PRN medication usage; while non significant changes were noted in physical interventions with the exception of ?other? interventions (i.e., least restrictive) which significantly increased. Three major categories emerged from the qualitative data (making a difference, recognizing progress and compromising factors), illuminating staff satisfaction with work experiences, individuals? progress, and factors that challenged fidelity to TIC. The study provides a preliminary conceptualization and evidence for the efficacy of the integration of TIC into IDD services despite methodological limitations and concerns regarding the use of physical interventions. Directions for future research are presented.

AB  - Abstract Background: Genetic polymorphisms that influence serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) neurotransmission are candidates for contributing to susceptibility to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The objective of our study was to determine if a variable length polymorphism for the promoter regions of the 5HT transporter (5HTTLPR), and/or a substitution polymorphism in the promoter region for the 5HT2A receptor, would be associated with PTSD in a trauma exposed population of adult African-Americans. Methods: Using a case control design, 118 participants recruited from the primary care clinics and the campus of a historically black university who met inclusion criteria including trauma exposure provided blood samples for genomic DNA. PTSD criteria were determined by the Clinician Assessment of PTSD Scale (CAPS) and criteria for other psychiatric disorders by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). 5HTTLPR and 5HT2A-1438A/G were genotyped using established methods. Associations of genotypes with lifetime PTSD, and models testing associations of allele ?dose?, were analyzed. Results: Fifty-five (47%) participants met lifetime criteria for PTSD and 26 (22%) met criteria for (mostly comorbid) major depression. The 5HT2A (lower expressing) G allele was significantly associated with PTSD. We did not find significant associations with 5HTTLPR. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a relationship between genetic variation in the 5HT2A promoter region and PTSD. Depression and Anxiety 26:993?997, 2009. Published 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We sought to investigate the risk factors and outcome of Ventilator Associated Tracheitis (VAT) according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition in pediatric trauma patients who were ventilated for ≥48?hr. In a retrospective cohort study, medical records of all pediatric trauma patients admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between April 2002 and April 2007 were reviewed. Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, Trauma Injury Severity Score (TISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), type of trauma, and other potential risk factors prior to the development of VAT (such as hyperglycemia, rate of re-intubation and tracheotomy, presence of chest tubes and central lines, urinary tract infection, seizures, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of total parental nutrition, transfusion, use of H2 blockers, steroids, and pressors/inotropes). Medical records were also reviewed for days of mechanical ventilation, PICU length of stay, and PICU mortality. During the study period, 217 trauma patients were admitted to the PICU, 113 patients met our inclusion criteria and 21.2% (24/113) developed VAT. On average patients with VAT (in comparison to patients without VAT), had a higher TISS score on admission [38.6?±?16.9 vs. 24.2?±?10.6; respectively (P?<?0.01)], longer days of ventilation and PICU length of stay [11.5?±?6.2 vs. 3.7?±?2.3 days (P?<?0.001) and 16.4?±?8.3 vs. 5.4?±?2.8 days (P?<?0.001), respectively]. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. In a logistic regression model adjusting for possible confounders, the TISS score (adjusted OR 7.53; CI: 2.01?28.14; P?=?0.03 and use of pressors/inotropes (adjusted OR 4.64; CI: 1.28?16.86; P?=?0.01) were the only independent risk factors associated with VAT. We conclude that the severity of illness and use of pressors/inotropes are associated with VAT in pediatric trauma patients. We also conclude that VAT is associated with an increase in days of mechanical ventilation and PICU length of stay in pediatric trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective Women veterans have a higher prevalence of chronic pain relative to men. One hypothesis is that differential combat and traumatic sexual experiences and attenuated levels of social support between men and women may differentially contribute to the development and perpetuation of pain. This investigation examined [1] gender differences in trauma, social support, and family conflict among veterans with chronic pain, and [2] whether trauma, social support, and family conflict were differentially associated with pain severity, pain interference, and depressive symptom severity as a function of gender. Methods Participants included 460 veterans (56% female) who served in support of recent conflicts, and who endorsed pain lasting 3 months or longer. Participants completed a baseline survey during participation in a longitudinal investigation. Self-report measures included pain severity, pain interference, depressive symptom severity, exposure to traumatic life events, emotional and tangible support, and family conflict. Results Relative to men, women veterans reporting chronic pain evidenced higher rates of childhood interpersonal trauma (51% vs 34%; P?<?0.001) and military sexual trauma (54% vs 3%; P?<?0.001), along with lower levels of combat exposure (10.00 vs 16.85, P?<?0.001). Gender was found to be a moderator of the association of marital status, combat exposure, childhood interpersonal trauma, and family conflict with pain interference. It also moderated family conflict in the prediction of depressive symptoms. Conclusions Results underscore the potential importance of developing and testing gender specific models of chronic pain that consider the relative roles of trauma, social support, and family conflict.
