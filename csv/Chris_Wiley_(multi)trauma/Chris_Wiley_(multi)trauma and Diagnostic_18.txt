AB  - Summary The authors present an assessment of the psychiatric status of adults by means of systematic questions. The chapter begins with general information about scales and schedules. A review of the field that focuses on the evolution of such methods over the past 50 years in different geographic locations, and different research and treatment settings is also included. Special focus is given to the time, place, and purpose of instruments developed for adult psychiatry. An overview of reliability and validity is followed by a discussion of controversial issues. The chapter concludes with unanswered questions and directions for future work.

AB  - Summary A 22-year-old Friesian gelding was presented with a history of chronic, nonresolving lameness localised to the right front foot. Radiographs showed a smoothly marginated circular lucent area with a rim of increased opacity adjacent to the solar canal of the distal phalanx. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a reversed V-shaped smoothly demarcated space-occupying mass causing invagination of the solar laminae towards the solar canal arch and deformity of the adjacent surface of the distal phalanx. The mass was removed surgically and submitted for histopathology, which revealed a keratoma and periosteal fibrosis. Six weeks post-surgery the horse returned to the previous work level and 8 months follow-up showed no recurrence of keratoma. This report highlights the usefulness of MRI as a diagnostic modality for solar keratoma.

AB  - Abstract Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a traumatic childbirth. Objective To test if providing psychological self-help materials would significantly lower the incidence of PTSD at 6-12 weeks postnatally. Design Open label, randomised controlled trial, blinded outcome assessment. Setting Community midwifery services in two North West NHS Trusts. Sample 2419 women receiving usual NHS postnatal care. Methods Midwives screened women for traumatic birth experience. 678 women who screened positive (28.1%) were randomly allocated to self-help with usual care (n=336) or usual care alone (n=342). Self-help materials, were a leaflet and on-line film designed to prevent the development of PTSD after trauma exposure through how to manage early psychological responses. Main Outcome Measure The primary outcome was a composite of diagnostic and sub-diagnostic PTSD at 6-12 weeks postnatally using the gold standard Clinician Administered PTSD Interview (CAPS-5). Results 478 of 678 (70.5%) correctly randomised women and 9 randomised in error were followed up. Diagnostic or sub-diagnostic PTSD rates at follow-up did not differ between groups who received self-help (26.7%, 65/243) or usual care alone (26.2%, 64/244) (ITT analysis: relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.53). Findings remained consistent in the per protocol analysis (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.27). Women viewed the materials very positively. There were no adverse effects. Health economic micro-costing indicated implementation would be very low cost. Conclusions Many women experience a traumatic birth and risk developing PTSD, but self-help strategies without professional support are insufficient and should not be routinely introduced.

AB  - Background: Data on the incidence and significance of catheter-induced trauma to fast and slow pathways are scarce. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence, predictors, and clinical implications of inadvertent catheter-induced mechanical trauma to fast and slow pathways during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT). Methods: A total of 901 consecutive patients (aged 9?92 years old) with inducible sustained AVNRT underwent RFA of the slow pathway. All procedures were closely monitored for appearance of catheter-induced mechanical block of fast or slow pathways. Results: Catheter-induced mechanical trauma to fast and/or slow pathways was observed in 121 (13.4%) patients: 86 (71%) patients had trauma of the fast pathway, three (2.4%) had trauma of the slow pathway, and 32 (26.4%) had trauma of both pathways. Mechanical trauma lasted <1 minute in 87 (72%) patients, 1?30 minutes in 23 (19%) and >30 minutes in 11 (9%). A significantly increased procedure discontinuation rate was observed in patients with mechanical trauma as compared to those with no trauma (P < 0.0001). Young patient age (<35) was a strong predictor for the occurrence of mechanical trauma to AV nodal pathways. No significant difference between the trauma and non-trauma groups was found in respect to the number of catheters used during the procedure, the incidence of AV block, and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. Conclusions: Mechanical trauma to fast and slow pathways during ablation of AVNRT is more common than previously recognized, occurring especially in patients aged <35 years.

AB  - Background Middle turbinate edema could be a characteristic feature of aeroallergen sensitization. In this study we sought to determine the diagnostic characteristics of middle turbinate edema as a marker of inhalant allergy. Methods A cross-sectional diagnostic study was performed on patients who had undergone nasal endoscopy and allergy testing. Allergy status was determined by positive serology or epicutaneous testing. Endoscopy was reviewed by blinded assessors for middle turbinate head edema. Appearance was graded as either normal, focal, multifocal, diffuse, or polypoid edema. Receiver-operator (ROC) analysis, likelihood ratio (LR), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were determined. Results One hundred eighty-seven patients representing 304 nasal cavities were assessed (42% female, age 39.74 ± 14.7 years, 57% allergic). Diffuse edema (PPV 91.7%/LR = 8) and polypoid edema (PPV 88.9%/LR = 6.2) demonstrated the strongest association with inhalant allergy. Multifocal edema was used as a cut-off to represent inhalant allergy from ROC analysis, which demonstrated 94.7% specificity and 23.4% sensitivity. The PPV for multifocal was 85.1% and LR = 4.4. Conclusion Middle turbinate edema is a useful nasal endoscopic feature to predict presence of inhalant allergy and, although not sensitive, has excellent PPV.

AB  - Abstract Of all patients in a hospital environment, trauma patients may be particularly at risk for developing (device-related) pressure ulcers (PUs), because of their traumatic injuries, immobility, and exposure to immobilizing and medical devices. Studies on device-related PUs are scarce. With this study, the incidence and characteristics of PUs and the proportion of PUs that are related to devices in adult trauma patients with suspected spinal injury were described. From January?December 2013, 254 trauma patients were visited every 2 days for skin assessment. The overall incidence of PUs was 28·3% (n = 72/254 patients). The incidence of device-related PUs was 20·1% (n = 51), and 13% (n = 33) developed solely device-related PUs. We observed 145 PUs in total of which 60·7% were related to devices (88/145). Device-related PUs were detected 16 different locations on the front and back of the body. These results show that the incidence of PUs and the proportion of device-related PUs is very high in trauma patients.

Mortality is high because of the severe subsequent relevant complications caused by the fistula. Here we report five cases of gastric stump-pleural fistula diagnosed by air perfusion radiography under digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DSA air perfusion radiography provides a reliable basis for the development of clinical programmes; it is a simple method which does not involve any pain or trauma to the patient.

AB  - The role of the nurse within the multi-professional rehabilitation team Aim of the study/paper.?To identify the contribution of the nurse within the multi-professional rehabilitation team. Background.?The requirement for nurses to work effectively within the multi-professional rehabilitation team is increasingly important with the higher incidence of chronic disease, growing numbers of older people and enhanced survival from major trauma. Methods.?A 2-year qualitative investigation was undertaken centred on three contrasting condition case studies (fractured neck of femur, rheumatoid arthritis and stroke). Clients were theoretically sampled, with their ?rehabilitation pathway? through different services providing the window through which the nurse?s contribution was explored. Multiple methods and points of data collection were used, including observation, face to face interviews (clients, carers and staff) and record review. To enhance generalisability, a series of national expert workshops were undertaken with four groups: users, carers and carers? organizations; nurses; members of the multi-professional team; and educationalists. Findings.?Six interlinked roles for the nurse were identified: assessment, co-ordination and communication, technical and physical care, therapy integration and therapy carry-on, emotional support, and involving the family. Of particular significance is the creation of a supportive environment for rehabilitation to occur. Some nurses undertook aspects of all of these roles at any one time while others were only involved in one or two areas. While nurses expressed a desire to integrate therapy into their care delivery, the actual achievement of this goal was variable. Conclusions.?Key elements of the nurse?s contribution within rehabilitation should aim to maximize client choice to enhance independent living in the client?s future environment. At a nursing educational policy level the nurse needs to have a full understanding of the principles and models of rehabilitation. At a practice level, the nurse?s role must be valued and recognized, by nurses themselves and other team members.

AB  - Abstract Tissue diagnosis of a soft tissue neoplasm is of paramount importance for the development of an appropriate treatment plan. Biopsy technique including approach and biopsy method is important to the success of diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Histologic and cytologic diagnoses are difficult and complicated by the large number of soft tissue lesions described, distinctly different biopotential for morphologically similar lesions, often small biopsy specimen size, and the generally limited experience many pathologists have in the diagnosis of soft tissue neoplasms. While utilized less frequently than core-needle biopsies, fine-needle aspiration is a valuable initial approach for the classification of soft tissue neoplasms. The combination of pattern based morphologic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostics represents a utilitarian and generally successful approach for the diagnosis of soft tissue lesions.

AB  - This paper addresses the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of increased probing depths. In general, in untreated and treated patients, when deep and shallow probing depths are compared, the data indicate that deep sites are associated with increased bleeding upon probing, elevated subgingival temperatures, higher levels of pathogens, more probing errors, a greater amount of infiltrated connective tissue, reduced ability to remove subgingival deposits with root planing, and diminished effectiveness of oral hygiene to alter the subgingival microbiota. Clinical trials demonstrate that probing depth is not a good predictor of future disease progression. However, deep sites are at greater risk of disease progression than shallow sites in untreated and treated patients. Furthermore, the deeper the probing depth, the greater the risk of future disease progression. Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates that it is advantageous, but not always necessary, for patients to have shallow probing depths. With regards to surgical reduction of probing depths beyond that attained with non-surgical therapy, clinicians need to consider the advantages (e.g., ease of maintenance, reduced risk of disease progression) and disadvantages (e.g., root sensitivity, cosmetic defects) of treatment procedures. Since numerous variables require consideration (e.g., response to root planing, goals of therapy, acceptable level of risk for future disease progression), treatment decisions will vary depending on the patient and the desired clinical outcome at specific sites.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Dental trauma in school populations has a high frequency and school teachers are often close to the place where such injuries occur. However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia. Materials and Methods A multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management. Results The response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers? education level. Conclusions The knowledge of school teachers in Colombia about emergency dental trauma management is inadequate. The findings strongly suggest a need for an education strategy with the involvement of the government, dentistry schools and private organizations.

AB  - Prompt and accurate diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias can play a crucial role in ensuring appropriate counseling and management (both antenatal and postnatal). When a skeletal dysplasia is detected during the antenatal period, especially early in the pregnancy, it can be associated with a poor prognosis. It is important to make a diagnosis in antenatal presentation of skeletal dysplasias to inform diagnosis, predict prognosis, provide accurate recurrence risks, and options for prenatal genetic testing in future pregnancies. Prenatal ultrasound scanning is a useful tool to detect several skeletal dysplasias and sonographic measurements serve as reliable indicators of lethality. The lethality depends on various factors including gestational age at which features are identified, size of the chest and progression of malformations. Although, it is important to type the skeletal presentation as accurately as possible, this is not always possible in an antenatal presentation and it is important to acknowledge this uncertainty. In the case of a live birth, it is always important to reassess the infant. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by fragile bones. Here, we report an infant with severe OI born following a twin pregnancy in whom the bone disease is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic mutation, c.4160C >T, p.(Ala1387Val) located in the C-propeptide region of COL1A1. An assumption of lethality antenatally complicated his management in early life. We discuss this patient with particular emphasis on the neonatal presentation of a severe skeletal dysplasia and the lessons that may be learned in such situations. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes to bed configuration and patient mix on nurses? workload in a single ward. Design Multi-method case study. Method The study was undertaken in an acute 28-bed ward in a tertiary referral public hospital in Queensland, Australia. Ward-level administrative data were obtained for a 2-year period, 12 months before bed configuration changes in October 2015 and 12 months after. These data included patient activity (bed occupancy, transfers, length of stay and casemix) and nurse staffing (budgeted and actual staffing levels, employment status and skillmix). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ward nurses (N = 17) to explore the impact of the bed configuration changes on their workload. Results Administrative data showed that the bed configuration changes resulted in more complex and dependent patients, increased patient transfers and greater variability in casemix. The interview data found these changes to patient complexity and activity intensified workloads, which were further increased by staffing decisions that resulted in greater reliance on temporary staff. Conclusion Hospitals already possess the data and expert knowledge needed to improve staffing and bed management decisions without the need for additional, costly workload systems. Impact Determining appropriate nurse staffing in light of the complexities and variation of patient needs at the ward level remains a challenge. This study identified increases in patient complexity, dependency, variability and churn that increased workload. Staffing grew but hidden factors associated with temporary staffing and skillmix further intensified nurses? workload. Harnessing existing data and the expertise and experience of nursing unit managers (NUMs) would help staff wards more efficiently and effectively, providing reasonable workloads and appropriate skillmix that can enhance the safety and quality of patient care. To facilitate this, NUMs need access to accurate, timely, data and authority in staffing and bed management decisions.

AB  - Summary In the current study, we investigated whether suppression can produce an amplified memory for a traumatic experience. Participants viewed a distressing film depicting a multi-fatality car accident. We broke the film down into several short clips, some of which were removed. After viewing the film, we instructed participants to (i) suppress and monitor film-related thoughts, (ii) think freely and monitor film-related thoughts or (iii) just think freely. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a recognition test. Memory distortion was comparable across conditions; however, suppression and monitoring of trauma-related thoughts removed the typical bias to falsely remember the most critical and traumatic clips of the film over the least critical clips. Our data suggest that suppression may be effective in reducing trauma-related cognitions and, therefore, does not predict a more ?amplified? memory for trauma. Instead, suppression and thought monitoring encourage an unbiased, although inaccurate, memory for trauma.Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Method Overall, 165 Danish psychiatric outpatients answered the International Trauma Questionnaire, the Life Event Checklist, and the World Health Organization Well-being Index. ICD-10 diagnoses were extracted from the hospital record. Chi-square analysis, t-tests, and conditional probability analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results Nearly all patients (94%) had experienced at least one traumatic event. CPTSD (36%) was more common than PTSD (8%) and had considerable overlap with ICD-10 affective, anxiety, PTSD, personality, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. ICD-11 PTSD overlapped with ICD-10 anxiety, PTSD, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. A subgroup of patients with ICD-10 PTSD (23 %) did not meet criteria for ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. Conclusion Traumatic experiences are common. ICD-11 CPTSD is a highly prevalent disorder in psychiatric outpatients. One quarter with ICD-10 PTSD did not meet criteria for either ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. PTSD and CPTSD had considerable overlap with ICD-10 disorders.

AB  - Abstract Objective Although trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been applied worldwide, the nature of how these Western-based interventions are applied in diverse settings has varied. This paper systematically reviewed the literature on how trauma-focused CBTs have been applied and adapted cross-culturally. Method A systematic review of studies that discuss the process of cultural adaptation of trauma-focused CBTs. Results Seventeen papers were included and varied in the comprehensiveness of the adaptation process. Two studies stated that a theoretical framework was followed. Almost one-third of the studies did not report whether local stakeholders were involved in the process of application. Fifteen studies examined the efficacy of the adaptations and the results were positive, but the methodology and quality varied. Conclusion There are inconsistencies in how trauma-focused CBTs are culturally adapted. A systematic approach to the transportation of such therapies would enable greater investigation into the necessity and efficacy of such adaptations.

AB  - Background It is unknown how traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One potential mechanism is via alteration of fear-learning processes that could affect responses to trauma memories and cues. We utilized a prospective, longitudinal design to determine if TBI is associated with altered fear learning and extinction, and if fear processing mediates effects of TBI on PTSD symptom change. Methods Eight hundred fifty two active-duty Marines and Navy Corpsmen were assessed before and after deployment. Assessments included TBI history, PTSD symptoms, combat trauma and deployment stress, and a fear-potentiated startle task of fear acquisition and extinction. Startle response and self-reported expectancy and anxiety served as measures of fear conditioning, and PTSD symptoms were measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Results Individuals endorsing ?multiple hit? exposure (both deployment TBI and a prior TBI) showed the strongest fear acquisition and highest fear expression compared to groups without multiple hits. Extinction did not differ across groups. Endorsing a deployment TBI was associated with higher anxiety to the fear cue compared to those without deployment TBI. The association of deployment TBI with increased postdeployment PTSD symptoms was mediated by postdeployment fear expression when recent prior-TBI exposure was included as a moderator. TBI associations with increased response to threat cues and PTSD symptoms remained when controlling for deployment trauma and postdeployment PTSD diagnosis. Conclusions Deployment TBI, and multiple-hit TBI in particular, are associated with increases in conditioned fear learning and expression that may contribute to risk for developing PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: We present a protocol for the non-invasive angiographic assessment of the arterial and venous cerebrovascular (CV) system by multi-slice CT. Material and Methods: Data acquisition was performed in a multi-slice CT scanner with a scan range from the carotid bifurcation to the vertex and manual scan start following i.v. administration of 120 ml iodinated contrast medium with a flow rate of 4 ml/s. This protocol was applied in 12 patients with symptoms of acute CV insuffiency. Results: In all patients, comprehensive imaging of the arteriovenous CV system was achieved including the common carotid bifurcation, the third segment of the major cerebral arteries, the dural sinus and the internal cerebral veins. Various CV pathologies, such as a territorial artery occlusion, a thrombotic obstruction of the internal carotid artery, an intracranial arteriovenous malformation and a sinus vein thrombosis, were successfully evaluated. Conclusion: Comprehensive assessment of the arteriovenous CV system is possible by the use of a single-bolus, monophasic multi-slice scan technique.

AB  - With the improved accessibility to ultrasound, fine needle aspiration of abdominal organs is now performed frequently in many veterinary practices. Despite this, there are many ?unknowns? as to the best method to produce a high-quality sample. This report begins by highlighting recent literature on the risks and benefits of abdominal fine needle aspiration. It follows with recommendations about the equipment and method best suited to the procedure, including needle and syringe size and aspiration versus non-aspiration techniques. Various smear preparations and laboratory submission requirements are also discussed. The final aspect of the review more specifically discusses fine needle aspiration of specific abdominal organs: the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, prostate and abdominal lymph nodes.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.
