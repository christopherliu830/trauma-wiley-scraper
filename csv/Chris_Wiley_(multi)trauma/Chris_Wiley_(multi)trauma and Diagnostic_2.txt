AB  - Summary This chapter provides an insight into the team approach and diverse roles that are apparent within orthopaedic and musculoskeletal trauma care. An overview of establishing a case for nurse-led services within the specialty is also presented. Care across the continuum is provided by a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals who are able to convey benefits such as continuity of care and formulate a comprehensive, holistic view of the patient's needs. In addition the multi-disciplinary team ensures the availability of a range of skills, support and education for the patient, patient's family/carer.

AB  - Abstract A clinical reappraisal study was carried out in conjunction with the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) All-Army Study (AAS) to evaluate concordance of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Screening Scales (CIDI-SC) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist (PCL) with diagnoses based on independent clinical reappraisal interviews (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [SCID]). Diagnoses included: lifetime mania/hypomania, panic disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder; six-month adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and 30-day major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and substance (alcohol or drug) use disorder (abuse or dependence). The sample (n?=?460) was weighted for over-sampling CIDI-SC/PCL screened positives. Diagnostic thresholds were set to equalize false positives and false negatives. Good individual-level concordance was found between CIDI-SC/PCL and SCID diagnoses at these thresholds (area under curve [AUC]?=?0.69?0.79). AUC was considerably higher for continuous than dichotomous screening scale scores (AUC?=?0.80?0.90), arguing for substantive analyses using not only dichotomous case designations but also continuous measures of predicted probabilities of clinical diagnoses.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study In order for changes in lameness to be accurately and repeatably detected and recorded during diagnostic investigations, an objective measure of lameness is required. Objectives To ascertain whether an inertial sensor-based system can distinguish between a positive and negative response to diagnostic anaesthesia of the foot and objectively assess the effect of a positive response on the trot. Study design Restrospective clinical study. Methods Data obtained during lameness investigations undertaken between August 2011 and December 2012 in which either a palmar digital or abaxial sesamoid nerve block was performed were retrospectively reviewed. Response to diagnostic anaesthesia was categorised as positive (n = 14) or negative (n = 9) by one of 2 evaluators before analysis of kinematic data (i.e. blinded). Changes in maximum and minimum head difference (?HDMax and ?HDMin) and change in head movement asymmetry/change in pelvic movement asymmetry (?HMA/PMA, measure of asymmetry) allocated to each limb were calculated. A Kruskal?Wallis one way analysis of variance on ranks was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for ?HDMax, ?HDMin and ?HMA for the blocked limb to identify cut-off values to distinguish positive and negative responses to the block. Results Median ?HDMax and ?HDMin were significantly greater after a positive response to diagnostic anaesthesia (P<0.01). Change in head movement asymmetry allocated to the blocked limb and contralateral forelimb and ?PMA allocated to the contralateral hindlimb were significantly greater in the positive response group (P<0.05). Change in head movement asymmetry allocated to the blocked limb and ?HDMax and ?HDMin are useful diagnostic tests for identifying positive response to anaesthesia (area under the curve = 0.98, 0.83 and 0.96 respectively). Conclusions An inertial sensor-based system can identify a positive response to diagnostic anaesthesia of the foot. Symmetry of movement allocated to the blocked limb, contralateral forelimb and contralateral hindlimb significantly improve, and head movement significantly decreases in horses with a positive response to the block. Cut-off values for a positive response have been identified with good sensitivity and specificity. Forelimb lameness significantly affects contralateral hindlimb movement, which has implications for the investigation of multi-limb lameness.

AB  - Objective. To reevaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography for detecting and classifying solid-organ injuries from blunt abdominal trauma by comparing ultrasonography with computed tomography (CT) and laparotomy. Methods. Six hundred four patients with blunt abdominal trauma were examined by both B-mode ultrasonography and CT for a study period of 14 years. The ultrasonographic examiners were divided into 2 groups depending on their experience with ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic results were then compared with CT and surgical findings. This was a retrospective study. Results. In 198 patients, solid-organ injuries were identified on CT, laparotomy, or both. Sensitivity values in group A (experts) were 87.5% for hepatic injuries, 85.4% for splenic injuries, 77.6% for renal injuries, and 44.4% for pancreatic injuries. Sensitivity values in group B were 46.2% for hepatic injuries, 50.0% for splenic injuries, and 44.1% for renal injuries. The detection rates in group A were 80% to 100% for different types of hepatic injuries except superficial injuries (20%) and 70% to 100% for different types of splenic injuries. The detection rates for renal parenchymal and pancreatic duct injuries were 53.3% and 80%, respectively. The detection rates for injuries requiring intervention were 86.1% in group A and 66.7% in group B. Conclusions. The sensitivity of ultrasonography with the use of CT and surgical findings as reference standards decreased compared with our prior study. However, ultrasonography was found to enable experienced examiners to detect and classify parenchymal injuries efficiently, despite disadvantages in detecting superficial and vascular injuries. Ultrasonography should be used to explore not only free fluid but also solid-organ injuries.

AB  - Rather than assuming that psychological terms mirror natural categories in the world and that the task of the helping professions is to find ways to discover, diagnose and treat these categories, our goal is to inquire about the status of the categories as an aid to then focusing on therapeutic responses. To that end, we unsettle trauma by exploring its social ontology as a disorder as well as its grammar. Feminist and cultural critiques of PTSD illustrate the limitations of the dominant discourse of trauma, moving trauma from individual pathology to social pathology. We offer two illustrations from the family therapy literature that draw upon polyphony, inner dialogues and the creation of new narratives to expand beyond the pathologising potentials of the discourse of trauma. Practitioner points Understanding the concept of trauma as a socially embedded construction is a necessary first step towards recognising its different applications in therapeutic work The dialogic/constructionist stance taken here assumes that meaning and understanding are shaped by discourse and interaction The taken-for-granted meanings associated with trauma need to be questioned Practitioners may then assess when the use of a PTSD diagnosis might import individualising and objectifying assumptions that undermine the goals of systemic family therapy

AB  - Background Limited data Exists ? on the Australian epidemiology of renal trauma, with very few studies published in the literature. The authors aim to detail the trends of renal trauma in the coastal city of the Gold Coast. Methods Retrospective data collection yielded 81 patients who sustained renal trauma from our 3-year period. Data included information on demographics, mechanism, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade, presence of haematuria, associated injuries, management, and complications. Results Male patients accounted for 83% (n = 67) of cases, and the average age of all injuries was 36 years. Low-grade AAST Grade I?III injuries comprised of 76% (n = 62) of injuries, AAST Grade IV contributed to 20% (n = 16) and 4% (n = 3) of injuries were AAST Grade V. The most common mechanism of injury was road accidents accounting for 35% (n = 28) followed by fall-related injuries (26%, n = 21). Other mechanisms included sport-related (13.5%, n = 11), non-motorized bicycle injuries (8.5%, n = 7), alleged assault (8.5%, n = 7), pedestrian injuries (5%, n = 4) and horse-related injuries (2%, n = 2). Ninety-six percent (n = 78) of kidney injuries were managed conservatively. Of the patients requiring intervention, all were AAST Grade V kidney injuries. Conclusion Males accounted for the majority of renal trauma cases, similar to the 3:1 ratio of male-to-female injuries found in other studies. In line with other studies, renal trauma reviewed on the Gold Coast also revealed road trauma as the leading cause, closely followed by falls. The majority of high-grade renal trauma was managed conservatively.

AB  - Abstract??? Traumatized teeth present a clinical challenge with regard to their diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis. Recent developments in imaging systems have enabled clinicians to visualize structural changes effectively. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cone beam computed tomography are among the most commonly used systems for dental and maxillofacial surgery. The purpose of this review is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and the clinical application for dento-alveolar trauma. Three clinical cases are described to illustrate the potential use of the NewTom 3G for diagnosis and treatment plan of dento-alveolar traumatic injuries.

AB  - Summary Innovative efforts have been made in the past two decades to introduce cultural considerations in psychiatric diagnostic systems. Most prominent in this respect has been the culture presence in DSM-IV and DSM-5, particularly in terms of cultural considerations for major forms of psychopathology, cultural concepts of distress, and a cultural formulation. Less substantial concerning culture has been the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) classification of mental disorders. Among evolving innovative diagnostic systems, the WPA International Guidelines for Diagnostic Assessment (IGDA) introduced the combination of standardized multiaxial and personalized idiographic formulations, while also attending to cultural issues. Person-centered integrative Diagnosis (PID) is aimed at diagnosing not only illness but also positive health through the assessment of health status, health contributors, and health experience, and thus attempts to bring culture into the core of the diagnostic process.

AB  - Abstract Research findings have documented a relationship between the number of types of traumatic events to which refugees were exposed and psychological disorders. It is unclear, however, if gender moderates the impact of trauma on refugee mental health. The participants in this study were 60 male and 31 female refugees and asylum-seekers resettled in Australia. Participants had a mean age of 34.54 years (SD = 9.70), and were from a variety of countries including Iraq, Iran, and Sri Lanka. We conducted a multigroup path analysis to test if the relationship between psychological outcomes of exposure to trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression) was different as a function of the type of traumatic exposure (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) or as a function of gender. We found a significant relationship between interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (? = .77) and anxiety symptoms (? = .32) in women, and a significant association between noninterpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (? = .59), anxiety (? =.49), and depression symptoms (? = .32) in men. For men, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = 0.14 to 1.01; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = ?0.53 to 0.43. For women, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = ?0.79 to 0.67; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = ?0.09 to 1.46. These results suggested supporting refugees in their efforts to overcome the psychological impact of trauma, including the allocation of resources in clinical services to support the psychological recovery of refugees.

AB  - ABSTRACT We examined how diverse and cumulated traumatic experiences predicted maternal prenatal mental health and infant stress regulation in war conditions and whether maternal mental health mediated the association between trauma and infant stress regulation. Participants were 511 Palestinian mothers from the Gaza Strip who reported exposure to current war trauma (WT), past childhood emotional (CEA) and physical abuse, socioeconomic status (SES), prenatal mental health problems (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms), and perceived stress during their secondtrimester of pregnancy as well as infant stress regulation at 4 months. While all trauma types were associated with high levels of prenatal symptoms, CEA had the most wide-ranging effects and was uniquely associated with depression symptoms. Concerning infant stress regulation, mothers? CEA predicted negative affectivity, but only among mothers with low WT. Against hypothesis, the effects of maternal trauma on infant stress regulation were not mediated by mental health symptoms. Mothers? higher SES was associated with better infant stress regulation whereas infant prematurity and male sex predisposed for difficulties. Our findings suggest that maternal childhood abuse, especially CEA, should be a central treatment target among war-exposed families. Cumulated psychosocial stressors might increase the risk for transgenerational problems.

AB  - Abstract Introduction In 2018, ARPANSA published updated national DRLs for adult CT, which were first published in 2012, and augmented the national DRL categories. This paper presents the updated national DRLs and describes the process by which they were produced. Methods Examine patient survey data submitted to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) National Diagnostic Reference Level Service (NDRLS). Determine the quartiles of the distributions of median survey dose metrics with categorisation by procedure type. Engage a liaison panel representing the radiology professions to review procedure categories and recommend revised national DRLs. The revised NDRL procedure categories are: head (non-contrast brain (trauma/headache)), cervical spine (Non-contrast (trauma)), soft-tissue neck (post-contrast (oncology)), chest (post-contrast (oncology)), abdomen?pelvis (post-contrast (oncology)), kidney?ureter?bladder (non-contrast (suspected renal colic)), chest?abdomen?pelvis (post-contrast (oncology)) and lumbar spine (non-contrast (degenerative pain)). Results The existing six procedure categories were revised and refined. Updated Australian national diagnostic reference levels for adult CT were recommended and endorsed for eight procedure categories: head (52 mGy/880 mGycm), cervical spine (23 mGy/470 mGycm),soft-tissue neck (17 mGy/450 mGycm), chest (10 mGy/390 mGycm), abdomen?pelvis (13 mGy/600 mGycm), kidney?ureter?bladder (13 mGy/600 mGycm), chest?abdomen?pelvis (11 mGy/940 mGycm) and lumbar spine (26 mGy/670 mGycm). The updated national DRLs are between 12 and 26% lower than the previous DRLs for dose-length product and between 13 and 63% lower for volume computed tomography dose index. Conclusions Australian national DRLs for adult CT have been reviewed and revised. The revised national DRLs are lower, better reflecting current practice among imaging facilities in Australia. The revised Australian national DRLs are similar to those in other developed countries.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a complex entity, which can involve persistence of the symptoms, conversion to dementia or improvement. The aim was to study the transitions between normal cognitive ageing and three MCI subtypes by using Markov transition models for different intervals between baseline and the follow-up assessment. Methods A total of 294 participants over 50?years old attending primary care centres were assessed and diagnosed at baseline as multi-domain amnestic MCI (22 participants), single domain amnestic MCI (44), non-amnestic MCI (non-amnestic MCI) (26) or controls (202). We adopted an overlapping interval strategy by constructing six different mid-point time intervals according to the time between the baseline and the follow-up assessment. We used Markov transition models to study diagnostic changes in the groups in the different time intervals Results The rate of change was lowest in the control group. In the single domain amnestic MCI and non-amnestic MCI groups, the same diagnosis was usually retained or changed to normal cognitive functioning. In the multi-domain amnestic MCI group, the rate of transition to normal functioning was lowest, and the conversion to dementia was the highest of all groups. The best fit to the Markov models was found for the period between 18?21?months, whereas the worst fit was for the period between 9?15?months Conclusions Markov models provide a comprehensive view of transitions between MCI and normal cognitive functioning. Time interval strategies seem to provide a good opportunity to monitor diagnostic transitions, although wider intervals including subsequent assessments are needed. The low rates of conversion to dementia are discussed. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Interest in trauma-informed approaches has grown substantially. These approaches are characterized by integrating understanding of trauma throughout a program, organization, or system to enhance the quality, effectiveness, and delivery of services provided to individuals and groups. However, variation in definitions of trauma-informed approaches, coupled with underdeveloped research on measurement, poses challenges for evaluating the effectiveness of models designed to support a trauma-informed approach. This systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature identified 49 systems-based measures that were created to assess the extent to which relational, organizational, and community/system practices were trauma-informed. Measures were included if they assessed at least one component of a trauma-informed approach, were not screening or diagnostic instruments, were standardized, were relevant to practices addressing the psychological impacts of trauma, were printed in English, and were published between 1988 and 2018. Most (77.6%) measures assessed organizational-level staff and climate characteristics. There remain several challenges to this emerging field, including inconsistently reported psychometric data, redundancy across measures, insufficient evidence of a link to stakeholder outcomes, and limited information about measurement development processes. We discuss these opportunities and challenges and their implications for future research and practice.

AB  - Summary Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Genitourinary tract injuries are rare, accounting for <3% of trauma cases. The majority of these injuries are due to blunt trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. In developed countries, iatrogenic injuries are especially prominent in the neonatal period whilst school-age children are prone to sports-related injuries, kicks and straddle injuries. Recent literature regarding pediatric genital trauma has focused on identifying and treating sexual abuse injuries as well as distinguishing these injuries from accidental trauma. This chapter reviews common etiologies for traumatic genital injuries and evaluate current diagnostic and treatment options. Risk factors, presenting signs and the evaluation of sexual abuse will also be reviewed.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques in the diagnosis of arterial root lesions (ARL) in order to improve the understanding and diagnostic accuracy of ARL. We retrospectively analyzed the MSCT imaging findings of 1546 patients. MSCT parameters included the aortic valve annulus level, sinuses of Valsalva level, a sinotubular junction level, ascending aorta, effective diameter, aortic wall thickness, coronary artery height, and coronary sinus depth. The specific measurement method used was curved planar reformation. MSCT found 93 cases of aortic valve disease (AVD). The diagnostic accuracy of MSCT for AVD was 91.7% (33/36). MSCT found 95 cases of acute aortic syndrome involving the aortic root, 71 of which were Stanford type A-aortic dissection (AD), 22 cases of Stanford type A-interstitial hematoma (IHM), and two cases of penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU). MSCT diagnosed Stanford type A-AD, Stanford type A-IHM, and PAU had a specificity of 99.8% and a sensitivity of 98.9%. In conclusion, MSCT enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques can accurately display the aortic root and adjacent structures, with clear positioning and high diagnostic accuracy, which can provide important basis for clinical diagnosis, preoperative localization, and postoperative follow-up.

AB  - Objective To review the literature and make practical recommendations regarding the conservative management of renal trauma. Patients and Methods Relevant articles and guidelines published between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed. Graded recommendations were constructed by a multi-disciplinary panel consisting of urologists, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. These recommendations underwent formal review and debate at the Western Australian USANZ 2013 state conference, and were presented at the USANZ 2014 annual scientific meeting. Results The literature on the conservative management of renal trauma is reviewed within the framework of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury severity scale. Graded recommendations are made regarding several key topics including: imaging, inpatient management, antibiotics, return to activity, and follow-up. Grade IV injuries and intraoperative consults are examined separately in view of the difficulties these groups cause in making appropriate treatment decisions. Conclusion A practical clinical guideline is provided regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.
