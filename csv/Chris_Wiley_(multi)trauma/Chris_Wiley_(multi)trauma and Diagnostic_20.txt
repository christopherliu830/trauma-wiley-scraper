AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among children in Maryland and to examine factors that influence hospital admission. Methods: Statewide mortality, hospital discharge, and ambulatory care data were used to identify all TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occurred in 1998 to children aged 0-19 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's standard case definition and protocol. Inpatient admission was modeled as a function of patient, injury, and hospital characteristics. Results: The overall incidence of pediatric TBI (i.e., ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths) in 1998 was 670/100,000. After controlling for injury severity and other factors, uninsured children were 40% less likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 0.43 to 0.82) and children with Medicaid were 90% more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 1.42 to 2.54) than were those with private insurance. The presence of a major associated injury significantly influenced the likelihood of hospitalization, especially among children with a minor (OR = 8.8) to moderate (OR = 11.6) TBI. Children who presented to a trauma center hospital were significantly more likely to be hospitalized than children treated at a non-trauma center hospital, although this varied depending on income (OR = 1.8 for high versus low) and hospital volume (OR = 2.6 for a small hospital and OR = 29.0 for a large hospital). Conclusions: After adjusting for TBI severity and the presence of associated injuries, significant differences in hospitalization rates may exist among different patient subgroups and hospitals for children who sustain TBIs.

AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.

AB  - Objective:? This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a four-session, caregiver?child Intervention, the Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI), to prevent the development of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) provided within 30 days of exposure to a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Method:? One-hundred seventy-six 7 to 17-year-old youth were recruited through telephone screening based on report of one new distressing posttraumatic stress symptom after a PTE. Of those, 106 youth were randomly assigned to the Intervention (n = 53) or a four-session supportive Comparison condition (N = 53). Group differences in symptom severity were assessed using repeated measures with mixed effects models of intervention group, time, and the interaction of intervention and time. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess treatment condition and any subsequent traumas experienced as predictors for full and partial PTSD diagnosis at 3-month follow-up. An exploratory chi-square analysis was performed to examine the differences in PTSD symptom criteria B, C, and D at follow-up. Results:? At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, past trauma exposures and symptom severity. At follow-up, the Intervention group demonstrated significantly fewer full and partial PTSD diagnoses than the Comparison group on a standardized diagnostic measure of PTSD. Also, there was a significant group by time interaction for Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children?s Posttraumatic Stress and Anxiety Indices as the CFTSI group had significantly lower posttraumatic and anxiety scores than the Comparison group. Conclusions:? The results suggest that a caregiver?youth, brief preventative early intervention for youth exposed to a PTE is a promising approach to preventing chronic PTSD.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated 1) trauma symptom changes following the implementation of a life skills intervention; 2) the relationship between demographic characteristics, cognitive functioning, life skill knowledge and changes in trauma symptoms; and 3) predictive factors of trauma symptoms during housing transitions. Participants (N?=?72) enrolled in intervention modules to increase residential stability (room and self-care, money management, nutrition management or safe community participation), completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, ACLS-2000 and a Practical Skills Test at baseline, post-intervention and 3 and 6 months later to examine differences in trauma symptoms and treatment outcomes. Trauma symptoms were highest at baseline and decreased significantly for most participants over time. For a subgroup of females experiencing abuse and individuals who were homeless less than 1 year, there was an increase in symptoms at 3 months post-intervention (highest rate of housing transition). This small convenience sample represents a limited geographic area. Replication of the study with larger groups for generalization, and further investigation into the specific impact of symptoms on function were recommended for future research.

AB  - Purpose To examine imaging utilization in a matched cohort of patients with and without implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and to project magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilization over a 10-year period. Materials and Methods The Truven Health MarketScan Commercial claims and Medicare Supplemental health insurance claims data were used to identify patients with continuous health plan enrollment in 2009?2012. Patients with ICDs were identified using ICD-9 and CPT codes, and matched to patients with the same demographic and comorbidity profile, but no record of device implantation. Diagnostic imaging utilization was compared across the matched cohorts, in total, by imaging categories, and in subpopulations of stroke, back pain, and joint pain. MRI use in the nonimplant group over the 4-year period was extrapolated out to 10 years for ICD-indicated patients. Results A cohort of 18,770 matched patients were identified; average age 65.5?±?13.38 and 21.9% female. ICD patients had significantly less MRI imaging (0.23 0.70 SD vs. 0.00 0.08 SD, P?<?0.0001) than nonimplant patients. Among patients with records of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (ICD 5%, nonimplant 4%) and accompanying diagnostic imaging, 44% of nonimplant patients underwent MRI vs. 1% of ICD patients (P?<?0.0001). Forecast models estimated that 53% to 64% of ICD-eligible patients may require an MRI within 10 years. Conclusion MRI utilization is lower in ICD patients compared to nonimplant patients, yet the burden of incident stroke/TIA, back, and joint pain suggests an unmet need for MR-conditional devices. J.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Ultrasonography is associated with a high error rate in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. The purposes of this study were to examine the nature of the diagnostic errors and to identify areas in which reporting could be improved. Methods Patients who had soft tissue tumours and received ultrasonography during a 10-year period (1999?2009) were identified from a local tumour registry. The sonographic and pathological diagnoses were categorised as either ?benign? or ?non-benign?. The accuracy of ultrasonography was assessed by correlating the sonographic with the pathological diagnostic categories. Recommendations from radiologists, where offered, were assessed for their appropriateness in the context of the pathological diagnosis. Results One hundred seventy-five patients received ultrasonography, of which 60 had ?non-benign? lesions and 115 had ?benign? lesions. Ultrasonography correctly diagnosed 35 and incorrectly diagnosed seven of the 60 ?non-benign? cases, and did not suggest a diagnosis in 18 cases. Most of the diagnostic errors related to misdiagnosing soft tissue tumours as haematomas (four out of seven). Recommendations for further management were offered by the radiologists in 144 cases, of which 52 had ?non-benign? pathology. There were eight ?non-benign? cases where no recommendation was offered, and the sonographic diagnosis was either incorrect or unavailable. Conclusions Ultrasonography lacks accuracy in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. Ongoing education is required to improve awareness of the limitations with its use. These limitations should be highlighted to the referrers, especially those who do not have specific training in this area.

Two measures were created to understand the levels of aggression teachers report occurs in their classrooms and to understand how teachers interact with media related to school shootings. Both ISSM and ATT were associated with higher levels of STSS. Lockdown drills did not appear to interact with these relationships to either strengthen or weaken them. Considering the importance of teachers? well-being and how it influences their ability to be effective teachers, continued investigation is warranted.

AB  - Trauma research has identified a link between parental adjustment and children?s functioning and the sometimes ensuing intergenerational impact of traumatic events. The effects of traumatic events on children have been demonstrated to be mediated through their impact on children?s parents. However, until now, little consideration has been given to the separate and more proximal mechanism of parenting practices as potential mediators between children?s adjustment and traumatic events. To shed some light in this arena, we review literature on trauma, adversity, and resilience, and discuss how parenting practices may mediate trauma and adverse environmental contexts. Using a social interaction learning perspective (Forgatch  Patterson, 2005), we propose a prevention research framework to examine the role that parenting practices may play in influencing children?s adjustment in the wake of trauma exposure. The article concludes by providing a specific model and role for evidence-based parenting interventions for children exposed to mass trauma.

Imaging of histologically proven cases of desmoid tumours at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne were obtained via picture archiving communication system (PACS) and then assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Suitable imagings were obtained from PACS. All imaging chosen was de-identified. Desmoid tumours can occur in many areas of the body. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of these tumours and magnetic resonance imaging has been the gold standard for imaging and is the most accurate in terms of assessing tumour margins and involvement of surrounding structures.

AB  - Abstract Use of ceiling-mounted radiographic equipment in an emergency room for management of the multiply injured patient is described. The protocol of the Advanced Trauma and Life Support manual is followed and three plain radiographs (lateral cervical spine, anteroposterior views of the chest and pelvis) are obtained by the radiographers, who are members of the trauma team. Abnormalities were diagnosed on 7 per cent of the cervical radiographs, 31 per cent of the chest and 28 per cent of the pelvis in 108 patients during the first year of use. With full integration of the radiographers into the trauma team these three initial films are obtained within 10 min. Subsequent films can be taken of skeletal injuries found clinically or incidentally on the first three plain radiographs. It is recommended that all emergency rooms should have a ceiling-mounted radiographic unit with an automatic daylight processor to provide the best service for patients with major trauma.

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

AB  - Several very rare forms of dementia are associated with characteristic focal atrophy predominantly of the frontal and/or temporal lobes and currently lack imaging solutions to monitor disease. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) is a recently developed technique providing quantitative relaxivity maps and images with various tissue contrasts out of a single sequence acquisition. This pilot study explores the utility of MRF-based T1 and T2 mapping to discover focal differences in relaxation times between patients with frontotemporal lobe degenerative dementia and healthy controls. 8 patients and 30 healthy controls underwent a 3 T MRI including an axial 2D spoiled gradient echo MRF sequence. T1 and T2 relaxation maps were generated based on an extended phase graphs algorithm-founded dictionary involving inner product pattern matching. A region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of T1 and T2 relaxation times was performed with FSL and ITK-SNAP. Depending on the brain region analyzed, T1 relaxation times were up to 10.28% longer in patients than in controls reaching significant differences in cortical gray matter (P = .047) and global white matter (P = .023) as well as in both hippocampi (P = .001 left; P = .027 right). T2 relaxation times were similarly longer in the hippocampus by up to 19.18% in patients compared with controls. The clinically most affected patient had the most control-deviant relaxation times. There was a strong correlation of T1 relaxation time in the amygdala with duration of the clinically manifest disease (Spearman Rho = .94; P = .001) and of T1 relaxation times in the left hippocampus with disease severity (Rho = .90, P = .002). In conclusion, MRF-based relaxometry is a promising and time-saving new MRI tool to study focal cerebral alterations and identify patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration. To validate the results of this pilot study, MRF is worth further exploration as a diagnostic tool in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how photovoice action research (PVAR) aimed at addressing gender-based violence (GBV) also responds to trauma resulting from GBV. I conducted a content analysis of 17 publications that use PVAR to address GBV to assess for how the PVAR projects also treat trauma symptoms. Briere and Scott's (2015) philosophical approach to trauma therapy is the conceptual framework for data analysis. I developed a priori codes aligned with the philosophical approach and deductively applied them to the data: (a) intrinsic processing; (b) respect, positive regard, and compassion; (c) hope; and (d) the pain paradox. The results reveal how data from the 17 PVAR studies correspond with the 4 philosophical concepts. Practical and research recommendations include using and evaluating PVAR as a tool to treat trauma and contribute to trauma treatment research with underrepresented communities.

AB  - ABSTRACT Immediate loading of dental implants has become a widely reported practice with success rates ranging from 70.8% to 100%. Although most studies have considered implant survival to be the only measure of success, a better definition includes the long-term stability of the hard and soft tissues around the implant(s) and other adjacent structures, as well as the long-term stability of all the restorative components. The parameters identified in 1981 by Albrektsson and colleagues as influencing the establishment and maintenance of osseointegration have been reconsidered in relation to immediate loading to improve the chances of achieving such success. Two of the six parameters (status of the bone/implant site and implant loading conditions) have preoperative diagnostic implications, whereas three (implant design, surgical technique, and implant finish) may compensate for less-than-ideal site and loading conditions. Factors affecting the outcome of immediate loading are reviewed to assist clinicians attempting to assess its risks and benefits.

AB  - Abstract We address the comparison of results between two diagnostic tests applied multiple times to the same subjects. The estimand of interest is the sensitivity of the combined test (primary and adjunct) relative to a primary test. Analytical methods are first described that assume independence between the multiple observations within a subject. In order to account for the within-subject correlation introduced by the multiple measurements, analytical approaches for correlated, categorical response data are described. In the discussion of these methods, we pay particular attention to the presence of a structural zero which results from the decision rule for the combination of diagnostic tests. In a simulation study, we compare the finite sample performances of all analytical approaches in terms of confidence interval coverage rates and median lengths. Our methods are cast in the context of a diagnostic bronchoscopy technology for the detection of lung cancer. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract This article describes the process of planning and running a training course for multi-disciplinary professionals in the wake of a local child death inquiry. The factors which influenced the content and management of the training experience are discussed, in particular the trainers' determination to encourage course participants to develop practice foresight rather than defensive reactions to what had emerged in the inquiry's findings. How the course was received by the practitioners, the work that was accomplished and the impact on the trainers of running a course in such circumstances are then highlighted.
