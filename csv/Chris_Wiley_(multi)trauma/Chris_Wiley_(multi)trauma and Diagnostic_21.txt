AB  - Abstract: Liver transplantation (LTx) in children currently offers long-term survival rates of more than 80%. Many causes for Tx failure have been identified. However, the incidence and impact of multi-organ system failure (MOSF) are, to date, unknown. Therefore, in this study the role of MOSF after LTx in children was investigated with regard to outcome. The data of 114 children (53 girls, 61 boys; median age 4.3?yr) after first LTx were evaluated retrospectively. The definition of MOSF, as used by Wilkinson et al. [Crit Care Med 1986: 14: 271?274], was modified with regard to age-adjusted values. The influence of MOSF on patient survival was investigated by Kaplan?Meier analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Thirty-one of 114 children with orthotopic LTx developed MOSF (involving two or more organs). In total, 18 children died (15.8%) during the hospitalization; 16 of these had MOSF. Mortality related to two-organ failure was 29.4% (n?=?5), to three-organ failure 78% (n?=?7), and to four-organ failure 80% (n?=?4). The highest mortality rates were observed in children with central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular failure, leading to a decreased probability of survival of 0.40 (p <?0.0001). Multi-variate analysis showed that CNS and cardiovascular failure were the most important risk factors for survival (p <?0.0001 and 0.056, respectively). Respiratory and renal failure, in univariate analysis, were significant contributors to poor survival, but had no statistically significant influence on outcome in multivariate analysis. Bone marrow insufficiency was found to have no influence on survival in either analysis. In multivariate analysis, the risk of development of MOSF was significantly increased by high numbers of transfused units of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), the absence of rejection episodes, or a high bilirubin level prior to Tx. Hence, MOSF is a major factor contributing to the death of children early after LTx. CNS and cardiovascular failure carried the highest risk for a poor outcome. Other risk factors associated with the development of MOSF were: numbers of transfused units of FFP, absence of rejection episodes, and a high pre-Tx bilirubin level.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Elevated serum procalcitonin (PCT) level has been reported to be a diagnostic index in systemic bacterial infections, but it can also increase in some non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Stevens?Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare immune-mediated cutaneous mucosal reaction which is susceptible to bacterial infections and may have elevated PCT levels. The value of serum PCT has not been assessed in series of SJS/TEN patients. We aimed to investigate the PCT levels in SJS/TEN patients with systemic bacterial infections (systemic infected group), with skin surface bacterial infections (skin surface infected group) and without infections (non-infected group), to assess whether PCT was a valuable indicator for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 42 inpatients with SJS/TEN were retrospectively analysis. The receiver?operator curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of PCT for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that PCT levels in the systemic infected group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CRP between the three groups. The cut-off PCT level of 0.65 ng/mL calculated by ROC had optimal diagnostic efficacy, with sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 89.7%, respectively. PCT and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis were positively correlated (P < 0.05). In conclusion, PCT is a valuable index and superior to CRP in detecting systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The level of PCT can partially reflect the severity of the disease.

AB  - Background/aim Research into the paid employment of people with spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury is prevalent; however, little research has examined the factors that may support employment for adults with a concomitant spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury (dual diagnosis). This study aimed to determine the level of paid employment reported by people with dual diagnosis and to explore contextual factors that supported paid employment. Methods This cross-sectional cohort study recruited 30 participants with dual diagnosis from a specialist spinal rehabilitation unit. Interviews were conducted during the first five years post-rehabilitation discharge to determine level of paid employment and contextual factors that supported employment. Results At interview, 47% of participants were in paid employment. Employment type at interview indicated a shift away from more physically intensive jobs. Employed and unemployed participants reported a high level of social support and reported experiencing few physical or attitudinal barriers in their day to day lives. These environmental factors did not differentiate between employed and unemployed participants (z range = ?0.98 to ?0.17; P value range = 0.33?0.86). The most common facilitator of employment identified by participants was the personal factor ? motivation (93% of employed participants). Conclusion When considering the impact of contextual factors on paid employment for people with a dual diagnosis of spinal cord injury/traumatic brain injury, personal factors may be of greater influence than environmental factors. Study participants experienced few physical or attitudinal barriers and reported highly supportive interpersonal relationships.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma-related guilt are risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) in veterans. Components of trauma-related guilt were examined as serial mediators of the relationship between PTSD and SI. In a sample of 53 OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans, PTSD had an indirect effect on SI through a serial mediation chain of guilt cognitions, distress, and global guilt, suggesting that trauma-related guilt via cognitions, distress, and global guilt is a pathway from PTSD to SI. Attention should be given to assessing and addressing trauma-related guilt in veterans experiencing PTSD to prevent SI.

AB  - Background:? Comparatively little is known about the cognitive appraisals and coping styles of child road traffic accident (RTA) survivors that are associated with chronic post-traumatic reactions. Methods:? Seventy-five children and young people aged 7?18 who were involved in a road traffic accident and attended an accident and emergency department were assessed 8?months after their accident. Post-traumatic symptoms were assessed by diagnostic interview (CAPS-C) and self-report questionnaires (IES). Demographic, accident and injury severity variables were recorded. Informed by the Ehlers and Clark (2000) model, trauma memory, subjective appraisals of the trauma and cognitive coping styles were assessed. Results:? Gender was the only non-cognitive variable associated with significant post-traumatic reactions and explained 5?6% of the overall variance. Trauma memory did not significantly contribute to the final regression model. The addition of the remaining cognitive factors assessing subjective appraisals of the trauma and cognitive coping style resulted in the model accounting for 61?65% of the variance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 8?months post trauma. Conclusion:? This study adds support to the applicability of the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model to children. The results indicate that the theoretically determined appraisals and cognitive coping styles are associated with chronic post-traumatic reactions. The findings suggest the need to develop trauma-focused interventions for children that directly address these key cognitions during therapy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases.

AB  - Abstract Aims? Random colonic biopsies are recommended to exclude microscopic colitis in patients with chronic diarrhoea especially when mucosa is macroscopically normal at endoscopy. This study aimed to assess the clinical outcome and economic impact of such a policy in an unselected group of patients with macroscopically normal mucosa. Methods? All new patients undergoing colonoscopy for investigation of chronic diarrhoea between April and December 2009 were included. Patients were divided into two groups: macroscopically normal mucosa and macroscopically inflamed mucosa. Endoscopic findings were correlated with histology of random biopsies and haematological parameters. Symptom status and any treatment were established from follow-up. The breakdown and overall cost of random biopsies for each patient with a macroscopically normal mucosa were determined, and cost incurred per diagnosis of microscopic colitis was established. Results? Altogether 137 (90.1%) of 152 patients with chronic diarrhoea had macroscopically normal mucosa at colonoscopy. Overall incidence of microscopic colitis in the study was 1.3% (2/152); both patients belonged to the macroscopically normal mucosa group. At follow-up, both these patients had spontaneous symptom resolution without any specific treatment. The policy of undertaking random biopsies in patients with macroscopically normal mucosa incurred an extra cost of £22?057 to diagnose two cases of microscopic colitis but did not alter medical treatment. Conclusions? In unselected patients with chronic diarrhoea and macroscopically normal mucosa, random colonic biopsies have a low diagnostic yield and incur a high cost. Continued research for predictive markers to improve patient selection for targeted biopsies is needed to develop a cost-effective investigative algorithm in chronic diarrhoea.

AB  - Summary This chapter illustrates the point that through the process of educating people on behavioral finance, one can help clients understand and improve their investor behavior. If behavioral finance were to be used by a large number of financial market participants (FMPs) to create better investment portfolios, three key challenges needed to be tackled. First, financial advisors need a guidebook to teach them the basics of what behavioral biases are and how to diagnose their client's irrational behaviors. Second, even if advisors can diagnose a client's biases, they need to know what to do with that information. Third, the industry needs a common behavioral finance language. An investor's background, past experiences, and attitudes can play a significant role in decisions made during the asset allocation process. It is important to note that because psychology is involved, no exact diagnosis can be made of any individual or situation.

AB  - Summary.? Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important medical problem because of the high fatality rate from PE and the large number of cases not diagnosed before causing death. Over the last decade, there has been considerable research into the diagnostic process. It is widely accepted that venous ultrasound imaging is an accurate test for the diagnosis of DVT and is the imaging test of choice. For PE, computer tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is replacing ventilation perfusion lung scanning. Technology for CTPA is rapidly evolving and multi-row detector scans have quite reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Despite the accuracy of imaging tests, the post-test probability of disease is highly dependent on pretest probability. Clinical evaluation tools have developed that enable us to accurately categorize patients? risk prior to diagnostic imaging. One advantage of this characterization is an ability to exclude the diagnosis of DVT or PE if clinical probability is sufficiently low and when the D-dimer is negative. There are now a number of D-dimer assays that have well-defined specificities and sensitivities, which enable use in conjunction with clinical probability. A careful combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer and imaging enables safe PE rule out protocols without imaging, an ability to suspect false positive imaging results, and more accurate determination of true positive imaging. These integration strategies result in safer, more convenient and cost-effective care for patients.

A total of 279 patients were diagnosed according to the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research. Interrater reliability, calculated by kappa statistics, was found to be between 0.74 and 0.91 on 2-character categories and between 0.64 and 0.90 on 3-character categories except schizotypal disorder (F21). On the 4-character categories, the agreement in the affective states between raters was lower. The reasons are discussed based on cultural differences.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

Perry found that trauma develops from severe neglect, abuse, and living in terrorizing environments. Trauma changes the neural processing ability within the child's developing brain which can lead to hypervigilance and dysfunctional behavior. Widom found that children who had been abused or neglected as children have 30% higher arrests as a juvenile and as an adult for a violent offense.

AB  - Abstract Objective. Assessment of apolipoprotein E genotype, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in different types of dementia. Subjects. 102 consecutive referrals to an old age psychiatry service based at Manchester were classified according to clinical criteria based on ICD 10. Results. Thirty-seven were considered to have Alzheimer's disease, 16 multi-infarct dementia and 33 to be free from dementia. Sixteen patients, in whom a definitive diagnosis could not be reached or sufficient information was not available, were excluded from the study. There was an increase in the prevalence of the Apo E4 allele in both Alzheimer's disease (?2=3.82, p<0.05) and multi-infarct dementia (?2=1.93, p<0.16) by Wald tests compared to individuals without dementia. The increased prevalence of the E4 Allele in multi-infarct dementia was not related to serum lipid levels. Conclusion. The hypothesis that the onset of multi-infarct dementia may be precipitated by E4's mediation of higher serum cholesterol levels is not supported by the present study. ? 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of the study was to examine validity and diagnostic accuracy of the single-item Faces Anxiety Scale for the purposes of preoperative anxiety screening. Background Anxiety is common in most patients expecting surgery interfering with patients' recovery. Valid and reliable measures for situations with limited time for assessment are needed. Design A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to collect the data from both self-report and rating instruments. Methods We enrolled 90 consecutive patients admitted for surgery in a university-affiliated hospital from January 2013 to June 2013. Patients were administered the anxiety state subscale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and they were presented the Faces Anxiety Scale. At the same time, patients' anxiety was rated by a nurse. Results The correlations among scores of self-report instruments, rating scale, and the Faces Anxiety Scale were high and statistically significant. Of the Faces Anxiety Scale cut-off scores tested, the cut-off score > 2 has an optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion The Faces Anxiety Scale is valid and easy to administer. The scale is useful in settings where fast and precise screening is necessary.
