AB  - ABSTRACT Orthopedic trauma, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruption, is a common source of osteoarthritis in the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive multi-planar imaging modality commonly used to evaluate hard and soft tissues of diarthrodial joints following traumatic injury. The contrast provided by generated images enables the evaluation of bone marrow lesions as well as delamination and degeneration of articular cartilage. We will provide background information about MRI signal generation and decay (T1 and T2 values), the utility of morphologic MRI, and the quantitative MRI techniques of T1?, T2, and T2* mapping, to evaluate subjects with traumatic knee injuries, such as ACL rupture. Additionally, we will provide information regarding the dGEMRIC, sodium, and gagCEST imaging techniques. Finally, the description and utility of newer post hoc analysis techniques, such as texture analysis, will be given. Continued development and refinement of these advanced MRI techniques will facilitate their clinical translation. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective To assess the association between parental post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and offspring PTSD and its specificity for other disorders in a non-clinical epidemiological cohort of Australian Vietnam veterans, their partners and their sons and daughters. Method Veterans were interviewed twice, in 1992?1994 and 2005?2006; partners were interviewed in 2006?2007, and their offspring in 2012?2014. A total of 125 sons and 168 daughters were interviewed from 197 families, 137 of which also included partners who were the mothers of the children. Statistical analysis used multi-level modelling to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals while controlling for clustering effects within families. Parent PTSD diagnoses were examined for associations with offspring trauma exposure, PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses. Results Veteran PTSD increased the risk of PTSD and no other disorder in both sons and daughters; partner PTSD did not. Veteran depression was also a risk factor for sons? PTSD, and alcohol disorder was linked to alcohol dependence in sons and PTSD in daughters, but not when controlling for veteran PTSD. Conclusion We conclude that PTSD in a Vietnam veteran father increases the risk specifically for PTSD in his sons and daughters.

AB  - Summary Inherited bleeding disorders affect between 1 in 1000 individuals for the most common disorder, von Willebrand Disease, to only 8 reported cases worldwide of alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency. Those with an identifiable abnormality can be divided into disorders of coagulation factors (87%), platelet count and function (8%) and the fibrinolytic system (3%). Of the patients registered in the UK with a bleeding disorder, the remaining 2% are unclassifiable. In addition to bleeding symptoms, patients with an inherited bleeding disorder can manifest other abnormalities, making an accurate and complete diagnosis that reflects the underlying molecular pathology important. Although some inherited bleeding disorders can still be easily diagnosed through a combination of careful clinical assessment and laboratory assays of varying degrees of complexity, there are many where conventional approaches are inadequate. Improvements in phenotyping assays have enhanced our diagnostic armoury but genotyping now offers the most accurate and complete diagnosis for some of these conditions. The advent of next generation sequencing technology has meant that many genes can now be analysed routinely in clinical practice. Here, we discuss the different diagnostic tools currently available for inherited bleeding disorders and suggest that genotyping should be incorporated at an early stage in the diagnostic pathway.

AB  - Abstract Although existing research suggests that certain childhood traumas such as childhood sexual abuse are associated with interpersonal (e.g., marital) difficulties in adulthood, there has been limited research on interpersonal sequelae of other types of traumas. In addition, the association between childhood traumas and interpersonal outcomes has often been limited to a particular outcome such as divorce, and existing studies have rarely controlled for the co-occurrence of other traumas when evaluating interpersonal outcomes. The current study sought to evaluate the associations between 7 childhood traumas and 2 marital outcomes?marital disruption (i.e., divorce and separation) and marital satisfaction?in a large, national probability sample. Results from univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that (a) probability of marital disruption was higher among people who during childhood had experienced physical abuse, rape, or serious physical attack or assault; and (b) current marital satisfaction was lower among people who during childhood had experienced rape or sexual molestation. Results support the importance of childhood traumas in predicting 2 important marital outcomes.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a pilot study of a 1-year multi-modal treatment for incest survivors, incorporating individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. The treatment was designed to provide a therapeutic context in which the affective intensity and meaning originally attached to the traumatic experience could be tolerated, and in which a thoughtful, reflective construction of the impact of the trauma could be developed. PTSD symptoms decreased in all participants, with all but one no longer meeting the diagnosis at post-treatment and follow-up. Using a narrative methodology, maladaptive schemas and overwhelming affects, ?trauma themes?, were also assessed to understand the survivors' views about themselves, others and the world around them. Participants demonstrated a steady pattern of improvement in the resolution of trauma themes. A discussion of the complex posttraumatic response to incest is included, as is a brief description of the treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background: Blast injury is uncommon, and remains poorly understood by most clinicians outside regions of active warfare. Primary blast injury (PBI) results from the interaction of the blast wave with the body, and typically affects gas-containing organs such as the ear, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. This review investigates the mechanisms and injuries sustained to the abdomen following blast exposure. Methods: MEDLINE was searched using the keywords ?primary blast injury?, ?abdominal blast? and ?abdominal blast injury? to identify English language reports of abdominal PBI. Clinical reports providing sufficient data were used to calculate the incidence of abdominal PBI in hospitalized survivors of air blast, and in open- and enclosed-space detonations. Results: Sixty-one articles were identified that primarily reported clinical or experimental abdominal PBI. Nine clinical reports provided sufficient data to calculate an incidence of abdominal PBI; 31 (3·0 per cent) of 1040 hospitalized survivors of air blast suffered abdominal PBI, the incidence ranging from 1·3 to 33 per cent. The incidence for open- and enclosed-space detonations was 5·6 and 6·7 per cent respectively. The terminal ileum and caecum were the most commonly affected organs. Surgical management of abdominal PBI is similar to that of abdominal trauma of other causes. Conclusion: Abdominal PBI is uncommon but has the potential for significant mortality and morbidity, which may present many days after blast exposure. It is commoner after blast in enclosed spaces and under water. Copyright ? 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background Information regarding clinical signs, assessment, treatment, and outcome in cats with hiatal hernia (HH) is limited. Objectives To characterize the clinical presentation of HH and medical and surgical outcomes in a cohort of affected cats. Animals Thirty-one client-owned cats with HH. Methods Medical records of cats with HH were retrospectively reviewed for signalment, history, results of diagnostic tests, details of surgical and medical treatments, complications, and outcome. Long-term follow-up data were obtained by telephone communication. Relationships between clinical variables and outcome were evaluated by regression analysis. Results Type I HH was present in 85.7% (24/28) of cats, and 64.5% (20/31) were >3?years of age at diagnosis. Twenty-one of 31 (67.7%) cats underwent surgical repair including phrenoplasty, esophagopexy, and left-sided gastropexy, and 10 of 31 cats were treated medically without surgery. Concurrent illness was common, and 77.4% cats had comorbidities. All cats survived to discharge, and median time to death or follow-up was 959?days (range, 3-4015?days). Cats treated medically survived longer than cats treated surgically, with median time to death or follow-up of 2559 and 771?days, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Type I HH is the most common type of HH in cats. A congenital etiology is possible, but many cats with HH were >3?years of age at diagnosis and suffered from comorbidities, including upper airway obstruction. Case selection and the presence of comorbidities likely influenced the outcome. Cats with HH may not be diagnosed until disease is advanced or concurrent illness draws attention to clinical signs.

AB  - The association of bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans among others with periodontal disease offers the opportunity for the development of diagnostic tests that are based upon the detection and/or quantification of one or more of these organisms or their by-products in the plaque. Three of the putative periodontal pathogens namely, T. denticola, B. gingivalis, and B. forsythus, can hydrolyze the synthetic trypsin substrate, N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-naphthylamide (BANA) forming a color reaction. The present investigation evaluated a commercially developed solid state assay for BANA hydrolysis that can be read after 15 minutes incubation at chairside. A total of 702 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 117 patients seen at four university dental clinics and placed on reagent cards. The color development on the cards was compared to the presence of T. denticola and B. gingivalis in the plaque, and with the clinical appearance of the sampled sites. This multi-center study demonstrated that antibodies to B. gingivalis and T. denticola could detect these organisms by an ELISA in the majority of the subgingival plaque samples. Comparable information could be obtained when the same plaques were evaluated by the reagent card format for BANA hydrolysis. The ELISA and reagent card were comparable in their ability to distinguish between clinically healthy and diseased sites. Both diagnostic procedures detected the periodontopathogens in plaques from sites that were judged clinically healthy. The reagent card test has certain clinical advantages over the ELISA in that it is simple, can be performed quickly at chairside, and provides valuable information as to the pathogenicity of the microflora at discrete oral sites. Such information may be used in the detection of patients or intraoral sites at risk for periodontal disease. J Periodontol 1990;61:189-196.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of paratracheal air cysts (PACs), their correlation with different lung diseases and their connection with the trachea by chest multi detector computed tomography (MDCT). Methods We retrospectively reviewed chest MDCT images of 8240 consecutive patients obtained from January 2010 to December 2011 with a 16-detector multi-detector CT scanner. PACs were assessed for prevalence, location, level, size and the presence of visible communication with the trachea. MDCT diagnoses were classified as normal, primary or metastatic malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and other lung diseases. We randomly selected 330 patients who had no visible PACs for the control group. We evaluated the associations between patients' demographic findings (age and sex), MDCT findings of lung and the presence of PACs. The findings of the PACs and control groups were compared. Statistical analysis used chi-squared test and Mann?Whitney U-test for evaluation. Results PACs were presented in 301 patients (4%); 204 men and 97 women, ranging in age from 14 to 91 years (median?=?57 years). There was no significant difference in the presence of PACs by age (P?>?0.05). Male subjects showed higher prevalence (P?=?0.005). Fifty PACs (16.6%) showed communication with the trachea or main bronchus. Although the relation between COPD and PACs was statistically significant (P?<?0.001), there was no relation between primary or metastatic malignancies, pneumonia and other lung diseases and PACs. Conclusion PACs are common in MDCT and should not be misdiagnosed as pneumomediastinum. It should be kept in mind that PACs may be associated with COPD.

AB  - Objectives Adults with bipolar disorder (BD) display aberrant activation in fronto-limbic neural circuitry during cognitive control. However, fronto-limbic response to cognitive control, and factors destabilizing this circuitry, remain under-studied during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood in BD. Sleep patterns are disturbed in BD, undergo change in adolescence, and support brain function. Among transitional age youth, BD diagnosis and sleep (duration and variability) were tested as predictors of fronto-limbic response to a stressful cognitive control task. Methods Two groups of youth (13-22 years old) participated: 15 with BD type I, II or not otherwise specified (NOS) [BD; age 18.1 ± 2.7 years (mean ± standard deviation, SD); 17 female] and 25 healthy controls [CTL; age 19.4 ± 2.7 years (mean ± SD); 17 female]. Sleep was monitored with actigraphy for at least 1 week prior to an adaptive multi-source interference functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm (a Stroop-like cognitive interference task). Group status and sleep duration (average and intra-individual variability) were examined as predictors of activation in response to incongruent>congruent trials within the bilateral amygdala, anterior cingulate (ACC), ventrolateral prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical regions of interest. Results The BD group displayed greater right amygdala activation than the CTL group. Average sleep duration and rostroventral ACC (rvACC) activity were negatively associated in the CTL group, but exhibited a quadratic relationship in the BD group such that short and long sleep were related to greater rvACC activation. Sleep duration variability and dorsal ACC activity were negatively associated in the BD group, and unrelated in the CTL group. Findings remained significant after controlling for age, sex, and mood symptoms. Conclusions Subjects with BD displayed a hyper-limbic response during cognitive control, and sleep was a source of variability in ACC engagement. Stabilizing sleep may be one avenue for improving cognitive control in BD.

AB  - The lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders was estimated in a study of the prevalence of mental disorders in Iceland. The survey instrument was an Icelandic translation of the US National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule. The cohort consisted of one half of those born in the year 1931. The participation rate was 79.3%. The overall prevalence of anxiety disorders was 44%, with phobia effecting 18%. The most common anxiety disorder was generalized anxiety, which had a prevalence of 22% and was more common among women. Simple phobia was the most common of the phobic disorders (8.8%), followed by agoraphobia without panic (3.8%), and social phobia (3.5%) The female-male ratio for anxiety disorders was 2:1. Of those with simple phobia, the most common items were a fear of heights (41%); claustrophobia (34%); being on public transportation (31%); the fear of being in crowds and speaking in front of others (28%); of being alone (24%); of insects (22%); of bad weather (21%); and of being in water (aquaphobia) (20%). In addition, 17% of the respondents listed phobias not cited in the DSM-III, and of those with the most common phobic disorder, only 9% had consulted a physician because of this condition. Post-traumatic stress disorder was found to affect women exclusively. Comorbidity shows a mean of at least 3 additional diagnoses.

AB  - Migraine or headache is a common problem in the active duty population, in the recently deployed service members, and is a cardinal symptom of traumatic brain injury. While there is increasing appreciation of the clinical burden of post-traumatic headache (PTHA) in the military traumatic brain injury population, there remain significant research gaps related to the epidemiology of PTHA, including lack of understanding of natural history, whether there are predisposing factors that predict the development or prognosis of headache post trauma and, most basically, the features that distinguish PTHA from other forms of chronic headache. Although diagnostic criteria for PTHA are included in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition, revised, these criteria are somewhat arbitrary and were not empirically defined. This lack of precision about the PTHA phenotype limits the rigor of observational studies of PTH but does not appear to significantly hamper treatment, provided the treatment involves a multi-modality approach.

AB  - Abstract: A pure electroporation injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent osmotic swelling of the tissue. The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile (water) protons and a restricted (protein) proton pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this injury. Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the transverse magnetic relaxation time (T2) in MRIs of healthy and electrically injured tissue. In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the MRI contrast, the degree of structural alteration of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane pores), and edema. The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle tissues, in that edema will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study examined the relationship between sexual trauma and eating disorder behavior, taking into account the effects of developmental stage of the victim and the effects of multiple sexual assaults. Method Four groups of adult women took part in this study. Subjects were either victims of childhood sexual abuse, victims of rape in adulthood, victims of both childhood sexual abuse and rape, and controls who were not traumatized sexually. All subjects were assessed with semistructured interviews and self-report inventories that assessed eating disorder behavior, general psychopathology, and impulsivity. Results Victims of childhood sexual abuse differed from controls on measures of eating disorder behavior and individuals who had experienced both childhood sexual abuse and rape in adulthood were most likely to display eating disorder-related psychopathology. Victims of childhood sexual abuse also distinguished themselves with high levels of eating disorder behavior plus multiple forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. Discussion This study provides additional support for the association between childhood sexual abuse and eating disorder behavior. Childhood sexual abuse may be particularly linked to the presence of binge eating behavior and several other forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. ? 2001 by John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are life-threatening complications in trauma patients. Despite the implantation of a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv ECMO), sufficient oxygenation (arterial SaO2?>?90%) is not always achieved. The additive use of high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) and ECMO in the critical phase after trauma could prevent the occurrence of life-threatening hypoxaemia and multi-organ failure. We report on a 26-year-old female (Injury Severity Score 29) who had multiple injuries as follows: an unstable pelvic fracture, a blunt abdominal trauma, a blunt trauma of the left thigh, and a thoracic injury. Three days after admission, the patient developed fulminant ARDS (Murray lung injury score of 11 and Horovitz- Index <80?mmHg), and vv ECMO therapy was initiated. The Horovitz- Index was <80?mm Hg, and the lung compliance was minimal. With HFOV, almost complete recruitment of the lung was achieved, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was significantly reduced. The pelvic fracture was treated non-operatively. The HFOV was terminated after 3 days, and the ECMO was stopped after 19 days.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the experience of three highly specialized centres in the vascular evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) in teenagers, as there is little information on this topic, and although clinical guidelines support the use of vascular studies in selected cases, our experience is that vascular evaluation aimed at diagnosing organic ED is uncommon in teenagers, and most are designated as having psychogenic ED. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a retrospective multi-institutional analysis of three ED databases (1998?2003) we assessed males aged ≤19?years presenting with ED. The review of these databases focused on demographic characteristics, risk factors for ED, erectile function, results of vascular evaluation, and the causes of ED. RESULTS In all, 40 males aged 14?19?years were identified. The mean (range) duration of ED at presentation was 22.6?(4?84)?months. The major risk factors for ED were antecedent perineal trauma (37%) and penile trauma or surgery (15%). The mean (sd) International Index of Erectile Function ?erectile function? domain score was 15?(4). Information obtained by history taking was not predictive of the cause of ED. Vascular studies were performed in 62% of the patients and 48% of these patients were found to have an underlying vascular pathology; 42% of the latter group were found to be possible candidates for surgical intervention and another 16% needed further angiographic evaluation. CONCLUSION ED in teenagers should not be routinely categorized as psychogenic without an adequate vascular evaluation, as a significant percentage have abnormal erectile haemodynamics consistent with vasculogenic ED.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a review of the research on those treatments for childhood trauma deemed 'Well-Supported by Research Evidence' or 'Supported by Research Evidence' by the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC). Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), a well-supported treatment originally designed for families impacted by child sexual abuse or violence, is explored in greater detail as this model has the strongest evidence base among treatments for childhood trauma with effectiveness documented in over 50 scientific studies, including 20 randomised trials. TF-CBT is a components-based, hybrid approach to treating children who have experienced trauma and their non-offending caregivers. Psychoeducation about TF-CBT helps caregivers and children have a general understanding of what treatment will entail and how it will address the trauma symptoms experienced.

AB  - Objective: To assess the usefulness of computed tomography arthrography of the stifle in diagnosing meniscal tears in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed. Dogs were included if they had evidence of cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency or persistent or recurrent lameness following surgery for cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. Dogs were sedated for a computed tomography scan of the affected stifle, orientated in the dorsal plane. A survey computed tomography scan was followed by a computed tomography arthrogram. A stifle arthrotomy was performed, and the surgical findings were recorded. The computed tomography scans were reviewed by three blinded reviewers, and the results were compared to the surgical findings. Results: Twenty-one computed tomography arthrograms from 20 dogs were included. At surgery, damage to the medial meniscus was identified in 14 stifles. Initial interpretation of computed tomography arthrography images was 57 to 64 per cent sensitive and 71 to 100 per cent specific for diagnosing medial meniscal injuries. Interpretation of the images on retrospective analysis was 71 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific, with an accuracy of 0·857. Clinical Significance: The accuracy of stifle computed tomography arthrography for the diagnosis of tears to the medial meniscus was found to be good. It is a minimally invasive and repeatable technique, which does not require general anaesthesia or specialist training to obtain the images. The ability to reliably diagnose meniscal injury without the need for surgery may be advantageous, particularly in dogs which had previously had surgery for cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency.

AB  - Background: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. Methods: A prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip fracture (≥65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30?min after admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4?h of admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. Results: The number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1%), with a decrease from 34% (45 of 132) in the control group to 22% (29 of 131) in the intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically older, more often had >4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the SPMSQ test. Conclusion: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during hospitalization by 35%.
