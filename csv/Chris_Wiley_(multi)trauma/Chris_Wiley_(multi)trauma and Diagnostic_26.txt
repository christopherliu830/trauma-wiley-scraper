AB  - Abstract Background Data from a cohort of women treated with bisphosphonates were used to illustrate that multi-state models may be the useful tools of analysis where two causes of treatment failure are the ultimate outcome of interest, and the sequence of recurrent episodes of treatment starting and discontinuing is also of concern. Methods All the 11?863 women resident in the Italian Region of Lombardy, aged 45 years or over and who received bisphosphonates for the first time during 2003 entered into the study and were followed up until December 2005. Multi-state models with in-treatment and treatment-free periods as transient states, and fractures and gastrointestinal-related events as competing causes of failure, were fitted to the data. The effect of several covariates on transition rates between states was estimated. Results One half of the women was treated with bisphosphonates for less than 27% of the period of observation. Negative prognostic factors for treatment discontinuation were younger age and the use of alendronate at once-daily dosing, with low refill compliance during follow-up. The risk of fracture was higher for older women who experienced fracture before entry in the cohort, and for those who switched between drugs, had low refill compliance, experienced episodes of treatment discontinuation and used corticosteroids during follow-up. Conclusions The use of multi-state models in pharmacoepidemiology provides non-biased estimates of the effect of covariates in predicting treatment discontinuation, restarting and failures. Our analyses emphasize the importance of maximising compliance in order to reduce the risks of both treatment discontinuation and fracture. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective To describe the bacterial bio-burden of open-treated wounds and make comparisons with bite wounds. Design Retrospective multicentre study. Sample Microbial culture between 2011 and 2013 from open-treated wounds in dogs and cats (initiation of therapy n=88, follow-up n=52) were compared to those from bite wounds (n=184). Procedures Bacteria were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by two accredited laboratories. Results In total, 77/88 (88%) of open-treated wounds yielded positive bacterial cultures at the beginning of treatment, decreasing to 27/52 (52%) during treatment. Upon initial evaluation, 42/88 (48 %) of open-treated wounds were considered infected with multi-drug-resistant bacteria, with a drop to 22/52 (41%) during therapy. Bite wounds yielded fewer positive cultures 88/184 (48%) with only 11/182 (6%) being affected by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Bacteria found most commonly in open-treated wounds were Enterococcus subspecies, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusion The bacterial populations of open-treated wounds differed markedly from the bite wounds. The high incidence of multi-drug-resistant strains in open wounds highlights the need for alternatives to antibiotics.

AB  - Abstract: This article considers the development of violence with particular reference to family factors in violence such as the quality of the parent-child relationship. In taking a developmental approach to violence, a link is established between the maltreatment of children in an attachment context and the risk of violence via the child's capacity to envision mental states in the other. Evidence from epidemiology and neuroscience is brought to bear on this link. Finally, some studies of prevention of violence that are likely to enhance attachment and mentalizing are considered.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to compare the value of high-resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of nasal fractures. Methods. Facial CT and HRUS examinations performed on 140 consecutive patients (103 male and 37 female; age range, 2?74 years; mean, 26 years) with nasal trauma between October 2004 and April 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. Sonograms were obtained with a hockey stick probe (15?7 MHz linear array transducer). All patients also underwent facial CT and conventional radiography. The nasal fracture detection rates for HRUS, CT, and conventional radiography were compared with the clinical and surgical diagnosis. Nasal fractures were classified into high- and low-grade groups according to severity. They were also compared with the CT findings of all 280 lateral nasal bones and with HRUS findings as the reference standard. Results. The accuracy rates for HRUS, CT, and conventional radiography in detecting nasal fractures were 100%, 92.1%, and 78.6%, respectively. Compared with HRUS, CT revealed only 196 of 233 lateral nasal bone fractures; its accuracy was 80%. In high-grade fractures, the accuracy of CT was 87%, but it decreased to 68% in low-grade fractures. Conclusions. Compared with HRUS, CT had lower accuracy, especially in low-grade nasal fractures. Thus, HRUS is a reliable diagnostic tool for the evaluation of nasal fractures.

AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.

AB  - Summary The location of care for many brain-injured patients has changed since 2012 following the development of major trauma centres. Advances in management of ischaemic stroke have led to the urgent transfer of many more patients. The basis of care has remained largely unchanged, however, with emphasis on maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion as the key to preventing secondary injury. Organisational aspects and training for transfers are highlighted, and we have included an expanded section on paediatric transfers. We have also provided a table with suggested blood pressure parameters for the common types of brain injury but acknowledge that there is little evidence for many of our recommendations. These guidelines remain a mix of evidence-based and consensus-based statements. We have received assistance from many organisations representing clinicians who care for these patients, and we believe our views represent the best of current thinking and opinion. We encourage departments to review their own practice using our suggestions for audit and quality improvement.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounting for 80% of head injury diagnoses, recognition of individuals at risk of cognitive dysfunction remains a challenge in the acute setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential role for computerised cognitive testing as part of a complete ED head injury assessment. Methods mTBI patients (n =?36) who incurred a head injury within 24?h of presentation to the ED were compared to trauma controls (n = 20) and healthy controls (n =?20) on tests assessing reaction time, speed and attention, episodic memory, working memory and executive functioning. Testing occurred during their visit to the ED at a mean of 12?h post-injury for mTBI and 9.4?h for trauma controls. These tasks were part of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery iPad application. Healthy controls were tested in both a quiet environment and the ED to investigate the potential effects of noise and distraction on neurocognitive function. Results Reaction time was significantly slower in the mTBI group compared to trauma patients (P =?0.015) and healthy controls (P =?0.011), and deficits were also seen in working memory compared to healthy controls (P?≤?0.001) and in executive functioning (P =?0.021 and P <?0.001) compared to trauma and healthy controls. Performances in the control group did not differ between testing environments. Conclusion Computerised neurocognitive testing in the ED is feasible and can be utilised to detect deficits in cognitive performance in the mTBI population as part of a routine head injury assessment.

AB  - Background? For families of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) getting a diagnosis is a traumatic experience on which future care and education plans for the child depend. In this paper parental experiences of diagnosis and forward planning for children with ASD are reported. Method? This paper is part of a large cross-sectional study conducted in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that assessed the needs and experiences of parents of children diagnosed with ASD. Questionnaires were designed and completed by 95 parents, reporting on 100 children, as well as 67 multi-disciplinary professionals. Results? Findings confirm that diagnostic and planning processes are extremely stressful for parents, that statutory diagnosis takes a long time, that care and education plans do not include full parental participation, and that reviews of plans do not consistently include intervention data. Conclusion? Policy and practice implications of these findings are important for future revisions of diagnostic tools and manuals.

AB  - The sequelae of child maltreatment tend to extend current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are more severe after single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe after child maltreatment than after single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more prevalent after single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more prevalent after child maltreatment. The Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) assessed PTSD and trauma-related symptoms in 256 children (83 children exposed to single trauma, 173 to child maltreatment). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed trauma-unrelated symptoms. Single-trauma children reported significantly more severe PTSD and trauma-related symptoms. Significantly more severe trauma unrelated symptoms were reported after child maltreatment. A significant relation was found between clinical PTSD and more severe trauma-related symptoms in both samples. Likelihood of children meeting PTSD symptoms after trauma seems to decrease when traumatization becomes more complex. Findings support our assumption that symptomatology of maltreated children extends current PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Summary Rationale This initiative is focused on building a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings. Methods In January 2016, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. GLIM appointed a core leadership committee and a supporting working group with representatives bringing additional global diversity and expertise. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications. Results A two-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected, i.e., first screening to identify ?at risk? status by the use of any validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among the GLIM core and supporting working group members. The top five ranked criteria included three phenotypic criteria (weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity as Stage 1 (moderate) and Stage 2 (severe) malnutrition are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories. Conclusion A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure further collaboration and endorsements from leading nutrition professional societies, to identify overlaps with syndromes like cachexia and sarcopenia, and to promote dissemination, validation studies, and feedback. The diagnostic construct should be re-considered every 3?5 years.

AB  - Purpose To visualize healthy and abnormal articular cartilage, we investigated the potential of using the 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) signal's magnitude and frequency and maps of relaxation. Materials and Methods After optimizing imaging parameters in five healthy volunteers, 3D multi-echo GRE magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired at 3T in four patients with chondral damage prior to their arthroscopic surgery. Average magnitude and frequency information was extracted from the GRE images, and maps were generated. Cartilage abnormalities were confirmed after arthroscopy and were graded using the Outerbridge classification scheme. Regions of interest were identified on average magnitude GRE images and compared to arthroscopy. Results All four patients presented with regions of Outerbridge Grade I and II cartilage damage on arthroscopy. One patient had Grade III changes. Grade I, II, and III changes were detectable on average magnitude and maps, while Grade II and higher changes were also observable on MR frequency maps. For average magnitude images of healthy volunteers, the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnitude image averaged over three echoes was 4.26?±?0.32, 12.26?±?1.09, 14.31?±?1.93, and 13.36?±?1.13 in bone, femoral, tibial, and patellar cartilage, respectively. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using different imaging contrasts from the 3D multi-echo GRE scan to visualize abnormalities of the articular cartilage. ? 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Level of Evidence: 1 J.

Nonselective computed tomography angiography with contrast medium injected peripherally via the jugular veins was used to evaluate the vascular supply to the distal limb. The use of this imaging technique demonstrated either intact or disrupted distal limb vasculature. The imaging results were verified with a positive long-term outcome in the case with a diagnosis of an intact vasculature and with histological findings of avascular necrosis in the case with a diagnosis of disrupted vasculature.

AB  - ABSTRACT Tuberculosis ranges among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A diagnostic approach to a patient with possible tuberculosis includes a detailed medical history and clinical examination as well as radiological, microbiological, immunological, molecular-biological and histological investigations, where available. Recently, important advances have been achieved in these fields that have led to substantial improvements in the accuracy and the timing of the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Novel methods allow for a better identification of latently infected individuals who are at risk of developing active tuberculosis, they also offer the possibility for a rapid diagnosis of active tuberculosis in patients with negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli and enable prompt identification of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly from respiratory specimen with a high accuracy. In addition, promising methods that will further optimize the diagnosis of tuberculosis are under development. In the future, therapeutic interventions based on the results of novel diagnostic procedures can be made earlier leading to improvements in patient care.

AB  - Abstract Among the millions of edentulous Americans, a persistent minority have not been able tolerate wearing dentures. Complicating factors may have precluded surgical intervention with grafts or dental implants to improve the physical and anatomic limitations of these unfortunate patients. A heat-cured polymer liner containing multiple small suction cups has been used for decades to successfully restore many such debilitated individuals. Two middle-aged female patients with edentulous maxillae and near fully dentate mandibles had both reached a point where they could no longer retain a maxillary complete denture, or function with it. Both had experienced multiple failed surgical attempts to improve their situations. They were both successfully restored with maxillary complete dentures containing heat-cured silicone liners with multiple small suction cups. Two young female maxillectomy patients had significant difficulties wearing maxillary obturators due to defect size and absence of defect undercuts. One had an edentulous maxilla, while the other had no axial undercuts on her few remaining maxillary teeth. Without an obturator, both suffered considerable air and fluid leaks, unintelligible speech, and swallowing problems. They too were successfully restored with obturators containing a heat-cured, multi-cup, silicone liner. The multi-cup, silicone denture liner has offered an economic, noninvasive alternative for patients unable or unwilling to undergo surgical intervention to facilitate prosthesis retention.

AB  - Abstract:? Ten urine chemistry parameters were measured on 74 voided urine samples from 34 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Multi-reagent urine dipstick tests were performed and results determined using colorimetric scales. Urine pH measured between 8 and 9 units in 91% of the chimpanzees. Test pads detected protein, erythrocytes, leukocyte esterase activity, and nitrites, ketones and bilirubin in 47, 32, 29, and <10% of the chimpanzees, respectively. No apparent association between positive test results for blood in adult females and reproductive status was found. Overall, 17 of the 34 chimpanzees had positive urine test results for protein, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, nitrites, ketones, and/or bilirubin. Dipstick urinalysis alone is an unreliable method for assessing health and physiological status of wild chimpanzees. However, if combined with other diagnostics it could prove to be a valuable health-monitoring tool. Limitations associated with this methodology need to be considered when interpreting urinary dipstick test results.
