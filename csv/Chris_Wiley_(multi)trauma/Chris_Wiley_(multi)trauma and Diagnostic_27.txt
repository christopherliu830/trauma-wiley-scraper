AB  - Abstract Innovations in clinical genetics have increased diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of inherited genetic conditions (IGCs). This has led to an increased number of families seeking genetic testing and / or genetic counselling and increased the clinical load for genetic counsellors (GCs). Keeping pace with biomedical discoveries, interventions are required to support families to understand, communicate and cope with their Inherited Genetic Condition. The Socio-Psychological Research in Genomics (SPRinG) collaborative have developed a new intervention, based on multi-family discussion groups (MFDGs), to support families affected by IGCs and train GCs in its delivery. A potential challenge to implementing the intervention was whether GCs were willing and able to undergo the training to deliver the MFDG. In analysing three multi-perspective interviews with GCs, this paper evaluates the training received. Findings suggests that MFDGs are a potential valuable resource in supporting families to communicate genetic risk information and can enhance family function and emotional well-being. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is feasible to train GCs in the delivery of the intervention and that it has the potential to be integrated into clinical practice. Its longer term implementation into routine clinical practice however relies on changes in both organisation of clinical genetics services and genetic counsellors? professional development.

AB  - The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF) is widely used to measure childhood abuse of all types. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the instrument. The participants constituted four subsamples (n = 517): substance abusers (n = 126), psychiatric patients (n = 210), prisoners (n = 109) and adolescents in out-of-home placements (n = 72). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a reasonable fit of the data to the original five-factor structure of the CTQ-SF. Measurement invariance was found across gender and the four subsamples. It was concluded that the Norwegian version of the CTQ-SF has acceptable psychometric properties, with good reliability and satisfactory accuracy, to assess different dimensions of childhood trauma.

AB  - Objective? To present the technique for intra-articular catheter placement and report the clinical outcomes of 38 cases of equine synovial trauma and/or infection treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials administered via an intrasynovial catheter (ISC). Design? Retrospective study. Procedure? Medical records of 38 horses treated for synovial trauma and sepsis with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC from 1995 to 2008 were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained via clinical re-evaluation or telephone contact with the owners. Results? The majority of horses (84%) received amikacin and Timentin? four times daily. In addition, synovial lavage through the ISC was carried out in 27 horses (71%). Only radiological evidence of osteolysis had a significant negative impact on both lameness at the time of hospital discharge and the long-term outcome. In total, 92% of horses treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had clinical resolution of infection. Catheter obstruction occurred in three cases, necessitating replacement or removal, and two synovial fistulae developed at sites of open drainage. The majority of horses treated had a favourable outcome, with 86% being at least pasture sound and 43% returned to riding. Conclusion? Septic synovial structures treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had a good prognosis for survival and 43% returned to riding, which is consistent with the results of other studies. The use of a simple ISC should be considered when broad-spectrum intrasynovial antimicrobial administration and lavage of a septic synovial structure are indicated.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes the most common disease process of the liver briefly. It defines the MR imaging features with characteristic examples and correlates MR imaging features and examples with their CT counterparts. The great majority of diseases can be characterized by defining their appearance on T1-, T2-weighted and different phases of postgadolinium T1-weighted images. The most commonly used gradient echo (GE) sequences for routine abdominal imaging are spoiled GE (SGE) and three dimensional gradient echo (3D-GE) sequences. Parallel MR imaging comprises a number of methods that can be used in combination with the majority of the MR imaging sequences in order to reduce scan time by acquiring less data than would otherwise be necessary to avoid aliasing. 3.0 T MRI enables the acquisition of very high quality postgadolinium 3D-GE sequences, with thinner sections and higher spatial resolution compared to 1.5 T, allowing the detection and characterization of very small lesions.

AB  - Assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders has become standard practice in the counseling profession. In this article, the authors examine problems and solutions associated with accurate assessment and diagnosis of conduct disorder. Problems of conduct disorder assessment and diagnosis include (a) client deceitfulness, (b) parent and teacher misinformation, (c) counselor countertransference, (d) diagnostic comorbidity, and (e) confounding cultural and situational circumstances. Counselors seeking to accurately diagnose conduct disorder should adhere to basic assessment principles; use multi-method, multi-rater, multi-setting approaches; closely review differential explanations and diagnoses; and regularly obtain peer consultation.

AB  - Objectives To report surgical technique, intra- and post-operative complications, and short- and long-term outcome following canine hepatobiliary surgery in which exposure of intra-abdominal hepatobiliary lesions was aided by diaphragmotomy. Materials and Methods Clinical records from four multi-disciplinary UK-based small animal referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed for dogs in which diaphragmotomy was performed between January 2014 and May 2019. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery performed, diaphragmotomy technique, management of diaphragmotomy and pneumothorax, intra- and post-operative complications, short-term outcome and long-term outcome were recorded. Results Thirty-one cases were identified. The most common hepatobiliary surgeries performed alongside diaphragmotomy were single hepatic lobectomy (14/31) and cholecystectomy (11/31). The most common diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma (10/31), gall bladder mucocoele (7/31) and hepatic nodular hyperplasia (4/31). Peri-operative mortality rate was 9.7% (3/31 cases) though none of these deaths were considered attributable to diaphragmotomy. Post-operative complications were encountered in 67.9% (19/28) cases that survived the peri-operative period, of which 25.0% (7/28) suffered complications that were considered attributable or likely attributable to diaphragmotomy. These seven complications resolved following non-surgical intervention. Follow-up was available for 26 of 28 patients that survived to discharge at a median of 4-months (range 10?days to 24?months) following surgery and revealed no evidence of complications related to diaphragmotomy. Clinical Significance Diaphragmotomy appears safe and increases abdominal exposure of hepatobiliary lesions. The benefit of improved exposure must be carefully weighed up against the risks inherent in inducing pneumothorax.

Patients who are more likely to develop urosepsis include elderly patients; diabetics; immunosuppressed patients, such as transplant recipients; cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroids; and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndromes. However, all patients can be affected by bacterial species capable of inducing inflammation within the urinary tract.

AB  - Abstract The most common errors in the diagnosis of dementia are underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Underdiagnosis is best avoided by careful use of psychometric screening tests to detect cognitive impairment in patients unaware of their own defect. Overdiagnosis can be avoided by not applying the label of ?dementia? until the diagnosis is unequivocal. Complete evaluation is necessary to rule out treatable causes of dementia, and should include medical, neurological, and psychiatric history and examination, simple psychometric tests, laboratory battery, computerized transaxial tomographic brain scan, and electroencephalogram. Ultimately, the diagnosis of dementia may change at follow-up examination, and the unequivocal diagnosis of a specific form of dementia still requires autopsy and neuropathological examination of the brain. The most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly include Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, depression, and other specific illnesses such as tumors, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Even systemic disease can present as dementia. The evaluation outlined above may help distinguish among these causes. New diagnostic techniques may eventually be helpful as well.

AB  - This article presents an overview of the philosophy and practical principles underlying the Linking Human Systems Approach based on the theory of resilience in individuals, families, and communities facing crisis, trauma, and disaster. The Link Approach focuses on tapping into the inherent strength of individuals and their families and emphasizes resilience rather than vulnerability. It has been successfully used in combating critical public health problems, such as addiction, HIV/AIDS, and recovery from major trauma or disaster. Also, three specific models of Link intervention aimed at the individual, family, and community levels are discussed, with special emphasis on the family-level intervention. These interventions are directed toward mobilizing resources for long-term physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual healing.

The 14-year survival rate for AD was 2.4% versus an expected rate of 16.6%, and for MID 1.7% versus 13.3% expected. MID showed a more malignant natural course than AD. Men carried a less favourable survival prognosis than women, both in AD and MID: the relative risk of dying for women was half that for men in both diseases. In MID, advanced disability indicated a relative risk of dying over twice as high. In both diseases the risk of death was substantially higher in the event of occurrence of primitive reflexes.

AB  - Introduction Worldwide, life expectancy, and aging-related disorders as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are increasing, having a rising impact on patients' quality of life and caregivers' distress. Telemedicine offers many possibilities, such as remote diagnosing and monitoring of patients. Objective The purpose of this study is to provide a narrative synthesis of the literature about the implementation of telemedicine for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with AD and MCI and their caregivers. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases up to September 2018. MCI or AD diagnoses were the conditions of interest. We excluded other dementias. Results Fifty-six articles met inclusion criteria. We identified two main categories: diagnosis group (DG) and follow-up/interventional group (FIG). Fifteen articles suggested how to make a remote or earlier diagnosis: four were case-control accuracy studies, nine were paired comparative accuracy studies, and two were prospective single-arm accuracy studies. Among these, four focused on MCI, six on AD, and five on both. Forty one focused on supporting patients during the stages of the disease (28 articles), patient's caregivers (nine articles), or both (four articles). Conclusions The rising use of telemedicine could actively improve AD and MCI patients' lives, reduce caregivers' burden, and facilitate an early diagnosis if patients live in remote places. However, as some studies report, it is relevant to take into account the emotional impact of telemedicine on patients and not only on the effectiveness.

AB  - Objective: To reveal views about dementia diagnosis derived from a larger study of information needs of carers of people with dementia in Tasmania, Australia. Methods: Over 100 participants, including family carers, health professionals and dementia service personnel, met as discrete focus groups. Data pertinent to dementia diagnosis were segregated and subjected to across-group comparative analysis. Results: The term dementia held connotations of stigma and futility, despite stated benefits of having a diagnosis. General practitioners were regarded as pivotal but having inadequate diagnostic and treatment options. While most health professionals advocated a longitudinal diagnostic process, this created considerable stress for family carers who sought a speedy process. Without a diagnosis, some dementia-specific services were undeliverable. Conclusion: Dementia diagnosis is steeped in deep-rooted difficulties and stressful implications, compounded by carers? differing needs and interests. Better understanding between care providers of their conflicting and consistent views could contribute to better dementia care.

The majority of injuries occur in the younger population, so management should consider the long-term outcome, failure and future treatment needs over the course of, often, many decades. The aim should be to provide a tooth-restoration complex that closely mimics the functional and aesthetic qualities of an intact tooth for as long as possible. This narrative review will assess the relevant literature pertinent to restoration of traumatized teeth in order to provide guidance for the practising clinician.

AB  - Abstract A primary interest of the field of infant mental health is in the early conditions that place infants at risk for less than optimal development. The fundamental problem of what constitutes normal and abnormal development is now a focus of developmental psychology, infant psychiatry, and developmental neuroscience. In the second part of this sequential work, I present interdisciplinary data to more deeply forge the theoretical links between severe attachment failures, impairments of the early development of the right brain's stress coping systems, and maladaptive infant mental health. In the following, I offer thoughts on the negative impact of traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental health, the neurobiology of infant trauma, the neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a predisposition to posttraumatic stress disorders, the neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the etiology of dissociation and body?mind psychopathology, the effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some implications for models of early intervention. These findings suggest direct connections between traumatic attachment, inefficient right brain regulatory functions, and both maladaptive infant and adult mental health.??2001 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with severe abdominal trauma injuries can have improved outcomes if a priority-oriented approach is taken to surgical intervention. This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often referred to as the great masquerader, and remains a diagnostic challenge in daily practice due to its mostly unspecific clinical presentation. Diagnostic algorithms are needed to assist clinical assessment and optimise the use of investigations, especially under emergency conditions. Nuclear medicine ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy has long been the imaging mainstay for the diagnosis of PE. Venous thromboembolism is not directly visualised but, rather, its effects on perfusion and ventilation. This necessitates the need for probability criteria, categorised as high, intermediate, low or very low probability, and normal. Spiral computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) emerged in the 1990s as a new diagnostic technique. CTPA has become the gold standard for the radiological assessment of a clinically suspected PE in daily practice. Special attention should be given to the clinical impact of incidental and subsegmental emboli.

Are multi family groups appropriate for patients with first episode psychosis? A 5-year naturalistic follow-up study. Objective:? To compare outcome over 5?years for patients who participated in multi family groups (MFGs) to those who refused or were not offered participation. Method:? Of 301 first episode psychotic patients aged 15?65?years, 147 participated in MFGs. Outcome was measured by drop-out rates, positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) symptom scores, and duration of psychotic episodes during the follow-up period. Results:? Multi family group participants had a significantly lower drop-out rates at 5-year follow-up than patients who did not participate. However, the MFG participants had significantly less improvement in PANSS positive and excitative symptoms and had significantly longer duration of psychotic symptoms during the follow-up period. Conclusion:? Multi family groups appear to increase the chance of retaining patients in a follow-up study, but adjustment of the programme may be necessary with first episode psychosis patients to meet their needs better.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of anterior and posterior instrumentation with different debridement and graft fusion methods for multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 81 patients with multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis who underwent anterior or posterior instrumentation combined with different methods of debridement, decompression, and graft fusion from January 2002 to December 2012. All patients were divided into an anterior instrumentation group and a posterior instrumentation group. In the anterior instrumentation group, there were 39 patients who underwent transthoracic debridement. In the posterior instrumentation group, there were 34 patients who underwent trans-costotransverse decompression and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation, and another 8 patients underwent combined anterior debridement and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation in a single-stage or two-stage procedure. The kyphotic angles were calculated from lateral spinal X-rays using the modified Konstam method. The symptoms and signs of tuberculosis, fusion level, fusion time of the bone graft, average kyphosis angle, average correction, average loss of correction, and clinical complications were recorded. The average follow-up period was 37?months (range, 17?72?months). Results The cohort consisted of 47 males and 34 females with an average age of 38?years. The mean durations of the operations were 3.5 ± 0.4?h in the anterior group and 4.0 ± 0.3?h in the posterior group ( P < 0.05). The mean blood loss volumes during surgery were 450 ± 42 and 560 ± 51?mL for the anterior group and the posterior group, respectively ( P < 0.01). The kyphotic deformities were corrected from 32.1° ± 10.3° to 10.2° ± 2.1° in the anterior group and from 33.8° ± 11.7° to 12.6° ± 2.7° in the posterior group ( P < 0.01). The neurologic statuses of the 23 patients with preoperative neurologic deficits improved in each group. Fusion was confirmed radiographically at 5.4 ± 1.2?months (range, 4?12?months) in the anterior group and 5.6 ± 1.4?months (range, 4?13?months) in the posterior group ( P > 0.05). Postoperative relapses were noted in 1 and 3 patients in the anterior and the posterior group, respectively. Conclusion Posterior instrumentation was more effective than anterior instrumentation in the correction of kyphosis and the maintenance of the correction. However, postoperative sinus formation was more frequent in patients who underwent a single-stage posterior procedure.
