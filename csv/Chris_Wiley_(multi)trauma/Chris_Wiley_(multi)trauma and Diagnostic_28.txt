AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of anterior and posterior instrumentation with different debridement and graft fusion methods for multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 81 patients with multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis who underwent anterior or posterior instrumentation combined with different methods of debridement, decompression, and graft fusion from January 2002 to December 2012. All patients were divided into an anterior instrumentation group and a posterior instrumentation group. In the anterior instrumentation group, there were 39 patients who underwent transthoracic debridement. In the posterior instrumentation group, there were 34 patients who underwent trans-costotransverse decompression and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation, and another 8 patients underwent combined anterior debridement and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation in a single-stage or two-stage procedure. The kyphotic angles were calculated from lateral spinal X-rays using the modified Konstam method. The symptoms and signs of tuberculosis, fusion level, fusion time of the bone graft, average kyphosis angle, average correction, average loss of correction, and clinical complications were recorded. The average follow-up period was 37?months (range, 17?72?months). Results The cohort consisted of 47 males and 34 females with an average age of 38?years. The mean durations of the operations were 3.5 ± 0.4?h in the anterior group and 4.0 ± 0.3?h in the posterior group ( P < 0.05). The mean blood loss volumes during surgery were 450 ± 42 and 560 ± 51?mL for the anterior group and the posterior group, respectively ( P < 0.01). The kyphotic deformities were corrected from 32.1° ± 10.3° to 10.2° ± 2.1° in the anterior group and from 33.8° ± 11.7° to 12.6° ± 2.7° in the posterior group ( P < 0.01). The neurologic statuses of the 23 patients with preoperative neurologic deficits improved in each group. Fusion was confirmed radiographically at 5.4 ± 1.2?months (range, 4?12?months) in the anterior group and 5.6 ± 1.4?months (range, 4?13?months) in the posterior group ( P > 0.05). Postoperative relapses were noted in 1 and 3 patients in the anterior and the posterior group, respectively. Conclusion Posterior instrumentation was more effective than anterior instrumentation in the correction of kyphosis and the maintenance of the correction. However, postoperative sinus formation was more frequent in patients who underwent a single-stage posterior procedure.

AB  - ABSTRACT Demented patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n= 17), late-onset Alzheimer's disease (n= 30) and vascular dementia (VD) (n= 20) were studied with computed tomography of the brain. Semiquantitative evaluation of white matter low attenuation (WMLA) and central and cortical atrophy was performed without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. In early onset AD there was almost complete absence of WMLA and central atrophy compared with the other groups, which showed moderate to severe changes. This suggests that early-onset AD should be separated from the late-onset form. The increased systolic blood pressure found in the WMLA group supports the opinion that WMLA has a vascular origin. The high percentage of WMLA in VD andlate-onset AD indicates that subcortical factors have to be considered in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Little is known about adult dental trauma experience at the population level. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and associations of dental injuries in New Zealand (NZ) adults. Materials and Method Information about dental and orofacial trauma in a representative sample of NZ adults (aged 18-94) was collected in a national oral health survey. As well as self-reported information, the maxillary six anterior teeth were examined for signs of dental trauma. Survey weights were used. Results Of the 40.9% (95% CI: 37.6, 44.2) who reported previous orofacial trauma, 69.1% (95% CI: 64.3, 73.5), or just over one-quarter of the sample, reported that this included a dental injury. More males than females had experienced orofacial trauma (51.3% [95% CI: 45.8, 56.8] and 31.4% [95% CI: 27.9, 35.1], respectively). The most common injury was a ?chipped or broken tooth? (66.6%, 95% CI: 60.6, 72.1). Almost three-quarters had sought treatment. Clinical examination revealed an overall trauma prevalence of 23.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 26.0) with more males than females affected. Some 14.9% (95% CI: 12.8, 17.2) had one injured tooth, while 6.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 8.1) had two injured teeth. The maxillary central incisors were the most frequently affected. Most participants with clinical signs of trauma had only one of the six maxillary teeth affected. The most common clinical dental trauma observation was evidence of ?treatment? or an ?untreated enamel fracture?, and these were more common among males and those aged 35-44 years. Conclusion Traumatic dental injuries constitute an important public health issue. More emphasis on preventing them in the NZ adult population is warranted, and public awareness of State-funded cover for dental injuries may need to be bolstered to enable equitable access for injury care. Overall, a greater emphasis on prevention and the importance of initial care for dental injuries could reduce the individual and societal burden.

AB  - Abstract Background With an aging population increasing presentations of cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can be expected to old age services. While progress has been made in recent years in relation to the understanding and development of aetiological theories, classification, assessment and management strategies and protocols in the adult population, similar advances have lagged behind for the elderly. Aims To review the adult literature regarding PTSD and discuss how this might apply to an elderly population. An attempt is made to highlight a better awareness of the field of psychological trauma in the elderly in the hope of stimulating debate and research. Method A review of the adult literature is conducted relating to classification, aetiology, demographic features, vulnerability, assessment, clinical management including psychotherapy and medications and how these may apply to the elderly. Results Little has been published in this field that directly relates to the elderly. The adult literature allows insight into understanding how PTSD may present in the elderly, and how they may be managed. Conclusions Further specific research is needed in the elderly in order to facilitate a better understanding of PTSD that present in this unique population. This will lead to better clinical assessment, management and treatment provision. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the rationale behind and experiences with traditional and newly evolving concepts of fluid therapy in the traumatized patient, and to review conventional and novel fluid preparations for use in trauma resuscitation. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical and research studies. Human data synthesis: Current treatment guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution (LRS) or saline as optimum management of hemorrhagic shock in trauma, regardless of whether bleeding is controlled or not. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore intravascular volume as rapidly as possible to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion. Recently, this strategy has been challenged, especially in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, as neither laboratory evidence nor clinical trials support this practice. Current research indicates that vigorous fluid infusion may exacerbate bleeding and cause severe hemodilution, both impairing resuscitation outcome. As a result, a new line of thinking is emerging that balances the risks and benefits of intravenous volume infusion by offering the clinician alternative treatment strategies and emphasizes continuous endpoint-oriented monitoring. ?Hypotensive? or ?hypovolemic? resuscitation techniques as well as initial volume replacement with fluids other than LRS or saline (e.g., hypertonic saline [HTS], HTS with dextran 70 [HTS-D]) have been introduced in human medical practice as additional options for treatment of victims of trauma under certain circumstances. Clinical studies evaluating the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) in the trauma setting are underway and may soon lead to an expansion of the fluid arsenal available to the clinician for treatment of trauma patients. Veterinary data synthesis: Based on available animal data, neither strict guidelines nor a clear fluid preference for resuscitation of traumatic shock have been defined. Although systematic clinical trials are missing, combinations of crystalloid and colloid (natural or artificial) appear to be as effective for resuscitation as crystalloid alone. Judicious use of an HBOC (e.g., Oxyglobin?) as a substitute for blood/red blood cells may be recommended in situations where whole blood or pRBCs are not or not yet available. Conclusions: The search for optimal methods of fluid resuscitation in trauma is ongoing. At this point the best solution is a differentiated approach to fluid therapy, one that tailors type and volume of resuscitation solution(s) used to the type and severity of injury in an individual patient and uses monitoring of perfusion and oxygenation parameters to guide resuscitation. Crystalloid fluids are effective for resuscitation but may need to be combined with or replaced by colloidal fluids in certain clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract? ??The aim of this work was to study the prevalence and clinical presentation of root fractures in a series of patients with dental trauma. Treatment strategies were classified and outcomes after a 6-month period presented. The study population comprised 76 patients (between the ages of 2 and 55 years) with 93 root fractures in their teeth (18 primary, 75 permanent). Data were collected following the taking of a detailed clinical history, objective clinical examination and photographic and radiological investigation. Since most of the primary teeth were extracted, only cases with root fracture of permanent teeth were followed-up: in all, 24 patients with 31 teeth with root fractures. The prevalence of root fractures in permanent teeth was 7.7% of all injuries, while in primary teeth it was 3.8%. The most frequently involved teeth were the maxillary incisors with a percentage of 75% in permanent teeth. Moreover, 40% of root fractures in permanent teeth were associated with fracture of the alveolar bone and of the soft tissues and in 45% of cases, the adjacent teeth were also injured. The results of this study reaffirm the necessity for scrupulous diagnosis of teeth after a traumatic injury. Adjacent teeth and those in the opposing arch should not be ignored. Treatment is multi-disciplinary, requiring surgical, orthodontic, operative and prosthetic compliance. Periodic check-up is essential.

AB  - Abstract During brain development, a population of uniform embryonic cells migrates and differentiates into a large number of neural phenotypes ? origin of the enormous complexity of the adult nervous system. Processes of cell proliferation, differentiation and programmed death of no longer required cells, do not occur only during embryogenesis, but are also maintained during adulthood and are affected in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease states. As neurogenesis is an endogenous response to brain injury, visible as proliferation (of to this moment silent stem or progenitor cells), its further stimulation can present a treatment strategy in addition to stem cell transfer for cell regeneration therapy. Concise techniques for studying such events in vitro and in vivo permit understanding of underlying mechanisms. Detection of subtle physiological alterations in brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis can be explored, that occur during environmental stimulation, exercise and ageing. Here, we have collected achievements in the field of basic research on applications of cytometry, including automated imaging for quantification of morphological or fluorescence-based parameters in cell cultures, towards imaging of three-dimensional brain architecture together with DNA content and proliferation data. Multi-parameter and more recently in vivo flow cytometry procedures, have been developed for quantification of phenotypic diversity and cell processes that occur during brain development as well as in adulthood, with importance for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Objective Debate concerning the diagnosis of mental health problems has accelerated since the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Despite this, little is known about how multi-disciplinary teams work together in the face of differing views. Method Constructionist thematic analysis was used to analyse data from semi-structured interviews conducted with 20 mental health clinicians based at three acute child and adolescent mental health care units. Case discussions in team meetings were also observed. Results Views regarding diagnosis were largely a function of the role of team members and stratified according to hands-on involvement with young people. Nurses saw it as the least relevant to their practice, clinical psychologists and other allied health professionals were the most critical, and psychiatrists were the most pragmatic about the benefits. Despite these differences, and with a few exceptions, team unity was possible through dialogue regarding formulation. Conclusion Despite academic debates regarding diagnosis, professionals in acute mental health settings can work together effectively if united by psychological formulations.

AB  - Clinico-pathological studies have shown that the clinical diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia (MID) is even more difficult than that of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The study evaluated the significance of course characteristics for the diagnosis of MID and DAT. Course characteristics were rated when 57 demented patients were admitted to our neurogeriatric department. Diagnosis of MID and DAT, respectively, was established after a follow-up study with repeated neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological investigations. In 21 cases diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem neuropathology. MID lacked the typical course of the disease in about two thirds of patients, while most DAT patients presented with the typical course of primary degenerative dementia. Features of the ?typical? clinical course of MID (abrupt onset, stepwise deterioration) helped to exclude DAT, whereas MID could not be excluded on the basis of a history of insidious onset and gradual decline.

AB  - Summary: A multi-institutional study on the prognosis of patients with epilepsy was performed in Japan from 1975 to 1977, including 20 institutions. The outcome of epileptic seizures and social adjustment 10, 5, and 3 years after the onset of the illness was studied in three different groups of epileptic patients, respectively. The number of successfully followed-up cases was 1,868 in total, follow-up rate being 42%. The data were analyzed statistically by use of analysis of variance. The rate of remission of seizures in all was 58.3% and the rate of normal social adjustment 62.6%. The remission rate showed no significant difference among the 10-, 5-, and 3-year outcome groups. The study on the outcome of seizure control indicated that the prognosis of seizure control is more favorable (a) in idiopathic than in residual or symptomatic epileptics; (b) in patients with onset before 10 years of age than in those with onset after 10 years; (c) in patients with less frequent seizures; (d) in sleep epilepsy than in waking and diffuse epilepsies; (e) in patients who started treatment within 1 year of onset of seizure; (f) in patients with single-type partial seizures than in those with partial seizures combined with tonic-clonic seizures; (g) in patients without high grade EEG background abnormality; and (h) in patients without neurological symptoms, intellectual deficits, personality disturbances, or psychotic symptoms. Factors that determine the prognosis of social adjustment were almost similar to those for remission of seizures. There was a close correlation between the outcome of seizure control and that of social adjustment. Correlation coefficient between follow-up rate and remission rate in 15 of the 20 collaborated institutions was 0.55 (p < 0.05), showing a tendency that the remission rate becomes higher as the follow-up rate is raised. RÉSUMÉ Une étude collaborative multi-institutionnelle sur le pronostic des épilepsies a été effectuée au Japon de 1975 à 1977 dans 20 institutions différentes. Le devenir des crises et l'adaptation sociale ont été appréciés chez 3 groupes différents de patients 10 ans, 5 ans et 3 ans après le debut de la maladie. Le nombre des cas dont l'évolution a pu être suivie de façon satisfaisante est de 1868, ce qui répond à une proportion de 42%. Les données ont ete analysees statistiquement par analyse de variance. Le taux de rémission des crises a été au total de 58,3% et le taux d'adaptation sociale normale de 62,6%. Il n'a pas été noté de différence significative du taux de rémission entre les 3 groupes. En ce qui concerne le pronostic des crises, il s'est avéré meilleur: 1o chez les sujets qui présentent une épilepsie idiopathique (et non symptomatique); 2o chez ceux dont les crises sont apparues avant l'âge de 10 ans; 3o chez ceux dont le crises sont rares; 4o chez ceux dont les crises surviennent pendant le sommeil; 5o chez ceux qui ont débuté le traitement dans l'année qui a suivi le début des crises; 6o chez ceux qui présentent un seul type de crises partielles par rapport à ceux dont les crises partielles sont combinees à des crises tonicocloniques; 7o chez ceux dont les rythmes de fond EEG ne sont pas très anormaux; 8o chez ceux qui ne présentent pas de troubles neurologiques, de déficit intellectuel, de troubles de la personnalité ou de symptomes psychotiques. Les facteurs qui déterminent le pronostic de l'adaptation sociale sont à peu près les mêmes que ceux qui concernent la rémission des crises. Il y a d'ailleurs une étroite corrélation entre ces deux pronostics. Le coefficient de corrélation entre le taux de rémission et la durée de l'observation des sujets dans 15 des 20 institutions collaboratives est de 0,55 (p < 0,05) et exprime la tendance pour le taux de rémission d'être d'autant plus grand que la durée d'observation est prolongée. RESUMEN Entre los an?os 1975 y 1977 se realizó en Japón un estudio multi-institucional (abarcando 20 Centros) con objeto de establecer el pronóstico de pacientes con epilepsia. Se estudiaron le evolución de las crisis comiciales y la integración social en 3 grupos diferentes de pacientes epilepticos 10 años, 5 an?os y 3 an?os después del comienzo de la enfermedad. El número de casos seguidos con éxito fue 1.868 en total, siendo la tasa de seguimiento del 42%. Se analizaron estadísticamente los datos por medio del análisis de la varianza. La tasa de remisión de las crisis fue en total del 58,3% y la tasa de ajuste social del 62,6%. La tasa de remisión no mostró diferencias significativas en los grupos evolutivos de 10, 5 y 3 años. El estudio pronóstico reveló que el control de los ataques era más favorable en la epilepsyía idiopática que en la residual o sintomática; en pacientes con un comienzo de las crisis antes de los 10 años de edad que después; en pacientes con crisis menos frecuentes; en epilepsyía relacionada con el sueño que la que tenia lugar durante la vigilia o era difusa; en pacientes que empezaron tratamiento antes del año del inicio de los ataques; en enfermos con un único tipo de crisis parciales que en aquéllos que presentaban crisis parciales y tónico-clonicas; en pacientes sin anomalías groseras de la actividad de fondo en el EEG y en enfermos sin síntomas neurológicos, déficit intelectual, alteraciones de la personalidad o síntomas psicóticos. Los factores que determinaron el pronóstico en lo que respecta a ajuste social eran casi similares a los relacionados con la remisión de los ataques. Hubo una estrecha correlación entre el pronóstico del control de las crisis y el grado de ajuste social. El coeficiente de correlación entre la tasa de revisiones y la tasa de remisiones en 15 de los 20 Centros fue 0,55 (p< 0,05), mostrando una tendencia a que las remisiones fuesen mayores a medida que la tasa de re-evaluaciones aumenta. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Eine kollaborative Studie über die Prognose von Patienten mit Epilepsie wurde in Japan an 20 Institutionen von 1975 bis 1977 durchgeführt. Der Verlauf epileptischer Anfälle und die soziale Anpassung wurden 10 Jahre, 5 Jahre und 3 Jahre nach Beginn der Erkrankung in 3 verschiedenen Gruppen epileptischer Patienten untersucht. Insgesamt wurden 1868 Patienten erfolgreich verfolgt, das sind 42%. Die Daten wurden mit Hilfe der Varianz-analyse statistisch bearbeitet. Die Heilungsquote für alle Anfälle betrug 58,3%, die Rate der normalen sozialen Anpassung 62,6%. Die Heilungsquote zeigte keine deutlichen Unterschiede zwischen den Zehnjahres-, Fünfjahres- und Dreijahresergebnissen. Die Aufschlüsselung ergab, daß die Prognose hinsichtlich Anfallsfreiheit günstiger bei der idiopathischen als bei der residualen Oder symptomatischen Epilepsie ist; günstiger schneiden Patienten mit Anfallsbeginn vor dem Alter von 10 Jahren ab, Patienten mit seltenen Anfällen, Patienten mit Schlaf-Epilepsie verglichen mit Wachoder diffuser Epilepsie, Patienten, bei denen die Behandlung innerhalb eines Jahres nach erstem Anfall eingeleitet wurde, Patienten mit isolierten Herdanfällen als solche mit Partialanfällen kombiniert mit tonisch-klonischen Krämpfen, Patienten ohne hochgradige Hintergrundsveranderungen im EEG, Patienten ohne neurologische Symptome, intellektuelle Defekte, Verhaltungsstorungen oder psychotische Symptome. Die Faktoren, die die Prognose hinsichtlich der sozialen Eingliederung bestimmen, waren ähnlich denen, die eine Anfallsfreiheit entschieden. Der Korrelationskoeffizient zwischen der Verlaufsrate und der Anfallsfreiheit betrug bei 15 der 20 kolla-borierenden Institutionen 0,55 (p < 0,05). Er zeigt somit die Tendenz, daß die Anfallsfreiheit höher wird in dem Maße, in dem die Häufigkeit der Kontroll-untersuchungen zunimmt.

AB  - Background Data examining the effect of operator years in practice and volume on adverse events (AE) after cardiac catheterization in patients with congenital heart disease is limited. Methods and Results Data were prospectively collected using a multi-center registry (C3PO). 10,885 catheterizations performed between 02/07 and 06/10 at eight institutions were included. AE rates were risk-adjusted for hemodynamic vulnerability, procedure type risk group, and age and compared between operators with different years in practice (YIP) and volume. AE occurred in 13% of procedures. Operators with less than five YIP had higher adjusted odds of any AE (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14?1.77) or a high severity AE (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04?1.75), when compared with operators with 5 to less than 25 YIP (5?<?25), while operators with ≥25 YIP had higher odds of a high severity (but not any) AE (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08?1.80). Operators with <5 YIP had a higher percentage of preventable AE (out of all AE, 16% vs. 8%, P?<?0.001) as well as higher odds of vascular or cardiac trauma (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11?2.97), or technical AE (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.31?2.99) when compared with operators with 5?<?25 YIP. There was no consistent relationship between operator volume, and incidence of AE. Conclusions Operators with less than 5 years in practice have higher risk-adjusted AE rates. While an important consideration in guiding and mentoring operators with fewer years in practice, it is important to emphasize that reporting adverse events does not take into account procedural efficacy. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to assess the effects on counselors of working with sexual violence survivors. Members of a women psychologists? organization and a group of sexual violence counselors completed questionnaires regarding the extent of their work with survivors and their psychological functioning. Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported more disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the goodness of other people), more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and more self-reported vicarious trauma. Symptomatology was not related to counselors? own history of victimization. Qualitative data regarding difficult and enjoyable aspects of working with survivors also were gathered, along with data on the strategies used by counselors to cope with work-related stress. implications for counselor training are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) reconstruction at two different slice thicknesses (1?mm, ?high resolution? vs. 5?mm, ?routine?) with respect to the detection of blebs and bullae (BBs) in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Methods Thirty-one patients underwent wedge resection of BBs (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral) for PSP from January 2010 to January 2013. Two observers assessed the presence and locations of BBs independently using high-resolution CT (HRCT) and routine CT reconstruction, and compared the sensitivities of each reconstruction method for BB detection using operative findings as a standard reference. In addition, the number of BBs in each CT image set was recorded and inter-observer agreements were evaluated. Results Sensitivity for the detection of BBs was significantly better for HRCT than routine CT (97.0% vs. 63.6% for observer 1 and 94.0% vs. 57.6% for observer 2, respectively, both P-values?<?0.001). On a per-bleb and a per-bulla basis, inter-observer agreements regarding BBs by HRCT were good and very good (k?=?0.66 and 0.94, respectively) and superior to those determined by routine CT (k?=?0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion Different slice thickness reconstructions influence the diagnostic efficacy of MDCT for the detection of BBs in patients with PSP. High-resolution thin slice CT reconstruction was found to have a significantly greater sensitivity than routine thicker slice thickness reconstruction for the detection of BBs.

AB  - Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives The focus on the diagnosis is a pivotal aspect of medical practice since antiquity. Diagnostic taxonomy helped to categorize ailments to improve medical care, and in its social sense resulted in validation of the sick role for some, but marginalization or stigmatization for others. In the medical industrial complex, diagnostic taxonomy structured health care financing, management and practitioner remuneration. However, with increasing demands from multiple agencies, there are increasing unintended and unwarranted consequences of our current taxonomies and diagnostic processes resulting from the conglomeration of underpinning concepts, theories, information and motivations. Results We argue that the increasing focus on the diagnosis resulted in excessive compartmentalization ? ?partialism? ? of medical practice, diminishing medical care and being naively simplistic in light of the emerging understanding of the interconnected nature of the diseasome. The human is a complex organic system of interconnecting dynamics and feedback loops responding to internal and external forces including genetic, epigenetic and environmental attractors, rather than the sum of multiple discrete organs which can develop isolated diseases or multiple morbidities. Solutions to these unintended consequences of many contemporary health system processes involve revisiting the nature of diagnostic taxonomies and the processes of their construction. A dynamic taxonomic framework would shift to more relevant attractors at personal, clinical and health system levels recognizing the non-linear nature of health and disease. Human health at an individual, group and population level is the ability to adapt to internal and external stressors with resilience throughout the life course, yet diagnostic taxonomies are increasingly constructed around fixed anchors. Conclusions Understanding diagnosis as dissecting, pigeonholing or bean counting (learning by dividing) is no longer useful, the challenge for the future is to understand the big picture (learning by connecting). Diagnostic categorization needs to embrace a meta-learning approach open to human variability.

AB  - Background Patients with traumatic bladder rupture frequently have associated pelvic fracture. With increasing numbers of pelvic fractures fixed internally, there are concerns that conservative management of bladder rupture may increase the risk of pelvic metalware infection. This study aims to determine if operative repair of bladder rupture in comparison to conservative management with catheter drainage alone is associated with a lower rate of infection of internal fixation device for concurrent pelvic fracture. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of level IV evidence. From July 2001 through June 2013, 45 multi-trauma patients at a level 1 trauma centre were identified to have sustained bladder rupture with concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation. Clinicopathological data were extracted from the TraumaNET database, medical records and health-coding database. Patients were stratified into two retrospective cohorts, management with surgical repair and management with catheter drainage alone. Fischer's exact test was used to determine whether the rate of pelvic metalware infection was different in the two cohorts. Results Of the 45 patients, 13 had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, 28 had extraperitoneal bladder rupture and four had combined intra-extraperitoneal bladder rupture. The median age for this cohort was 31. Bladder rupture was surgically repaired in 36 patients and managed conservatively with catheter drainage in nine patients. The rate of pelvic internal fixation device infection was lower in patients managed with surgical repair compared with conservative management (5.6% versus 33.3%, P = 0.047). Conclusion Operative repair of bladder rupture is associated with a lower rate of pelvic orthopaedic hardware infection in the presence of concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation.

AB  - The 2010 earthquakes in Haiti initiated crises for one of the world's poorest nations. This transpired amidst pervasive, pre-disaster hardships, with the resulting situation described as ?acute on chronic? trauma exposure. The current paper provides a description of a dynamic model focused on three factors of consideration for similar crises: cultural context, unfolding traumatic events and developmental processes. Knowledge from developmental psychology can inform humanitarian aid efforts to effectively address the unique needs of children. Recommendations are offered for research, clinical work and policy related to the mental health needs of children where ?acute on chronic? conditions exist.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a challenging condition for which there is no reference standard for treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide outcome data on the largest study to date evaluating pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for ON and to determine whether any demographic, clinical, or treatment characteristics are associated with success. Design.? Retrospective data analysis was conducted in 102 subjects evaluating the effect of myriad factors on treatment success. Setting.? This study was conducted in academic civilian and military pain treatment centers. Patients.? One hundred and two consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of ON were treated with PRF of the greater and/or lesser occipital nerve. Outcome Measures.? A positive primary outcome was predefined as ≥50% pain relief lasting at least 3 months. The secondary outcome measure was procedural satisfaction. Results.? Fifty-two (51%) patients experienced ≥50% pain relief and satisfaction with treatment lasting at least 3 months. Variables associated with a positive outcome included a traumatic inciting event (65.7% success rate; P?=?0.03), lower diagnostic block volumes (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62?0.82; P?<?0.0001), and employment of multiple rounds of PRF (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.77?4.92; P?<?0.0001). Factors correlating with treatment failure included extension of pain anterior to the scalp apex (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14?0.73; P?=?0.006) and ongoing secondary gain issues (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11?0.33; P?<?0.0001). Conclusion.? PRF may provide intermediate-term benefit in ON to a significant proportion of refractory cases. Careful attention to selection criteria and treatment parameters may further improve treatment outcomes.
