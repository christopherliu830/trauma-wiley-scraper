AB  - Background Patients with traumatic bladder rupture frequently have associated pelvic fracture. With increasing numbers of pelvic fractures fixed internally, there are concerns that conservative management of bladder rupture may increase the risk of pelvic metalware infection. This study aims to determine if operative repair of bladder rupture in comparison to conservative management with catheter drainage alone is associated with a lower rate of infection of internal fixation device for concurrent pelvic fracture. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of level IV evidence. From July 2001 through June 2013, 45 multi-trauma patients at a level 1 trauma centre were identified to have sustained bladder rupture with concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation. Clinicopathological data were extracted from the TraumaNET database, medical records and health-coding database. Patients were stratified into two retrospective cohorts, management with surgical repair and management with catheter drainage alone. Fischer's exact test was used to determine whether the rate of pelvic metalware infection was different in the two cohorts. Results Of the 45 patients, 13 had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, 28 had extraperitoneal bladder rupture and four had combined intra-extraperitoneal bladder rupture. The median age for this cohort was 31. Bladder rupture was surgically repaired in 36 patients and managed conservatively with catheter drainage in nine patients. The rate of pelvic internal fixation device infection was lower in patients managed with surgical repair compared with conservative management (5.6% versus 33.3%, P = 0.047). Conclusion Operative repair of bladder rupture is associated with a lower rate of pelvic orthopaedic hardware infection in the presence of concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Survival and causes of death of 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) were examined. The patients were originally found in a community-based epidemiological survey of dementia, and all patients with AD or MID alive on the prevalence day were included. The 6-years survival rate for AD was 21.1% vs. the expected rate 48.5%, that for MID 11.9% vs. 45.2% expected. A comparison of relative survival rates suggested that MID carries a less favorable survival prognosis than AD. The mean durations were: AD 5.7 years and MID 5.2 years; median duration being 5 years in both diseases. The excess mortality in both AD and MID was independent of age. In AD, the survival rate decreased with increasing severity of dementia, while in MID the mortality was the same regardless of the severity of the dementia. The dementia disorder was the underlying cause of death in 68% of AD patients, and in 38% of MID patients, bronchopneumonia being the most frequent immediate cause of death in both groups. As a cause of death, acute cerebrovascular accidents occurred more often in MID patients than in the general population of comparable age. Malignant diseases were less frequent as a cause of death in both dementia groups than in the general population.

AB  - Abstract??? Traumatic granuloma is an uncommon condition considered to be a benign, reactive lesion that usually affects the tongue. The exact pathogenesis implicated in the development of this lesion is not clear. However, trauma has been found to be a contributing factor in a majority of the cases. Clinically, it often presents as an ulceration or an indurated submucosal mass. Microscopically, it is characterized by a diffuse polymorphic cell infiltrate composed predominantly of eosinophils extending deep into the submucosa causing degeneration of the underlying muscle. Recognition of the lesion is important because it often mimics oral squamous cell carcinoma. But traumatic granuloma is self-limiting and tends to resolve spontaneously. This paper describes a case of traumatic granuloma on the dorsal surface of tongue in a 62-year-old woman. The clinical aspects, pathogenesis and histopathology of this uncommon lesion are discussed with an emphasis on its benign, self-limiting nature.

AB  - Recent scientific reports and popular press describing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) collectively link this condition to a broad array of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including extremely rare and multi-determined behaviors such as murder-suicide. These reports are difficult to reconcile with several decades of research on the science of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its consequences, especially the natural history and prognosis of mild TBI. This article attempts to reconcile these sources by reviewing the state of the science on CTE, with particular attention to case definitions and neuropathological criteria for this diagnosis. The evidence for links between TBI, CTE, and catastrophic clinical events is explored, and the complexity of attributing rare frequency behavioral events to CTE is highlighted. The clinical and medicolegal implications of the best available evidence are discussed, concluding with a cautionary note against prematurely generalizing current findings on CTE to entire populations of persons with, or at risk for, concussion exposures.

AB  - Abstract Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health costs. Although a wide range of psychological therapies have been used in the treatment of PTSD there are no systematic reviews of these therapies in children and adolescents. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of psychological therapies in treating children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with PTSD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to December 2011. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 -), MEDLINE (1950 -) and PsycINFO (1967 -). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. We applied no date or language restrictions. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies compared to a control, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or adolescents exposed to a traumatic event or diagnosed with PTSD. Data collection and analysis Two members of the review group independently extracted data. If differences were identified, they were resolved by consensus, or referral to the review team. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes, the standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both, using a fixed-effect model. If heterogeneity was found we used a random-effects model. Main results Fourteen studies including 758 participants were included in this review. The types of trauma participants had been exposed to included sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a trauma-related support service. The psychological therapies used in these studies were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure-based, psychodynamic, narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Most compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No study compared psychological therapies to pharmacological therapies alone or as an adjunct to a psychological therapy. Across all psychological therapies, improvement was significantly better (three studies, n = 80, OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.85) and symptoms of PTSD (seven studies, n = 271, SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.42), anxiety (three studies, n = 91, SMD -0.57, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.13) and depression (five studies, n = 156, SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.36) were significantly lower within a month of completing psychological therapy compared to a control group. The psychological therapy for which there was the best evidence of effectiveness was CBT. Improvement was significantly better for up to a year following treatment (up to one month: two studies, n = 49, OR 8.64, 95% CI 2.01 to 37.14; up to one year: one study, n = 25, OR 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69). PTSD symptom scores were also significantly lower for up to one year (up to one month: three studies, n = 98, SMD -1.34, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.89; up to one year: one study, n = 36, SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.01), and depression scores were lower for up to a month (three studies, n = 98, SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.13) in the CBT group compared to a control. No adverse effects were identified. No study was rated as a high risk for selection or detection bias but a minority were rated as a high risk for attrition, reporting and other bias. Most included studies were rated as an unclear risk for selection, detection and attrition bias. Authors' conclusions There is evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for treating PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. At this stage, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to others. There is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to psychological therapies than others. The findings of this review are limited by the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small size of identified studies. In addition, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of all psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other treatments. More details are required in future trials in regards to the types of trauma that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD and whether the traumas are single event or ongoing. Future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and reliable measures of PTSD symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and sub-scores, are consistently reported. Plain Language Summary Psychological therapies for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health costs. The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of all psychological therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents.  We searched for all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies to a control, other psychological therapies or other therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years. We identified 14 studies with a total of 758 participants. The types of trauma related to the PTSD were sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a trauma-related support service. The psychological therapies used in the included studies were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure-based, psychodynamic, narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Most included studies compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No study compared psychological therapies to medications or medications in combination with a psychological therapy. There was fair evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in the longer term and to be able to compare the effectiveness of one psychological therapy to another. The findings of this review are limited by the potential for bias in the included studies, possible differences between studies which could not be identified, the small number of identified studies and the low number of participants in most studies.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the relationship between emotions, depression and eating disorders. Initially, a review is undertaken of the current state of the research and clinical literature with regard to emotional factors in eating disorders. This literature is then integrated within a version of the multi-level model of emotion proposed by Power and Dalgleish. The aim of this paper is to incorporate a basic emotions, multi-modal perspective into developing a new emotions-based model that offers a theoretical understanding of psychological mechanisms in eating disorders. Within the new Schematic Propositional Analogical Associative Representation System model applied to eating disorders, it is argued that the emotions of anger and disgust are of importance in eating disorders and that the eating disorder itself operates as an inhibitor of emotions within the self. It is hoped that the development of a multi-levelled model of eating disorders will allow for the construction of number of specific testable hypotheses that are relevant to future research into the psychological treatment and understanding of eating disorders.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: The central importance of emotions in eating disorders, and these emotions can operate over a number of cognitive levels of processing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity of platelets of an age- and sex-matched group of controls was compared with several groups of inpatients having non-familial dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), Parkinson's disease (PD), multi-infarct dementia (MID), mixed types of these 3 diseases and a group of other central nervous system (CNS) organic disorders. All patients were subjected to several psychometric tests, including the Sandoz Clinical Assessment - Geriatric Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Mini-Mental State Examination and the Organic Mental Disorder Scale (OMDS). A statistically significant enhancement of MAO-B activity could be observed in DAT patients and in PD patients, whereas the MID group showed a mean activity similar to that of the control group and the group with other organic CNS disorders. In DAT patients the degree of dementia in the OMDS test and the enhancement of MAO activity were positively correlated, but PD did not show such a correlation. It is concluded that the increase of MAO activity in PD and in DAT might be due to a disease-related enhanced affinity to oxygen and to such oxygen-derived radicals as superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. However, a possible drug-induced enhancement of MAO activity in PD cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the MAO-B activity values in platelets of individual patients or controls are not indicative of diagnosis or prognosis of any of these diseases and are of no disease-related specificity.

AB  - Abstract Aim Determine the effect of traumatic event re-exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity on proximal drug use and drug abuse treatment-seeking in syringe exchange participants. Design Prospective longitudinal 16-month cohort study of new syringe exchange registrants enrolled in a parent study of methods to improve treatment engagement. Setting Data were collected in a research van next to mobile syringe exchange distribution sites in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants Male and female (n?=?162) injecting drug users (IDUs) registered for syringe exchange. Measurements Traumatic event re-exposure was identified each month with the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire. PTSD symptoms were measured with the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale?Revised, given every 4 months. Outcome measures collected monthly were days of drug use (heroin, cocaine) and drug abuse treatment-seeking behavior (interest, calls to obtain treatment, treatment participation). Findings Each traumatic event re-exposure was associated with about 1 more day of cocaine use after accounting for the previous month's cocaine use [same month adjusted B, standard error?=?1.16 (0.34); 1 month later: 0.99 (0.34)], while PTSD symptoms had no effect. Traumatic event re-exposure increased interest in drug abuse treatment [same month adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals?=?1.34 (1.11?1.63)] and calling to obtain treatment [same month 1.58 (1.24?2.01); 1 month later 1.34 (1.03?1.75)]. Each 10% increase in PTSD symptom severity was associated with persistent increased interest in treatment [same month 1.25 (1.10?1.42); 1 month later 1.16 (1.02?1.32); 2 months later 1.16 (1.02?1.32)] and calling to obtain treatment [same month 1.16 (1.02?1.32)]. Neither traumatic events nor PTSD symptoms were associated with participants receiving treatment. Conclusions Becoming exposed again to traumatic events among injecting drug users is associated with an increase in cocaine use up to 1 month later, but drug use is not related to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Both traumatic event re-exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms predict drug abuse treatment-seeking behavior for up to 2 months.

Materials and Methods: This work is health insurance portability and accountability act compliant. High resolution T1-weighted, dual echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion tensor MRI images were prospectively acquired on 68 RRMS patients (range, 25?58 years) and 68 age-matched controls. The data were analyzed using standardized human brain atlas-based tissue segmentation procedures to obtain regional volumes and their corresponding T2 relaxation times and DTI maps. Results: Group-averaged brain atlas-based qMRI maps of T2, fractional anisotropy and diffusivities are visually presented and compared between controls and RRMS. The analysis shows a widespread injury in RRMS. Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) was substantial in RRMS. The qMRI attributes of the neocortex in combination with the CC such as T2 and diffusivities were elevated and correlated with disability. Conclusion: Using a standardized multimodal qMRI acquisition and analyses that accounted for lesion distribution we demonstrate that cerebral pathology is widespread in RRMS. Our analysis of CC and neocortex qMRI metrics in relation to disability points to a neurodegenerative injury component that is independent from lesions. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Despite clinical observations that many veterans have multiple sources of war-related guilt, many problematic guilt issues are commonly not treated or even detected by clinicians. We describe development of a survey that systematically assesses idiosyncratic sources of guilt across the spectrum of events that are potential sources of trauma-related guilt from the war-zone. A multimethod strategy was used to develop a survey with strong content validity. Results indicate the survey is temporally stable, substantially correlated with other measures of guilt, and highly correlated with measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Findings confirm that many Vietnam veterans have multiple sources of severe war-related guilt. The survey may have important clinical utility for problem identification, treatment planning, and evaluating treatment efficacy.

AB  - Importance There is a paucity of evidence analysing the treatment of cyclodialysis clefts. Background We describe outcomes following the treatment of this rare condition at six centres internationally. Design Retrospective case series. Participants Thirty-six patients with a cyclodialysis cleft from 2003 to 2017 were recruited. Methods Clefts were treated with cycloplegic agents, laser therapy and/or surgery. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative best recorded visual acuity (BRVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and the rate of cleft closure. Results The mean age was 45?±?17?years and 29 (80.6%) patients were male. One eye (2.8%) received only medical therapy, 5 (13.9%) received laser, 14 (38.9%) underwent surgery after laser failure and 16 (44.4%) eyes received exclusively surgery. Over 80% of eyes had a BRVA improvement of more than two lines. Closure was attained in 30 eyes (93.8%; n?=?32), with postoperative stabilized IOP?≥?12?mmHg in 29 eyes (80.6%; n?=?36) and postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 in 20 eyes (58.8%; n?=?34). Improved postoperative BRVA was related to better preoperative BRVA (P =?0.006) and preoperative IOP?≥?4?mmHg (P =?0.03). There was no significant difference between treatment approach for IOP?≥?12?mmHg (P =?0.85) or postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 (P =?0.80). Only two eyes at last follow-up required IOP lowering medication. Conclusions and Relevance There was a high closure rate with most eyes eventually requiring surgery. Clinically significant improvements in BRVA were found in most eyes. Improved postoperative BRVA was significantly related to better preoperative BRVA and IOP.

AB  - Objective To evaluate outcome and adverse events following ventral stabilization of the atlantoaxial (AA) joint in dogs with clinical AA subluxation using screw/polymethymethacrylate (PMMA) constructs in a retrospective, multi-center cohort study. Study Design Historical cohort study. Animals 35 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 3 institutions were reviewed to identify dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw and PMMA constructs. Data on signalment, pre- and postoperative neurologic status, imaging performed, and adverse events were retrieved. Neurologic examination data were abstracted to generate a modified Frankel score at admission, discharge, and re-examination. Telephone interview of owners >180 days postoperative was conducted. Results Thirty-five dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw/PMMA constructs were included. Most dogs were young (median age 1 year), small breed dogs with acute onset of neurologic signs (median duration 22.5 hours). Most dogs were non-ambulatory at the time of admission (median modified Frankel score 3). Adverse events were identified in 15/35 dogs including 9 dogs with major adverse events. Four dogs required a second surgery due to vertebral canal violation (n?=?2) or implant failure (n?=?2). Re-examination at 4?6 weeks postoperative reported 15/28 dogs with improved neurologic status and 19/28 dogs were ambulatory. Telephone follow-up was available for 23/35 dogs with 23/23 reported as ambulatory (median follow-up 390 days). Conclusions Ventral application of screw and PMMA constructs for AA subluxation, as described here, is associated with clinical improvement in the majority of dog. Major adverse events are infrequent and the technique is considered relatively safe.

AB  - Abstract Research diagnostic interviews need to discriminate between closely related disorders in order to allow comorbidity among mental disorders to be studied reliably. Yet conventional studies of diagnostic validity generally focus on single disorders and do not examine discriminant validity. The current study examines the validity of fully-structured diagnoses of closely-related distress disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, and dysthymic disorder) in the lay-administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI) with independent clinical diagnoses based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A). The NCS-A is a national survey of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) among 10,148 adolescents. A probability sub-sample of 347 of these adolescents and their parents were administered blinded follow-up K-SADS interviews. Good concordance [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)] was found between diagnoses based on the CIDI and the K-SADS for generalized anxiety disorder (AUC?=?0.78), post-traumatic stress disorder (AUC?=?0.79), and major depressive episode/dysthymic disorder (AUC?=?0.86). Further, the CIDI was able to effectively discriminate among different types of distress disorders in the sub-sample of respondents with any distress disorder.
