AB  - Abstract We investigated the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) module's trauma screen of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), a single-item traumatic event history query. Compared to the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (SLESQ), the SCID trauma screen was 76% sensitive in identifying trauma histories in 199 medical patients (correctly ruling out 67%) but only 66% sensitive in 253 college students (ruling out 87%). A modified, more behaviorally specific SCID trauma screen (M-SCID) yielded poorer results in identifying trauma among 245 additional college students. Based on probable PTSD diagnoses (PTSD Symptom Scale), using the SCID screen instead of the SLESQ, 3% (M-SCID screen) to 11?14% (standard SCID) of PTSD cases were missed due to not having a trauma history. Our results lend support to previous research establishing the SCID trauma screen as a useful screening device in settings where a more comprehensive trauma screen is not possible.

AB  - Abstract Objective Evidence-based decision-making tools are widely used to guide cervical spine assessment in adult trauma patients. Similar tools validated for use in injured children are lacking. A paediatric-specific approach is appropriate given important differences in cervical spine anatomy, mechanism of spinal injury and concerns over ionising radiation in children. The present study aims to survey physicians' knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment in injured children. Methods A cross-sectional survey of physicians actively engaged in trauma care within a paediatric trauma centre was undertaken. Participation was voluntary and responses de-idenitified. The survey comprised 20 questions regarding initial assessment, imaging, immobilisation and perioperative management. Physicians' responses were compared with available current evidence. Results Sixty-seven physicians (28% registrars, 17% fellows and 55.2% consultants) participated. Physicians rated altered mental state, intoxication and distracting injury as the most important contraindications to cervical spine clearance in children. Fifty-four per cent considered adequate plain imaging to be 3-view cervical spine radiographs (anterior?posterior, lateral and odontoid), whereas 30% considered CT the most sensitive modality for detecting unstable cervical spine injuries. Physicians' responses reflected marked heterogeneity regarding semi-rigid cervical collars and what constitutes cervical spine ?clearance?. Greater consensus existed for perioperative precautions in this setting. Conclusions Physicians actively engaged in paediatric trauma care demonstrate marked heterogeneity in their knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment. This is compounded by a lack of paediatric-specific evidence and definitions, involvement of multiple specialties and staff turnover within busy departments. A validated decision-making tool for cervical spine assessment will represent an important advance in paediatric trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background: Efforts to develop and validate fully-structured diagnostic interviews of mental disorders in non-Western countries have been largely unsuccessful. However, the principled methods of translation, harmonization, and calibration that have been developed by cross-national survey methodologists have never before been used to guide such development efforts. The current report presents the results of a rigorous program of research using these methods designed to modify and validate the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for an epidemiological survey in Nepal. Methods: A five-step process of translation, harmonization, and calibration was used to modify the instrument. A blinded clinical reappraisal design was used to validate the instrument. Results: Preliminary interviews with local mental health expert led to a focus on major depressive episode, mania/hypomania, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder. After an iterative process of multiple translations-revisions guided by the principles developed by cross-national survey methodologists, lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses based on the final Nepali CIDI had excellent concordance with diagnoses based on blinded Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) clinical reappraisal interviews. Conclusions: Valid assessment of mental disorders can be achieved with fully-structured diagnostic interviews even in low-income non-Western settings with rigorous implementation of replicable developmental strategies.

AB  - Abstract Background The Trauma Pod (TP) vision is to develop a rapidly deployable robotic system to perform critical acute stabilization and/or surgical procedures, autonomously or in a teleoperative mode, on wounded soldiers in the battlefield who might otherwise die before treatment in a combat hospital could be provided. Methods In the first phase of a project pursuing this vision, a robotic TP system was developed and its capability demonstrated by performing selected surgical procedures on a patient phantom. Results The system demonstrates the feasibility of performing acute stabilization procedures with the patient being the only human in the surgical cell. The teleoperated surgical robot is supported by autonomous robotic arms and subsystems that carry out scrub-nurse and circulating-nurse functions. Tool change and supply delivery are performed automatically and at least as fast as performed manually by nurses. Tracking and counting of the supplies is performed automatically. The TP system also includes a tomographic X-ray facility for patient diagnosis and two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic data to support interventions. The vast amount of clinical protocols generated in the TP system are recorded automatically. Conclusions Automation and teleoperation capabilities form the basis for a more comprehensive acute diagnostic and management platform that will provide life-saving care in environments where surgical personnel are not present.

AB  - Summary.? Current diagnostic management of hemodynamically stable patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) consists of the accurate and rapid distinction between the approximate 20?25% of patients who have acute PE and require anticoagulant treatment, and the overall majority of patients who do not have the disease in question. Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated that, using algorithms with sequential diagnostic tests, PE can be safely ruled out in patients with a clinical probability indicating PE to be unlikely and a normal D-dimer test result. This obviates the need for additional radiological imaging tests in 20?40% of patients. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the first line tool to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with a likely probability of PE or an elevated D-dimer blood concentration. While single-row-detector technology CTPA has a low sensitivity for PE and bilateral compression ultrasound (CUS) of the lower limbs is considered necessary to rule out PE, multi-row-detector CTPA is safe to exclude PE without the confirmatory use of CUS.

The present article reviews the clinical and imaging clearance of the thoracic and lumbar spines of blunt trauma victims and the evolution of these strategies with the use of new imaging technologies. Methods:? A comprehensive literature search was performed, and articles identified were critically appraised Results:? Twenty papers were identified, 12 directly comparing computed tomography screening with plain X-rays. Evidence-based protocols are presented. The evolution of imaging strategies in response to new technology is described. Conclusions:? Thoracolumbar spine screening is best done using reformatted images acquired when scanning the chest and abdomen of high-risk multi-trauma patients. If computed tomography is not clinically indicated for investigation of other injuries then plain films are the first line investigation.

AB  - Audit is the evaluation of patient care. The care of the injured patient commences at the accident scene and involves prehospital triage and management, emergency hospital assessment and resuscitation, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, operative surgery, intensive care unit management, acute hospital care and rehabilitation. Audit assesses the delivery of trauma care and clinical management and through identification of inadequacies facilitates the introduction of appropriate improvements. Both the American National Academy of Sciences?National Research Council and the Australian National Health & Medical Research Council have recommended the establishment of an audit process to evaluate the quality of trauma management and to obtain quality assurance. They have advised that this process would be assisted by the development of regional trauma registries and a uniform approach to the grading of injuries. Reduction in the preventable death rate, frequency of complications and duration of hospitalization has followed audits as a result of changes in the organization and quality of trauma care. In the United States, for example, the preventable death rate after injury was reduced from 35 to 15% in Orange County, California and from 14 to 3% in San Diego County, California. Studies from Great Britain, The Netherlands, Canada, Australia and elsewhere have further supported the view that trauma audit modifies practice leading to reductions in mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2010) 16, 188?192 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and psychological characteristics of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients with trauma history. Materials and methods:? The clinical and psychological characteristics of 34 TMD patients with trauma history were compared with those of 340 TMD patients without trauma history. Craniomandibular index (CMI) was used for clinical characteristics of TMD patients. Symptom severity index (SSI) was used to assess the multiple dimensions of pain. Symptom checklist-90-revision (SCL-90-R) was used for psychological evaluation. Results:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed significantly higher CMI and palpation index. TMD patients with trauma history also exhibited higher values in duration, sensory intensity, affective intensity, tolerability, scope of symptom, and total SSI score. In addition, these patients showed significantly higher values in symptom dimensions of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation. Among the symptom dimensions of SCL-90-R, somatization showed the most significant correlations with CMI and SSI. Conclusions:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed more severe subjective, objective, and psychological dysfunction than those without trauma history. Pain of myogenous origin, history of physical trauma, and psychosocial dysfunction were all closely related.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To investigate differences between paediatric patients with moderate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatric ED, with respect to: demographics, patterns of presentation, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores (ISS), interventions and outcome. Method:? Retrospective cohort study. Moderate to severe trauma was defined as ISS >9. Paediatric patients admitted to hospital via Starship Children's Emergency or KidzFirst ED, with trauma from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, with ISS >9 were identified using multiple databases. The charts were reviewed and data collected included: demographics, hospital of first presentation, diagnoses, ISS, Paediatric trauma score (PTS), Glasgow coma score (GCS), ventilator hours, length of admission, survival and discharge destination. Descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals, Mann?Whitney U-test, ?2-test and Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. Results:? A total of 393 children with moderate to severe trauma were identified using initial search strategies. Of these, 82 children met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study; 42 children were admitted via KidzFirst ED and 40 via Starship Children's ED. There was no statistically significant difference in ISS (P= 0.86), PTS (P= 0.11), GCS (P= 0.62), hours on a ventilator (P= 0.28) and length of stay (P= 0.87) between children admitted from Starship or KidzFirst ED. Conclusion:? This study suggests that there are no differences in the numbers or severity of paediatric trauma patients admitted from the Starship and KidzFirst ED. This indicates triage is to the closest ED despite having a tertiary referral centre for paediatric trauma available in Auckland City.

AB  - Summary Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) represent two expressions of a similar clinical pathological process, often referred to as venous throm-boembolism (VTE). It has long been recognized that, as clinical signs and symptoms of PE and DVT are not specific for the diagnosis, objective diagnosis in both patients presenting with leg symptoms and those with chest symptoms is mandatory. Since the last review on this subject in this journal in 2009, several large trials have been performed that shed new light on all aspects of the diagnostic management of suspected VTE, especially in the field of simplified clinical decision rules, age-dependent D-dimer cut-offs and magnetic resonance imaging. A literature search covering the period 2007?2012 was performed using the Medline/PubMed database to identify all relevant papers regarding the diagnostic management of acute PE and DVT. Established concepts and the latest evidence on this subject will be the main focus of this review.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents an ecological view of psychological trauma and trauma recovery. Individual differences in posttraumatic response and recovery are the result of complex interactions among person, event, and environmental factors. These interactions define the interrelationship of individual and community and together may foster or impede individual recovery. The ecological model proposes a multidimensional definition of trauma recovery and suggests that the efficacy of trauma-focused interventions depends on the degree to which they enhance the person-community relationship and achieve ?ecological fit? within individually varied recovery contexts. In attending to the social, cultural and political context of victimization and acknowledging that survivors of traumatic experiences may recover without benefit of clinical intervention, the model highlights the phenomenon of resiliency, and the relevance of community intervention efforts.

AB  - Abstract Background Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) occurs in 0.2?2.7% of blunt trauma patients and has up to 30% mortality. Conventional screening does not recognize up to 20% of BCVI patients. To improve diagnosis of BCVI, both an expanded battery of screening criteria and a multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been suggested. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of CTA restricted to the Denver protocol screen-positive patients would reduce the unnecessary use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool. Methods This is a registry-based study of blunt trauma patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital from 1998 to 2012. The diagnosis of BCVI was confirmed or excluded with CTA, magnetic resonance angiography and, if these imaging were non-conclusive, four-vessel digital subtraction angiography. Results Thirty (61%) BCVI and 19 (39%) non-BCVI patients met eligibility criteria. The Denver protocol applied to our cohort of patients had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83?100%) and a specificity of 42% (95% CI: 20?67%). With a prevalence of BCVI in blunt trauma patients of 0.2% and 2.7%, post-test odds of a screen-positive test were 0.03 (95% CI: 0.002?0.005) and 0.046 (95% CI: 0.314?0.068), respectively. Conclusions Application of the CTA to the Denver protocol screen-positive trauma patients can decrease the use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool by 95?97% and reduces its hazards.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Laryngeal trauma is an infrequent diagnosis with a scarcity of published data. We aim to further define the factors associated with positive surgical outcomes of adult laryngeal trauma. Study Design: Multi-institution database analysis. Methods: Of the 1.9 million trauma cases from the National Trauma Database (NTDB), 564 adult trauma events were selected with ICD-9 codes specific to laryngeal trauma. Results: Laryngeal trauma was seen predominately in white (61.5%), middle-aged (40.6 years), male (83.7%) patients experiencing blunt (70.7%) laryngeal injury with multiorgan system (92.2%) trauma. There was an overall 17.9% mortality rate. Within the 564 cases, 133 direct laryngoscopies, 185 tracheostomies, 53 laryngeal suturing, and 60 laryngeal fracture repairs were performed. In univariate negative binomial regression models, trauma severity (P ≤ .01), placement of tracheostomy (P lt; .01), and delayed tracheostomy placement (P = .04, .03, .048) were associated with increased ventilator dependence, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and overall hospital admission duration. Multivariate regression models demonstrated significant associations between tracheostomy performed within 24 hours and shortened ICU stay (P = .03, ? = ?.28, SE = 1.7) and overall hospital stay (P = .009, ? = ?.23, SE = 3.1). Conclusions: The NTDB allows study of the largest laryngeal trauma cohort in modern literature. Although complexities arise in the treatment of laryngeal traumas, when indicated, surgical airway should be placed within 24 hours of presentation to improve the overall hospital course.

AB  - Abstract Trauma-informed practices in the juvenile justice system are increasingly recognized as effective for promoting public safety through case management, rehabilitation, and treatment that is responsive to a traumatic event exposure and current trauma reactions. As court systems explore integration of trauma-informed practices, tools for identifying best practices and strategically implementing trauma-informed approaches are integral for judges and court administrators aiming to develop trauma-informed courts. The current paper reviews the National Child Traumatic Stress Network's development of the Trauma-Informed Juvenile Court Self-Assessment (TI-JCSA). Implications for self-guided strategies to shift court practices and policies to align with trauma-informed approaches will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Hemoperitoneum in the hypotensive trauma patient is an indication for emergent laparotomy. Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) is a widely used tool for detecting hemoperitoneum. The usefulness of FAST is currently limited by low sensitivity. We hypothesize rolling patients onto their right side will pool small volumes of fluid into the right upper quadrant of the abdomen leading to increased sensitivity. Methods Peritoneal dialysis patients were recruited for voluntary participation in a small pilot prospective clinical trial. Each participant first underwent a supine FAST followed by a 30-second roll onto the right side. Once back in the supine position, the FAST was repeated (FASTeR or FAST examination after right-sided roll). About 50?mL aliquots of dialysate were sequentially infused into the abdomen and the imaging sequence repeated until a positive finding was obtained. Results Seven patients were consented for the study. One patient was found to have an equivocal examination secondary to renal cysts. All six remaining participants converted to a positive FASTeR at an intra-abdominal fluid volume at which standard FAST was negative. Conclusions Rolling patients to the right side increased FAST sensitivity, converting false-negative to true positives examinations. A larger study is needed to validate our preliminary data.

AB  - Abstract Trauma to the facial area accounts for a significant number of admissions to the emergency department. Diagnostic imaging is almost always required, and is critical in determining patient management. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) appears consistently in the literature as the gold-standard imaging modality for facial bones, but results in a high radiation dose to the patient. This makes the application and advancement of dose reduction and dose optimisation methods vital. This narrative review presents a critical analysis of the literature concerning diagnostic imaging of facial bone trauma, with an emphasis on dose reduction methods for MDCT. Databases including Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Scopus were used to investigate this topic, with the key words: facial bone trauma, computed tomography (CT) imaging and dose reduction. Exclusion criteria included studies on nasal bone fracturing, dental imaging, elective surgeries and paediatric imaging. The literature shows overwhelming support for MDCT, given its accuracy, efficiency and ease of operation. Noise reducing reconstruction algorithms show promise as a successful method of dose reduction in facial bone imaging. Investigations of more innovative techniques also appear within the literature, including diagnostic cone-beam CT (CBCT), intraoperative CBCT and dual-source CT (DSCT), but further research is required to confirm their clinical value.

AB  - Objective To review the guidelines released in the last decade by several organisations for the optimal evaluation and management of genitourinary injuries (renal, ureteric, bladder, urethral and genital). Methods This is a review of the genitourinary trauma guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), and renal trauma guidelines from the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). Results Most recommendations are guided by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) organ injury severity system. Grade A evidence is rare in genitourinary trauma, and most recommendations are based on Grade B or C evidence. The findings of the most recent urological trauma guidelines are summarised. All guidelines recommend conservative management for low-grade injuries. The major difference is for haemodynamically stable patients who have high-grade renal trauma; the SIU guidelines recommend exploratory laparotomy, the EAU guidelines recommend renal exploration only if the injury is vascular, and the AUA guidelines recommend initial conservative management. Conclusion There is generally consensus among the three guidelines. Recommendations are based on observational or retrospective studies, as well as clinical principles and expert opinions. Multi-institutional collaborative research can improve the quality of evidence and direct more effective evaluation and management of urological trauma.

AB  - Summary? In this selective study, 59% of the patients had a renal injury (laceration, rupture or pedicle injury). A normal IVU excluded significant renal injury after blunt trauma. Renal angiography was more accurate than ultrasonography or computed tomography in determining the extent of the injury. A retroperitoneal haematoma found during laparotomy should be explored if significant renal trauma cannot be excluded. Renal salvage after rupture or pedicle injury should be attempted in stable patients.
