AB  - Objectives To compare the progression-free survival of dogs with high-grade T-cell lymphoma treated with either a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone-based or a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine chemotherapy protocol. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, cases were selected based on histologic or cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma, T-cell phenotype, hypercalcaemia, or both, and no previous chemotherapy for lymphoma. Treatment was not randomly allocated. Results Seventy-three dogs were included in this study: 50 in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 23 in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. The median progression-free survival was 133?days for dogs in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 97?days for dogs in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. When golden retrievers (n?=?16) were evaluated ?separately, progression-free survival was longer in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone versus mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine treatment group (median PFS 154?days versus 70.5 days, respectively). Clinical Significance The progression-free survival time for dogs with multi-centric T-cell lymphoma treated with a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine protocol was similar to that of dogs treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Further studies, including those evaluating golden retrievers separately, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Summary Spinal clearance in unconscious children following traumatic brain injury is an area of controversy. The risk of significant injury in this high-risk group needs to be balanced against that of prolonged spinal immobilization and all its implications. No national or international guideline exists to aid clinicians faced with such a scenario. This article reviews traumatic spinal injury in children looking at prevalence, risk factors, anatomical considerations, and radiological investigation. Spinal immobilization is discussed along with the use of appropriate and targeted radiological investigations to aid clearance.

AB  - A consensus-validation study used action research methods to identify relevant nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions, and patient outcomes for a population of adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in long-term care. In meetings totaling 159 hours to reach 100% consensus through group discussions, the three classifications of NANDA International's (NANDA-I's) approved nursing diagnoses, the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), and the Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) were used as the basis for three nurses experienced in working with adults with TBI to select the elements of nursing care. Among almost 200 NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, 29 were identified as relevant for comprehensive nursing care of this population. Each nursing diagnosis was associated with 3?11 of the more than 500 NIC interventions and 1?13 of more than 300 NOC outcomes. The nurses became aware of the complexity and the need for critical thinking. The findings were used to refine the facility's nursing standards of care, which were to be combined with the interdisciplinary plan of care and included in future electronic health records.

AB  - Abstract Adolescents are at high risk for violence exposure and initiation of drug use. Co-occurring substance use and trauma exposure are associated with increased risk of mental health disorders, school underachievement, and involvement with multiple systems of care. Coordination and integration of systems of care are of utmost importance for these vulnerable youth. This study delineates the negative sequelae and increased service utilization patterns of adolescents with a history of trauma, substance abuse, and co-occurring trauma and substance abuse to support the need for integrated mental health and substance abuse services for youth. Data from two national sources, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment demonstrate the increased clinical severity (measured by reports of emotional and behavioral problems), dysfunction, and service utilization patterns for youth with co-occurring trauma exposure and substance abuse. We conclude with recommendations for an integrated system of care that includes trauma-informed mental health treatment and substance abuse services aimed at reducing the morbidity and relapse probability of this high-risk group.

AB  - Summary Many patients come to the emergency department with complaints of visual change or loss, ocular trauma, eye pain or other conditions that necessitate an accurate assessment of the eye and/or orbit. Ultrasound has been used by ophthalmologists for several decades. As multi-purpose, high-frequency probes are now available for many of the portable ultrasound machines found in emergency departments, emergency physicians take advantage of these diagnostic capabilities and perform bedside ultrasound ocular examinations as their scope of practice. Vitreous haemorrhage can occur secondary to diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, trauma, retinal vein occlusion or retinal tears. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) can occur as a result of normal aging, trauma, vitreous haemorrhage or inflammation. In chronic PVD, the vitreous may become more stiff and dense and may resemble retinal detachment. Differentiation may be difficult and may depend on ophthalmology consultation.

AB  - Abstract Rational. The concept of epilepsy syndromes, introduced in 1989, was defined as ?clusters of signs and symptoms customarily occurring together?. Definition of epilepsy syndromes based on electro-clinical features facilitated clinical practice and, whenever possible, clinical research in homogeneous groups of patients with epilepsies. Progress in the fields of neuroimaging and genetics made it rapidly clear that, although crucial, the electro-clinical description of epilepsy syndromes was not sufficient to allow much needed development of targeted therapies and a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of seizures. The 2017 ILAE position paper on Classification of the Epilepsies recognized that ?as a critical tool for the practicing clinician, epilepsy classification must be relevant and dynamic to changes in thinking?. The concept of ?epilepsy syndromes? evolved, incorporating issues related to aetiologies and comorbidities. A comprehensive update (and revision where necessary) of the EEG diagnostic criteria in the light of the 2017 revised terminology and concepts was deemed necessary. Methods. The work was commissioned by the Neurophysiology Task Force of the ILAE Committee on the Diagnostic Methods. Diagnostic criteria and recording procedures were developed by group consensus, reached through an ?informal?, internal decision-making process. Each working group member was allocated a number of syndromes, and a standard structured template was used. International literature was extensively reviewed. Results. We developed a simple diagnostic system that is applicable to all epilepsy syndromes which allows the physician (i) to rate the strength of EEG diagnosis (degree of diagnostic certainty) by weighting EEG findings in relation to the available clinical information or the specific clinical question, and ii) to suggest further EEG diagnostics where conclusive diagnostic evidence is lacking. We also propose a system of syndrome-specific recording protocols that, used with the relevant clinical presentation or specific clinical question, may maximize activation of epileptic discharges and ultimately help with standardization of EEG recording across departments, worldwide. Because recording methodology also depends on available resources, a two-tier system was developed to embrace clinical EEG services in resource-limited and industrialized countries. A clinical practice statement for each of the epilepsy syndromes discussed underscores the crucial role of the clinical information with regards to both the optimization of the EEG recording and mainly its meaningful interpretation. Part I covers Genetic (Idiopathic) generalized epilepsies and syndromes, Reflex epilepsies, structural and genetic focal (lobar) syndromes and Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsies [Published with educational EEG plates on www.epilepticdisorders.com].

AB  - Background and Objectives To examine the associations between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, stimulant use, and treatment outcomes among dually diagnosed women. Methods Participants were 141 women who participated in a multisite clinical trial of group treatments for PTSD and addictions. Results Generalized linear models indicated Seeking Safety (SS; a cognitive-behavioral intervention) was significantly more effective than Women's Health Education (WHE; a control group intervention) in reducing stimulant use at follow-up among women who were heavy stimulant users at pre-treatment and who showed improvements in PTSD symptoms. There were no significant differences between the interventions among women who were light stimulant users at treatment entry. Conclusions and Scientific Significance These findings suggest that integrated treatment of co-occurring PTSD and addictions may be more effective than general health education approaches for heavy stimulant users. Assessment of frequency of stimulant use among individuals with PTSD symptoms may inform treatment selection for this population. (Am J Addict 2014;23:90?95)

AB  - Asymptomatic tumors are not uncommon, may be diagnosed during clinical examination or during surgical interventions for other purposes such as treatment of a hemorrhage due a blunt trauma. Case report? 6 year-old boy had fallen, hitting his abdomen against a rock, and arrived at hospital ten hours later. Initial assessment he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain; his physical examination showed: respiratory rate: 16?mov/min, blood pressure: 100???80?mmHg, heart rate: 100?bat/min, and Glasgow coma score: 15. His abdomen was distended, with guarding and rebound tenderness, and had a palpable mass. FAST ultrasound was positive; and Ct-scan showed an abdominal mass with 15???12???7?cm dimension, and moderate amount of free blood in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9?mg/dl, hematocritic 28.8%, white blood cells 6.900?cel/dl. Midline laparotomy was performed, a large, injured and bleeding mesenteric mass was found encircling superior mesentery artery and several small bowel loops; 500?ml of free blood was found in the peritoneal cavity. Mesenteric mass was partially removed with a segment of the small bowel. Findings of anatomico-pathologic examination revealed an intestinal Burkitt lymphoma, with mesenteric linfonodes. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and started with quimotherapy. Comments? This case report shows an unusual traumatic abdominal blending that could not be clearly diagnosed before laparotomy was performed. The emergency of this case was bleeding control, decision to remove mass was taken only for this purpose, and not to treat the tumor. As removal of the whole mass was impossible, a partial removal was performed.

AB  - Abstract The 2006 Lebanon War exposed children in the north of Israel to daily rocket attacks. To cope with the massive psychological needs, a teacher-delivered protocol focusing on enhancing personal resilience was implemented. Children were assessed for risk factors, symptoms, and adaptation before the 16-week program (Time 1; n = 983) and after its completion (Time 2; n = 563). At a 3-month follow-up (Time 3; n = 754) children were assessed together with a waiting-list comparison group (n = 1,152). Participating children showed a significant symptom decrease at Time 2 and significantly fewer symptoms than the control group at Time 3. Six or more risk factors were associated with greater symptoms and parental concern about the child's adaptive functioning. Teachers are valuable cost-effective providers for clinically informed interventions after mass trauma and disaster.

AB  - Purpose? To discuss the entire spectrum of injuries seen in lower limb trauma and choice of reconstructive options. Methodology? Retrospective review of 72 consecutive cases in one year. Data collected from individual case records and the department photo data base. Injuries were classified and analyzed based on bone and soft tissue involvement, associated vascular injuries, mechanism of injury as in crush, degloving, and combined. Bony injuries were classified according to Gustilo?s classification. Treatment options and outcome for bone and soft tissue are discussed separately. Results? Total of 72 cases. 95%of cases were two wheeler traffic accidents. Distribution of cases according to site involved: Leg-39; Foot-14; Leg and foot-16; Thigh, leg, and foot-3. 8 of them were of Gustilo?s IIIB and 7 of IIIC. 42 flaps done included Gastrocnemius-4, Soleus-7, reverse sural-7, Cross leg-2, Fasciocutaneous-5 Perforator based local flaps-3Latissimus dorsi-7, Gracilis-6 Lateral thigh-1 Intervention: Immediate: 12%. Early (less than 1 week): 36, Delayed (>1 week): 52% Complications:Wound infection:Minor: 12; Major: 8 (3 Cases ? Clostridia) Partial flap loss: 6; Loss of SSG over flap/donor site: 5; Acute renal failure: 1 Amputations: Above knee: 4; below knee: 2 Conclusions? This series represents the spectrum of high velocity injuries in an overcrowded urban locality of developing country. Significant tissue loss is most often the rule. A judicious execution of reconstructive options can optimize results. Management protocols were adopted to avoid delayed referrals. This audit served as a benchmark to put together a dedicated trauma team in our hospital.

AB  - Endothelial activation is pivotal in the development and escalation of sepsis. Central to endothelial activation is the endothelial up-regulation of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) including E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and PECAM-1. Shed CAMs are also found in circulating soluble forms (sCAMs). We investigated whether sCAMs can be used as biomarkers for the differentiation between septic and non-septic patients. Furthermore, we investigated lymphocyte and monocyte expression of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) ligands for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, respectively. Twenty-one septic and 15 critically ill non-septic patients were included. All patients had an APACHE II score above 13 at ICU admission. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as controls. Flow cytometry was used to estimate levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sPECAM-1, and the cellular expression of CD11a and CD49d. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1 and sPECAM-1 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls at admission and during the observation period. Lymphocyte and monocyte expression of CD11a and CD49d was suppressed or unaltered in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sPECAM-1 were able to discriminate between septic and non-septic patients, indicating that sCAMs may be potential diagnostic biomarkers of sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Detecting the presence of injuries to the cervical spine is an important component of the initial assessment of patients sustaining blunt trauma. A small proportion of cervical spine injuries consists of ligamentous disruption. Accurate detection of ligamentous injury is essential as it may result in sequelae including radiculopathy, quadriplegia and death. Flexion?extension (FE) radiography has traditionally been utilised for the detection of ligamentous injury in patients who have been cleared of bony injury. There are controversies surrounding the use of FE for alert patients with neck pain. There are studies that call into question the diagnostic accuracy of FE, the high proportion of inadequate FE images due to muscle spasm and the adverse effects of prolonged cervical collar immobilisation while awaiting FE. Other literature indicates that FE provides no additional diagnostic information following a multi-detector helical computed tomography. This review evaluates the literature on the utility of FE for the detection of ligamentous injury and explores alternate strategies for clearing the cervical spine of ligamentous injury.

AB  - Background Few efficacious early treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents exist. Previous trials have intervened within the first month post-trauma and focused on secondary prevention of later post-traumatic stress; however, considerable natural recovery may still occur up to 6-months post-trauma. No trials have addressed the early treatment of established PTSD (i.e. 2- to 6-months post-trauma). Methods Twenty-nine youth (8?17 years) with PTSD (according to age-appropriate DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnostic criteria) after a single-event trauma in the previous 2?6 months were randomly allocated to Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD; n = 14) or waiting list (WL; n = 15) for 10 weeks. Results Significantly more participants were free of PTSD after CT-PTSD (71%) than WL (27%) at posttreatment (intent-to-treat, 95% CI for difference .04?.71). CT-PTSD yielded greater improvement on child-report questionnaire measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety; clinician-rated functioning; and parent-reported outcomes. Recovery after CT-PTSD was maintained at 6- and 12-month posttreatment. Beneficial effects of CT-PTSD were mediated through changes in appraisals and safety-seeking behaviours, as predicted by cognitive models of PTSD. CT-PTSD was considered acceptable on the basis of low dropout and high treatment credibility and therapist alliance ratings. Conclusions This trial provides preliminary support for the efficacy and acceptability of CT-PTSD as an early treatment for PTSD in youth. Moreover, the trial did not support the extension of ?watchful waiting? into the 2- to 6-month post-trauma window, as significant improvements in the WL arm (particularly in terms of functioning and depression) were not observed. Replication in larger samples is needed, but attention to recruitment issues will be required.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delusions and misidentifications have been reported in dementia ranging from 10% to 73% in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and up to 40% in multi-infarct dementia (MID) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in 61 AD and 31 MID patients both the frequency and the content of delusions during the course of illness and to evaluate the relationship between these and both functional and mental decline. The results indicated that delusion experiences had occurred in 45% of AD patients and in 38% of MID patients, occurring most frequently during the first year of illness. Patients who experienced psychiatric symptoms showed higher mini mental state examination scores and were less impaired in functional disability measures. With regard to the content, no significant differences were observed between AD and MID patients; 53% of psychotic symptoms were found to be paranoid delusions while 47% were misidentification delusions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to validate a newly developed tool for predicting the risk of recurrence within 12 months of a venous leg ulcer healing. Performance of the tool to predict recurrence within a 12-month period was assessed using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) analysis. Multi-site retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies were undertaken to validate a risk assessment tool for the recurrence of venous leg ulcers within 12?months. In the retrospective study (n =?250), 55% of venous leg ulcers recurred within 12?months, and the risk assessment total score had excellent discrimination and goodness of fit with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90, P <?.001). The prospective study (n =?143) observed that 50.4% (n =?63) of venous leg ulcers recurred within 12?months of healing. Participants were classified using the risk assessment tool as being at low risk (28%), moderate risk (59%), and high risk (13%); the proportion of wounds recurring at 12?months was 15%, 61%, and 67% for each group, respectively. Validation results indicated good discrimination and goodness of fit, with an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82, P <?.001). Validation of this risk assessment tool for the recurrence of venous leg ulcers provides clinicians with a resource to identify high-risk patients and to guide decisions on adjunctive, tailored interventions to address the specific risk factors to decrease the risk of recurrence.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of hyperarousal and hypervigilance. Increasing research on the ?gut?brain? axis (bidirectional signaling between the gut and the brain) has drawn links between PTSD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), an exceedingly common yet incompletely understood gastrointestinal condition. This meta-analysis thus aimed to examine the body of evidence and extent of association of PTSD with IBS. Methods Using the keywords [early abuse OR childhood abuse OR violence OR trauma OR PTSD] AND [irritable bowel syndrome or IBS], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Medline, Embase, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases yielded 11,257 papers published in English between January 1, 1988, and May 1, 2018. Of these, only eight studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Results The eight studies (four cross-sectional and four cohort) contained a total of 648,375 subjects. Most studies were from the USA and conducted on army veterans. The funnel plot revealed a roughly symmetrical distribution of studies, and Egger test was not significant for publication bias (P = 0.583). Random-effects meta-analysis found PTSD to be a significant risk factor for IBS (pooled odds ratio 2.80, 95% confidence interval: 2.06 to 3.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions Overall, PTSD is associated with an increased likelihood of IBS. This is the first meta-analysis to specifically examine the association between PTSD and IBS, and it provides insights into the probable (patho)physiology and management of IBS, supporting a holistic consideration of the psychosocial aspects of IBS and further research into effective multi-modal therapeutics.
