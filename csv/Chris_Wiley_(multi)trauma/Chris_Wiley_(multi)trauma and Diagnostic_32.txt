AB  - Abstract Introduction:? Brain computed tomography (CT) is inconsistently recommended worldwide in the investigative algorithm of patients presenting with first episode psychosis (FEP). The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of brain CT in patients presenting with FEP without neurological signs in a major metropolitan teaching hospital. Methods:? The CT brain scan reports of 237 consecutive patients, for which the imaging requests or reports provided a history of FEP but no focal neurological signs, were retrospectively identified within a 6-year period in a 750-bed tertiary referral teaching hospital using the radiology information system text-search function (170 male, 67 female; mean age, 28.3?years). All reports were authored or approved by consultant radiologist. They were reviewed for the presence of any lesion that could cause psychosis and hence alter clinical management. Minor neuroradiological abnormalities were also noted. Hospital Ethics Committee registration and approval were obtained and patient informed consent was not required. Results:? No focal brain lesion potentially responsible for the psychosis or focal lesion requiring surgical intervention was identified in any patient. Findings unable to be directly linked to the psychosis such as evidence of small vessel ischaemic disease, arachnoid cysts, cerebral atrophy, and normal variants were present in 17.6% of patients (45 of 237 studies), none of which led to an alteration of clinical management. Conclusion:? The results of this study postulate that brain CT should not be universally performed in the initial assessment of patients with first episode psychosis without neurological signs.

AB  - Aim Previous research has demonstrated a strong association between early trauma exposure and the development of psychotic symptoms. However, few of these studies have included young adolescents and children. This study investigated rates and number of potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) among typically developing youth (TD; n = 21), youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 38), and youth with a psychotic disorder (PD; n = 28) between 7 and 18 years of age. CHR participants were further evaluated to determine whether a history of PTEs was associated with prodromal symptom severity. Methods Study group inclusion was determined by structured interviews. Trauma history was assessed using the post-traumatic stress disorder module of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children?Present and Lifetime Version. CHR participants with vs without a history of PTEs were compared on severity of prodromal symptoms. Results CHR and PD participants reported significantly higher rates and numbers of PTEs than TD participants. Contrary to expectations and prior research, CHR participants with vs without a history of PTEs did not differ in prodromal symptom severity. Explanations and implications for the findings are discussed. Conclusions These findings suggest that the relationship between trauma and the development of psychotic symptoms extends to children and adolescents as young as 7 years of age. This study underscores the importance of screening for trauma exposure among youth seeking treatment for psychotic symptoms.

AB  - Abstract In this article, we report the prevalence of traumatic events (TEs), lifetime and 12-month posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 148 women experiencing homelessness in 3 midsized cities in the United States (Omaha, NE, Pittsburgh, PA, and Portland, OR). The women ranged in age from 19 to 54 years with an average age of 38.89 years (SD = 10.18). The sample was 42.6% White/European American. We investigated the mediation of distal TEs (i.e., childhood maltreatment) by more proximal TEs associated with being homeless (i.e., homelessness-related stressors) for meeting diagnostic criteria for 12-month PTSD. Results indicated that 42.6% of the women met criteria for lifetime PTSD and 39.7% met criteria for past-year PTSD. The number of TEs reported ranged from 0 to 16 in order of prevalence with a median of 6 TEs. The correlations between childhood maltreatment and 12-month PTSD ranged from .16 to .20 and the correlations between homelessness-related stressors and 12-month PTSD ranged from .21 to .30. The mediation analysis was consistent with the association between childhood maltreatment and past-year PTSD being fully mediated by homelessness-related trauma.

AB  - Abstract Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) is an uncommon medical condition that may be encountered by otolaryngologists and facial plastic surgeons. TTS begins with damage to the trigeminal nerve or its central sensory connections, causing anesthesia in a dermatomal distribution. With repeated scratching and manipulation, an ulceration occurs, often in the alar region. In this multi-institutional report, we summarize a small series of patients with TTS. Treatment options are discussed along with a review of the relevant literature. Although rare, it is important that practicing otolaryngologists be familiar with the classic signs and symptoms of this condition in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background: Psychosis can be considered one of the most severe stressors that an individual may face. Previous studies have suggested that the traumatic experience of psychotic symptoms and hospitalization may provoke a post-traumatic type reaction. Aim: The aim of this study was to establish the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among patients recovering from a first-episode of psychosis in Singapore, and to elucidate the factors associated with it. Methods: Patients from the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme in Singapore, who were recovering from their first psychotic episode, participated in this study. Diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) ? Text Revised Axis I Disorders. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, an interviewer-rated semi-structured interview, was used to diagnose PTSD. Results: Sixty-one patients (30 males, 31 females) were recruited. Twelve (19.7%) patients were diagnosed with PTSD. Hospitalization for treatment, whether compulsory or otherwise, did not increase the rate of PTSD. The Chinese ethnic group had lower risk of developing PTSD (adjusted odds ratio 0.14, P?=?0.018). Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of PTSD in patients recovering from their first psychotic episode. This study raises awareness among clinicians and hopes to promote early recognition and treatment of PTSD so as to potentially improve outcome.

AB  - Contrary to prevailing medical belief, dementia is generally not caused by arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels. There may be, in fact, as many as 50 different causes. While the two major types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, are irreversible, perhaps 20 per cent of dementias are secondary to treatable causes, and are reversible. The most important of these is the pseudodementia of depression, which can be easily missed without a high degree of suspicion. Tips on the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, and pseudodementia are discussed, as are other causes of dementia secondary to various diseases or therapy.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the Intensive In-home Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service (IICAPS), a large-scale home-based intervention that collaboratively engages the family, school, and various other service providers (e.g. health practitioners or judicial systems) to prevent the hospitalization, institutionalization or out-of-home placement of children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. Multi-informant data (youth, parents and clinician) on the level of youth problem severity and functioning was gathered from 7169 youth and their families served by the IICAPS network, pre- and post-intervention. A newly developed ?Multi-informant Latent Consensus? (MILC) approach was employed to measure mental health ?baseline levels? and change, within a Structural Equation Modeling framework. The MILC approach demonstrated promise integrating information from multiple informants involved in the therapeutic process to yield a more accurate and systemic view of a child's level of functioning and problem severity than each report taken individually. Results indicated that the IICAPS family and community based intervention model led to a reduction of problem severity and improved functioning in children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance.

AB  - Computed tomography is the cornerstone of modern radiology and arguably the most important modality in terms of clinical impact. CT is used extensively for emergencies, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, orthopedic and other applications - often as the first and only imaging procedure needed for diagnosis, characterization, staging, treatment planning, and follow-up. CT is often the first and only modality needed. There is high likelihood that a patient will have a CT scan in the emergency department, as an outpatient, or as an inpatient for a multitude of indications - trauma, suspected infection or malignancy, and frequently to investigate symptoms such as pain and fever, or to answer a question raised by another test, such as an EKG abnormality or ultrasound finding. Many other modalities are available, including MRI, ultrasound, fluoroscopy and nuclear medicine PET and SPECT. Depending on the clinical question, more than one modality may be required, so questions raised in a CT exam could be resolved with PET or MRI. Each modality has strengths and limitations which are known and recognized relative to the clinical indication. Since pre-certification may be required by payors prior to imaging, these indications are important for reimbursement. The principal drivers for clinical imaging, both single and multi-modality today are reimbursement, radiation dose, workflow efficiency, and availability. Multimodality imaging is most frequently applied to solve complex or demanding clinical problems, and almost never used for screening. A major advantage of CT in hospitals and clinics as well as free-standing imaging centers, is its availability 24/7, while other modalities such as US and MRI may be limited to scheduled examinations in the majority of cases. Multimodality scanners based on CT incorporate PET/SPECT and MRI to combine morphologic and functional imaging. The most demanding imaging applications are cardiovascular, where complex motion and small morphologic features coexist, so imaging methods that are very satisfactory elsewhere in the body may not be successful. Clinical CT scanning consists of administering toxic materials, e.g., contrast media, while monitoring the EKG and illuminating the body with high brightness x-rays. Larger area detectors and higher acquisition rates are welcome improvements, but don't solve all of the problems encountered with scan variability due to respiratory, whole body, and cardiac motion, especially in a spectrum of patients from infant to massively obese adult sizes (< 1 kg to 250 kg or more). The challenges and pitfalls in CT and multimodality imaging will be delineated and evaluated relative to current and future technology. Learning Objectives: 1. The role of x-ray computed tomography (CT) is central to multimodality imaging in diagnosis, staging, treatment planning and follow-up. 2. The principal drivers for CT and complementary use of other modalities are availability, reimbursement, workflow, and radiation dose. The influence of these factors on clinical decision making will be outlined and illustrated. 3. The limitations of a single modality, such as CT, can be overcome by integrating complementary instrumentation, especially PET/SPECT, MRI and others (such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy) to provide simultaneous morphologic and functional imaging.

AB  - Low back pain patients (n=142) on sick leave for at least 8 weeks were given a multi-modal cognitive behavioural treatment program (MMCBT) that lasted for 4 weeks. Before treatment, all patients were tested with a comprehensive test battery. The outcome at 12-month follow-up was predictable from the pretest, but only when combining medical and psychological data. Patients who returned to work (Returners, 50%) in the MMCBT group were characterised by less pain, more psychological strength, were evaluated by the physiotherapist as having a good prognosis for return to work, and were less educated. Patients who did not return to work (Non-returners) in the MMCBT group felt tense and unfit, felt hopelessness concerning the future, were less physically active, thought their complaints would worsen if they continued working, and reported fewer difficulties driving a car. Returners to work (58%) in the randomised control group (n=81), who received ordinary physical therapy, were characterised by high levels of energy, less subjective health complaints, less exhaustion for a condition test, and did not work in positions giving a constant load on the back. There was no significant differences between number of patients who had returned to work in the MMCBT and the control group. Non-returners in the control group lacked energy, trained less regularly, worked in occupations that gave an almost constant load on the back, and did not expect to be back to work in the course of a couple of weeks. It seems to be important to develop further diagnostic tools to identify those who might benefit from extensive or specific treatments.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.

AB  - Summary A leg ulcer is a symptom and the treating physician needs to find out its origin by differential diagnostic approaches and procedures. The correct diagnosis leads to a specific therapy that ideally accelerates the healing of the ulceration. Identifying the pathogenesis of a leg ulcer is the first and main step towards healing. Although vascular diseases are the major causes of leg ulcers, one needs to consider, in addition to venous and arterial disorders, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic and neoplastic causes. The simple truth that one can only make a diagnosis that was considered holds particularly true in leg ulcers. The differential diagnostic considerations presented here appear in the daily routine of a dermatologist and the article provides help in diagnostic approaches and therapeutic decisions.

AB  - Abstract Drug addiction is a chronic brain disorder with no proven effective cure. Assessing both structural and functional brain alterations by using multi-modal, rather than purely unimodal imaging techniques, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying addiction, which in turn may facilitate future treatment strategies. However, this type of research remains scarce in the literature. We acquired multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging from 20 cocaine-addicted individuals and 19 age-matched controls. Compared with controls, cocaine addicts showed a multi-modal hypo-status with (1) decreased brain tissue volume in the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); (2) hypo-perfusion in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, right temporal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and (3) reduced irregularity of resting state activity in the OFC and limbic areas, as well as the cingulate, visual and parietal cortices. In the cocaine-addicted brain, larger tissue volume in the medial OFC, anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum and smaller insular tissue volume were associated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Decreased perfusion in the amygdala and insula was also correlated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Tissue volume, perfusion, and brain entropy in the insula and prefrontal cortex, all showed a trend of negative correlation with drug craving scores. The three modalities showed voxel-wise correlation in various brain regions, and combining them improved patient versus control brain classification accuracy. These results, for the first time, demonstrate a comprehensive cocaine-dependence and craving-related hypo-status regarding the tissue volume, perfusion and resting brain irregularity in the cocaine-addicted brain.

AB  - Abstract Background: This study was undertaken to measure survival of patients with multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma treated by cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy through a multi-institutional collaboration. Methods: A multi-institutional data registry, established by the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group, was used to identify patients with peritoneal mesothelioma and the subgroup with multicystic tumours, treated by cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Outcomes for this subgroup are reported. The primary endpoint was overall survival. A secondary endpoint was the incidence of treatment-related complications. Results: Of 405 patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, 26 (6·4 per cent) had multicystic tumours. There were 20 women and six men with a mean(s.d.) age of 42(12) years. The median peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 14 (range 6?39). There was no perioperative mortality. Six patients developed grade III or IV complications. After a median follow-up of 54 (range 5?129) months, all 26 patients were still alive. Conclusion: Multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma appears to be a distinct subtype of peritoneal mesothelioma, where long-term survival may be achieved through cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The pathogenetic mechanisms causing a dementing brain disease after temporary ischemia, heat shock, or brain trauma are surveyed. These lesions increase beta amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) synthesis. This process is potentiated by an ischemic glutamate release that opens cellular Ca2+ channels, inhibiting glucose turnover and ATP production, which is, under these conditions, accompanied by the generation of beta amyloid (beta A), even in young persons. Beta amyloid starts a vicious circle by inactivating the glycolytic key enzyme, phos-phofructokinase, which, with age, exhausts the functional reserve capacity of the brain. This demonstrates that beta A is an epiphenomenon of a dementing brain disease, triggered by the disturbance of glucose turnover and oxidative phosphorylation. Clinical studies have shown that a dementing brain disease can be clearly objectified and monitored by 18F-2-deoxyglucose PET studies. This paper looks briefly a pharmacologic approaches to this disease using models of temporary ischemia, the testing of 14C-deoxyglucose turnover, or examination with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. In conclusion, the key process of all dementing brain diseases of the Alzheimer type is a decreased glucose turnover and subsequently decreased oxidative phosphorylation, linked directly to a secondary amyloid formation and nerve cell atrophy.
