AB  - Abstract This study examined the relationship between acute cortisol responses to trauma and subsequent PTSD symptoms (PTSS) in children and their biological mothers. Urinary cortisol levels were assessed in 54 children aged 8?18 upon admission to a level-1 trauma center. Six weeks posttrauma, 15-hour urine samples were collected from children and their mothers. Depression and PTSS were assessed at 6 weeks (N = 44) and 7 months (N = 38) posttrauma. Higher child in-hospital cortisol significantly predicted 6-week child PTSS. This was true only for boys at 7 months. In mothers, lower 6-week cortisol levels significantly predicted 7-month PTSS. Results extend findings of differing directions of acute hormonal predictors of PTSS in adults versus children to a sample of genetically related individuals.

AB  - Abstract Objective The current article compared the impact of exposure to sexual trauma and other types of physical threats against the patient or the patient's family on response to treatment, relapse, and dropout rates in 160 Colombian women between 12 and 49 years of age with eating disorders. Method A comparison was made to 70 cases with unsatisfactory response to treatment and 90 controls with a better response to treatment goals. Results Forty-five percent had a history of sexual abuse, other violent traumas, or both. Significant statistical differences were observed between both groups in exposure variables. The highest probability of poor outcome was observed in patients with sexual abuse and exposure to other violent acts (odds ratio [OR] = 6.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1?19.07). The risk of dropout or relapse was, respectively, 10 and 3 times greater among those exposed. Discussion Violent social conditions should be noted as another form of trauma with potential impact on outcome in Colombian women with eating disorders. ? 2005 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values according to the different b values. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was acquired. We evaluated 74 patients (M:F = 43:31, mean age of 44 years) who underwent 3.0 Tesla knee MR with DWI because of the possibility of ACL tear due to trauma. Region of interest measurements were performed. We (two radiologists) measured the signals of the DWI and derived ADC values on the oblique sagittal DWI with b values of 0, 600, and 1000. The diagnostic accuracies of the conventional MR image and each DWI with an ADC value with a different b value were evaluated. The CNR and ADC values were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The diagnostic performances of the various imaging methods were evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for differentiating between normal and ACL injury as determined by the use of conventional MRI with additional DWIs with McNemar test. The arthroscopic or clinical findings were used as the reference standard. Results The mean CNRs of ligament tears with b values of 600 and 1000 were significantly higher than those of normal ligament (22 versus 7 and 9 versus 4, P value < 0.05). The sensitivities and the accuracies of the DWI were significantly lower than the conventional MRIs (P value < 0.001). Conclusions: The CNRs of the torn ACL with each b value (600 and 1000) were significantly higher those of than normal ligament, although the ADC values of the torn ligament were not different from normal ligament. Addition of the DWI to the conventional MRI did not improve diagnostic performance. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:1116?1122.

AB  - Abstract Accurate and timely identification of anaerobic bacteria is critical to successful treatment. Classic phenotypic methods for identification require long turnaround times and can exhibit poor species level identification. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is an identification method that can provide rapid identification of anaerobes. We present a multi-centre study assessing the clinical performance of the VITEK? MS in the identification of anaerobic bacteria. Five different test sites analysed a collection of 651 unique anaerobic isolates comprising 11 different genera. Multiple species were included for several of the genera. Briefly, anaerobic isolates were applied directly to a well of a target plate. Matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry. Mass spectra results were generated with the VITEK? MS, and the comparative spectral analysis and organism identification were determined using the VITEK? MS database 2.0. Results were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 651 isolates analysed, 91.2% (594/651) exhibited the correct species identification. An additional eight isolates were correctly identified to genus level, raising the rate of identification to 92.5%. Genus-level identification consisted of Actinomyces, Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces neuii and Bacteroides uniformis were notable for an increased percentage of no-identification results compared with the other anaerobes tested. VITEK? MS identification of clinically relevant anaerobes is highly accurate and represents a dramatic improvement over other phenotypic methods in accuracy and turnaround time.

AB  - Summary Aging and old age confront the psychiatric clinician and nosologist with special diagnostic problems. Aging reflects evolving biological, psychological, and social processes. Fundamental alterations of central nervous system functioning color the psychopathological and pathophysiological significance of specific symptoms, while the psychosocial meaning of discrete life events changes as one moves across the age spectrum. Old age brings an increase in confounding systemic medical conditions. Thus, we are confronted with an array of yet-to-be-answered questions. The development of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) provided an opportunity to begin considering such issues more formally.

AB  - Abstract Aim Our primary aim was to calculate the head computed tomography (CT) scan rate in children with a minor head injury (MHI) when the Dutch National guidelines were followed in clinical practice. The secondary aim was to determine the incidence of CT abnormalities and the guideline predictors associated with traumatic abnormalities. Methods We performed a multi-centre, prospective observational cross-sectional study in the emergency departments of six hospitals in The Netherlands between 1 April 2015 and 31 December 2016. Results Data on 1002 patients were studied and 69% of cases complied with the guidelines. The overall CT rate was 44% and the incidence of traumatic abnormal CT findings was 13%. CT scans were performed in 19% of children under two years of age, 48% of children between two and five years and 63% of children aged six years or more. Multivariate regression analysis for all age categories showed that CT abnormalities were predicted by a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 15, suspicion of a basal skull fracture, vomiting and scalp haematomas or external lesions of the skull. Conclusion Strict adherence to the Dutch national guidelines resulted in CT overuse. New guidelines are needed to safely reduce CT scan indications.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mutations in FLNA (Filamin A, OMIM 300017) cause X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia (XL-PNH). XL-PNH-associated mutations are considered lethal in hemizygous males. However, a few males with unusual mutations (including distal truncating and hypomorphic missense mutations), and somatic mosaicism have been reported to survive past infancy. Two brothers had an atypical presentation with failure to thrive and distinct facial appearance including hypertelorism. Evaluations of these brothers and their affected cousin showed systemic involvement including severe intestinal malfunction, malrotation, congenital short bowel, PNH, pyloric stenosis, wandering spleen, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, inguinal hernia, and vesicoureteral reflux. The unanticipated finding of PNH led to FLNA testing and subsequent identification of a novel no-stop FLNA mutation (c.7941_7942delCT, p.(*2648Serext*100)). Western blotting and qRT-PCR of patients' fibroblasts showed diminished levels of protein and mRNA. This FLNA mutation, the most distal reported so far, causes in females classical XL-PNH, but in males an unusual, multi-organ phenotype, providing a unique insight into the FLNA-associated phenotypes. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is defined as a diagnosis made by a radiologist who takes into account the output of a computerized analysis of a medical image. There are in general two different types of CAD schemes: one to locate suspicious regions in the image, computer-aided detection (CADe) and another to classify a suspicious region into one of two or more classes, computer-aided diagnosis (CADx). The goal of CAD is to improve the performance of radiologists, to reduce variation within and between radiologists, and to make radiologists more efficient. This article describes motivation for developing CAD, the basic principles, current issues in CAD research, and future areas for development.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the occurrence and the type of after office-hours traumatic dental injuries managed by the Dental Unit of the Accident and Emergency Department at the Singapore General Hospital. During a 2-year period (from August 1990 to July 1992), 461 trauma patients (314 males, 147 females) sustained injuries to 968 teeth. The distribution in different races of Chinese: Malay: Indian: others was 7.3: 1.3: 0.9: 0.5. The predominant age groups were 2?3 years, 3?4 years and 17?18 years; 71.3% of the teeth sustained luxation type injuries, the remaining 28.7% had fractures, 45.3% of the cohort had concomitant soft tissues injuries, while 13.7% had associated facial bone fractures. Teenager traumas were more common during school vacations. It is concluded that thorough standardized documentation is imperative to obtain baseline information on dental trauma. This could facilitate future preventive measures, education and research.

AB  - Aim: To assess the causes and the prevalence of traumatic injuries to the permanent incisors of 12-year-old schoolchildren in Jaragua do Sul, Brazil. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Public and private primary schools. Participants: 476 children of both sexes, selected by multistage sampling technique. Methods: Clinical examination of upper and lower permanent incisors. Main outcome measures: Incisal overjet, lip coverage, traumatised anterior teeth, cause of trauma. Parents' levels of education and employment status and family income. Results: Boys experienced double the percentage of injuries compared to girls. Children with incisal overjet greater than 5mm (P = 0.077) and inadequate lip coverage (P = 0.667) were not more likely to have experienced dental injuries. The main causes of injuries to the permanent incisors were falls (26 per cent), traffic accidents (20.5 per cent), sports (19.2 per cent), violence (16.4 per cent) and collisions with people or inanimate objects (6.8 per cent). Socio-economic measures had no significant effect on prevalence of trauma. Conclusions: Policy makers must take the causes of trauma into account when developing a strategy for the prevention of dental injuries. The role of violence in causing traumatic dental injuries has been underestimated.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare demographics and disease characteristics in dogs in which peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) had been diagnosed and report outcomes after surgical treatment (ST) or conservative treatment (CT). Study design Retrospective study. Sample population One hundred twenty-eight dogs (91 ST, 37 CT) in which PPDH had been diagnosed. Methods Medical records were reviewed for demographics, perioperative findings, and outcomes. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and email correspondence with owners and referring veterinarians. Baseline variables were compared between treatment groups. Results Dogs treated surgically were younger (P < .001), more likely to be sexually intact (P = .002), more likely to have clinical signs from PPDH vs an incidental diagnosis (P < .001), and more likely to have other congenital abnormalities (P = .003) compared with dogs treated conservatively. Ninety-seven percent of ST dogs were discharged from hospitals. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were reported in 22% and 41% of dogs, respectively, although most complications were classified as low grade (75% and 83%, respectively). Follow-up was available in 87 dogs, at a median of 1062?days. Hernia recurrence was not reported in any surgically treated dog. The deaths of nine dogs (five ST, four CT) could be attributed to PPDH, and long median survival times were observed in both the ST and CT groups (8.2 and 5?years, respectively). Conclusion Preoperative characteristics differed between dogs treated conservatively vs surgically. Surgical treatment was associated with low operative mortality, and both ST and CT dogs had good long-term survival. Clinical significance A diagnosis of PPDH can confer a good long-term prognosis for both ST and CT dogs.

AB  - Abstract The aetiological agents of many invasive fungal infections are saprobes and opportunistic pathogens. Some of these fungi are darkly pigmented due to melanin production and traditionally have been named ?dematiaceous?. The melanized fungi cause a wide array of clinical syndromes ranging from superficial to deep-seated infections. Diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of clinical specimens and on examination of cultures. Sequencing is recommended for accurate species identification, especially for unusual or newly described pathogens. In cases of mycetoma and chromoblastomycosis, pathognomonic histological findings are useful and the Fontana?Masson stain, specific for melanin, usually confirms the diagnosis. There are no standardized therapies but voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole demonstrate the most consistent in vitro activity against this group of fungi. Oral itraconazole has been considered the drug of choice, given the extensive clinical experience with this drug. However, voriconazole may presumably be superior for central nervous system infections because of its ability to achieve good levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Posaconazole is a well-tolerated alternative drug, backed by less clinical experience but with excellent salvage treatment results after failure of other antifungals. Amphotericin B has been useful as alternative therapy in some cases. Combination antifungal therapy is recommended for cerebral abscesses when surgery is not possible and for disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients.

AB  - Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation and infection that can be used as a predictive risk marker of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals or as a prognostic marker of recurrent ischemia and death among patients with coronary heart disease or stroke. We developed a sensitive, disposable, and easy to operate sensor based on heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay for high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurement. We used screen-printed electrodes modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and protein A to ensure the oriented immobilization of anti-CRP antibodies. CRP was quantitatively measured down to a concentration of 0.5?ng mL?1, enabling high dilution of the samples before measurement and consequently reducing interferences present in the serum. The sensor developed is suitable for point of care detection of hs-CRP at clinically relevant concentrations for the diagnosis of both conventional and low-grade inflammations.

AB  - Purpose: The pathophysiology and clinical phenomenology of epileptic psychoses are wide and varied, and an internationally accepted classification system has yet to be established. A multi-axial classification should be developed to capture the complexity of clinicai situations and to describe the heterogeneity of individuals presenting with the same diagnosis. We propose a new 5-axial classification system based on a review of the previous literature and evaluate its validity and applicability in Japan by a multi-institutional design. Methods: According to the ICD-10 guidelines, psychosis is defined as the presence of hallucination, delusions, or a limited number of behavioral abnormalities, such as gross excitement and overactivity, marked psychomotor retardation, and catatonic behavior, without disturbance of consciousness. Among the patients with epilepsy and psy- choses treated by the authors at 6 epilepsy clinics, 128 patients were randomly selected to participate as subjects. Those patients who developed epilepsy after the onset of their psychoses were excluded. The average age of the subjects was 39.4 years, average age of onset of epilepsy was 13.3 years, and average age of onset of psychoses was 27.9 years. Results: The first axis codes the type of epilepsy and laterality of epileptic focus. Temporal lobe epilepsy (48%) and other localization-related epilepsies (14%) were prevalent, but all types of epilepsy were seen. Left-sided (29%) and right-sided foci (27%) were in equal proportion, and bilateral foci (9%) also were found. The second axis codes the type of psychoses and clinical course. Paranoid schizophrenia-like disorder (41%) and delusional disorder (19%) were prevalent; whereas acute transient psychotic disorder (9%), catatonic disorder (7%), hallucinosis (6%), and hebephrenic schizophrenia-like disorder (4%) were relatively infrequent. Single episode (24%), recurrent episodes (34%), and chronic course (34%) were found in almost equal proportion. Therc were several cases with chronic course after recurrent episodes (3%). The third axis codes the temporal relationship between seizure occurrence and EEG changes during psychoses. lnterictal onset (69%) was most frequent followed by postictal (15%), para-ictal (6%), and other (5%). EEG changes during psychoses were seen in 38%, and normalization of the EEG was seen in 4%of patients. In 22%, EEG could not be recorded during psychoses (22%). The fourth axis codes the precipitating factors of psychoses. Specific personality trait (20%), changes in drug-regimen (l4%), co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders (12%), and psychosocial factors (10%) were seen. The fifth axis codes the organic background. Abnormal findings by brain imaging techniques (38%). mild intelligence deficiency (30%), and previous history of brain damage (27%) were noted. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate the heterogeneity of epileptic psychoses. We have proposed a 5-axial classification that appears to provide a convenient format for organizing and communicating clinical information to assist clinical practice and facilitate research. Using those guidelines, we may be able to improve our under- standing of the pathogenesis, develop suitable treatment, predict the prognosis, and ultimately establish appropriate intervention strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACT ? The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is purely a clinical diagnosis. The most common types of diagnostic error are a failure either to recognize the early, or unusual symptoms, or to differentiate other tremors and extrapyramidal syndromes from Parkinson's disease. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is increasing. This has resulted from the reduction of the excess mortality by levodopa treatment. In the near future, there will be more older parkinsonian patients with a more prolonged duration of the disease.

AB  - Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine pancreas in both dogs and cats. Ante-mortem diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis can be challenging. The clinical picture of dogs and cats with pancreatitis varies greatly (from very mild to severe or even fatal) and is characterised by non-specific findings. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis should always be performed in dogs and cats suspected of having pancreatitis, although findings are not-specific for pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase activities and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations have no or only limited clinical value for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in either dogs or cats. Conversely, serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration is currently considered to be the clinicopathological test of choice for the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis. Abdominal radiography is a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of other diseases that may cause similar clinical signs to those of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but this depends largely on the clinician's experience. Histopathological examination of the pancreas is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatitis, but it is not without limitations. In clinical practice, a combination of careful evaluation of the animal's history, serum PLI concentration and abdominal ultrasonography, together with pancreatic cytology or histopathology when indicated or possible, is considered to be the most practical and reliable means for an accurate diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatitis compared with other diagnostic modalities.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives.? The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the circulation is approximately 10- to 50- fold higher than B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). We sought to compare the accuracy of midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) measured with a novel sandwich immunoassay with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) in the diagnosis of heart failure. Design.? The diagnosis of heart failure was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists using all available clinical data (including BNP levels) in 287 consecutive patients presenting with dyspnoea to the emergency department (ED). MRproANP and NTproBNP levels were determined at presentation in a blinded fashion. Results.? Heart failure was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 154 patients (54%). Median MRproANP was significantly higher in patients with heart failure as compared to patients with other causes of dyspnoea (400 vs. 92?pmol?L?1, P?<?0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of MRproANP was very high with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 and was comparable with that of NTproBNP (0.92, P?=?0.791). Moreover, MRproANP provided incremental diagnostic information to BNP and NTproBNP in patients presenting with BNP levels in the grey zone between 100 and 500?pg?mL?1. Conclusion.? Midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide is as accurate in the diagnosis of heart failure as NTproBNP. MRproANP seems to provide incremental information on top of BNP or NT-proBNP in some subgroups and should be further investigated in other studies.

AB  - Despite advances in evidence-based treatments (EBTs), research suggests these interventions are not utilized in practice settings. This study examined implementation of multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP), an EBT for childhood mood disorders, in two outpatient community clinics. Fifteen community therapists facilitated MF-PEP. Twenty community clinicians referred 40 children ages 8?12 with mood disorders and their parents who participated in MF-PEP. Preliminary descriptive findings based on observations and self-report questionnaires demonstrated implementation outcomes of acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of MF-PEP at these clinics. Parents also demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of mood disorders posttreatment. Preliminary results support implementation of MF-PEP in practice settings and suggest community-based MF-PEP may be associated with improvement in clinical outcomes.
