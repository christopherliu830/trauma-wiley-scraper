AB  - Abstract. Objectives.? The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the circulation is approximately 10- to 50- fold higher than B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). We sought to compare the accuracy of midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) measured with a novel sandwich immunoassay with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) in the diagnosis of heart failure. Design.? The diagnosis of heart failure was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists using all available clinical data (including BNP levels) in 287 consecutive patients presenting with dyspnoea to the emergency department (ED). MRproANP and NTproBNP levels were determined at presentation in a blinded fashion. Results.? Heart failure was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 154 patients (54%). Median MRproANP was significantly higher in patients with heart failure as compared to patients with other causes of dyspnoea (400 vs. 92?pmol?L?1, P?<?0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of MRproANP was very high with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 and was comparable with that of NTproBNP (0.92, P?=?0.791). Moreover, MRproANP provided incremental diagnostic information to BNP and NTproBNP in patients presenting with BNP levels in the grey zone between 100 and 500?pg?mL?1. Conclusion.? Midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide is as accurate in the diagnosis of heart failure as NTproBNP. MRproANP seems to provide incremental information on top of BNP or NT-proBNP in some subgroups and should be further investigated in other studies.

AB  - Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine pancreas in both dogs and cats. Ante-mortem diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis can be challenging. The clinical picture of dogs and cats with pancreatitis varies greatly (from very mild to severe or even fatal) and is characterised by non-specific findings. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis should always be performed in dogs and cats suspected of having pancreatitis, although findings are not-specific for pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase activities and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations have no or only limited clinical value for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in either dogs or cats. Conversely, serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration is currently considered to be the clinicopathological test of choice for the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis. Abdominal radiography is a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of other diseases that may cause similar clinical signs to those of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but this depends largely on the clinician's experience. Histopathological examination of the pancreas is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatitis, but it is not without limitations. In clinical practice, a combination of careful evaluation of the animal's history, serum PLI concentration and abdominal ultrasonography, together with pancreatic cytology or histopathology when indicated or possible, is considered to be the most practical and reliable means for an accurate diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatitis compared with other diagnostic modalities.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical features, imaging and angiographic findings of thirty four patients with cranial dural arteriovenous malformations and fistulae are presented in four groups. Group 1 ? Seven patients with anterior cavernous malformations, predominant superior ophthalmic vein drainage, and symptoms and signs of carotico-cavernous fistula. Group 2 ? Twelve patients with malformations of the superior petrosal, transverse and sigmoid sinus regions, presenting predominantly with bruit. Group 3 ? Seven patients with malformations of the basal sinuses and prominent cortical venous drainage, presenting with intracranial haemorrhage, headache and impaired cortical function. Intracranial haemorrhage never occured in the absence of cortical venous drainage. Group 4 ? Eight patients with infrequent manifestations. Group 1 and 2 patients are readily recognized and diagnosed. Group 3 and 4 patients are often misdiagnosed. Treatment modalities comprised embolisation therapy, surgical excision, and carotid compression. Twenty patients were treated by one or more of these modalities with a successful outcome in thirteen patients. Group 1 patients are the most amenable to trans-arterial embolisation. Carotid compression as the sole modality of treatment was successful in four patients. Unless the fistula is successfully closed, Group 3 patients and patients who present with cervical or thoracic myelopathy carry a grave prognosis. There is need for greater radiologist awareness of Group 3 and the rarer presentations, particularly myelopathy. With the exception of one patient, the morphological features of our cases are consistent with the now-accepted view that these lesions are acquired arterio-venous fistulae and not congential malformations.

AB  - Abstract The intersecting scenarios of multi-trauma, thoracic injury and traumatic cardiac arrest present some of the most demanding moments in paediatric trauma. For these reasons, decision support through teamwork, checklists, technology and guidelines are central to ensuring quality paediatric trauma care. The ?Rule of 4's? is a simple aide-memoire, which guides clinicians of all grades, expertise and distractedness in a reliable approach to injured children who require safe and effective emergency pleural decompression and timely insertion of a chest drain. The Rule of 4?s enables these important therapeutic goals to be met through: (i) four steps in a ?good plan?; (ii) fourth (or fifth) intercostal space as the basis for siting a ?good hole?; (iii) 4? uncuffed endotracheal tube size (4? [age/4?+?4]) to guide selection of a ?good tube?; and (iv) 4 cm mark for a ?good stop? to ensure the drain is in far enough but not too far.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Common peroneal nerve (CPN) injury occurs in 10?40% of patients following knee dislocation. Is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using routine knee protocols able to adequately evaluate CPN injury and predict long-term outcome? Methods Trauma patients presenting for knee MRI at a single public hospital, between July 2007 and May 2017, were retrospectively identified using radiology and orthopaedic databases. Medical records were retrieved for clinical scores. MRI images were scored by two independent radiologists blinded to the clinical CPN status and scores correlated with initial clinical scores using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Final cohort included 107 patients (81 males and 26 females) with a mean age of 39 (range 19?81 years). MRI was considered to be adequate for coverage of the CPN in 84 patients. Fourteen patients had CPN injury clinically (seven complete and seven partial). Concordance between MRI scores and initial clinical scores was 0.456 (P = 0.01). MRI sensitivity and specificity for CPN injury on the 84 adequate scans were 54.5% and 93.2% respectively. All seven cases of partial CPN injury and three of seven cases of complete CPN injury recovered fully. High MRI scores of 5 and 8 were given for the two patients with a persisting complete CPN palsy. Highest scores for partial CPN injury subjects were 2 and 4. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging using a routine knee protocol is not adequate for the assessment of CPN injury in many subjects. More specific MRI neural sequences with complete CPN coverage may be worth trialing.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma can result in tooth loss despite best efforts at retaining and maintaining compromised teeth (Dent Traumatol, 24, 2008, 379). Upper anterior teeth are more likely to suffer from trauma, and their loss can result in significant aesthetic and functional problems that can be difficult to manage (Endod Dent Traumatol, 9, 1993, 61; Int Dent J 59, 2009, 127). Indeed, teeth of poor prognosis may not only present with compromised structure but trauma may also result in damage to the support tissues. Injury to the periodontium and alveolus can have repercussions on subsequent restorative procedures (Fig. 19). Where teeth are identified as having a hopeless prognosis either soon after the incident or at delayed presentation; planning for eventual tooth loss and replacement can begin at the early stages. With advances in both adhesive and osseointegration technologies, there are now a variety of options for the restoration of edentate spaces subsequent to dental trauma. This review aims to identify key challenges in the provision of tooth replacement in the traumatized dentition and outline contemporary methods in treatment delivery.

AB  - Objectives: To review the presenting clinical signs, treatment and survival of dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma and, if possible, to identify useful prognostic indicators. Methods: Medical records of 44 dogs were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical signs, clinical stage, time of diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Chi-square/Fisher Exact test as appropriate. Results: The most frequent clinical signs were cough (12 dogs, 27%), enlarged lymph nodes (11 dogs, 25%) and dysphagia (11 dogs, 25%). Anorexia and lethargy were less common but were significantly associated with a poor outcome. No matter what treatment modalities were used, survival times were short and median survival time for all the dogs in the study was 179 days. However, there were a small number of long-term survivors. Clinical Significance: Dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma that suffered anorexia and lethargy had shorter survival times than patients without these clinical signs. Although surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seem to increase the median survival time of dogs diagnosed with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, there is no highly effective treatment for canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - As is well known, Freud described the clinical practice of psychoanalysis as the ?loam? of his cultural-theoretical work, an assessment which is shared by many psychoanalysts up to the present, including the authors of this paper. The complex interplay between unconscious phantasies on the one hand, and the real experiences arising from the new possibilities opened up by prenatal diagnostics on the other, is described with reference to a report of an intensive, long psychoanalysis with an analysand from a family burdened with a genetically transmitted illness (haemophilia). The holding and containing function of the analyst enabled this analysand, despite traumatic experiences with the miscarriage of a healthy child triggered by a prenatal diagnosis and the later abortion of a haemophiliac baby, nevertheless to have the courage to go through another pregnancy and give birth to a healthy girl. The intensive clinical investigation of the unconscious phantasies, conflicts and traumas around the prenatal diagnostics proved to be not only therapeutically fruitful for the analysand, Ms F. It also facilitated insights into those individual chances and risks which appear to be an integral part of the opportunities presented by todays prenatal diagnostics and, through them, it lead to a cultural-critical look at the ambivalence of medical-technical progress. These insights, which are only attainable through psychoanalysis, can represent a distinctive contribution of psychoanalysis to a multi-disciplinary dialogue with medical practitioners, geneticists, ethicists and health policy-makers. By referring to a large EU study on ?Ethical Dilemmas due to Prenatal and Genetic Diagnostics?, this paper gives a practical example of such a discussion. Ms F. was psychoanalytically interviewed as part of this study, 16 years after the conclusion of her analysis. The summary of these interviews, which is set against the account of the treatment, offers an impressive insight not only into the long-term effects of a psychoanalysis under very particular personal circumstances, but also into the lasting consequences of decisions made in the context of prenatal diagnostics. Finally, the results of the individual case study are brought together with the clinical outcomes of the EU study, and some considerations are formulated concerning the protective and risk factors facing women during and after prenatal diagnostics. The paper is an appeal to psychoanalysts, with their specific competence in dealing with unconscious phantasies and conflicts and their high level of professionalism in dealing with traumatised patients, to get involved in fresh dialogue with prenatal diagnosticians and their patients.

At the time of the trauma, a diaphragmatic lesion went unnoticed. Five years later, the patient had a 24-h history of increasingly severe abdominal pain with repeated vomiting. Helical CT showed a portion of the left hemidiaphragm avulsed from its insertions on the ribs with large-bowel loop obstruction herniated in the left hemithorax. The preoperative CT diagnosis was confirmed by surgery: reduction of the hernia and reinsertion of the hemidiaphragm to the lumbocostal arch were performed.

AB  - Abstract Earlier clinical and bioarchaeological studies found that injury recidivists were most likely to be young adult males. Since then, the clinical meaning of the injury recidivist has expanded to include all individuals with multiple injuries, and other aspects of health have been considered. Our study sought to apply these advances to paleopathology and place multiple injuries in a wider context by investigating: the age and sex distribution of those with single and multiple fractures, and if people with multiple injuries had poorer general health. The sample of 213 males and 190 females (≥18?years old) from six populations in England, Siberia, and Sudan ranged in date from the 3rd century BC to the mid-19th century AD. Health variables included cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, periostitis, Schmorl's nodes, enamel hypoplasias, dental caries, and periodontitis. Ante-mortem injuries were: fractures (0/1/≥2), myositis ossificans, dental trauma, and sharp-force injuries. The data were analysed using chi-square and hierarchical loglinear analyses (P?=?0.05). No significant three-way association between age, sex, and injury was found. There was no difference between the sexes when individuals with single versus multiple injuries were compared. There were significant differences in the age-distribution of people with 0 and 1/≥2 fractures. Males and those 26?35?years old were most likely to have fractures and multiple injuries. Porotic hyperostosis was significantly associated with fractures. There was no significant relationship between general poor health and multiple injuries. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background Ground-glass nodules (GGNs), which are possible precursors of lung cancer, attract increasing attention. Many studies have attempted to identify the characteristic imaging features of GGNs for their qualitative diagnosis; however, the comprehension of GGNs remains controversial. We performed this study to identify imaging characteristics helpful to the differential diagnosis of solitary GGNs. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 112 solitary GGNs resected from 112 patients, pathologically examined after surgical resection. Imaging features of the GGNs, such as size, shape, a solid component, lobulation, spiculation, vascular convergence sign, pleural tag, and air cavity density, were assessed. Differences between malignant and benign nodules were analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 112 GGNs, 82 were malignant and 30 were benign. A solid component, vascular convergence sign, and a larger diameter were risk factors for malignancy, with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93.9%, 60.0%, and 84.8%, respectively. Lobulation, spiculation, air cavity densities, and pleural tags were also important indicators of malignancy, with positive predictive values of 93.5%, 83.3%, 91.7%, and 87.2%, respectively. Conclusion GGNs with a solid component, vascular convergence sign, and a larger diameter are highly suggestive of malignancy. The possibility of a neoplasm should also be considered in the case of GGNs that show lobulation, spiculation, air cavity densities, or pleural tags. To obtain a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the nodules, three-dimensional reconstruction is highly recommended.

AB  - Summary Background Salmonella enterica is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections in veterinary hospitals ? with outbreaks of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella among equine cases resulting in high case fatality rates and substantial financial cost. Objectives Study objectives were to 1) investigate factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella enterica and 2) evaluate the effect shedding may have on health outcomes of previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Study design Retrospective case?control study with prospective cohort study. Methods Analysis of medical records (N = 373; 94 culture positive, 279 culture negative) was undertaken to determine factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella. Additionally, a follow-up study was conducted to assess long-term outcomes associated with shedding among previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Data regarding exposures of interest were collected retrospectively from medical records. Information on long-term outcomes was obtained by phone interview of owners. Multivariable regression techniques were used to investigate factors associated with shedding and subsequent health outcomes. Results Horses experiencing diarrhoea during hospitalisation were more likely to shed Salmonella (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.02, 3.45) compared with horses without diarrhoea, but isolates tended to be susceptible strains. Antimicrobial therapy during hospitalisation was not associated with shedding or recovery of MDR strains. Shedding did not increase long-term risk for non-survival, colic or abnormal faeces after hospital discharge; nor increase risk for hospitalisation or occurrence of abnormal faeces in stablemates. Main limitations Data collection was reliant upon the quality of medical records and owner recall, which may have led to information bias. The study population was derived from central Kentucky and may differ from horse populations in other regions. Conclusions and clinical importance In general, Salmonella shedding was not associated with decreased average survival times or impacts to health of stablemates, perhaps due to owner implemented biosecurity precautions. Regardless, recently hospitalised horses should be segregated after discharge, in addition to employing rigorous hygiene practices. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting Information.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.
