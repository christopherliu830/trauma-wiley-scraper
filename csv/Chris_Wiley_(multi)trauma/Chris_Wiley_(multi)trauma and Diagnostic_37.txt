AB  - Abstract Background Steady increase in computed tomography (CT) utilisation in the ED was observed in countries such as the USA, Canada, China and Korea; however, limited empirical data are available regarding Taiwan. Objective The objective of the present study is to quantify and compare trends in CT utilisation in the ED over a 5 year period in a medical centre in Taiwan. Methods Electronic chart review was performed in a medical centre with an annual ED census of 80 000 patients. Subjects >20 years of age who underwent CT scans during ED visits from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009 were identified. Results Among the 333 673 adult ED visits, 43 635 received CT scans, with a utilisation rate of 131 per 1000. Within the 5 year span, patient volume increased by 7.7%, whereas CT utilisation increased by 42.7%. The rates of increase in patient volume and CT utilisation were 5.0% and 32.4% in non-trauma; 19.7% and 97.8% in trauma. CT scans were mostly performed on the head (47%), abdomen (36%), followed by chest (10%) and miscellaneous (7%). An increase of 168% in spinal CTs for trauma patients was observed. An increase in CT utilisation was found in all age groups with a proportionate increase with increasing age in both trauma and non-trauma. Conclusion ED CT utilisation has increased at a rate far exceeding the growth in ED patient volume. This may be attributed to the improved utility of CT in diagnosing serious pathology, more diagnostic indications for CT, ready availability and the necessity for diagnostic certainty in the ED.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Abstract Survival from cancer has improved over the past decade resulting in more long-term survivors. The literature on multi-dimensional quality of life (QOL) among long-term (5+ years) adult survivors is reviewed for each of seven cancer sites (i.e. breast, ovarian, cervical, prostate, colorectal, head and neck, and Hodgkin's disease survivors). Overall, long-term survivors experience good to excellent QOL. Physical domain QOL was the most frequently measured while spiritual domain QOL was the least frequently measured. QOL varies according to treatment received and by age for all groups with older persons (excepting head and neck and Hodgkin's disease survivors) reporting better QOL. QOL improves with time for breast cancer survivors and tends to decrease over time for prostate cancer survivors. Issues regarding sexual functioning affected the social domain?especially for breast and prostate cancer survivors. Social support improves psychological domain QOL for breast, cervical, and colorectal survivors. Review of findings may assist researchers and clinicians wishing to enhance the QOL of the long-term survivor population by identifying the most pressing and widely experienced concerns and by providing directions for future research.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.

AB  - Contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (CE-MDCT) is used routinely in evaluating human patients with acute abdominal symptoms. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) continues to be in its infancy as it relates to evaluation of the acute abdomen. The purpose of this study was to compare survey radiography, B-mode ultrasound, CEUS, and CE-MDCT findings in canine patients presenting with acute abdominal signs; with a focus on the ability to differentiate surgical from non-surgical conditions. Nineteen dogs were prospectively enrolled. Inclusion required a clinical diagnosis of acute abdominal signs and confirmed surgical or non-surgical causes for the clinical signs. Agreement for the majority of recorded imaging features was at least moderate. There was poor agreement in the identification of pneumoperitoneum and in the comparison of pancreatic lesion dimensions for B-mode vs. CEUS. The CT feature of fat stranding was detected in cases including, but not limited to, gastric neoplasia with perforation, pancreatitis, and small intestinal foreign body. Ultrasound underestimated the size and number of specific lesions when compared with CE-MDCT. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was successful in detecting bowel and pancreatic perfusion deficits that CE-MDCT failed to identify. Accuracy for differentiation of surgical vs. non-surgical conditions was high for all modalities; 100%, 94%, and 94% for CE-MDCT, ultrasonography and survey radiography respectively. Findings indicated that CE-MDCT is an accurate screening test for differentiating surgical from non-surgical acute abdominal conditions in dogs. Focused CEUS following CE-MDCT or B-mode ultrasonography may be beneficial for identifying potentially significant hypoperfused lesions.

AB  - Background:? Negative trauma-related cognitions have been found to be a significant factor in the maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. Initial studies of such appraisals in trauma-exposed children and adolescents suggest that this is an important line of research in youth, yet empirically validated measures for use with younger populations are lacking. A measure of negative trauma-related cognitions for use with children and adolescents, the Child Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI), is presented. The measure was devised as an age-appropriate version of the adult Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (Foa et al., 1999). Methods:? The CPTCI was developed and validated within a large (n?=?570) sample, comprising community and trauma-exposed samples of children and adolescents aged 6?18?years. Results:? Principal components analysis suggested a two-component structure. These components were labelled ?permanent and disturbing change? and ?fragile person in a scary world?, and were each found to possess good internal consistency, test?retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminative validity. The reliability and validity of these sub-scales was present regardless of whether the measure was completed in the acute phase or several months after a trauma. Scores on these sub-scales did not vary with age. Conclusions:? The CPTCI is a reliable and valid measure that is not specific to the type of trauma exposure, and shows considerable promise as a research and clinical tool. The structure of this measure suggests that appraisals concerning the more abstract consequences of a trauma, as well as physical threat and vulnerability, are pertinent factors in trauma-exposed children and adolescents, even prepubescent children.

AB  - Abstract Background Complex regional pain syndrome is a painful and disabling post-traumatic primary pain disorder. Acute and chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) are major clinical challenges. In Europe, progress is hampered by significant heterogeneity in clinical practice. We sought to establish standards for the diagnosis and management of CRPS. Methods The European Pain Federation established a pan-European task force of experts in CRPS who followed a four-stage consensus challenge process to produce mandatory quality standards worded as grammatically imperative (must-do) statements. Results We developed 17 standards in 8 areas of care. There are 2 standards in diagnosis, 1 in multidisciplinary care, 1 in assessment, 3 for care pathways, 1 in information and education, 4 in pain management, 3 in physical rehabilitation and 2 on distress management. The standards are presented and summarized, and their generation and consequences were discussed. Also presented are domains of practice for which no agreement on a standard could be reached. Areas of research needed to improve the validity and uptake of these standards are discussed. Conclusion The European Pain Federation task force present 17 standards of the diagnosis and management of CRPS for use in Europe. These are considered achievable for most countries and aspirational for a minority of countries depending on their healthcare resource and structures. Significance This position statement summarizes expert opinion on acceptable standards for CRPS care in Europe.

AB  - Summary.? Physiotherapy and radiography of the joints are standard diagnostic strategies for assessment of haemophilic arthropathy. The use of ultrasonography as an adjunct tool for early diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy may optimize factor replacement therapy. The objective of this study was to compare costs and effectiveness of physiotherapy, radiography and ultrasonography (intervention strategy, IS) with physiotherapy and radiography alone (standard care strategy, SCS) for diagnosing soft tissue and osteocartilaginous changes in haemophilic joints. We retrospectively compared costs and effectiveness of IS vs. SCS in knees, ankles and elbows of 31 children (age range, 4?17?years) with haemophilia A (n?=?30) or B (n?=?1) (IS, n?=?11; SS, N?=?20). Direct health care costs were measured from the provincial health care perspective. Effectiveness was measured by false-negative (FN) rates in each study arm by comparing presence or absence of abnormalities of physiotherapy and imaging exams to the reference standard measure (MRI). In scenario 1, all diagnostic tests matched with MRI. In scenario 2, at least one diagnostic test matched with MRI. The IS was more costly [incremental cost/100 patients, Canadian (CND) $4987] and more effective (incremental effectiveness, FNs/100 patients for scenario 1, ?4.09, and for scenario 2, ?41) for both scenarios. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for scenario 1 and for scenario 2 were CND$1166 and CDN$116 per FN result averted per 100 patients, respectively. In conclusion, in the short-term, the incorporation of ultrasonography in a test set for diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy substantially improved the diagnostic performance of this test set, however at an increased cost.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aims to describe the association between sociodemographic factors and trajectories of disease, disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA). Methods Data were collected prospectively over 3 years in the Singapore Early Arthritis Cohort study. Trajectories were modeled using multi-trajectory group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) and determinants of trajectory membership were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Results Two hundred and thirteen patients were included: 58.2% Chinese, 16.4% Malay, 21.6% Indian, mean (SD) age 51.3 (12.6) years and symptom duration 21.8 (15.3) weeks. In the multi-trajectory analysis, three groups of disease trajectories and corresponding disability and HRQoL trajectories were identified: group 1 (moderate disease rapid response, 49.9%), group 2 (high disease rapid response, 31.1%) and group 3 (high disease slow response, 19.1%). Malay patients had higher relative risk ratio (RRR) of being in trajectory groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (RRR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.05-3.98 and RRR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.45-6.43, respectively) while patients with tertiary education had lower relative risk (RRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.89 and RRR = 0.33, (95% CI 0.14-0.83, respectively). In the analysis of individual outcomes, ethnicity, education level and body mass index were determinants of the heterogeneous disease activity trajectories. Gender and education level were determinants of the disability trajectories. Only gender was a determinant of the HRQoL trajectories. Further, 96.2% of the patients were treated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Conclusion Disparities in sociodemographic factors should be taken into consideration in formulating treatment strategies in ERA.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objectives of the present study were to describe the injury profiles of cyclists presenting to an ED and determine the risk of significant head injury associated with bicycle helmet use. Methods This was a retrospective single trauma centre study of all adult cyclists presenting to an inner city ED and undergoing a trauma team review between January 2012 and June 2014. The outcome of interest was significant head injury defined as any head injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale score of two or more. Variables analysed included demographic characteristics, helmet use at time of incident, location, time and the presence of intoxication. Results The most common body regions were upper limb injuries (57%), followed by head injuries (43%), facial injuries (30%) and lower limb injuries (24%). A lower proportion of people wearing helmets had significant head injury (17% vs 31%, P = 0.018) or facial injury (26% vs 48%, P = 0.0017) compared with non-helmet users. After adjustment for important covariates, helmet use was associated with a 70% decrease in the odds of significant head injury (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.15, 0.76, P = 0.008). Conclusions Head injuries were common after inner city cycling incidents. The use of helmets was associated with a reduction in significant head injury.

AB  - Aim.? To understand the uniqueness of the experience of testing HIV positive from the perspective of pregnant women. Background.? As more people learn of their HIV diagnosis through routine screening processes, it is timely to reflect on the impact of receiving an unexpected positive result. Design.? A prospective qualitative study. Methods.? This paper draws on the case studies of four women who were participating in a larger prospective qualitative study of reproductive decision-making, pregnancy and childbirth following HIV diagnosis. Multiple interviews were conducted following diagnosis during pregnancy, and, after the birth of their babies. Thematic data analysis was undertaken. Results.? Drawing on Becker?s theory of disruption, we document the ?sudden disjuncture? of their antenatal diagnosis and the embodied emotional struggle the women engaged in to create continuity in their lives. A diagnosis of HIV disrupted the women?s biographies in terms of their health, relationships and social identity. As pregnant women, the threat of HIV was experienced most significantly in relation to their unborn child. However, their narratives also revealed how a diagnosis of HIV in the context of pregnancy, whilst traumatic, provided a focus for regaining continuity in their lives, as the baby became a metaphor for hope and orientation toward the future. Conclusions.? As HIV testing becomes more ?routine?, the findings of this study serve to remind health professionals that a positive diagnosis continues to constitute a major trauma to individuals and families. Relevance to clinical practice.? We propose that appropriately educated nursing and midwifery staff could facilitate the ?meaning making? process that is required for newly diagnosed HIV positive persons to find a subjective sense of well-being in their lives.

Other lesions (e.g. simple cysts, fibroepithelial lesions and some malignancies) may be mammographically indistinguishable and ultrasound (US) may be helpful in further characterisation, for example, by demonstrating posterior enhancement with simple cysts, cystic and solid components in papillary lesions, internal septations on haematomas and abscesses, solid homogeneity or heterogeneity in fibroepithelial lesions and increased vascularity in neoplastic, inflammatory or infective lesions. A diagnostic needle biopsy may be performed in some cases; however, with larger and heterogeneous lesions, there is an increased possibility of diagnostic inaccuracy due to limited sampling, such that full excision of the lesion may be advisable to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives The increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and the consequent progression to cirrhosis is expected to become a major cause of liver transplantation. This will exacerbate the organ donor shortage and mean that ?marginal? fatty liver grafts are more frequently used. Autofluorescence spectroscopy is a fast, objective, and non-destructive method to detect change in the endogenous fluorophores distribution and could prove to be a valuable tool for NAFLD diagnosis and transplant graft assessment. Materials and Methods A system was constructed consisting of a fibre probe with two laser diodes that provided excitation light at 375 and 405?nm, and an imaging spectrograph system. This was used to distinguish fluorescence spectra acquired from the harvested livers from mice with NAFLD of differing severity (healthy, mild steatotic and steatohepatitic). The fluorescence data were entered into a sparse multiclass probabilistic algorithm for disease classification. Histopathology, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and alanine transaminase (ALT) assays were conducted in addition to the fluorescence measurements Results TBARS and ALT assays enabled differentiation of the steatohepatitic group from the mild steatosis and control groups (P?≤?0.028) but failed to separate the mild steatotic group from the control group. The three groups were all clearly differentiated from each other using fluorescence spectroscopy, and classification accuracy was found to be 95%. Conclusion Fluorescence spectroscopy appears to be a promising approach for the analysis of diseased liver tissue. Lasers Surg. Med. 43:392?400, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? Muscle haematoma represents 10?25% of bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia. There is limited consensus on diagnostic or treatment strategies and little knowledge about the natural history of muscle haematoma and optimal treatment goals. The aim of this review was to perform a systematic description of the natural history of muscle haematoma in healthy athletes, focusing on diagnosis, classification and treatment options. Publications and educational textbooks on management of sports injuries were used as data source. Muscle haematomas occur following contusion, strain, or laceration and can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. Muscle haematoma may be inter- or intramuscular. In healthy athletes, the healing process takes 20?40?days. Optimal diagnosis includes history, physical examination (inspection, palpation, active and passive range of motion (ROM) test, muscle length test, isometric strength test, biomechanical examination, full spinal examination, peripheral nerve test and slump test), ultrasound, MRI or CT. Treatment is conducted based on: (i) super-acute stage, control of the bleeding and minimizing the size of the haematoma; (ii) acute stage, restoration of pain-free ROM; (iii) subacute stage, functional rehabilitation; and (iv) gradual return to normal activity. Treatment and preventive strategies include RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation), protected mobilization, stretching and strengthening exercises, manual therapy (articular, neural and soft tissue mobilization and massage), correction of movement dysfunction, functional rehabilitation and electro-therapeutic interventions. The study reviews the natural history of muscle haematoma and state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment in healthy athletes. Results may be useful to optimize diagnosis and treatment of muscle haematoma in patients with haemophilia.

AB  - An improved understanding and characterization of glial activation and its relationship with white matter injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination after brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public healthcare burden and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Particularly, traumatic white matter (WM) injury or traumatic axonal injury has been reported as being associated with patients' poor outcomes. However, there is very limited data reporting the importance of glial activation after TBI and its interaction with WM injury. This article presents a systematic review of traumatic WM injury and the associated glial activation, from basic science to clinical diagnosis and prognosis, from advanced neuroimaging perspective. It concludes that there is a disconnection between WM injury research and the essential role of glia which serve to restore a healthy environment for axonal regeneration following WM injury. Particularly, there is a significant lack of non-invasive means to characterize the complex pathophysiology of WM injury and glial activation in both animal models and in humans. An improved understanding and characterization of the relationship between glia and WM injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) presents in young, otherwise-healthy individuals. This study examined recurrence and survival characteristics after surgical resection for FLC by utilizing an international multi-institutional database. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for FLC from six institutions (1993?2010) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was studied with life tables and Cox regression models. Results Thirty-five patients (13 female, 37%) were included (median age: 32 years). R0 resection was achieved in all curative-intent operations (n?=?30), and palliative operations were performed for five patients. Crude 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 22% and 3%, respectively. For curative-intent surgery, overall and recurrence-free survivals at 5 years were 62% and 45%, respectively. In patients who achieved a 4-year disease-free interval after surgery, none subsequently developed recurrence. In multivariate models, presence of extrahepatic disease was the only factor that independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38?22.55, P?=?0.016) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.64, 95% CI: 1.48?21.49, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Patients with surgically amenable FLC had encouraging long-term survival. Recurrence-free survival to 4 years suggested possible freedom from disease thereafter. Recurrent resectable disease was associated with an excellent prognosis, and repeat surgery should be strongly considered. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014; 110:412?415. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
