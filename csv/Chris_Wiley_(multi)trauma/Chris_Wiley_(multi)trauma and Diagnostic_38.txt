AB  - An improved understanding and characterization of glial activation and its relationship with white matter injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination after brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public healthcare burden and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Particularly, traumatic white matter (WM) injury or traumatic axonal injury has been reported as being associated with patients' poor outcomes. However, there is very limited data reporting the importance of glial activation after TBI and its interaction with WM injury. This article presents a systematic review of traumatic WM injury and the associated glial activation, from basic science to clinical diagnosis and prognosis, from advanced neuroimaging perspective. It concludes that there is a disconnection between WM injury research and the essential role of glia which serve to restore a healthy environment for axonal regeneration following WM injury. Particularly, there is a significant lack of non-invasive means to characterize the complex pathophysiology of WM injury and glial activation in both animal models and in humans. An improved understanding and characterization of the relationship between glia and WM injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination.

AB  - Abstract Purpose. To evaluate the sonographic features of traumatic neuromas after neck dissection. Methods. This study included 8 patients whose ages ranged from 36?69 years (mean, 49 years). In all cases, traumatic neuromas were incidentally detected at neck sonography for evaluation of suspected recurrence of well-differentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. All sonograms and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results. This study covered 8 cases in which traumatic neuromas were diagnosed by clinical, laboratory, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and other imaging modalities. None of the patients had clinical signs of neuromas, which were, incidentally, discovered by neck sonography. A noticeable sonographic feature in all cases was an isoechoic mass with internal parallel heterogeneous hyperechogenicity. All patients complained of severe pain during FNAB. The cytological results of 2 patients showed fragments of nerve tissue. The remaining 6 FNABs were nondiagnostic. Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels in washout fluids from FNAB of all patients were <0.2 ng/mL, indicating nonthyroidal origin. Conclusion. Distinctive sonographic features, sharp pain during FNAB, and low Tg levels in FNAB washout fluid can help to diagnose traumatic neuromas without surgery. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - SUMMARY From a review of the literature, it can be concluded that it is always advantageous and usually necessary to distribute the casualties of a disaster to several hosp-hospitals rather than allowing 1 hospital, the nearest to the scene, to bear the whole load. The potential of these hospitals would be enhanced if their preparedness and planning included anticipation of their functioning as part of a framework of the entire capacity of the medical services of an entire small country, or a region of a larger one. For the smooth functioning of this framework, central co-ordination and control of the distribution of the load, the movements within it, the strengthening of its various component parts is necessary and services other than medical (transport, communications, etc.) are essential. The establishment of a multihospital system for disaster situations for a whole region is suggested. This would integrate all medical facilities and services of the region, as well as promoting additional services, first horizontally integrated and later vertically, and would have a central governing body with full authority to prepare the system for the calamity and to execute the implementation of the plan when disaster occurs. This body may find it useful to base some of its decision in the planning as well as the implementing stage, on an assumed population of casualties that is characteristic for the region and on implications that may be drawn from the population.

AB  - Abstract Objective In order to optimize psycho-oncologic care for patients with severe stressor-related symptomatology, we aimed to provide (a) valid and generalizable prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in oncological patients and (b) the percentage of PTSD cases elicited by cancer-related events. Methods This multi-center study was based on a representative sample of patients across cancer types. A diagnostic interview (CIDI-O) was used to assess PTSD according to DSM-IV. We first describe type and frequency of potentially traumatic events (A1-events) and the degree to which they meet the trauma criteria (A2-events). Subsequently, we present adjusted prevalence rates of PTSD and explore the proportion of patients with cancer-related PTSD. Results Four thousand twenty patients participated (response rate: 68 %), and 2141 completed the diagnostic interview; 1641 patients reported at least one A1-event, of whom 16% (n = 257) reported cancer-related events. Ninety-one percent (n = 232) of theses cancer-related events qualified as A2-events. Across cancer types, the adjusted 4-week prevalence of PTSD was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.5-2.7); 9% (n = 5) of the 4-week PTSD cases were cancer-related. Conclusions Across cancer types and treatment settings, few cancer patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Of those, a mere fraction was attributable to cancer-related events. These robust findings should be taken into account in both research and practice to develop and provide adequate care for cancer patients with severe stressor-related symptomatology.

AB  - Canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. A retrospective study was undertaken of all dogs that were presented between January 1999 and January 2004 to the Animal Health Trust for the treatment of tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. Five cases were identified, and their median survival time was 211 days (95 per cent confidence interval 80 to 352) with two of the five dogs remaining alive at the end of the study, 826 and 1628 days from diagnosis with no clinical signs of disease. The protocol was well tolerated with only one of the five dogs showing toxicity associated with carboplatin and all dogs that started radiotherapy completing it. Compared with results of previous studies, these cases suggest that surgical cytoreduction followed by coarse fractionated radiotherapy together with carboplatin may be a useful way to treat this tumour. Carboplatin alone caused partial remission in the two cases where it was used as neo-adjunctive therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Cystoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of urological problems in man. Until recently its use in dogs was limited to rigid endoscopy in the bitch. With modern flexible fibre-optic instruments the majority of male dogs can also be examined without the need for surgical intervention. This paper describes the techniques used and the cystoscopic findings in a series of 38 clinical cases. In 24 of these, abnormal findings were present permitting a diagnosis to be made or confirmed. The potential for this technique as a diagnostic procedure is discussed.

AB  - During one year all ankle inversion injuries seen at the acute ward of our institution were divided into grades of severity and classified according to the maximal area of tenderness at the time of clinical examination. Seven years later 648 of the subjects (91%) evaluated their ankle with the help of a questionnaire. Location of maximal tenderness at the time of injury was: lateral fibular ligaments 61%, lateral midfoot ligaments 24%, base of the fifth metatarsal/peroneal tendons 5% and combined lesions 8%. 39% were considered minor, 46% were moderate, and 15% severe. All cases followed a functional treatment protocol. Seven years post- injury 32% reported chronic complaints of pain, swelling or recurrent sprains. 72% of the subjects with residual disability reported that they were functionally impaired by their ankle ? in most cases a question of not performing sports at a desired level. 4% experienced pain at rest and were severely disabled. 19% were bothered by repeated inversion injuries ? 43% of these subjects felt that they could compensate by using an external ankle support. There was no correlation between the severity of the sprain as judged at the time of injury and the frequency of residual disability or between the area of maximal tenderness at the time of injury and the area of maximal pain at the time of follow-up.

AB  - Abstract ? A cross-sectional survey was carried out on 3702 boys and girls aged 9?14 years, attending public and private primary schools in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A multi-stage sampling technique using an equal probability scheme was adopted to select the children. The response rate for the total sample was 97%. Dental examinations were carried out by one dentist (MISC). Intra-examiner agreement was very good. The prevalence of dental injuries increased from 8% at the age of 9 years to 13.6% at 12 and 16.1% at 14 years. Adjusted results showed that children from high socio-economic backgrounds were 1.4 (95% CI=1.15?1.79) times more likely to present with a dental injury than children with low SES. Boys were 1.7 times (95% CI=1.41?2.16) more likely to have dental injuries than girls. Children with an overjet size greater than 5.0 mm were 1.37 times (95% CI=1.06?1.80) more likely to have a dental injury than children with an overjet size equal or lower than 5.0 mm. Finally, children with an adequate lip coverage were 0.56 times (95% CI=0.44?0.72) less likely to have a traumatic dental injury than those with inadequate lip coverage.

To quantify the impact of edentulousness on residual ridge volume, denture stomatitis (DS), as well as oral health behaviours among geriatric denture-wearers. Background:? Residual ridge resorption (RRR) is the primary intraoral complication of complete edentulism, but individual variation among geriatric patients has been observed. Materials and methods:? Data collection relied upon a 10-year retrospective chart review of all complete denture-wearing geriatric patients presenting at the Removable Prosthodontics Clinic, Dental School of Athens, between 1993 and 2002. Analyses relied on descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on ordinal logistic regression. Results:? A total of 873 records of geriatric patients (age mean?=?72; median?=?70; range?=?65?95) comprised our analytical sample. Subjects? mean (SD) time since edentulation was 7.7 (10.2) years. Eleven percent were diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). While 28% of patients reported cleaning their dentures at least daily, 6% presented with denture stomatitis (DS). Each added year of edentulism increased the odds of mandibular RRR: OR (95% CI)?=?1.05 (1.03, 1.07). Nightly denture wear was the strongest risk factor for DS. Finally, independent of age and sex, each year of being edentulous increased the odds of presenting with TMD: OR (95% CI)?=?1.03 (1.01, 1.05). Conclusion:? Time since edentulation was strongly associated with mandibular but not maxillary RRR, as well as TMD development.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively useful sonographic diagnostic criteria for testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma and to determine significant predictors among the criteria. Methods From July 2004 to February 2007, 29 consecutive patients (mean age, 22.8 years; range, 20?43 years) with blunt scrotal trauma who underwent scrotal sonography were enrolled. Ten ruptured testes and 6 intact testes were confirmed by surgery, and an additional 13 intact testes were confirmed by a physical examination. The sonographic findings were recorded with respect to contour irregularity, the presence of intratesticular and extratesticular heterogeneous echoes, loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography, and engorgement of the pampiniform plexus by consensus between 2 radiologists. The sonographic findings used to diagnose testicular rupture were analyzed by the Fisher exact test, and significant predictors were determined by multiple regression analysis. Results The ruptured testes showed contour irregularity (P = .0002), a heterogeneous intratesticular echo pattern (P = .0077), and loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography (P = .0093). Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus was seen in most nonruptured testes (P = .0178). Contour irregularity was the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture (P = .0002). On the basis of this single predictor, diagnostic predictive values for sonography were calculated; the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all 90%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 82% and 94%, respectively. Conclusions Among the useful sonographic criteria, contour irregularity is the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma.

AB  - Abstract This study examined how the characteristics of people with mental illness who are participants in post-booking jail diversion programs affect recidivism and time spent incarcerated. The study employed data from a multi-site, federally funded jail diversion initiative. A pre?post comparison design was used to compare experiences of arrest and days spent in jail of diverted individuals for the 12 months following enrollment with the 12 months prior to enrollment. Also compared were differences in 12-month public safety outcomes. Data were collected between February 2003 and August 2007. The findings suggest that people with mental illness who are diverted from jail to community-based services experience fewer arrests and jail days. Approximately half of the sample were never arrested during the 12 months following enrollment. The strongest differences between people who experienced reduced contact with the criminal justice system and people with unchanged or increased contact were found in measures of criminal history. The results suggest that services targeted to diverted individuals with mental illness should address public safety goals, not just those of public health. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary The incidence of multiple pregnancies continues to rise, in part due to the increasing use of assisted reproduction techniques. Due to the serious maternal and perinatal complications with multiple pregnancies and the further increased risks with higher order multiples, selective fetal reduction has been offered in an attempt to improve perinatal outcomes. This invasive, ultrasound-guided, percutaneous procedure has theoretical risks of pregnancy loss, morbidity to the surviving fetuses and associated risks of premature ruptured membranes and preterm labour. It also evokes complex ethical and moral issues for the parents, clinicians and society as a whole. Pregnancy outcome rates have improved following selective fetal reduction as experience with techniques have improved and the number of very high order pregnancies has reduced.

AB  - Abstract Background Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) symptoms can significantly differ between patients, fluctuate over time, disappear or persist. This leads to problems in defining recovery and in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Objectives To define recovery from the patients? perspective and better understand their priorities for treatment approaches. Methods Establishing an international consortium, we used a 2-Round Delphi-based study in eight countries across Europe and North America. Participants ≥18 years who met, or had met, Budapest clinical criteria were included. Round 1 participants completed the statement: ?I would/do consider myself recovered from CRPS if/because?? alongside demographic and health questionnaires. Data were thematically organised and represented as 62 statements, from which participants identified and ranked their recovery priorities in Round 2. Results Round 1 (N = 347, 80% female, 91% non-recovered) dominant ICF themes were: activities of daily living; bodily functions; external factors; participation and personal factors. The top five priority statements in Round 2 (N = 252) were: no longer having (1) CRPS-related pain, (2) generalised pain and discomfort, (3) restricted range of movement, (4) need for medication, (5) stiffness in the affected limb. With very few exceptions, priorities were consistent, irrespective of patient demographics/geography. Symptoms affecting daily activities were among those most frequently reported. Conclusions Our data showed a small number of themes are of highest importance to CRPS patients? definition of recovery. Patients want their pain, movement restriction and reliance on medication to be addressed, above all other factors. These factors should therefore be foremost concerns for future treatment and rehabilitation programmes. Significance Those with longstanding CRPS may no longer meet diagnostic criteria but still be symptomatic. Defining recovery is therefore problematic in CRPS. Our study has identified patients? definition of recovery from CRPS, in order of priority, as relief from: their CRPS-related pain, generalised pain, movement restriction, reliance on medication, and stiffness.

AB  - Summary Background Primary hyperparathyroidism is uncommon in equids. Objectives To describe the diagnostic findings and efficacy of treatment in equids with primary hyperparathyroidism. Study design Retrospective case series describing 16 horses and one mule. Methods Cases were identified by retrospective review of records at Cornell University and via an ACVIM listserv query. Inclusion criteria were an equid with hypercalcemia, normal renal function and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) or histopathological diagnosis of a parathyroid adenoma. Equids with normal PTH and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) in the face of hypercalcemia were included as suspect cases. Results The most common presenting complaints were weight loss (12/17) and hypercalcemia (10/17). PTH was above reference range in 12/17 cases. Suspected parathyroid tumours were localised in 12/14 equids imaged using ultrasonography alone (2/3), technetium 99m Tc sestamibi scintigraphy alone (1/1) or both modalities (9/10). Three horses did not have imaging performed. Surgical exploration successfully excised tumours in six of 10 cases. Five were located at the thoracic inlet, and surgery resulted in complete cure. One tumour was excised from the thyroid lobe, and the horse remained hypercalcemic. Four other cases explored surgically, four treated medically and three that were not treated also remained hypercalcemic. Main limitations The small study size prohibited statistical analysis. Conclusions Parathyroid adenomas in equids can be successfully localised with ultrasonography and scintigraphy. Surgical excision appears more likely to be successful for single gland disease at the thoracic inlet.

AB  - Abstract No standard of care is currently recognized for treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC). This retrospective study assesses outcome following definitive-intent, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (RT) in dogs with PC. Medical records review was performed, including 18 patients from four institutions undergoing definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiotherapy to treat PC. Diagnosis was incidental in 7/18 (39%) patients. Five dogs (28%) had evidence of metastasis to loco-regional lymph nodes at diagnosis. Seventeen patients received concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 15/18 (83%) patients received maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy, with variable drugs and protocols employed. Total prescribed radiation dose ranged from 48 to 54?Gy (median 50?Gy) delivered as daily doses of 2.5-2.8 Gy. One patient was euthanized prior to completing radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was observed in nine patients; Grade 1-2 diarrhoea was the most common toxicity observed. Suspected late toxicity (urethral stricture, ureteral stricture and hindlimb oedema) was observed in three patients. Median event-free survival (EFS) following RT was 220?days, and median overall survival was 563?days. Local progression occurred in seven patients at a median of 241?days. Median overall survival was significantly longer in incidentally diagnosed dogs (581 vs 220?days in symptomatic dogs, P = .042). EFS was significantly longer in patients treated with MTD chemotherapy (241 vs 25?days, P <?.001), and significantly shorter in patients presenting with evidence of metastatic disease (109?days) vs those without (388?days, P = .008). These findings suggest that definitive-intent radiotherapy is a valuable treatment option for local control of canine PC with moderate risk of toxicity.

AB  - Abstract Objective The goal of the present study was to compare the diagnostic yield of weight-bearing radiographs with non-weight-bearing computed tomography (CT) scan for subtle Lisfranc (LF) injuries in the ED. Methods Retrospective analysis of patients presenting with a suspected LF injury over a 2 year period from 2016 to 2017 who had both weight-bearing bilateral foot radiographs and CT scan. Information extracted included patient demographics, radiographic findings of metatarsal fractures, fleck sign and measurements of diastasis between the medial cuneiform and second metatarsal expressed as a ratio of the uninjured side, clinical findings and treatment modality. Radiologist reports were recorded as either positive, negative or equivocal for a LF injury. Results A total of 117 patients were included with a mean age of 38?years and 54% (n?=?63) women. When initial weight-bearing radiographs were positive, 54% of subsequent CT scans were reported as either equivocal or negative. Of the patients who had a negative or equivocal weight-bearing radiograph, only 12% had a positive CT scan. The mean diastasis ratio in patients undergoing surgery was 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.41?1.65) compared to 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.07?1.16) for patients with injuries not requiring operative intervention (P?<?0.001). There was a statistically significant correlation between a positive weight-bearing radiograph and surgical treatment (R?=?0.339, P?<?0.001), and between diastasis measurements and surgical treatment (R?=?0.576, P?<?0.001). Conclusions CT provides limited benefit in the diagnosis and initial management of suspected subtle LF injuries in the ED. We advocate for the use of bilateral weight-bearing radiographs as a first-line investigation.
