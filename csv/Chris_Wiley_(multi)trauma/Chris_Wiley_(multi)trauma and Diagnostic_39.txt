AB  - Abstract Objective The goal of the present study was to compare the diagnostic yield of weight-bearing radiographs with non-weight-bearing computed tomography (CT) scan for subtle Lisfranc (LF) injuries in the ED. Methods Retrospective analysis of patients presenting with a suspected LF injury over a 2 year period from 2016 to 2017 who had both weight-bearing bilateral foot radiographs and CT scan. Information extracted included patient demographics, radiographic findings of metatarsal fractures, fleck sign and measurements of diastasis between the medial cuneiform and second metatarsal expressed as a ratio of the uninjured side, clinical findings and treatment modality. Radiologist reports were recorded as either positive, negative or equivocal for a LF injury. Results A total of 117 patients were included with a mean age of 38?years and 54% (n?=?63) women. When initial weight-bearing radiographs were positive, 54% of subsequent CT scans were reported as either equivocal or negative. Of the patients who had a negative or equivocal weight-bearing radiograph, only 12% had a positive CT scan. The mean diastasis ratio in patients undergoing surgery was 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.41?1.65) compared to 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.07?1.16) for patients with injuries not requiring operative intervention (P?<?0.001). There was a statistically significant correlation between a positive weight-bearing radiograph and surgical treatment (R?=?0.339, P?<?0.001), and between diastasis measurements and surgical treatment (R?=?0.576, P?<?0.001). Conclusions CT provides limited benefit in the diagnosis and initial management of suspected subtle LF injuries in the ED. We advocate for the use of bilateral weight-bearing radiographs as a first-line investigation.

AB  - Abstract The relationship between farming and cancer risk was investigated in an integrated series of case-control studies conducted from 1985 to 1991 in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, north-east Italy. Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, colon and rectum, pancreas, breast, thyroid gland, kidney and urinary tract, bladder, prostate, soft-tissue sarcomas, Hodgkin's diseases, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myelomas, and controls admitted to hospital for acute, non-neoplastic conditions, were interviewed. For males, a significantly elevated relative risk was seen for oral cavity and pharynx. Farming, however, was associated with a significant protection against cancer of the colon and rectum and bladder. In females, only one significant association emerged, for multiple myeloma. A few significant interactions between cancer risk and year of birth (i.e., before 1930 or 1930 and after) were observed. The risk of cancer of the larynx was significantly elevated in younger male farmers but not in older ones. Our multi-site case-control study confirms that farmers have, for some cancer sites, a distinctive pattern. Excesses of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx in farmers are characteristic of the present study area and, possibly, of similar European rural populations who have in common high levels of alcohol consumption and, at least in the past, unbalanced diets.

AB  - Abstract Lipoblastomas are rare benign tumors of white fatty tissue that occur primarily in young children. Occasionally, heterogeneity of morphological appearance and histological overlap with other lipogenic tumors are described. In such cases fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of PLAG1, a gene specifically rearranged in lipoblastoma, is necessary to prevent misdiagnosis. We present a case of lipoblastoma arising in an atypical site with histological features characteristic of lipoma. The correct diagnosis was made possible on cytogenetic grounds through the identification of the characteristic PLAG1-HAS2 fusion gene, thus allowing an appropriate clinical approach.

The basic method and mechanism(s) of preparation of albumin microspheres and subsequent modifications made to overcome the drawbacks of earlier approaches and the need for further developments are discussed, as are the processing parameters and the level of various ingredients affecting the physicochemical properties of the albumin microspheres. Different equations proposed by various investigators to modulate in vitro release kinetics are reviewed. The microscopic structural and surface properties, the chemical modification of the biopolymer (e.g., cationization, tagging with amino acids and sugar moieties) for tissue specificity or to influence the release profile and biodegradation are discussed. An array of potential diagnostic applications and the use of albumin microspheres as a drug delivery system are reviewed. Drug Dev. Res. 58:219?247, 2003.? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - The participation and support of the family in the rehabilitation process is essential. The family of the brain-injured person, placed in a stressful situation, needs nursing care and intervention. This need is identified in the literature and supported by experience. The dimensions of a family care plan are included in a step-by-step approach, with emphasis on the assessment phase. Specific areas addressed in the assessment are the overall family system, phases of recovery, and the response to crisis. A care plan is provided as a guide. The care plan must be expanded and individualized to meet the needs of the family unit or family member to be most effective.

AB  - Abstract Three hundred and thirty-nine Vietnam combat veterans with the diagnosis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder were administered the Vietnam Related Experiences Questionnaire. The items on this questionnaire were constructed to highlight four combat related conflicts postulated to represent the salient symptom clusters within PTSD: fear-anxiety, mistrust, survival guilt, and guilt secondary to aggression. Exploratory factor analysis followed by a confirmatory factor analytic procedure using maximum likelihood estimate demonstrated a five-factor solution: vulnerability, guilt, dreams of death/destruction, depression, and rebelliousness. The factor loadings of the variables and the factor correlations are discussed. Diagnostic features of the questionnaire are highlighted.

AB  - Summary This European guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia was developed by a task force of the European Sleep Research Society, with the aim of providing clinical recommendations for the management of adult patients with insomnia. The guideline is based on a systematic review of relevant meta-analyses published till June 2016. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians involved in the management of insomnia, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the evidence and guide recommendations. The diagnostic procedure for insomnia, and its co-morbidities, should include a clinical interview consisting of a sleep history (sleep habits, sleep environment, work schedules, circadian factors), the use of sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, questions about somatic and mental health, a physical examination and additional measures if indicated (i.e. blood tests, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram; strong recommendation, moderate- to high-quality evidence). Polysomnography can be used to evaluate other sleep disorders if suspected (i.e. periodic limb movement disorder, sleep-related breathing disorders), in treatment-resistant insomnia, for professional at-risk populations and when substantial sleep state misperception is suspected (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not sufficiently effective or not available. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists and some antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia (≤4 weeks; weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin and phytotherapeutics are not recommended for insomnia treatment (strong to weak recommendations, low- to very-low-quality evidence). Light therapy and exercise need to be further evaluated to judge their usefulness in the treatment of insomnia (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Complementary and alternative treatments (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) are not recommended for insomnia treatment (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

AB  - Background Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal skin disease of cats and dogs. The most common pathogens of small animals belong to the genera Microsporum and Trichophyton. It is an important skin disease because it is contagious, infectious and can be transmitted to people. Objectives The objective of this document is to review the existing literature and provide consensus recommendations for veterinary clinicians and lay people on the diagnosis and treatment of dermatophytosis in cats and dogs. Methods The authors served as a Guideline Panel (GP) and reviewed the literature available prior to September 2016. The GP prepared a detailed literature review and made recommendations on selected topics. The World Association of Veterinary Dermatology (WAVD) provided guidance and oversight for this process. A draft of the document was presented at the 8th World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology (May 2016) and was then made available via the World Wide Web to the member organizations of the WAVD for a period of three months. Comments were solicited and posted to the GP electronically. Responses were incorporated by the GP into the final document. Conclusions No one diagnostic test was identified as the gold standard. Successful treatment requires concurrent use of systemic oral antifungals and topical disinfection of the hair coat. Wood's lamp and direct examinations have good positive and negative predictability, systemic antifungal drugs have a wide margin of safety and physical cleaning is most important for decontamination of the exposed environments. Finally, serious complications of animal?human transmission are exceedingly rare.

AB  - Objectives: To retrospectively review the first treatment response of dogs with mycotic rhinosinusitis to commonly utilised treatment techniques. Methods: Medical records of dogs treated for mycotic rhinosinusitis were obtained retrospectively via a manual review of the clinical databases of six veterinary referral centres for the period of January 1998 to June 2008, and first treatment outcome was evaluated. Historical and clinicopathological findings were also reviewed to evaluate their impact on treatment success or failure. Results: There was no significant difference in first treatment outcome between treatment groups (P=0·21). When all topical treatments were considered together (n=85), 39 dogs (45·8%) had a successful first treatment. Initial treatment success was associated with a younger age (56·3 versus 75·8 months; P=0·02) and was 2·7 times more likely in dogs with unilateral disease, although this was not significant (P=0·07). Adjunctive therapy with systemic antifungal agents was associated with treatment failure (PÄ0·01). Fifty-nine dogs (69·4%) responded successfully following multiple treatments. Clinical Significance: Treatment of mycotic rhinosinusitis remains challenging, and multiple treatments are frequently required for adequate treatment. Reasons for first treatment failure are likely multifactorial in origin, making it difficult to predict those dogs that are likely to have a superior prognosis, regardless of the treatment type used.

AB  - Abstract Background In the era of frequent head-to-pelvis computed tomography (CT) for adult blunt trauma evaluation, we sought to update teachings regarding aortic injury by determining 1) the incidence of aortic injury; 2) the proportion of patients with isolated aortic injury (without other concomitant thoracic injury); 3) the clinical implications of aortic injury (hospital mortality, length of stay [LOS], and rate of surgical interventions); and 4) the screening value of traditional risk factors/markers (such as high-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on chest x-ray [CXR]) for aortic injury, compared to newer criteria from the recently developed NEXUS Chest CT decision instrument (DI). Methods We conducted a preplanned analysis of patients prospectively enrolled in the NEXUS Chest studies at 10 Level I trauma centers with the following inclusion criteria: age > 14 years, blunt trauma within 6 hours of ED presentation, and receiving chest imaging during ED trauma evaluation. Results Of 24,010 enrolled subjects, 42 (0.17%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13% to 0.24%) had aortic injury. Most patients (79%, 95% CI = 64% to 88%) had an associated thoracic injury, with rib fractures, pneumothorax/hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion occurring most frequently. Compared to patients without aortic injury this cohort had similar mortality (9.5%, 95% CI = 3.8% to 22.1% vs. 5.8%, 95% CI = 5.4% to 6.3%), longer median hospital LOS (11 days vs. 3 days, p < 0.01), and higher median Injury Severity Score (29 vs. 5, p < 0.001). High-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on CXR had low sensitivity for aortic injury (76% [95% CI = 62% to 87%] and 33% [95% CI = 21% to 49%], respectively), compared to the NEXUS Chest CT DI (sensitivity 100% [95% CI = 92% to 100%]). Conclusions Aortic injury is rare in adult ED blunt trauma patients who survive to receive imaging. Most ED aortic injury patients have associated thoracic injuries and survive to hospital discharge. Widened mediastinum on CXR and high-energy mechanism have relatively low screening sensitivity for aortic injury, but the NEXUS Chest DI detected all cases.

AB  - Abstract Over the past decades, laser use in medicine has expanded from its initial application as a light-based scalpel to a plethora of clinical uses, ranging from surgical treatment through composite polymerization, dental ablation, vision correction, and skin resurfacing to diverse diagnostic modalities. Recently, the concept of light-based diagnostics and therapy has come under investigation. Low light intensities are used to excite endogenous or exogenous fluorophores, some of which have characteristic fluorescence emissions in pathological tissues. Thus, premalignancy and malignancy potentially can be detected and diagnosed. Photosensitized superficial lesions can subsequently be destroyed selectively by using higher intensities of laser light. The application of fluorescence emission-based detection and diagnosis of precancer and cancer is reviewed, based on its application to the oral cavity?the author's primary anatomical area of expertise. This approach is justified as the same principles apply throughout the human body; to any area accessible to the clinician either directly or by some sort of fiber-optic probe. J. Cell. Biochem.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated risk factors among mothers of children who underwent cancer surgery. Method This cross-sectional, multi-center study included a total of 60 mothers whose children underwent major thoraco-abdominal surgery and were under follow up in the outpatient setting between February 2016 and May 2016. Clinical Data Form, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Clinician-Administered PTSD scale were used. Results Of all participants, 13 (21.7%) were diagnosed with PTSD. These mothers had shorter duration of marriage, longer duration of hospital stay after surgery, and higher HADS scores, compared with the others without PTSD. Thoughts of guilt such as ?I am being punished or tested? were more frequent in mothers with PTSD. Insomnia, irritability, concentration problems, and psychological reactivity were the most common symptoms. Conclusion Post-traumatic stress disorder is a severe disorder that may worsen the daily functioning of mothers and may also have an unfavorable effect on child. It is therefore of utmost importance for clinicians to recognize PTSD and the associated risk factors in order to guide these parents.

AB  - Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal genodermatosis characterized by the triad of fibrofolliculomas, trichodyscomas and acrochordons. The gene for BHD was localised to chromosome 17p11.2 and a germline insertion/deletion was identified to cause premature truncation of the BHD protein, folliculin. Patients carry increased risk for developing lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal carcinoma. Prompt diagnosis is important for patient clinical management. We encountered a 41 year-old white male, otherwise healthy, with classic clinical presentation of BHD, i.e. numerous firm, smooth, whitish papules covering his face and neck, which were developed after adolescence. There is no related family history. Nine biopsies were taken during the past 5 years. The following changes are present: markedly dilated hair follicles, telangiectasia in fibrosing stroma, and melanocytic nevus cells. Diagnoses of epidermal inclusion cyst, fibrous papules, and dermal nevus were given. However, some subtle but diagnostic histopathological features for fibrofolliculoma, perifolliculafibroma, and trichodyscoma were overlooked. Correct diagnosis was reached upon review of all the biopsies. Patient is currently undergoing genetic testing and clinical workups. We present this case to update our knowledge on this rare disease, particularly the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic pitfalls, in order to avoid the delay of correct diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aims to establish current practice among Australasian emergency physicians and trainees on several aspects of the investigation of suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Methods An electronic questionnaire (SurveyMonkeyTM) was distributed to emergency physicians and trainees by email through the ACEM. Survey recipients were asked about demographics, followed by a series of questions relating to the investigation of SAH. Results There were 878 survey respondents (response rate 24%). Our data showed that 47.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that a CT brain within 6?h of headache onset is sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of SAH. For a CT performed within 12?h of ictus, 14.4% were satisfied that SAH could be excluded. After a negative CT scan, for further investigation of SAH, 88% of respondents preferred lumbar puncture to CT angiography. For detection of xanthochromia in the cerebrospinal fluid, 57.7% of respondents felt that spectrophotometry (vs visual inspection) is necessary to accurately diagnose SAH. Conclusions A range of information was collected regarding the investigation of suspected SAH. We report significant differences in the diagnostic approach of Australasian emergency physicians and trainees to this condition, in particular the utility of CT within 6?h for exclusion of SAH.

AB  - Abstract Each year, 1.4 million people in the United States are seen in a hospital for a traumatic brain injury. Those with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury frequently go through a course of inpatient neurorehabilitation prior to discharge back into the community. A broad overview of neurorehabilitation is presented, including the standards for admission to inpatient rehabilitation and the members and roles of the neurorehabilitation team. Common medical complications that are managed after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury are reviewed. The spectrum of arousal issues is summarized. The evidence regarding neurorehabilitation is then reviewed. Future studies that are underway to better understand the utility of neurorehabilitation are then discussed.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - Abstract Myriad factors have been found to have an impact on delinquent behavior and traumatic stress. This study proposes a model that tests the relationship between common predictors of delinquency (neighborhood condition, antisocial peer socialization, and exposure to violence) with traumatic stress. Serial mediation was used to test the relationships between these predictors and traumatic stress. Results indicate the mediation effect between neighborhood conditions and traumatic stress significantly reduces the total effect. Implications for traumatic stress in the context of delinquent behavior are discussed.
