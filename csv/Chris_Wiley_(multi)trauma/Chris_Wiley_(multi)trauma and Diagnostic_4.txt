AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Positive peritoneal cytology equates M1 disease in patients with gastric cancer. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is a proven test to detect occult visceral injury in trauma patients. The objective of this study is to determine whether DPL can be used to assess peritoneal cytology in patients with gastric cancer. Methods Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were prospectively enrolled to undergo DPL prior to diagnostic laparoscopy (DL). Saline was instilled through a percutaneous catheter and fluid was collected for cytology (DPL-cyt). Washings obtained during DL were used as controls (DL-cyt). Results DPL was successful in 22/27 patients (81.5%). Among the 22 successful DPLs, 12 had positive cytology (54.5%). Positive DPL-cyt specimens matched DL-cyt specimens in 12/12 cases (specificity?=?100%). One of 10 cases with negative DPL-cyt was positive on the final DL-cyt (sensitivity?=?92%). There were six patients with negative DPL-cyt who had visible M1 disease diagnosed with DL (DPL evaluation of M1 disease, sensitivity 54.5%, specificity?=?100%). Conclusions DPL is a safe method of detecting positive cytology in patients with gastric cancer, however gross M1 disease may be missed without visual inspection. The specific role of DPL in the staging workup of patients with gastric cancer remains to be determined. J. Surg. Oncol. 2013;107:794?798. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT? The study was conducted to compare an experimental multiaxial diagnostic system (MAS) with tradtitional multicategorical diagnoses in child psychiatric work. Sixteen written case histories were circulated to 21 child psychiatrists, who made diagnoses independently of one another, using two different diagnostic systems. Diagnostic reliability was measured as percentage of interrater agreement. The highest diagnostic reliability was obtained in psychotic disorders, the lowest in personality disorders. The MAS implied improved diagnostic reliability of mental retardation, somatic disorders and developmental disorders. Adjustment reaction (reactio maladaptiva) was the diagnosis most commonly used, but with varying reliability in both systems. The reliability of the socio-economic and psycho-social axes were generally high.

AB  - Research has demonstrated a strong positive association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and physical pain. However, few studies have explored the impact of pain problems on the symptoms and treatment of PTSD, and results remain inconsistent. This longitudinal study examined whether trauma-related and trauma-unrelated pain differentially and uniquely predicted reexperiencing symptoms. We also examined whether levels of reexperiencing symptoms mediated the relationship between pain intensity and posttreatment symptoms of avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal (ANH). Analyses were conducted using archival data from 99 treatment-seeking veterans who reported the etiology and intensity of their pain and severity of PTSD symptoms pre- and posttreatment. Among veterans with trauma-related pain, pain intensity (a) uniquely corresponded to greater posttreatment reexperiencing symptoms (b = 1.09), and (b) was indirectly predictive of ANH symptoms via the reexperiencing symptoms (b = 1.93). However, veterans with trauma-unrelated pain evidenced no associations between pain intensity and reexperiencing (b = 0.04) or ANH symptoms (b = 0.06). We thus found that trauma-related pain was indirectly related to poor PTSD treatment outcomes via reexperiencing symptoms. These findings offer additional insight into factors that may influence PTSD treatment outcomes for pain-suffering trauma survivors.

AB  - Abstract Controversy exists as to the utility of the MMPI in diagnosing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies of an empirically developed PTSD Subscale for the MMPI have had conflicting results. In this study 84 MMPI clinical and research scales, including the PTSD Subscale, of 234 Vietnam War veterans (+PTSD = 117, -PTSD = 117) were compared to determine the clinical usefulness of the scales for differential diagnosis of PTSD. The veterans were all inpatients applying for admission to a PTSD treatment program. The MMPI clinical profile for PTSD was corroborated, though it had little statistically significant difference than the average profile of the -PTSD group. The PTSD Subscale was slightly better than chance in classifying veterans. A number of research scales were found to be as or more accurate than the PTSD Subscale in terms of true hit rates.

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.

AB  - Objectives:? High resolution two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) difficulty in evaluation of some scrotal mass lesions is not frequent. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional ultrasound extended imaging (3D XI) in characterization of those lesions. Methods:? The study protocol had the approval of the University's review board all participants' informed consents were obtained. The study included 28 selected patients (12 testicular and 16 para-testicular mass lesions) examined by 2D US and 3D XI applications including computed multi-slice view (MSV) and multi-resolution enhanced images (XI MR). Results were correlated with histopathological findings. Results:? Two-dimensional ultrasound did not adequately characterize 28 patients out of 329 (8.5%). 3D XI interrogation was an easy procedure and distinctive of the pathological findings in 27 patients out of 28 (96.4%). The performance of XI MR with respect to characterization provided additional diagnostic information over MSV. Conclusions:? The performance of 3D XI with respect to testicular mass characterization proved better than static 2D US. Subsequently, the results of this study suggest that the routine use of 2D US in diagnosis of scrotal mass lesions should preferably be upgraded to 3D XI methods.

AB  - Summary Complications during pregnancy are not frequent, but may occur abruptly. Point-of-care ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-ionising diagnostic tool that is available at the bed-side when complications occur. This review covers the use of ultrasound in various clinical situations. Gastric ultrasound can identify stomach contents that put the woman at risk for pulmonary aspiration. In the future, this tool will probably be used routinely before induction of anaesthesia to determine the presence of stomach contents above a particular risk threshold. Difficult tracheal intubation, and the potential for ?can't intubate, can't oxygenate?, is more frequent in pregnant women. Point-of-care ultrasound of the airway allows accurate identification of the cricothyroid membrane, permitting rapid and safer establishment of front-of-neck airway access. Combined cardiac and lung ultrasound can determine the potential risk:benefit of fluid administration in the pregnant patient. Such prediction is of critical importance, given the tendency of pregnant women to develop pulmonary oedema. Combined echocardiography and lung ultrasound can be combined with ultrasound of the leg veins to differentiate between the various causes of acute respiratory failure, and guide treatment in this situation. Finally, as shown in the general population, multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound allows early diagnosis of the main causes of circulatory failure and cardiac arrest at the bed-side. As the importance of point-of-care ultrasound in critical patients is increasingly recognised, it is emerging as an important tool in the therapeutic armoury of obstetric anaesthetists.

AB  - Abstract??? To evaluate the frequency and causes of dental and maxillofacial trauma in hospitalized patients. From January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2003, data from hospitalized trauma patients in a level 1 trauma center in Israel were analyzed according to age, gender, time, place, and cause of injury. Maxillofacial and tooth injuries were separated and further analyzed according to the above parameters. The analysis was based on data from the Israel Trauma Registry (ITR). Of all 14?040 trauma patients, 1038 (7.4%) involved maxillofacial or dental injuries. Common causes of injury were motor vehicle crashes (41%), falls (27%) and intentional injuries (23%). Fifty percent occurred on the street/road, 17% at home and 14% in public buildings. Surgery was required in 55.5% of all maxillofacial injuries. Males were hospitalized three times more than females, and young people, ages 19?28, were at greatest risk (30.2%). Oral and maxillofacial trauma is common, requiring dental health training for primary caregivers.

AB  - Summary This chapter introduces the current classification of sleep disorders: the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders is a concise reference book with information on the presently known disorders of sleep. The chapter discusses some of the questionnaires used both in clinical practice and in scientific studies. The diagnosis of certain sleep disorders, especially if there is combined or complex pathology, often requires specific attention and investigation in a specialised sleep centre. The data gathered by questionnaires, the clinical interview and additional technical procedures should be integrated into a logical framework that provides a working hypothesis, differential diagnosis, and eventually a final, confirmed diagnosis. Close collaboration between the sleep specialist and the neurologist may not only yield a complete and proper diagnosis but also enhances the quality of management.

AB  - In order to standardize and quantify diagnostic information derived from medical histories and case reports given by demented patients, their families or care-providers, a questionnaire has been developed containing 94 questions. The output is categorized by computer into graphic clinical scales which correlate and weigh information relating to seven of the most common causes of dementia. The present investigation assesses the validity of predictive diagnostic classifications derived from the clinical scales tested on admission by correlating them later with final diagnoses determined independently by thorough clinical evaluation including standard diagnostic tests, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance scans. Results of 101 healthy, neurologically normal, age-matched volunteers and 140 patients representative of the more common forms of dementia indicate that correct diagnostic identification was: 75% for dementia secondary to Parkinson's disease, 100% for Huntington's disease, 90.2% for Alzheimer's disease, 82.4% for multi-infarct dementia, 90.0% for posttraumatic dementia, 77.8% for normal-pressure hydrocephalus and 85.7% for Wernicke-Korsakoff dementia. Correct diagnostic assignment was highly significant (P < .0005). The screening questionnaire may prove to be a useful and standard diagnostic tool for clinicians and investigators concerned with epidemiology, prevention and treatment of dementia.

AB  - Aims The multi-center SPEED registry evaluated the procedural success and in-hospital clinical outcomes of direct stenting with the Svelte ?all-in-one? coronary stent Integrated Delivery System (IDS) through diagnostic catheters to identify the clinical indications for which this approach is appropriately suited. Methods & results Forty-eight (48) patients with 54 lesions of lengths ≤20 mm and RVD 2.5?3.5 mm were targeted for direct stenting through diagnostic catheters (4?6F) via radial or femoral approach. Procedural characteristics early in an investigator's experience (28 lesions) were compared with outcomes following experience (26 lesions). Procedure, device and strategy success were realized in 54 (100%), 50 (93%) and 46 (85%) lesions, respectively, with strategy success significantly related to RVD (P?=?0.05), lesion location (P?=?0.01), and diagnostic catheter size (P?=?0.05). Significant improvement in crossing and intervention time and trends toward improvement in device and strategy success, reductions in procedure and radiation time and contrast use were observed. Conclusions Direct stenting through diagnostic catheters via radial or femoral approach using the Svelte IDS is feasible and associated with good in-hospital outcomes. This approach offers the attractive option of assessing lesions via diagnostic catheter and, depending upon vessel anatomy and lesion morphology, continuing with ad-hoc interventional treatment using the same diagnostic catheter. Improvements in strategy success and procedural efficiencies, based on operator experience, facilitate catheter downsizing and reduce intervention time, ancillary product use and overall procedure costs. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - There exists a general consensus that prolonged grief disorder (PGD), or some variant of PGD, represents a distinct mental disorder worthy of diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, confusion remains over whether different names and proposed symptom criteria for this disorder identify the same or different diagnostic entities. This study aimed to determine whether PGD, complicated grief (CG), and persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) as described by the DSM-5 are substantively or merely semantically different diagnostic entities. Data were derived from the Yale Bereavement Study, a longitudinal community-based study of bereaved individuals funded by the US National Institute of Mental Health, designed explicitly to evaluate diagnostic criteria for disordered grief. The results suggested that the difference between PGD and PCBD is only semantic. The level of agreement between the original PGD test, a new version of the PGD test proposed for ICD-11 and the PCBD test was high (pairwise kappa coefficients?=?0.80-0.84). Their estimates of rate of disorder in this community sample were similarly low (?10%). Their levels of diagnostic specificity were comparably high (95.0-98.3%). Their predictive validity was comparable. In contrast, the test for CG had only moderate agreement with those for PGD and PCBD; its estimate of rate of disorder was three-fold higher (?30%); its diagnostic specificity was poorer, and it had no predictive validity. We conclude that PGD, PCBD and proposed ICD-11, but not CG, symptom-diagnostic tests identify a single diagnostic entity. Ultimately, brief symptom-diagnostic tests, such as the one proposed here for ICD-11, may have the greatest clinical utility.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the pathology, epidemiology, prevention, identification and management of the most significant complications affecting the orthopaedic and trauma patient. These complications can be life threatening and lead to delays in recovery. They are often preventable and when they are not, early detection is vital so that interventions can be activated which minimise the consequences. The practitioner needs to understand how to prevent, recognise and manage complications ? both those which are general and relatively common and those which are relatively rare and related specifically to orthopaedic and trauma conditions and care. Some of the considerable evidence base which identifies best practice in risk management, detection and care are considered here so that the practitioner is provided with some guidance for practice in the most common complications: infection (including urinary and respiratory tract infections), compartment syndrome, fat embolism, venous thromboembolism, urinary retention, shock and constipation.

AB  - Abstract The Chinese version of the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS-C) was developed to respond to the need of Chinese-speaking individuals. The DTS is a validated self-rating scale used in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The DTS-C is translated from DTS through a two-stage translation. Subjects were drawn from a sample of 210 survivors of the 21 September 1999, Chi-Chi Earthquake. The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.97) and test?retest reliability (r = 0.88). Concurrent validity was obtained against the clinical diagnostic interview, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 at DTS-C score of 44. It showed that the sensitivity was 0.9, specificity 0.81, positive likelihood ratio 4.74, and negative likelihood ratio 0.12. The recommended stratum-specific likelihood ratios were 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05?0.20) for the score range 0?39, 4 (2.22?7.23) for the score range of 40?59, and 6.14 (3.42?11.02) for the scores above 60. In PTSD diagnosed subjects, the factor structures closely resembled the DSM-IV grouping of PTSD symptoms. The psychometric strength of DTS-C is reliable for its future use, particularly for screening for subjects with possible diagnosis of PTSD.

AB  - Summary Multidetector-row computed tomographic contrast angiography (MDCTA) is routinely employed to investigate vascular masses in human patients but, to date, the use of this technique to investigate an aneurysmal mass has not been reported in an equine case. The potential of MDCTA to investigate a right-sided parapharyngeal mass in a 6-week-old Thoroughbred foal was therefore investigated. A 4-slice helical computed tomography scanner was used on a superficial, firm, ovoid mass yielding arterial blood on fine needle aspiration. MDCTA enabled identification of the vessels involved thus assisting in forming a diagnosis based on the morphology of the lesion and aided surgical planning. Histology confirmed the presence of mural thrombus and calcification within the smooth muscle wall consistent with a true aneurysm. MDCTA provided additional information to conventional imaging in this case of vascular masses of the head and neck. The technique therefore has the potential to improve diagnosis and assist in the management of such lesions.
