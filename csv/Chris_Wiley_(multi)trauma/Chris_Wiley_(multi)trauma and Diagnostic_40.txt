AB  - Abstract Myriad factors have been found to have an impact on delinquent behavior and traumatic stress. This study proposes a model that tests the relationship between common predictors of delinquency (neighborhood condition, antisocial peer socialization, and exposure to violence) with traumatic stress. Serial mediation was used to test the relationships between these predictors and traumatic stress. Results indicate the mediation effect between neighborhood conditions and traumatic stress significantly reduces the total effect. Implications for traumatic stress in the context of delinquent behavior are discussed.

AB  - Objective To combine and analyse the results from centres with a large experience of laparoscopy for the impalpable testis with small series, to determine the expected success rate for laparoscopic orchidopexy. Methods A questionnaire was distributed to participating paediatric urologists; each contributor retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts for their cases of therapeutic laparoscopy for an impalpable testis, detailing 36 variables for each patient. The data were collated centrally into a computerized database. For inclusion, the testis was intra-abdominal (including ?peeping? at the internal ring) at laparoscopic examination, was not managed through an open approach and did not undergo orchidectomy. Three surgical groups were assessed, with success defined as lack of atrophy and intrascrotal position: group 1, primary laparoscopic orchidopexy; group 2, a one-stage Fowler-Stephens (F-S) orchidopexy; and group 3, a two-stage F-S orchidopexy. Results Data were gathered from 10 centres in the USA, covering the period 1990?1999; 252 patients representing 310 testes were included and overall, 15.2% were lost to follow-up. There was no significant difference between success rates in the larger and smaller series. Atrophy occurred in 2.2% of 178 testes, 22.2% of 27 testes and 10.3% of 58 testes in groups 1?3, respectively. Testes were not in a satisfactory scrotal position in 0.6%, 7.4% and 1.7% of groups 1?3, respectively. The mean follow-up for each group was 7.7, 8.6 and 20.0?months, respectively. The overall success for all groups was 92.8% (97.2% group 1; 74.1% group 2; 87.9% group 3), with an atrophy rate of 6.1%. Conclusion Laparoscopic orchidopexy for the intra-abdominal testis, in both large and small series, can be expected to have a success rate higher than that historically ascribed to open orchidopexy. Within this series, single-stage F-S laparoscopic orchidopexy resulted in a significantly higher atrophy rate than the two-stage repair. However, when considering both F-S approaches, the laparoscopic approach gave greater success than previously reported for the same open approaches. Despite the weaknesses inherent in a retrospective unrandomized study, we conclude that laparoscopic orchidopexy is, if not the procedure of choice, an acceptable and successful approach to the impalpable undescended testicle.

To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Abstract Self-injurious behavior(SIB) in individuals with mental retardation is a severe behavioral disorder that has significant social and medical consequences. Although considerable research evidence indicates that SIB can be maintained by either environmental contingencies or biologic conditions, integrative diagnostic and treatment models have yet to be developed. We have piloted a bio-behavioral diagnostic and treatment model to classify and subtype cases of SIB, leading to the selection of specific behavioral or pharmacologic treatments. A functional analysis defines SIB as operant, possibly biologic, or mixed operant and possibly biologic. Subtyping within these classes is based on the delineation of specific operant functions and the clinical characteristics of the individual patient. Our preliminary research suggests that this empirical decision-making model can lead to specific treatments that are effective and that reduce the incidence of nonresponders to behavioral intervention and medication. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed to determine the frequency of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on neuroimaging and the need for emergency neurosurgery in children with normal mental status following a post-traumatic seizure (PTS). Methods We searched six electronic databases from inception to October 15, 2018, to identify studies including children under 18 years with head injury and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 after an immediate PTS. Relevant non-English articles were translated to determine eligibility. Results We performed random effect meta-analyses and assessed heterogeneity with I2. The pooled estimate of the frequency of TBI, from seven studies, was 13.0% (95% CI: 4.0?26.1; I2 = 81%). Data on the need of emergency neurosurgery were reported in four studies and the pooled estimate of its frequency was 2.3% (95% CI: 0.0?9.9; I2 = 86%). Two studies reported on children with isolated PTS without any other signs of head injury, representing 0.1% of patients in both studies, for a total of 76 children. Of these, only three had TBI and one underwent neurosurgery. Conclusion Children with immediate PTS and normal mental status frequently have TBI with a substantial need for neurosurgery. Clinicians should strongly consider neuroimaging for these children, although prolonged observation may be considered for those with isolated PTS.

AB  - Abstract Objective Since the initial description of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in the early 1900s, classification of this disease has been in flux. The goal of this manuscript is to review the existing literature and to revisit definitions and diagnostic criteria for AgP. Study analysis An extensive literature search was performed that included databases from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Of 4930 articles reviewed, 4737 were eliminated. Criteria for elimination included; age > 30 years old, abstracts, review articles, absence of controls, fewer than; a) 200 subjects for genetic studies, and b) 20 subjects for other studies. Studies satisfying the entrance criteria were included in tables developed for AgP (localized and generalized), in areas related to epidemiology, microbial, host and genetic analyses. The highest rank was given to studies that were; a) case controlled or cohort, b) assessed at more than one time-point, c) assessed for more than one factor (microbial or host), and at multiple sites. Results Epidemiologic studies provided insight into ethnic and societal factors affecting AgP. DNA analysis of microbes showed some consistency but significant variability. Host factor analysis was less consistent. Many genetic studies were conducted but few had either sufficient power or looked at multiple genes in AgP. Conclusions Conflicting data resulted for several reasons; 1) the classification was too broad, 2) the disease (AgP) was not studied from its inception, at differing time points (temporal), and at different locations (topographic). New technologic advances coupled with a more delimiting definition of disease will allow for genetic, host and microbial factor analyses in an unbiased manner. As such we predict that progress can be made in identifying a robust group of genetic, host, and microbial risk-markers associated with periodontal disease that can improve diagnostic capability in disease associated with juveniles, adolescents, and post-adolescent individuals.

AB  - The ultimate promise of diffusion MRI (dMRI) models is specificity to neuronal microstructure, which may lead to distinct clinical biomarkers using noninvasive imaging. While multi-compartment models are a common approach to interpret water diffusion in the brain in vivo, the estimation of their parameters from the dMRI signal remains an unresolved problem. Practically, even when q space is highly oversampled, nonlinear fit outputs suffer from heavy bias and poor precision. So far, this has been alleviated by fixing some of the model parameters to a priori values, for improved precision at the expense of accuracy. Here we use a representative two-compartment model to show that fitting fails to determine the five model parameters from over 60 measurement points. For the first time, we identify the reasons for this poor performance. The first reason is the existence of two local minima in the parameter space for the objective function of the fitting procedure. These minima correspond to qualitatively different sets of parameters, yet they both lie within biophysically plausible ranges. We show that, at realistic signal-to-noise ratio values, choosing between the two minima based on the associated objective function values is essentially impossible. Second, there is an ensemble of very low objective function values around each of these minima in the form of a pipe. The existence of such a direction in parameter space, along which the objective function profile is very flat, explains the bias and large uncertainty in parameter estimation, and the spurious parameter correlations: in the presence of noise, the minimum can be randomly displaced by a very large amount along each pipe. Our results suggest that the biophysical interpretation of dMRI model parameters crucially depends on establishing which of the minima is closer to the biophysical reality and the size of the uncertainty associated with each parameter.

AB  - SUMMARY Due to its particularly lethal nature and tendency to affect relatively young individuals, the timely diagnosis of melanoma remains of paramount importance for clinicians and their patients. Unfortunately, melanomas can mimic benign lesions that are overwhelmingly more common in the population than are melanomas, and misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis of melanoma can occur. Misdiagnosis of melanoma serves as one of the most common causes for malpractice litigation brought against medical practitioners. In this review we describe seven clinical scenarios that represent challenges in melanoma diagnosis and discuss potential strategies for avoiding the errors that commonly give rise to those scenarios.

AB  - Abstract Isolated swellings within the head and neck region are common phenomena, with the majority being readily diagnosed and appropriately managed. While history alone will often assist in arriving at a correct diagnosis, discrepancies and inconsistencies in the clinical picture should act as a prompt for the clinician to consider the prospect of having encountered less common pathology. We report a case of an unusual supra-orbital swelling where the history, clinical findings and initial investigations masked a rare diagnosis. The differential diagnoses for this case principally included haematoma, infection and cutaneous cyst. However, following a period of review with no improvement in either symptoms or objective clinical measures, incisional biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma. Management thereafter involved referral for lymphoma specialist assessment, with subsequent investigation to establish the level of locoregional and/or systemic involvement and the initiation of appropriate radiotherapy.

AB  - Objectives To identify the incidence, risk factors and presenting signs of lymphoma in dogs presenting to primary-care practice in the UK using analysis of data within the VetCompass? programme. Materials and Methods Case records from the VetCompass? programme from primary-care practices in the UK were searched for newly diagnosed lymphoma in dogs within a 1-year period: 2013. Diagnosis was based on clinical records with or without laboratory confirmation. Signalment was evaluated as risk factors for lymphoma diagnosis using multivariable logistic regression. Results There were 286 presumed newly diagnosed cases identified during 2013 from 455,553 dogs (overall incidence risk 63 of 100,000 dogs per year) of which 193 (67%) were laboratory confirmed (42 of 100,000 dogs per year). Advanced age, dogs older than 12?years, dogs weighing more than 30?kg and some specific breeds were significantly associated with lymphoma diagnosis. Only 18 dogs (6%) of the population identified were referred to a specialist clinic. Clinical Significance This study concurs with others that age, bodyweight and breed are significant risk factors for lymphoma. Results of this study highlight: (1) the low number of dogs with lymphoma that are referred to specialists in the UK and (2) that few dogs undergo immunophenotyping (which can carry prognostic importance), emphasising the importance of epidemiological programmes that evaluate diseases presented to primary-care veterinarians.

AB  - Summary After relative neglect in the age of melancholy during the 1970s and 1980s, there has been a renaissance of bipolar disorder during the last decade of the 20thcentury. The new bipolar era has also witnessed the development of innovative pharmacological and psychosocial interventions specifically geared for this disorder. The signs and symptoms of the classical cyclical illness are unmistakable. However, the illness may begin insidiously with manifestations of a subthreshold or disturbances of a temperamental nature buried in early childhood or adolescence. As the primary aim of this chapter is to review the current body of research evidence and clinical experience in the diagnosis and classification of bipolar disorder, there will be no attempt to exhaustively review comorbidity. The latter will be limited to the most disputed clinical boundaries of bipolar disorder.

AB  - Families of gender nonconforming children need to negotiate the interactions between two gender systems: a rigid gender binary imported from familial, social, and cultural experiences and a fluid gender spectrum articulated by their child. This article reviews parental reactions to nonconforming gender developments and poses that the parental mandates of protection and acceptance are problematized by the difference of gender norms between the child and the family, as well as the child and the environment. Through multiple therapeutic modalities?parental coaching and education, parent support group, and child and family therapy?the author illustrates interventions supporting both parents and prepubescent children in their negotiation of safety, connection, and fluidity. Case vignettes illustrate the method in action.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the incidence and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) in children. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients younger than 18 years of age treated for DFSP over a period of 11 years (2000?2011) in Madrid, Spain. The sample consisted of 13 children. The average annual incidence of DFSP in the pediatric population corresponded to 1.02 cases per million person-years (95% confidence interval 0.55, 1.73). Sites of involvement were diverse, with 15.3% of tumors found in acral locations. The median tumor size was 3.5 cm ? 3 cm and the median time from apparent onset to diagnosis was 36 months. Histopathologic examination revealed conventional (77.0%), pigmented (15.4%), and myxoid (7.6%) variants. The mitotic index was consistently <5 per 10 high-power fields. All lesions were removed using surgical excision. One patient developed a local recurrence because of initial affected margins; none developed metastases. The median duration of clinical follow-up was 70.5 months. This study estimated the average annual incidence rate of DFSP in a population of patients younger than 18 years and reviewed the experience of several hospitals in the management of this tumor.

AB  - Summary This chapter begins with an introduction of the anatomy of the ankle and foot. Appropriateness criteria for imaging foot and ankle trauma are then discussed. The ankle and foot are anatomically distinct from each other and therefore radiographic evaluation of each is different from the other. Standard ankle radiographs include anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and mortise view, and foot radiographs include AP, lateral, and oblique views. Computed Tomography (CT) is used for pre-operative planning in patients with complex distal tibial and malleolar fractures, tarsal fractures and Lisfranc fracture-dislocations. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is indicated in assessment of radiographically occult stress and insufficiency fractures. In the setting of foot and ankle trauma, ultrasound is often performed to evaluate the Achilles tendon for the presence and severity of a tear. The key to interpreting ankle and foot radiographs is familiarity with normal anatomy and injury patterns that may involve the ankle and foot.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is a rapidly growing area, providing physicians with a valuable diagnostic tool for patient assessment. This paper describes a collaborative model, utilising radiology department ultrasound expertise, to train and credential physicians in PoCUS. A 6-year experience of the implementation and outcomes of the programme established within the emergency departments of a large, multi-campus hospital network are presented. Methods A collaborative model was initially developed and implemented between radiology and emergency departments. Key elements of the programme included hospital executive support, close collaboration with stakeholders, resource allocation, appointment of a sonographer educator, clear scope of practise and robust quality processes. Results Participation grew from 36 emergency physicians in 2011 to 96 physicians in 2016. A total 11064 scans were logged with the programme in the 6-year period. Routine quality audit of 61.8% (6836/11064) of all scans included 2836 Focussed Assessment by Sonography in Trauma (FAST) and 1422 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) examinations. False-positive or false-negative diagnoses occurred in 3.6% (102/2836) FAST and 1.3% (19/1422) AAA cases. No adverse clinical outcomes were reported to involve programme-compliant scans. Conclusion A collaborative model to train and credential physicians in PoCUS has been successfully implemented. The programme grew significantly, produced excellent quality outcomes and resolved many issues of potential conflict related to PoCUS.
