AB  - Abstract Introduction Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is a rapidly growing area, providing physicians with a valuable diagnostic tool for patient assessment. This paper describes a collaborative model, utilising radiology department ultrasound expertise, to train and credential physicians in PoCUS. A 6-year experience of the implementation and outcomes of the programme established within the emergency departments of a large, multi-campus hospital network are presented. Methods A collaborative model was initially developed and implemented between radiology and emergency departments. Key elements of the programme included hospital executive support, close collaboration with stakeholders, resource allocation, appointment of a sonographer educator, clear scope of practise and robust quality processes. Results Participation grew from 36 emergency physicians in 2011 to 96 physicians in 2016. A total 11064 scans were logged with the programme in the 6-year period. Routine quality audit of 61.8% (6836/11064) of all scans included 2836 Focussed Assessment by Sonography in Trauma (FAST) and 1422 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) examinations. False-positive or false-negative diagnoses occurred in 3.6% (102/2836) FAST and 1.3% (19/1422) AAA cases. No adverse clinical outcomes were reported to involve programme-compliant scans. Conclusion A collaborative model to train and credential physicians in PoCUS has been successfully implemented. The programme grew significantly, produced excellent quality outcomes and resolved many issues of potential conflict related to PoCUS.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience. Methods Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24 months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) subscores respectively. Results In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P?<?0.001, cluster size?>?20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group and three CAPS subscores. Discussion These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.

AB  - Records were reviewed of 477 patients who had diaphragm pacemakers implanted for treatment of chronic hypoventilation. Three groups were established for comparison. (1) Center group: 165 patients operated on in six medical centers participating in a cooperative study; (2) Noncenter group, sufficient data available: 203 patients operated on by surgeons with experience limited to a few cases; (3) Nonstudy group, minimal data available: 109 patients operated on as in group 2; vital statistics only were contributed. The protocol for data gathering was comprised of 154 major variables. Basic data on age, sex, diagnosis and etiology were analyzed for homogenicity of data among the groups. A comprehensive analysis of the pacing methods, complication and results fom the Center group yielded information on the early experience with diaphragm pacing important to its future application.

AB  - Background: Severe periodontal furcation invasion has long been a treatment dilemma for the clinician. Many techniques have been advocated in the treatment of multi-rooted posterior teeth ranging from conventional scaling and root planing (SRP), apically positioned flaps, root amputations, root resections, tunnel procedures, guided tissue regeneration, and restorations. The keys to success depend on the clinician's ability to access the furcation to remove local factors and create an environment that enhances the patient's own hygiene efforts. Long-term success in treating teeth with furcation invasion depends upon tooth retention and arresting the destructive processes within the furcation area. Methods: A Class III furcation invasion in a mandibular molar was treated by surgical access for SRP along with obliterating the furcation utilizing a resin ionomer restoration. Results: Initially, the patient was asymptomatic. Within 3 months of treatment, the patient presented with suppuration that was refractory to local efforts. Radiographs taken only 5 months postsurgery demonstrated advanced bone loss apical to the restoration. The tooth ultimately was extracted because mobility increased and the tooth became symptomatic. Conclusions: The clinician must consider the multi-factorial etiology of periodontal breakdown within a furcation. For this patient, the technique of sealing off the exposed furcation with restorative material appeared to have resulted in progressive bone loss and accelerate tooth loss. This single case report is presented as a rebuttal to recently published articles, which have demonstrated excellent results when treating furcations with ionomer restorations.

AB  - Abstract Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should include derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? To determine the institution's current non-therapeutic (negative) appendicectomy rate; the frequency of clinical predictors for appendicitis in patients who underwent appendicectomy; and the utilization and accuracy of ultrasound scans (USS) and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of appendicitis. Methods:? A retrospective chart review was conducted in an adult, metropolitan teaching hospital. Patients who presented to the ED and underwent an appendicectomy over a 12-month period were analysed. Symptoms and signs predictive of appendicitis, results of USS and CT scans if performed, and histopathology findings were abstracted from patient records. Results:? Two hundred and forty patients had appendicectomies, 147 (61%) were male and the median age was 25 years (range 14?78 years). The negative appendicectomy rate was 14.3% (95% CI 9.1?21.0%) and 18.3% (95% CI 11.0?26.7%) in males and females, respectively. Abdominal pain shifting to the right iliac fossa (RIF), anorexia and RIF rebound tenderness were found more frequently in patients with positive than negative appendicectomies (P < 0.05). USS and CT scans were performed in 68 (28%) and 15 (9.5%) patients, respectively. The likelihood ratio for appendicitis in patients with a normal USS or a normal CT scan was 0.83 (95% CI 0.56?1.24) and 0.08 (95% CI 0.01?0.60), respectively. There were no false positive CT scan results. Conclusion:? Computed tomoraphy scanning should play an increasing role in the ED management of suspected appendicitis. Our negative appendicectomy rate could potentially be halved by the introduction of CT scans in the diagnostic work up of these patients.

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31, 456?468. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00831.x Abstract Vergence eye movements are used to track objects that move in depth in one?s binocular visual field to attain and maintain a fused and single percept. The mechanism and control of vergence eye movements involves complex neurological processes that may be compromised in individuals with traumatic brain injury, thus frequently resulting in a wide range of vergence dysfunctions and related near-work symptoms, such as oculomotor-based reading problems. This paper presents a review of the vergence system and its anomalies in mild traumatic brain injury, as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic clinical ramifications. Implications related to brain imaging and human neuroplasticity are also considered.

AB  - Abstract Background The management of hepatic hemangiomas remains ill defined. This study sought to investigate the indications, surgical management and outcomes of patients who underwent a resection for hepatic hemangiomas. Methods A retrospective review from six major liver centres in the United States identifying patients who underwent surgery for hepatic hemangiomas was performed. Clinico-pathological, treatment and peri-operative data were evaluated. Results Of the 241patients who underwent a resection, the median age was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR): 39?53] and 85.5% were female. The median hemangioma size was 8.5?cm (IQR: 6?12.1). Surgery was performed for abdominal symptoms (85%), increasing hemangioma size (11.3%) and patient anxiety (3.7%). Life-threatening complications necessitating a hemangioma resection occurred in three patients (1.2%). Clavien Grade 3 or higher complications occurred in 14 patients (5.7%). The 30- and 90-day mortality was 0.8% (n = 2). Of patients with abdominal symptoms, 63.2% reported improvement of symptoms post-operatively. Conclusion A hemangioma resection can be safely performed at high-volume institutions. The primary indication for surgery remains for intractable symptoms. The development of severe complications associated with non-operative management remains a rare event, ultimately challenging the necessity of additional surgical indications for a hemangioma resection.

AB  - Abstract Background Metamemory is the process of monitoring and controlling one's memory. Improving metamemory may reduce the memory problem in old age. We hypothesized that metamemory training (MMT) would improve cognition in older adults with subjective memory complaints and change the brain region related to metacognition. Method We recruited and randomized older adults to the multi-strategic memory training of 10 weekly 90-min sessions, based on the metamemory concept or usual care. Cognitive tests including the Elderly Verbal Learning Test, Simple Rey Figure Test, Digit Span, Spatial Span, Categorical Fluency, and the Boston Naming Test were done in 201 participants, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 49 participants before and after training. Results A total of 112 in the training group and 89 in the control group participated. The training group had a significant increase in long-term delayed free recall, categorical fluency, and the Boston Naming test. In MRI, the mean diffusivity of the bundles of axon tracts passing from the frontal lobe to the posterior end of the lateral sulcus decreased in the training group. Conclusion These results indicate that the MMT program has a positive impact on enhancing older people? cognitive performance. Improved white matter integrity in the anterior and posterior cerebrum and increased cortical thickness of prefrontal regions, which related to metacognition, possibly suggest that the effects of the MMT would be induced via the enhancement of cognitive control.

AB  - SUMMARY Two patients who presented with skin fragility and a bullous eruption were found to have amyloid deposits along the epidermal basement membrane. In both cases a basement membrane similar to that observed in pemphigoid was seen on direct immunofluorescence resulting from the non-specific absorption of immunoglobulins by the amyloid deposits. Evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia was found in both patients, one of whom developed nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Abstract A study was conducted among 209 displaced women attending a Women's Center in a war zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1994. Information on war-related traumatic events, sociodemographic factors and posttraumatic symptomatology was collected by means of a questionnaire. Post-traumatic symptoms were registered by using a 10-item Posttraumatic Symptom Scale (PTSS-10). Women with six or more symptoms were classified as a ?posttraumatic symptom case? (PTS-case). Among women who had survived the most severe traumas (concentration camps or other kinds of detention) the proportion of PTS-cases was highest: 71% compared to 47% of the women without this kind of traumatic background. High numbers of traumas, having children, being over 25 years of age, and the reporting of an absent husband, were characteristics associated with being a PTS-case. In the multivariate analysis, severe trauma and reporting of an absent husband remained significantly associated with PTS-cases. Clinical implications were discussed.

AB  - Abstract To be able to diagnose systemic candidiasis (SC) and to predict outcomes in SC patients are still challenging tasks for physicians. Previous proteomic studies suggest that anti-Candida methionine synthase (Met6p) IgG antibodies may be a candidate marker for SC. To evaluate their reliability for diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification in SC, we developed a generic prototype strategy for their measurement in SC. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses revealed a high diagnostic accuracy for this prototype format, which was slightly better to that for the widely used Western blot assays. Multivariate logistic-regression models showed a positive association between serum anti-Met6p IgG antibody levels and SC risk that was independent from established SC risk factors and other baseline variables. After adjusting for and stratifying according to known prognostic factors, a significant trend toward a lower two-month mortality risk with increasing levels was evidenced in SC patients at presentation. We conclude that these antibodies may be useful in discriminating SC from non-SC patients and determining risk stratification in SC. These may also confer protection against SC and be valuable for the design of future immunotherapies. Furthermore, our prototype format has the potential to make impact on other infectious diseases, cancers, allergies or autoimmune disorders.

An evaluation of dental and maxillofacial trauma in a level 1 trauma center in Israel was carried out to assess the causes of trauma and the relationship between the injuries to the patient?s age, gender and ethnicity. Analysis was based on data from the Israel Trauma Registry. Patients hospitalized in a level 1 trauma center from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2005 were analyzed according to age, gender, time, place, ethnicity and cause of injury. Files of 22?558 trauma patients were reviewed. Maxillofacial and tooth injuries were separated and further analyzed according to the above parameters. Maxillofacial or dental injuries were observed in 1668 (7.4%) of the trauma patients, caused by motor vehicle accidents (39.2%), falls (30.9%), and intentional injuries (21.2%). Most occurred on the street/road (46.5%), at home (18.8%), and in public buildings (12.4%). Arab patients suffered more from vehicle accidents while Jewish patients presented more intentional injuries. Men were hospitalized three times more than women, and young people were at greater risk. The most frequent age of trauma was 19?28?years (27.6%). Ethnic differences were particularly noticeable for intentional injuries and vehicle accidents. This emphasizes that a larger percentage of the Arab population suffered from dental and maxillofacial injuries. Further dental health education and training for primary caregivers are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been identified as a meaningful indicator of distress in cancer survivors. Distinct from young adult survivors of childhood cancer, young people diagnosed with cancer as adolescents and young adults (AYAs) face unique psychosocial issues; however, there is little published research of PTSS in the AYA population. This study examines prevalence and predictors of PTSS among AYAs with cancer. Methods As part of a longitudinal study of AYAs with cancer, 151 patients aged 15?39?years completed mailed surveys at 6 and 12?months post-diagnosis. Severity of PTSS was estimated at 6 and 12?months post-diagnosis. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the predictive effects of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on changes in PTSS over time. Results At 6 and 12?months, respectively, 39% and 44% of participants reported moderate to severe levels of PTSS; 29% had PTSS levels suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder. No significant differences in severity of PTSS between 6 and 12?months were observed. Regression analyses suggested that a greater number of side effects were associated with higher levels of PTSS at 6?months. Currently receiving treatment, having surgical treatment, diagnosis of a cancer type with a 90?100% survival rate, remaining unemployed/not in school, and greater PTSS at 6?months were associated with higher levels of PTSS at 12?months. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress symptoms were observed as early as 6?months following diagnosis and remained stable at 12-month follow-up. The development of early interventions for reducing distress among AYA patients in treatment is recommended. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract??? The aim of this study was to investigate the current method for recording trauma in UK dental hospitals. A standard questionnaire was sent out to all 19 UK and Irish dental hospitals to investigate how trauma was recorded both at initial presentation and at review appointments. Where a standard form was used, a copy was requested. Each form was analysed to assess what information was being recorded and whether prompts were used. For the initial presentation of trauma, nine institutions had a standard trauma form, one used a standard form for avulsions only, seven had no form and two did not respond. For subsequent follow-up visits of trauma cases, six hospitals had a standard form, one used a standard from for avulsions only, 10 had no form and two did not respond. There was considerable variation in the questions that were asked at initial presentation of trauma cases and follow-up reviews in dento-alveolar trauma. Without consistent recording, there is little chance that multi-centred prospective clinical trials can take place in the field of dental trauma.

AB  - Despite considerable research on secondary traumatization, the ramifications of veterans? and their wives? posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) for the family system remain largely uninvestigated. Beginning to fill this gap, the current study aims to investigate the reciprocal relations between both spouses? PTSS and marital adjustment, and the implications these bear for their parental functioning. Two hundred and twenty-five Israeli veterans (mean age = 58.62, SD = 7.6) from the 1973 Yom Kippur War and their wives (mean age = 58.28, SD = 5.79) were examined at two points in time: 30 (T1) and 35?37 years after the war (T2). Analysis included longitudinal actor?partner interdependence modeling and sequential mediation analyses. The results show that higher PTSS among the wives at T1 predicted higher PTSS among husbands at T2, and vice versa, and predicted their husbands? marital adjustment at T2. Moreover, wives? PTSS at T1 had a significant effect on parental overinvolvement of both parents at T2, but neither their PTSS nor their husbands? PTSS had an impact on positive parenting. In the intrapersonal domain, better marital adjustment at T1 predicted positive parenting among both spouses in subsequent measurement. Interpersonally, wives? lower marital adjustment at T1 predicted husbands? higher parental functioning, but not vice versa. Furthermore, marital adjustment mediated the association between PTSS and positive parenting for both spouses. The results emphasize the detrimental ramifications of war trauma on the interpersonal domains in veterans? families. Hence, both marital and parental consequences of trauma should be considered in clinical family interventions.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3 years (range: 54?75 years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma n = 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) n = 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma n = 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5 years (range: 51?69 years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the demographic information of dogs referred for investigation of fever, to determine the usefulness of various diagnostic investigations and to assess the effect of treatment before referral on the presence of fever at referral, the duration of the investigation and the ability to reach a final diagnosis. Methods: The clinical records of 66 dogs, in which fever was part of the clinical signs documented by the referring veterinary surgeon, were reviewed. The effects of treatment 24 hours before referral on temperature at initial consultation and on time to diagnosis were evaluated. The effect of body temperature at initial consultation on cost and on time to diagnosis was also determined. The effect of insurance on costs incurred was assessed. The utility of different diagnostic investigations was recorded, and cases were classified according to the final diagnosis. Results: Only 34·8 per cent of dogs were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease, with most frequent diagnoses being steroid-responsive meningitis and polyarthritis. Treatment 24 hours before referral significantly increased the time to diagnosis (P=0·004) and affected the presence of fever at referral (P=0·006). Insurance status did not significantly affect cost incurred by the owner. Clinical Significance: This study documents a high incidence of immune-mediated disease in dogs referred for investigation of fever. It also documents a higher incidence of inflammatory central nervous system disease in febrile dogs than that reported previously. Of the diagnostic modalities employed in the majority of cases, radiography, cytology and bacteriological and fungal cultures (fluids/tissues) were the most useful. It is suggested that treatment is withdrawn or withheld before commencing diagnostic investigation of fever.
