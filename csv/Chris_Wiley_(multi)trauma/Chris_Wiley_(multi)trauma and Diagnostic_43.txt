AB  - Abstract ?? Background:?Non-setting calcium hydroxide (Ultracal XS?) is recommended by the International Association of Dental Traumatology as the initial medicament following avulsion and replantation for mature teeth. There is experimental evidence to suggest Ledermix?, placed as an alternative inter-visit dressing may improve periodontal healing. Aim:?This study investigated, using a multi-centre randomized controlled trial, the effect of two root canal medicaments, Ledermix? and Ultracal XS?, on periodontal healing of avulsed and replanted teeth. Material and methods:?Children were recruited if they fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Treatment followed a standardized protocol. Assessment of periodontal healing or ankylosis was made clinically and radiographically by an experienced, ?blinded?, clinician at 12?months. Results:?Over 200 patients were assessed for eligibility at five centres. Twenty-nine patients were eligible for inclusion. Final analysis involved 22 patients with 27 teeth. Ankylosis was detected in four of the 12 teeth in the Ledermix? group and nine of 15 in the Ultracal XS? group. No significant difference between medicaments was found in the proportion of teeth or patients showing periodontal healing. Discussion:?There was no significant difference in periodontal healing between the two medicaments at either a tooth or patient level. The numbers recruited fell short of an estimated power calculation. For patients meeting the inclusion criteria and completing the trial, periodontal healing was seen in 52% of teeth at the 12-month assessment between both groups. The only factor found to significantly influence the periodontal outcome was dry time.

AB  - The objectives of the present study were to estimate the prevalence of recurrent headaches in schoolchildren (ranging from 2nd to 5th degrees) in Mersin city of Turkey and to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio of the diagnostic headache characteristics in children with migraine and Tension Type Headache (TTH) using neurologist's diagnosis as the gold standard. The stratified sample of study was composed of 5562 children. The prevalence of recurrent headache was 49.2% (2739 of 5562) and the prevalence of current headache was 31.3% (859 of 2739). TTH was more common than migraine (24.7% vs. 10.4%). The most sensitive headache characteristic for migraine was ?severity of pain? and the most sensitive definitive symptom is ?duration of headache? in children with TTH. IHS-based symptom definition criteria are highly beneficial in diagnosis of childhood headache, if used together with detailed clinical assessment.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Prospectively collected, real-world data on bleeds, haemophilic treatment and safety outcomes in persons with haemophilia A (PwHA) with factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors are limited. A prospective, global, multi-centre, non-interventional study (NIS; NCT02476942) collected detailed real-world data in PwHA treated per local routine clinical practice. Aim To characterize bleeding rates, haemophilic treatment practices, prophylaxis adherence and adverse events (AEs) in adult/adolescent PwHA with inhibitors in the NIS. Methods Participants aged ≥12 years with congenital haemophilia A/documented high-titre FVIII inhibitor history were enrolled. Participants remained on their usual treatment; no interventions were applied. Results Overall, 103 PwHA with inhibitors enrolled, (median [range] age 31 [12-75] years) and were monitored for median (range) 26.0 (4.1-69.6) weeks. In the episodic (n = 75) and prophylactic (n = 28) treatment groups, respectively, 1244 and 325 bleeds were reported, and 528 (42.4%) and 104 (32.0%) were not treated; annualized bleeding rates (ABRs; 95% confidence interval) were 18.6 (15.2-22.8) and 14.9 (10.5-21.2) for treated bleeds, and 32.7 (27.3-39.1) and 25.0 (18.4-34.0) for all bleeds. Coagulation products used included activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and/or recombinant activated FVII. Among participants prescribed aPCC prophylaxis, 35.0% adhered to both prescribed frequency of aPCC administration and prescribed dose. Serious AEs of haemarthrosis and muscle haemorrhage were reported; most common AEs were arthralgia, viral upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia. Conclusions ABRs (treated bleeds and all bleeds) remain high on standard treatment; this prospective NIS demonstrates the need for more effective treatments for PwHA with inhibitors to reduce/prevent bleeds, with potential to improve prophylaxis adherence and further improve outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - Abstract Oral Cavity. Most carcinomas in situ of the oral cavity present as red or pink lesions that do not have a keratinized surface. Scrapings of such lesions readily disclose abnormal squamous cells diagnostic of cancer. Scrapings of the keratinized white lesions (so-called leukoplakia) are of no diagnostic value. Dentists, who are most likely to uncover precancerous lesions, are apparently not aware of the diagnostic options based on simple scrape smears. The method is also applicable to follow-up of patients with treated cancer of the oral cavity. Esophagus. Cytologic evaluation of esophageal cancer, initially by washings and subsequently by brushings under endoscopic control, is an established method of diagnosis. The diagnostic results are very good in symptomatic cancer patients and have an accuracy reaching 85?90%. Unfortunately the results of treatment of advanced lesions are very poor, with 5-year survival of only about 5%. Serious efforts at detection of early esophageal cancer started in China in the 1960s, using an abrasive balloon technique which was applied to asymptomatic populations in high risk areas such as Linxian in the Henan province of Central China. The Chinese investigators reported the finding of numerous precancerous lesions of the esophagus classified as carcinoma in situ and as dysplasia. Surgical resection of some of the precursor lesions apparently resulted in a significant drop in the rate of invasive carcinoma, although the statistical results were not convincingly presented. The balloon technique has been tested by us and by others in South Africa and in Transkei, confirming its efficacy in the diagnosis of early esophageal cancer. Peripheral Lung. Sputum and bronchial brush cytology may uncover bronchogenic carcinoma in situ and early invasive cancers located in the primary or secondary bronchi. Small, peripheral lung lesions usually do not shed cells in sputum or brushings, and their discovery is usually based on roentgenologic finding. The identity of such lesions can be confirmed in most cases by a transcutaneous aspiration. Most of the peripheral malignant lesions are small adenocarcinomas or epidermoid carcinomas, both resectable by routine surgical procedures. Less commonly, oat cell carcinomas may be observed and these lesions should not be treated by surgery. Benign lesions such as granulomatous inflammation and fungal infections may also be identified by aspiration techniques. The prognosis of the resectable carcinomas varies with their size and the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases. Most importantly perhaps, many of these peripheral lesions occur in non-smokers or former smokers, slowly replacing in frequency the classical squamous bronchogenic carcinomas observed in smokers. It is clear that the optimal targets for chemoprevention are the oral and esophageal precursor lesions.

AB  - Important advances in understanding traumatic stress reactions in children and young people have been made in recent years. The aim of this review was to synthesise selected recent research findings, with a focus on their relevance to clinical practice. We therefore address: findings on the epidemiology of trauma exposure and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); recent changes to diagnostic classification; implications for screening and assessment of traumatic stress reactions; and treatment outcome studies including interventions for acute and chronic PTSD, dissemination of effective treatments into community settings, and early interventions. We conclude with recommendations for clinical practice and suggestions for future areas of research.

AB  - Renovascular disease is a common but complex disorder, the most common causes of which are fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. Clinically, it can present as asymptomatic renal artery stenosis, renovascular hypertension, or ischemic nephropathy. Assessing the clinical index of suspicion remains essential in determining an appropriate diagnostic strategy. For diagnosis in patients with suspected fibromuscular disease, it may be reasonable to proceed directly to renal angiography; however, for most patients with suspected atherosclerotic disease, there are a number of noninvasive tests available that can aid in decision making. The choice of the most appropriate initial test should be based on patient characteristics, clinical presentation, and local expertise. Treatment options include medical, surgical, or percutaneous approaches. Generally, in patients with fibromuscular disease, percutaneous intervention provides durable improvement or cure of hypertension. In patients with atherosclerotic disease, the data are less consistent, and there does appear to be a group of patients who will respond well to medical management alone. As technology advances, the diagnostic and treatment paradigms will continue to evolve.

AB  - Malnutrition is common among hospitalized patients in the United States, and its coded prevalence is increasing. Malnutrition is known to be associated with increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Although national data indicate that the number of malnutrition diagnoses among hospital discharges has been steadily rising, an in-depth examination of the demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients has not been conducted. We examined data from the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), the most recent nationally-representative data describing U.S. hospital discharges. Using ICD-9 codes, we constructed a composite variable indicating a diagnosis of malnutrition. Based on our definition, 3.2% of all U.S. hospital discharges in 2010 had this diagnosis. Relative to patients without a malnutrition diagnosis, those with the diagnosis were older, had longer lengths of stay and incurred higher costs. These patients were more likely to have 27 of 29 comorbidities assessed in HCUP. Finally, discharge to home care was twice as common among malnourished patients, and a discharge of death was more than 5 times as common among patients with a malnutrition diagnosis. Taken together, these nationally representative, cross-sectional data indicate that hospitalized patients discharged with a diagnosis of malnutrition are older and sicker and their inpatient care is more expensive than their counterparts without this diagnosis.

AB  - The aim of this replication study was to determine if prior findings at one U.S. dental school about dental students' comfort discussing and perceptions of the relevance of 15 risk behaviors to adolescent patient oral health care would be observed at other institutions. All first- and fourth-year dental students (n=414) at three U.S. dental schools in fall 2017 were invited to participate, and 218 completed the survey (52.7% response rate). These students reported feeling comfortable to uncomfortable discussing risk behaviors with adolescent patients, yet perceived those risk behaviors as relevant to their oral health. There were significant differences in student comfort discussing risk behaviors with adolescents and their perceptions of relevance by gender, age, class status, and school location. Males were more comfortable than females discussing oral health risk behaviors. There were no significant differences by race/ethnicity. Fourth-year students had higher levels of comfort discussing risk behaviors than first-year students. Compared to students in the South and Midwest schools, students at the West school were more comfortable discussing selected topics and had higher perceptions of their relevance to adolescent oral health care. These results suggest there is room for improvement in this area of dental education. Dental schools should aim to strengthen students' knowledge of and comfort in discussing oral health risk behaviors with adolescent patients with the use of educational activities and clinical experiences.

AB  - Abstract ? This study aimed to assess the prevalence of injuries to the permanent incisors in Blumenau, Brazil. In addition, the relationship between dental injuries and socio-economic indicators was examined. A cross-sectional survey was carried out. It included a random sample of 652 children aged 12 years, from both sexes, attending public and private primary schools in Blumenau, Brazil. Multi-stage sampling technique and proportional representation were adopted. A trained and calibrated dentist collected the data through clinical examinations and interviews. Clinical examination included type of damage, treatment provided and needed, size of incisal overjet and type of lip coverage. The response rate was 82.5%. The prevalence of dental injuries was 58.6%. Boys experienced more injuries than girls, 67.2% and 50.2% (P=0.001), respectively. Children from mothers with higher schooling experienced more dental injuries than those from of mothers with lower schooling, 68.2% and 56.6% (P=0.03). Father?s level of education, parents? employment status and family income were not statistically significantly associated with dental injuries (P>0.05). There was a tendency for children with incisal overjet greater than 5 mm (P=0.2) and inadequate lip coverage (P=0.1) to have more dental injuries, but differences were not statistically significant. Nearly all (97.3%) children who had dental injuries needed treatment. In conclusion, the prevalence of dental injuries in Blumenau, Brazil, was very high, treatment of dental injuries was severely neglected, and boys and children from mothers with high schooling were more likely to have experienced dental injuries.

AB  - Abstract A natural history study was conducted in 142 Thalassemic (Thal), 199 transfused Sickle Cell Disease (Tx-SCD, n = 199), and 64 non-Tx-SCD subjects to describe the frequency of iron-related morbidity and mortality. Subjects recruited from 31 centers in the US, Canada or the UK were similar with respect to age (overall: 25 ± 11 years, mean ± SD) and gender (52% female). We found that Tx-SCD subjects were hospitalized more frequently compared with Thal or non-Tx-SCD (P < 0.001). Among those hospitalized, Tx-SCD adult subjects were more likely to be unemployed compared with Thal (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0?2.5) or non-Tx-SCD (RR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.3?7.3). There was a positive relationship between the severity of iron overload, assessed by serum ferritin, and the frequency of hospitalizations (r= 0.20; P = 0.009). Twenty-three deaths were reported (6 Thal, 17 Tx-SCD) in 23.5 ± 10 months of follow-up. Within the Tx-SCD group, those who died began transfusion (25.3 vs. 12.4 years, P < 0.001) and chelation therapy later (26.8 vs. 14.2 years, P = 0.01) compared with those who survived. The unadjusted death rate in Thal was lower (2.2/100 person years) compared with that in Tx-SCD (7.0/100 person years; RR = 0.38: 95% CI 0.12?0.99). However, no difference was observed when age at death was considered. Despite improvements in therapy, death rate in this contemporary sample of transfused adult subjects with Thal or SCD is 3 times greater than the general US population. Long term follow-up of this unique cohort of subjects will be helpful in further defining the relationship of chronic, heavy iron overload to morbidity and mortality. Am. J.

AB  - Although psychological resilience has been shown to ?buffer? against depression following major stressors, no studies have reported on this relationship within the prostate cancer (PCa) population, many of whom are at elevated risk of depression, health problems and suicide. To investigate the effects of resilience upon anxiety and depression in the PCa population, postal surveys of 425 PCa patients were collected from two sites: 189 PCa patients at site 1 and 236 at site 2. Background data plus responses to depression and resilience scales were collected. Results indicated that total resilience score was a significant buffer against depression across both sites. Resilience had different underlying component factor structures across sites, but only one (common) factor significantly (inversely) predicted depression. Within that factor, only some specific items significantly predicted depression scores, suggesting a focused relationship between resilience and depression. It may be concluded that measures of resilience may be used to screen depression at-risk PCa patients. These patients might benefit from resilience training to enhance their ability to cope effectively with the stress of their diagnosis and treatment. A focus upon specific aspects of overall resilience may be of further benefit in both these processes.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To examine trends in ED presentations with a mental health diagnosis (MHdx) in Australia by jurisdiction and by sex, between 2004?05 and 2016?17. Methods Data were captured in the National Non-Admitted Patient Emergency Department Care Database. Outcomes were the proportion of ED presentations with a principal diagnosis of ICD-10-AM F00-F99 (MHdx), and the rate of all ED and MHdx presentations per 10?000 population. Results Between 2004?05 and 2016?17, MHdx presentations experienced compounding annual growth of 5.9% nationally, and increased from 3.3% to 3.7% of all ED presentations with a diagnosis. Most growth occurred between 2010?11 and 2015?16. Northern Territory (NT) had the highest level of MHdx presentations per 10?000 population, more than double the Australian average. The proportion of MHdx presentations was highest in South Australia (SA) in most years, and the average annual proportion of MHdx presentations was statistically significantly higher than the national average in SA, Queensland (QLD) and Western Australia (WA). The proportion of MHdx presentations increased in each jurisdiction, with significant increases for Victoria, QLD, WA, Australian Capital Territory and NT. Males experienced greater numbers and rates of all ED and MHdx presentations, while the proportion of MHdx presentations was 8% higher for females. Conclusions The proportion of ED presentations for MH conditions, narrowly defined, has increased in all Australian jurisdictions between 2004?05 and 2016?17, but particularly since 2010?11. Differences between jurisdictions indicate jurisdictional specific issues. However, significant or upward trend of MHdx presentations across all jurisdictions indicates generic issues necessitating concern and policy development at a national level.

AB  - Purpose. This article constitutes the first effort to consider debasement employing the Millon Clinical Multi-axial Inventory III (MCMI-III) in a forensic clinical population and incorporating the recommendations of Van Denburg and Choca (1997). It considers the proposition (Rogers, 1990a) that the pathogenic and criminological models of malingering can be rejected in favour of the adaptional model. Methods. A total of 142 MCMI-III profiles were collected over a 17-month period by a forensic psychology service. Of these, 47 had Debasement scale scores greater than 74. From the remaining 75, a group of 47 were randomly selected for comparative purposes. Of the total sample there were 75 males and 19 females, 68 were out-patients and 26 were in-patients, the latter having been detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, applicable to England and Wales. The two groups were compared on personality variables, offending history, presenting problems and referral circumstances. Results. There is tentative support for Rogers (1990a) in that situational variables appear to have a significant impact on debasement as would be predicted by the adaptional model of malingering. However, this was insufficient evidence to reject the pathogenic and criminological models of malingering. Conclusions. It is suggested that a longitudinal study examining the impact of different stages of the mental health or criminal justice system on debasement, and other validity scales, would illuminate the adaptional model further. Factors that influence the inclination to exaggerate psychopathology and which could be manipulated experimentally are also noted. Some speculation about the possible combined use of Debasement and Histrionic, Narcissistic and Compulsive scales in distinguishing between malingerers is offered.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion of Immunological Origin (RSAI) is currently diagnosed by the occurrence of 2?3 consecutive miscarriages of unknown origin. The psychological trauma incurred by these events is a serious ailment which may be potentially avoided if a method of analysis is derived which may forecast these events and in turn prevent them from occurring. This review intends to examine studies of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) which use laboratory diagnosis and also studies of RSA that do not use laboratory diagnosis. We believe that when laboratory results are incorporated into the diagnosis of RSA/RSAI that treatment is highly successful whereas the absence of laboratory results severely hinders the effectiveness of treatment. It is worth noting that correlating treatment versus outcome is imprudent because of the multiple variables involved in patient cases. It is not imprudent, however, to say that incorporation of laboratory data is essential when diagnosing RSA/RSAI.

AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.
