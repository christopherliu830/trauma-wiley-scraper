AB  - Abstract Background and aims The focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multi-dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risk-taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the item-bank, (2) calibrate the item-bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptom-specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CAT-SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain. Design Item bank construction, item calibration phase, CAT-SUD validation phase. Setting Primary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patient-to-patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles). Participants/cases Calibration phase: the CAT-SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CAT-SUD. Measurements A total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CAT-SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis. Findings Calibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multi-dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168-item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CAT-SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20-fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CAT-SUD (AUC = 0.85). Conclusions We have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multi-dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CAT-SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

AB  - The two leading causes of urinary incontinence in dogs are ureteral ectopia in juveniles and urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence in adults. While the accuracy of diagnosis of ectopic ureters has improved due to increased use of CT and/or cystoscopy, the diagnosis of urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence largely remains one of exclusion. New treatment options have been developed for both conditions, which have reduced morbidity and mortality, although the rate of long-term urinary continence has not significantly improved for either and neither has our understanding of the pathophysiology behind these failures. This review provides updates on the management of both of these conditions, with discussion of controversial areas and thoughts for future directions.

AB  - Aim To determine which factors relate to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, in adult patients who are admitted to critical care units. Background Patient survival rates from critical care areas are improving each year and this has led to interest in the long-term outcomes for patients who have been discharged from such environments. Patients typically require invasive and extensive treatment, which places a stress on physical and mental health. Prevalence estimates of post-traumatic stress disorder in the critical care discharge population vary from 5?63%, yet it remains unclear what the predisposing factors are. Design A systematised review. Method Subject heading and keyword searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect, with 23 articles identified that examined the relationship between critical care and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Results Three main themes were identified; Critical Care Factors, Patient Factors and Experience Factors. Eight key and three potential causative factors were found: younger age, female, previous psychiatric history, length of ICU stay, benzodiazepine sedation, use of stress hormones, delusional memory and traumatic memory, delirium, GCS score of ≤9 on admission & use of mechanical restraint. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress reactions can be strongly related to the development and presence of traumatic and delusional memories. Younger patients may exclude themselves from research to avoid their traumatic thoughts. The role of prior psychiatric illness is unknown. Distinction between ?factual? and ?false? or delusional memory as occurs in the literature maybe unhelpful in understanding trauma reactions. Relevance to clinical practice There are around 38,000 occupied critical care beds each year in England. The scale of the issue is therefore substantial. Risk factors can be isolated from available evidence and provide a rudimentary risk assessment tool to inform practice development in this area.

AB  - Summary Almost half of the nail pathology is due to onychomycosis, but as the nail has a limited repertoire of clinical expressions, many nail conditions may mimic onychomycosis. Its differential diagnosis should be known in order to avoid useless or even potentially toxic treatments. Clinical features of the most common type of onychomycosis, namely distal subungual lateral onychomycosis (DSLO), are subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and yellowish discoloration of the nail plate. In psoriasis involving the distal matrix, the incorporation of parakeratotic cells in the nail plate may result in leukonychia, which should be distinguished from superficial white onychomycosis (SWO). In some special features of proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), the nail exhibits one or several white transverse lines. Total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO) is a long-standing condition where the nail was contaminated and became progressively dystrophic. Clinical examination and a thorough history of patients are usually sufficient for establishing the right diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Child abuse is a significant social and public health problem in many societies. One particular form of physical abuse is inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI) ? the so-called ?Shaken Baby Syndrome?. One of the key features associated with ITBI is characteristic ocular findings ? only observed on fundal examination. It is crucial not to miss the diagnosis of ITBI as there may be implications for the safety of the child. The ophthalmologist is one key contributor to the process required to make the diagnosis of ITBI accurately and on the basis of all the relevant evidence. This article discusses some medicolegal implications of examining a child with retinal haemorrhages in the context of suspected ITBI, with practical advice for the ophthalmologist to be as objective and prepared as possible. The scientific validity of some alternative explanations advanced in court is discussed, with a strong emphasis on the literature.

AB  - Summary ICD-10 contains diagnostic criteria which exist in two versions: diagnostic guidelines for routine clinical use and criteria for research. Mental disorders in the elderly are not a separate category of morbidity, and psychiatric disturbances in the elderly can be classified in any clinically relevant section. The dementias are embedded in the section on organic and symptomatic mental disorders (?organic? meaning that the disorder can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or systemic disease). Entry points at the level of clinical syndrome are: dementia; amnesic syndrome; delirium; organic quasi-functional disorder; and personality disorder. Once dementia is established, the diagnostic process branches off into the clinical forms of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and dementia in diseases classified elsewhere. Multi-axial coding can be achieved by using extra codes from other ICD-10 chapters for physical disorders; or by using the multi-axial system now available, with axes for clinical diagnosis, disablements and contextual factors.

AB  - Ultrasonography of a cat with diarrhoea and vomiting revealed a multi-layered, discrete linear structure within the large intestine with retention of the intestinal layers which could potentially be confused with an intestinal intussusception. The structure was ultimately expelled from the large intestine during defecation, and confirmed as a fibrinonecrotic cast. The origin of the fibrinonecrotic cast was assumed to be an intestinal pseudo-membrane formed in enteritis caused by immune suppression due to the panleukopenia virus. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasonographic description of a fibrinonecrotic cast and spontaneous passage of the colonic cast in the veterinary field.

AB  - Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single-center pediatric LT cohort (2000-2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height-for-age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride?rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non-CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow-up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.

AB  - Abstract Aims To evaluate multi-frequency tactilometry as a method to measure vibrotactile sense in the sole of the foot in subjects with diabetes. Methods Vibration thresholds were investigated at five frequencies (8, 16, 32, 64 and 125 Hz) at three sites (first and fifth metatarsal heads and heel) in the sole of the foot in subjects with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (n = 37). Thresholds were compared with healthy, age- and gender-matched subjects (n = 37) and related to glycaemic levels, subjective estimation of sensation in the feet and to perception of touch. Results Vibration thresholds were significantly higher in subjects with diabetes compared with healthy subjects at low frequencies (8, 16 and 32 Hz) at all measured sites, and also at 64 Hz for the metatarsal heads. Perception of touch and subjective estimation of sensation were significantly impaired in subjects with diabetes. Glycaemic levels, which were higher in subjects with diabetes, did not correlate with vibration thresholds at 32 Hz (most sensitive to Meissner?s corpuscles) or with touch thresholds in subjects with diabetes. Vibration thresholds at 32 Hz correlated significantly with perception of touch (rho = 0.45?0.65; P < 0.01) and with subjective sensation (rho = ?0.38 to ?0.52; P < 0.001) in subjects with diabetes. Perception of touch and subjective estimation of sensation did also correlate (rho = ?0.51 to ?0.80; P < 0.002). Conclusions Tactilometry is effective in detecting neuropathy in the sole of the foot at low frequencies of mainly 8?32 Hz, indicating that at least Meissner's corpuscles, or their related large nerve fibres, are affected by diabetes.

AB  - Summary The following discussion has been developed to facilitate an historical perspective for future work in defining the boundaries and characteristics of psychopathology. The chapter begins with an historical overview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) classification systems that started with efforts to collect statistics about the population at large (i.e. U.S. Census), which would be consistent with statistics on the diagnostic composition of patients in mental hospitals. Next, there is a review of the history of international collaboration that has allowed for the ongoing coordination efforts to develop classification systems by both the APA and the international scientific community. After a review of the strengths and limitations of the DSM-IV, the chapter concludes with a look ahead to future efforts to improve the validity and clinical utility of diagnostic criteria for psychopathology, and the arrangement of such diagnoses into a system of classification. The roots of the fifth-edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) developmental process are described as options for future efforts to ensure continued collaboration between U.S. and international developers of the DSM and ICD systems.

AB  - Abstract Objective Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses unstable angina (UA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). In 2007?2008 in Australia, there were 95?000 hospitalisations for ACS. There is limited data about the level of agreement between the ED and hospital discharge diagnosis. The objective of the present study is to describe the proportion of ED patients with a concordant ACS hospital discharge diagnosis and determine factors associated with this. Methods The present study was a retrospective case series of consecutive presentations of patients with ACS to the EDs of Southern Health, Victoria, Australia, during a 6 month period between August 2011 and January 2012. Results One thousand and twenty-eight patients diagnosed with ACS in the ED were identified. Hospital discharge diagnosis was recorded for 704 cases. The mean age was 63 years (SD 14.5) and 69% were male. One hundred and nineteen patients (16.9%) were diagnosed with a STEMI, 322 (45.7%) with a NSTEMI and 263 (37.4%) with UA. There were 68.3% who had a concordant discharge diagnosis of ACS. An ED diagnosis of STEMI (87.4), English as the primary language (OR 1.81 [1.13?2.89]) and chest pain as the presenting complaint (OR 2.70 [1.72?4.23]) were associated with a concordant diagnosis of ACS. Conclusion Almost one-third of patients who are admitted to the hospital with ACS have a different hospital discharge diagnosis. English as a primary language and presenting with chest pain are associated with a more concordant diagnosis. More research needs to be performed to better understand these findings.

AB  - ABSTRACT Pelvic bone segmentation is a vital step in analyzing pelvic CT images, which assists physicians with diagnostic decision making in cases of traumatic pelvic injuries. Due to the limited resolution of the original CT images and the complexity of pelvic structures and their possible fractures, automatic pelvic bone segmentation in multiple CT slices is very difficult. In this study, an automatic pelvic bone segmentation approach is proposed using the combination of anatomical knowledge and computational techniques. It is developed for solving the problem of accurate and efficient bone segmentation using multiple consecutive pelvic CT slices obtained from each patient. Our proposed segmentation method is able to handle variation of bone shapes between slices there by making it less susceptible to inter-personal variability between different patients' data. Moreover, the designed training models are validated using a cross-validation process to demonstrate the effectiveness. The algorithm's capability is tested on a set of 20 CT data sets. Successful segmentation results and quantitative evaluations are present to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed algorithm, well suited for pelvic bone segmentation purposes.

AB  - Abstract Background Fibrosis, a proliferative response of fibrocytes after tissue injury, is a common sequela of external radiotherapy and can vary greatly among patients even in the absence of DNA repair syndromes, due to their different intrinsic radiosensitivity. Fibrosis is also a serious cosmetic problem for patients, and in some cases it can also imply pain. Case Here, we report a case of a severe fibrosis 2 years after breast conserving surgery and postoperative 3D conformal breast irradiation. Furthermore, our patient had the suspicion of tumour recurrence. Our examinations were aimed at diagnosing recurrence or the lack of recurrence and investigating whether the symptoms occurred due to overdosing or extreme intrinsic radiosensitivity. Therefore, examining the patients' radiosensitivity, a cytogenetic test was performed, which revealed the patient's increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation, and therefore we rejected the prospect of overdosage. As a solution for the fibrosis, mastectomy was effectuated, and a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was used for reconstruction. Conclusions We suggest a multi-disciplinary approach to manage fibrosis and propose cytogenetic markers to be used as predictors to identify patients who most likely benefit from a certain therapeutic regimen in terms of reduction of therapy-related side effects.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test whether postnatal psychological distress in parents of babies with congenital malformations is reduced by prenatal diagnosis. Methods A prospective observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted at two Norwegian hospitals. We included 293 parents of babies with congenital malformations (prenatal detection rate: 36.5%) referred for neonatal surgery and 249 parents of healthy babies (comparison group). Parental psychological responses were assessed on three postnatal occasions by psychometric instruments (GHQ-28, STAI-X1, and IES). Results Significantly increased psychological distress (GHQ-28) was reported by parents who received prenatal diagnosis as compared to postnatal diagnosis; acutely 28.9 versus 24.4, P = 0.006 (comparison group: 19.6); at 6 weeks 26.8 versus 21.5, P < 0.001 (comparison group: 17.7); and at 6 months 22.6 versus 18.7, P = 0.015 (comparison group: 16.6). Mothers consistently reported higher levels of distress than fathers. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that prenatal diagnosis and being a mother significantly predicted severity of acute psychological distress. At 6 weeks and 6 months, mortality and associated anomalies were significant independent predictors of psychological distress. Conclusion Controlling for other covariates, we found that prenatal diagnosis of congenital malformations was a significant independent predictor of acute parental psychological distress after birth.

Women diagnosed with breast cancer may experience both psychological distress and PTG. As rumination may influence outcomes through distinct pathways, this study investigated the association of intrusion, brooding and instrumental subcomponents of rumination with psychological distress and PTG in the breast cancer context. Methods Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (n?=?185), mean age 55.98 years (SD?=?9.26), completed an online survey including the Multi-dimensional Rumination in Illness Scale, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, Medical Outcomes Social Support Survey, demographic and health-related questions. Results As predicted, regression analyses indicated that brooding was positively related to depression, anxiety and stress, but was also negatively related to the PTG dimensions of new possibilities and spiritual growth. Partially supporting the study hypotheses, intrusion was positively associated with stress and the PTG of relating to others and new possibilities. As hypothesised, instrumental rumination was positively associated with all five dimensions of PTG. Conclusions Rumination is a key consideration in both positive and negative psychological responses of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Associations of specific components of rumination with varying psychological outcomes suggest differential paths by which the specific subcomponents of rumination exert this influence.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the volume of in-stent neointimal proliferation, assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), at 6-month follow-up after implantation of a coronary Carbofilm?-coated stent (Tecnic Carbostent?, Sorin Biomedica Cardio, Saluggia, Italy) versus a conventional 316 L stent (Rx Multi-Link Penta, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Background: Many trials suggest that stent characteristics and coating could be important determinants of restenosis. Methods: From October 2004 to May 2005, 63 patients were randomized to Tecnic (T, n = 30) or Penta (P, n = 33). The primary end-point was in-stent volume of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) measured by IVUS at 6 months. The secondary end-points included binary restenosis, minimal luminal diameter (MLD), target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Results: There were no significant differences between T and P as to mean age, male gender, clinical status, complexity of the lesion, lesion length, reference vessel diameter before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), MLD pre-PCI, and stent-to-artery ratio. However, MLD poststenting was greater in P group than T group (2.81 ± 0.45 mm vs. 2.49 ± 0.33 mm, P < 0.002). At 6 months, angiographic late lumen loss (0.61 ± 0.51 mm vs. 0.92 ± 0.61 mm, P < 0.043), in-stent obstruction (25.86 ± 16.48% vs. 38.33 ± 19.56%, P = 0.021), and in-stent late loss volume (31.62 ± 29.75 mm3 vs. 57.28 ± 37.16 mm3, P = 0.016) were significantly lower in T group than in P group. Conclusion: Penta stent appears to offer a better deployment and a larger MLD post-PCI than Carbofilm-coated stent. However, a thicker NIH was observed on Penta stent at 6-month follow-up, when compared to Tecnic.

AB  - Dysphagia is associated with aspiration, pneumonia, and malnutrition, but remains challenging to identify at the bedside. A variety of exam protocols and maneuvers are commonly used, but the efficacy of these maneuvers is highly variable. We conducted a comprehensive search of 7 databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus, from each database's earliest inception through June 9, 2014. Studies reporting diagnostic performance of a bedside examination maneuver compared to a reference gold standard (videofluoroscopic swallow study or flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing) were included for analysis. From each study, data were abstracted based on the type of diagnostic method and reference standard study population and inclusion/exclusion characteristics, design, and prediction of aspiration. The search strategy identified 38 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Overall, most bedside examinations lacked sufficient sensitivity to be used for screening purposes across all patient populations examined. Individual studies found dysphonia assessments, abnormal pharyngeal sensation assessments, dual axis accelerometry, and 1 description of water swallow testing to be sensitive tools, but none were reported as consistently sensitive. A preponderance of identified studies was in poststroke adults, limiting the generalizability of results. No bedside screening protocol has been shown to provide adequate predictive value for presence of aspiration. Several individual exam maneuvers demonstrated reasonable sensitivity, but reproducibility and consistency of these protocols was not established. More research is needed to design an optimal protocol for dysphagia detection. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2015;10:256?265. ? 2015 Society of Hospital Medicine

AB  - Objective To report on a large multi-institutional series of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) partial nephrectomy (PN) and analyse renal function and short-term oncological outcomes. Material and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive cases of LESS-PN performed between November 2007 and March 2012 at 11 participating institutions. Demographic data and data on the main peri-operative outcomes and complications were gathered and analysed. Kidney function was evaluated by measuring serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Chronic kidney disease was defined in stages for each patient according to the National Kidney Foundation, Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. Results A total of 190 cases were included in this analysis. The mean renal tumour size was 2.6?cm, and the mean PADUA score was 7.2. The median operating time was 170?min with a median estimated blood loss of 150?mL. A clampless technique was used in 70 cases (36.8%) and the median warm ischaemia time (WIT) was 16.5?min. PADUA score independently predicted the length of WIT (low vs high score: odds ratio 5.11, CI 1.50?17.41, P = 0.009; intermediate vs high score: odds ratio 5.13, CI 1.56?16.88, P = 0.007). The overall postoperative complication rate was 14.7%. Where a clamping technique was used, a significant increase in serum creatinine concentration and a significant decrease in eGFR were observed postoperatively and at 6 months. On multivariate analysis PADUA score was the only predicting factor. Overall survival rates were 99, 97 and 88% at 12-, 24- and 36-month follow-up, respectively, while disease-free survival rates were 98% at 12-month and 97% at 24- and 36-month follow-up. Conclusion The study showed that LESS-PN is effective in terms of renal function preservation and oncological control at short- and intermediate-term follow-up.

AB  - Highlights Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) is a preventive intervention for preadolescent youth in foster care. 95% of those offered FHF started the program, 92% completed it, and there was over 85% attendance. FHF reduced mental health symptoms, especially trauma, and mental health service utilization. Effects were consistent across almost all subgroups, suggesting FHF benefits diverse children. Positive youth development programming is acceptable and can be beneficial for vulnerable children.
