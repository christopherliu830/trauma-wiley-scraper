AB  - Abstract Mouse spinal cord (SC) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides important information on tissue morphology and structural changes that may occur during pathologies such as multiple sclerosis or SC injury. The acquisition scheme of the commonly used DWI techniques is based on conventional spin-echo encoding, which is time-consuming. The purpose of this work was to investigate whether the use of echo planar imaging (EPI) would provide good-quality diffusion MR images of mouse SC, as well as accurate measurements of diffusion-derived metrics, and thus enable diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and highly resolved DWI within reasonable scan times. A four-shot diffusion-weighted spin-echo EPI (SE-EPI) sequence was evaluated at 11.75?T on a group of healthy mice (n?=?10). SE-EPI-derived apparent diffusion coefficients of gray and white matter were compared with those obtained using a conventional spin-echo sequence (c-SE) to validate the accuracy of the method. To take advantage of the reduction in acquisition time offered by the EPI sequence, multi-slice DTI acquisitions were performed covering the cervical segments (six slices, six diffusion-encoding directions, three b values) within 30?min (vs 2?h for c-SE). From these measurements, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivities were calculated, and fiber tracking along the C1 to C6 cervical segments was performed. In addition, high-resolution images (74???94?µm2) were acquired within 5?min per direction. Clear delineation of gray and white matter and identical apparent diffusion coefficient values were obtained, with a threefold reduction in acquisition time compared with c-SE. While overcoming the difficulties associated with high spatially and temporally resolved DTI measurements, the present SE-EPI approach permitted identification of reliable quantitative parameters with a reproducibility compatible with the detection of pathologies. The SE-EPI method may be particularly valuable when multiple sets of images from the SC are needed, in cases of rapidly evolving conditions, to decrease the duration of anesthesia or to improve MR exploration by including additional MR measurements.

AB  - How can we study the ?quality of psychoanalytic treatments?? The authors attempt to answer this question by discussing a naturalistic, multi-perspective and representative follow-up study of psychoanalyses and long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapies. We studied a representative sample (n = 401) of all the patients who had terminated their psychoanalytic treatments with members of the German Psychoanalytical Association (DPV) between 1990 and 1993. Between 70 and 80 per cent of the patients achieved (average 6.5 years after the end of treatment) good and stable psychic changes according to the evaluations of the patients themselves, their analysts, independent psychoanalytic and non-psychoanalytic experts, and questionnaires commonly applied in psychotherapy research. The evaluation of mental health costs showed a cost reduction through fewer days of sick leave during the seven years following the end of long-term psychoanalytic treatments. The results achieved using non-psychoanalytical instruments are complemented by the richness of the idiosyncratic findings, gained by the psychoanalytic research instruments.

AB  - Highlights Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) is a preventive intervention for preadolescent youth in foster care. 95% of those offered FHF started the program, 92% completed it, and there was over 85% attendance. FHF reduced mental health symptoms, especially trauma, and mental health service utilization. Effects were consistent across almost all subgroups, suggesting FHF benefits diverse children. Positive youth development programming is acceptable and can be beneficial for vulnerable children.

AB  - Summary:? Seizures in the neonatal period are common. They can be caused by a variety of conditions, ranging from benign, self-limited illnesses to severe, life-threatening disorders. They are often the first sign of neurologic dysfunction in neonates, and may be used as one factor in considering long-term prognosis. An important mission of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) is to improve the care of patients with epilepsy. Most recently, as part of the Global Campaign against Epilepsy, ILAE, in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO), established a new initiative to create clinical guidelines and diagnostic and management algorithms for the care of patients with seizures that can be applied worldwide, including in developing countries with limited or varied medical resources. Created by an international panel of experts in seizure management and guideline development, this document proposes guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the most common and important conditions that cause seizures in the neonatal period. The publication of these clinical pathways for neonatal seizures will be followed by a period of field testing and comment by WHO clinicians and officials before finalization.

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2011; 17: 69?79 Abstract Lyme borreliosis, caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies complex, is the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The non-specific nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic challenge and concise case definitions are essential for its satisfactory management. Lyme borreliosis is very similar in Europe and North America but the greater variety of genospecies in Europe leads to some important differences in clinical presentation. These new case definitions for European Lyme borreliosis emphasise recognition of clinical manifestations supported by relevant laboratory criteria and may be used in a clinical setting and also for epidemiological investigations.

AB  - Abstract Objective ED chest pain assessments can be challenging, lengthy and contribute to overcrowding. Rapid accurate risk stratification strategies should improve ED length of stay (EDLOS). Emergency, Biochemistry and Cardiology implemented new guidelines using paired (<3?h) multiple cardiac markers to stratify patients. The intervention would reduce chest pain EDLOS. We observed for safety and disposition effects. Methods This is a single-site, prospective observational, before and after intervention study. In December 2009, paired multiple cardiac markers, the second at least 4?h from pain, replaced late troponins. The 4 h rule (ED flow improvement) started in April 2009 (unplanned confounder). Demographics, clinical features, risk assessment and disposition; preferably prospective. Administrative datasets provided disposition outcomes, 4 months pre-/post-intervention. Follow up with partially blinded adjudications assessed for 45?day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Before intervention, consecutive patients were enrolled with mixed prospective/retrospective data. After, sampling occurred whenever prospective data were collected. Results Adjudicated patients were n?=?1029 (14.2% MI, 14.9% MACE), 426 before, 603 after. EDLOS reduced 87?min (416?329; P?<?0.001), similar to triage 2 patients without chest pain. Possibly, avoidable MACE occurred in five of 598 discharges (0.8%, CI 0.3?1.8%) with non-significant decreases (0.5%, CI 0.1?1.8%) post-intervention. Disposition changes included greater observation ward use (3.8?12.3%; P?<?0.001), more discharges (47.4?52.9%, P?=?0.002), less transfers (9.3?6.9%, P?=?0.014) and less late inpatient discharge decisions (15.2?8.7%, P?=?0.001). Conclusion Paired cardiac markers performed adequately for avoidable MACE, and disposition improved significantly. A confounding system change meant the reduced EDLOS (primary outcome) was unable to be associated with the intervention.

This chapter summarizes the general principles of diagnosis and modes of therapy, leading to schemata about how to select and alter modes of therapy as needed. Brief descriptions of the different therapies are given, including psychopharmacotherapy, verbal psychotherapies, and family and group therapies. A sequential model is described that allows for a rational selection of therapies for complex problems. Combinations of therapies are discussed, and clinical vignettes given.

AB  - Wounding of Norway spruce by inoculation with sterile agar, or agar containing the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica, induced traumatic resin duct formation in the stem. Visible anatomical responses occurred in the cambium 6?9 d post-inoculation. Near the inoculation site cellular proliferation, polyphenolic accumulation, and lignification were induced as a wound reaction to seal the damaged area. Five centimetres from the inoculation site cells in the cambial zone swelled and divided to form clusters. By 18 d post-inoculation, these cells began to differentiate into resin duct epithelial cells surrounding incipient schizogenous lumens. Mature axial traumatic ducts appeared by 36 d as a row of ducts in the xylem centripetal to the cambium. The ducts formed an interconnected network continuous with radial resin ducts. Parenchyma cells surrounding the ducts accumulated polyphenols that disappeared as the cells differentiated into tracheids. These polyphenols appeared to contain fewer sugar residues compared to those accumulating in the secondary phloem, as indicated by the periodic acid?Schiff's staining. The epithelial cells did not accumulate polyphenols but contained immunologically detectable phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.5), indicating synthesis of phenolics as a possible resin component. These findings may represent a defense mechanism in Norway spruce against the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica.

AB  - Abstract Background Little is known about childhood ALL in the Middle East. This study was undertaken by MECCA as initial efforts in collaborative data collection to provide clinical and demographic information on children with ALL in the Middle East. Procedure Clinical and laboratory data for patients with ALL between January 2008 and April 2012 were prospectively collected from institutions in 14 Middle East countries and entered into a custom-built-database during induction phase. All laboratory studies including cytogenetics were done at local institutions. Results The 1,171 voluntarily enrolled patients had a mean age of 6.1?±?3.9 years and 59.2% were boys. T-ALL represented 14.8% and 84.2% had B-precursor ALL. At diagnosis, 5.6% had CNS disease. The distribution of common genetic abnormalities reflected a similar percentage of hyperdiploidy (25.6%), but a lower percentage of ETV6?RUNX1 translocation (14.7%) compared to large series reported from Western populations. By clinical criteria, 47.1% were low/standard risk, 16.9% were intermediate risk, and 36% were high risk. Most patients received all their care at the same unit (96.9%). Patients had excellent induction response to chemotherapy with an overall complete remission rate of 96%. Induction toxicities were acceptable. Conclusions This first collaborative study has established a process for prospective data collection and future multinational collaborative research in the Middle East. Despite the limitations of an incomplete population-based study, it provides the first comprehensive baseline data on clinical characteristics, laboratory evaluation, induction outcome, and toxicity. Further work is planned to uncover possible biologic differences of ALL in the region and to improve diagnosis and management. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014; 61:1403?1410. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Disc bulge and disc desiccation are the most common abnormalities occurring in the spine, which leads to severe low back pain. Despite computer-aided automatic abnormality diagnostic imaging systems are available still there is a need for betterment in diagnostic accuracy and in processing time. Image processing with combined imaging features like shape and texture has given better diagnostic ability when compared with processing with individual features. In the present study, the desiccated and bulged Intervertebral Discs (IVDs) are diagnosed automatically by combining shape features extracted using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and texture feature extracted using novel Local Sub-Rhombus Binary Relation Pattern (LS-RBRP) techniques with Random Forest (RF) classifier. The performance analysis projects that the RF with HOG+LS-RBRP has an overall better accuracy of 94.7% when compared with HOG (87%) and LS-RBRP (90.2%) with RF classifier separately in categorizing the normal IVD, disc bulge and disc desiccation in the lumbar spine MRI.

AB  - Abstract The objective of clinical periodontal diagnosis in maintenance patients is to monitor the risk for periodontal disease progression. Risk for progression should be continuously monitored at the patient, tooth and site level at each recall appointment. At the patient level, the significance of systemic diseases, cigarette smoking, compliance with the recall program, loss of support m relation to the patient's age, full mouth plaque and/or bleeding scores, and prevalence of residual pockets are of key importance. At the tooth and tooth-site levels, residual periodontal support, inflammatory parameters and their persistence, presence of ecological niches with difficult access such as furcations, and presence of iatrogenic factors have to be put into proportion with the patient s overall risk profile. The information gathered by clinical monitoring and continuous multilevel risk assessment facilitates an immediate appreciation of the periodontal health status of an individual and the possible risk for further infection and/or disease progression in the dentition and at a particular tooth or site.

AB  - Objectives Elevated shame and dissociation are common in dissociative identity disorder (DID) and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and are part of the constellation of symptoms defined as complex PTSD. Previous work examined the relationship between shame, dissociation, and complex PTSD and whether they are associated with intimate relationship anxiety, relationship depression, and fear of relationships. This study investigated these variables in traumatized clinical samples and a nonclinical community group. Method Participants were drawn from the DID (n = 20), conflict-related chronic PTSD (n = 65), and nonclinical (n = 125) populations and completed questionnaires assessing the variables of interest. A model examining the direct impact of shame and dissociation on relationship functioning, and their indirect effect via complex PTSD symptoms, was tested through path analysis. Results The DID sample reported significantly higher dissociation, shame, complex PTSD symptom severity, relationship anxiety, relationship depression, and fear of relationships than the other two samples. Support was found for the proposed model, with shame directly affecting relationship anxiety and fear of relationships, and pathological dissociation directly affecting relationship anxiety and relationship depression. The indirect effect of shame and dissociation via complex PTSD symptom severity was evident on all relationship variables. Conclusion Shame and pathological dissociation are important for not only the effect they have on the development of other complex PTSD symptoms, but also their direct and indirect effects on distress associated with relationships.

AB  - Literature describing medical treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC) is sparse. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes, including time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST), of canine PC treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or chemotherapy, and to identify prognostic factors. Records from 8 institutions were searched for dogs with cytologically or histologically confirmed PC without bladder involvement: 67 dogs were included. Presenting signs were urinary (25), gastrointestinal ([GI], 11) and systemic (3); 16 dogs had GI and urinary signs, 7 dogs had systemic signs with concurrent GI or urinary signs and in 5 dogs the tumour was an incidental finding. Out of 27 dogs, 9 (33%) had positive urine culture. Metastases were identified in 26 dogs to lymph nodes (19), lungs (10), bone (2) and liver (1). Treatment included NSAIDs and chemotherapy (32), NSAIDs alone (31) and chemotherapy alone (4). The overall MST was 82 days (range 9-752) and median TTP was 63 days (range 9-752). Dogs receiving NSAIDs combined with chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer MST (106 vs 51 days; P?=?.035) and TTP (76 vs 44 days; P?=?.02) compared to dogs receiving NSAIDs alone. Intact dogs and those with metastatic disease had significantly shorter MST (31 vs 90 days, P?=?.018 and 49 vs 109 days, P?=?.037, respectively); intact dogs also had significantly shorter TTP (25 vs 63 days, P?=?.0003). This study suggests that a combination of NSAIDs and chemotherapy may improve outcomes in canine PC. Metastatic disease and being entire negatively influenced prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test feasibility of a systematic approach to routine screening and response for intimate partner violence among women presenting to three New South Wales EDs. Methods This prospective feasibility study was conducted over 6?months in two rural and one major tertiary metropolitan ED in New South Wales. Women aged 16?45?years triaged category 3?5 (treat within 30?min/1 h/2 h), who could be approached privately, were screened for intimate partner violence using the validated HITS (Hurts, Insults, Threatens and Screams or Swears) tool. The follow-up protocol for patients who disclosed abuse, specified a social work/psychology (psychosocial) response within 1?h. Outcomes of interest were screening rates of eligible presentations, disclosures of abuse, psycho-social referral and responses. Interviews conducted with ED medical directors and nurse unit managers at each site explored barriers and facilitators. Results A total of 1047 women (11.4% of eligible presentations) completed screening at their first or subsequent presentation. Of 868 women screened on first presentation, 18% (n = 154) disclosed intimate partner violence, with no significant differences by age group, country of birth, triage category or time/day of arrival. Key barriers to screening were high patient volume, absence of electronic prompts and lack of privacy. Of those who screened positive 49% (n = 75) received an immediate, on-site psycho-social response. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that it is both possible and relevant, given the 18% disclosure rate, to screen women in relation intimate partner violence in EDs and provide a psycho-social response within 1?h. More needs to be done to address barriers to screening to provide opportunities for early intervention.

AB  - The study investigated the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in child and adolescent survivors in Turkey three years after the 1999 Marmara Earthquake, with consideration of the severity of exposure and the survivors' gender and age. A representative sample of 293 young earthquake survivors (152 female and 141 male between the ages of 8 and 15) participated in the study. Participants' scores on the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for Children indicated that 31.4% reported moderate, 24.2% reported severe, and 3.8% reported very severe traumatic stress reactions. Analysis of the Revised Impact of Events Scale for Children scores revealed that 56% reported severe PTSD symptoms. While severity of exposure and gender were significantly associated with severity of PTSD symptoms, age was not related to PTSD symptoms. The results indicated a high need for addressing the mental health problems of the child and adolescent trauma survivors in Turkey.

AB  - ABSTRACT A polyradiculoneuritis and polymyositis caused by a toxoplasma-like protozoan is described in two seven-week-old labrador pups. Examination of a centrifuged sample of cerebrospinal fluid was a useful diagnostic aid in one case and the successful treatment of the other pup is described. This case is discussed in the light of the recently described protozoan Neospora caninum which can also affect the neuromuscular system of neonatal pups.

AB  - An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions in adipose tissue is thought to contribute to chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation and consequently to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whose serum levels are elevated in such patients, have been shown to interfere with cytokine production in vitro. In order to evaluate the effects of elevated NEFA levels on cytokine production in adipose tissue in vivo we used an 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion (OFM) catheter to induce local inflammation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of healthy volunteers and to sample interstitial fluid (IF) specifically from the inflamed tissue. In two crossover studies, nine subjects received either an intravenous lipid-heparin infusion to elevate circulating NEFA levels or saline over a period of 28 h. The former increased the circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs), NEFA, glucose, and insulin over the study period. NEFA effects on locally induced inflammation were estimated by measuring the levels of a panel adipokines in the OFM probe effluent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels increased during the study period but were not affected by lipid-heparin infusion. In contrast, the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced during the final hour of lipid-heparin infusion (saline: 449.2 ± 105.9 vs. lipid-heparin: 65.4 ± 15.4 pg/ml; P = 0.02). These data provide the first in vivo evidence that elevated NEFA can modulate cytokine production by adipose tissue.
