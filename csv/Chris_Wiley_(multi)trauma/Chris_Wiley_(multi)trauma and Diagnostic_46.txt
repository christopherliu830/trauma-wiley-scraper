AB  - ABSTRACT Subluxation of a vertebra secondary to an injury (ie, traumatic spondyloptosis) is most commonly seen in the lumbosacral joint. This extremely rare spinal destabilization is caused by congenital defects, degeneration, tumors, infection, or trauma and is accompanied by severe neurologic debilitation. The patient's neurological function can be preserved when surgical team members have knowledge of spinal injuries, surgical interventions, positioning and its implications, and an awareness of the risks to the patient. Appropriate interventions can decrease complications, operative revisions, length of stay, morbidity and mortality, and hospital costs. AORN J 89 (April 2009) 657?672. ? AORN, Inc, 2009.

AB  - Abstract??? The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of dental injuries and the influence of determining factors in preschool children from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A cross-sectional survey was carried out through clinical examinations and the application of a questionnaire to the parents of 419 children aged 0 to 5?years attending preschool. The sample was stratified by region, type of institution and age. The eighteen preschools visited were chosen randomly. The prevalence of traumatic injury to primary teeth was 39.1%. Enamel fractures were the most common traumatic injury (49.7%). Boys were 1.62 times more likely to have dental injuries than girls. Children with inadequate lip coverage were 3.75 times more likely to have a traumatic dental injury than those with adequate lip coverage. Children attending state preschools had nearly two times greater chances of having dental trauma than children attending private preschools. It was concluded that the prevalence of dental injuries in preschool children is high in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and constitutes a public health problem.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the incidence of spinal fractures and their outcomes in the elderly who fall from low-levels in a suburban county. Design Retrospective county-wide trauma registry review from 2004 to 2013. Setting Suburban county with regionalized trauma care consisting of 11 hospitals. Participants Adult trauma patients aged ≥65 years who were admitted after falling from <3 feet. Measurements Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Results Spinal fractures occurred in 18% of 4,202 older adult patients admitted following trauma over this 10-year time period, in the following distribution: 43% cervical spine, 5.7% thoracic, 4.9% lumbar spine, 36% sacrococcygeal, and 9.6% multiple spinal regions. As compared to non-spinal fracture patients, more spinal fracture patients went to acute/subacute rehabilitation (47% vs 34%, P < .001) and fewer were discharged home (21% vs 35%, P < .001). In-hospital mortality rate in spinal and non-spinal fracture patients was similar (8.5% vs 9.3%, P = .5). Conclusion Low-level falls often resulted in a spinal fracture at a variety of levels. Vigilance in evaluation of the entire spine in this population is suggested.

AB  - Aim:? While volumetric and metabolic imaging on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients has been intensively performed, few studies using electroencephalograms (EEG) have been done as yet. The aim of the present study was to investigate abnormalities in functional connectivity of cortical networks in PTSD. Methods:? Non-linear interdependence (NI), a measure of bidirectional, non-linear information transmission between two time series, was used. Resting EEG were recorded for 18 PTSD patients and 18 sex-matched healthy subjects on 16 channels with their eyes closed. Results:? The NI patterns in PTSD patients were hemisphere asymmetric: an increase in NI in the fronto-parieto-temporal regions of the left hemisphere (F7, F3, T3, C3, T5 and P3) and a decrease in the fronto-parieto-occipital regions of the right hemisphere (F4, C4, P4 and O2). The non-linearity of NI in EEG, estimated from the surrogate data method, exhibited an increase in the PTSD patients as compared with that of healthy subjects, particularly in the left hemispheric cortex. Conclusion:? Abnormal functional connectivity in PTSD can be assessed using NI, a measure of multi-channel EEG.

AB  - Abstract? This cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess epi-demiological data concerning dental injuries to the permanent incisors of Syrian children. It included 1087 children aged 9 to 12 years, of both sexes, randomly selected from public and private primary schools in Damascus. The response rate was 100%. The prevalence of traumatic injuries to the permanent incisors rose from 5.2% at the age of 9 years to 11.7% at the age of 12 years (P= 0.007). The difference in prevalence between boys and girls was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The majority (59.8%) of children who had experienced injuries to the permanent incisors reported that they were not taken to the dentist for evaluation or treatment of the damage. Among those children who had experienced traumatic injuries to the teeth 93.1% presented with untreated damage. Because some injuries were minor, such as small enamel fractures, the proportion of children who needed treatment was 63.2%. There was a tendency for children with an incisal overjet greater than 5 mm to have experienced dental injuries (P=0.06). Children with inadequate lip coverage were more likely to have experienced dental injuries than those with adequate lip coverage (P=0.000). The most common reported cause of injuries to the permanent incisors was violence (42.5%), followed by traffic accidents (24.1%), collisions with people or inanimate objects (16.0%) and falls (9.1%). In conclusion, traumatic dental injury may pose a serious dental public health problem.

AB  - Summary Inherited disorders of platelet granules are clinically heterogeneous and their prevalence is underestimated because most patients do not undergo a complete diagnostic work-up. The lack of a genetic diagnosis limits the ability to tailor management, screen family members, aid with family planning, predict clinical progression and detect serious consequences, such as myelofibrosis, lung fibrosis and malignancy, in a timely manner. This is set to change with the introduction of high throughput sequencing (HTS) as a routine clinical diagnostic test. HTS diagnostic tests are now available, affordable and allow parallel screening of DNA samples for variants in all of the 80 known bleeding, thrombotic and platelet genes. Increased genetic diagnosis and curation of variants is, in turn, improving our understanding of the pathobiology and clinical course of inherited platelet disorders. Our understanding of the genetic causes of platelet granule disorders and the regulation of granule biogenesis is a work in progress and has been significantly enhanced by recent genomic discoveries from high-powered genome-wide association studies and genome sequencing projects. In the era of whole genome and epigenome sequencing, new strategies are required to integrate multiple sources of big data in the search for elusive, novel genes underlying granule disorders.

AB  - Abstract Glutaric aciduria type I (synonym, glutaric acidemia type I) is a rare organic aciduria. Untreated patients characteristically develop dystonia during infancy resulting in a high morbidity and mortality. The neuropathological correlate is striatal injury which results from encephalopathic crises precipitated by infectious diseases, immunizations and surgery during a finite period of brain development, or develops insidiously without clinically apparent crises. Glutaric aciduria type I is caused by inherited deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase which is involved in the catabolic pathways of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine and L-tryptophan. This defect gives rise to elevated glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid, and glutarylcarnitine which can be detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (organic acids) or tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitines). Glutaric aciduria type I is included in the panel of diseases that are identified by expanded newborn screening in some countries. It has been shown that in the majority of neonatally diagnosed patients striatal injury can be prevented by combined metabolic treatment. Metabolic treatment that includes a low lysine diet, carnitine supplementation and intensified emergency treatment during acute episodes of intercurrent illness should be introduced and monitored by an experienced interdisciplinary team. However, initiation of treatment after the onset of symptoms is generally not effective in preventing permanent damage. Secondary dystonia is often difficult to treat, and the efficacy of available drugs cannot be predicted precisely in individual patients. The major aim of this revision is to re-evaluate the previous diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients with this disease and incorporate new research findings into the guideline.

AB  - SUMMARY Two cases of scurvy diagnosed following presentation with a purpuric rash are presented. A 44-year-old man developed scurvy as a result of poor dietary intake of vitamin C. This occurred because of a number of factors. including poor dentition, diarrhoea, depression and benzodiazepine/narcotic dependence. A 69-year-old man with acute myeloid leukaemic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome developed mucositis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as complications of chemotherapy. This led to poor dietary intake and consequently scurvy. Both cases demonstrated specific and diagnostic cutaneous manifestations of scurvy, particularly perifollicular purpura, ecchymoses and coiled corkscrew hairs. The diagnosis was supported by specific diet history. Ascorbic acid tolerance test was used as a simple laboratory method to confirm the clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Aims This multi-centre prospective field study evaluated whether peripheral venous catheter site of insertion influences the risk of catheter-related phlebitis. Potential predictors of phlebitis were also investigated. Background Millions of patients worldwide use peripheral venous catheters, which frequently cause local complications including phlebitis, infection and obstruction. Although phlebitis predictors have been broadly investigated, uncertainties remain on the potential effect of cannulation anatomical site, duration and the appropriate time for catheter removal. Design A prospective cohort design was carried out from January?June 2012. Methods The clinical course of each patient who received a new peripheral venous catheter for any cause in five Italian hospitals was followed by trained nurses until catheter removal. The presence of phlebitis was assessed every 24 hours using the Visual Infusion Phlebitis score. Analyses were based upon multilevel mixed-effects regression. Results The final sample consisted of 1498 patients. The average time for catheters in situ was 65·6 hours and 23·6% of the catheters were in place beyond 96 hours. Overall phlebitis incidence was 15·4%, 94·4% of which were grade 1. The likelihood of phlebitis independently increased with increasing catheter duration, being highest after 96 hours. Compared with patients with catheter placed in the dorsum of the hand (22·8% of the sample), those with the catheter located in the antecubital fossa (34·1%) or forearm were less likely to have a phlebitis of any grade. Conclusions Antecubital fossa and forearm veins may be preferential sites for peripheral venous cannulation. Our results support Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to replace catheters in adults no later than 96 hours. A relevant proportion of healthcare personnel did not adhere to such guidelines ? more attention to this issue is required.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims:? Hepatitis?C virus (HCV) diagnosis causes significant psychological stress and anxiety. We thought it would be important to illustrate the anxiety caused by HCV diagnosis in patients from the developing world. Methods:? This study was conducted at the Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, between February 2004 and April 2004. All patients who were recently diagnosed with HCV (those who tested positive to anti-HCV and HCV polymerase chain reaction) were given a questionnaire that compared stress due to HCV infection with four other variables, including death of a close family member, divorce, loss of source of income and move to another city. We also analyzed the anxiety level among these patients using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results:? We studied 98 patients and 100 healthy controls. Thirty-one (31.63%) patients who were diagnosed with HCV presented only with fatigue. Sixty-three (64.28%) patients admitted that diagnosis of HCV interfered with their daily life in some way. Among the newly diagnosed cases, 48 (48.97%) patients had moderate to severe anxiety (BAI Class B and C). Multi-logistic regression analysis showed that anxiety was related to HCV-related stress (P?<?0.002) and self-perceived severity of disease (P?<?0.001). HCV diagnosis was significantly more stressful than divorce (59.87 vs 70.95; P?<?0.013), loss of source of income (50.52 vs 70.80; P?<?0.001), and a move to another city (28.32 vs 70.80; P?<?0.001). Conclusions:? Diagnosis with HCV is reported to be more stressful than divorce, loss of source of income and a move to another city.

AB  - Abstract Counselling the parents following a diagnosis of fetal congenital heart disease (CHD) is as important a task for the fetal cardiologist, as the skill involved in achieving an accurate diagnosis. The counsellor will base prognosis not only on the diagnosis itself but also on the security of diagnosis, the stage in gestation and potential for change, the association with extracardiac malformations and the known results of treatment. Depending on the gestational age and legal situation the counsellor is operating in, termination of pregnancy may be one of the options to consider and one that should always be raised in discussion. Thus, the parents may be in the position of making a crucial decision concerning the management of the pregnancy on the basis of the information received, so it is vital that the counsellor is truly able to communicate with them, whatever be their level of understanding.

AB  - Summary Sleep disturbances are a hallmark feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have examined sleep quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), a technique able to detect subtle differences that polysomnography does not capture. We hypothesized that greater high-frequency qEEG would reflect ?hyperarousal? in combat veterans with PTSD (n?=?16) compared to veterans without PTSD (n?=?13). EEG power in traditional EEG frequency bands was computed for artifact-free sleep epochs across an entire night. Correlations were performed between qEEG and ratings of PTSD symptoms and combat exposure. The groups did not differ significantly in whole-night qEEG measures for either rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep. Non-significant medium effect sizes suggest less REM beta (opposite to our hypothesis), less REM and NREM sigma and more NREM gamma in combat veterans with PTSD. Positive correlations were found between combat exposure and NREM beta (PTSD group only), and REM and NREM sigma (non-PTSD group only). Results did not support global hyperarousal in PTSD as indexed by increased beta qEEG activity. The correlation of sigma activity with combat exposure in those without PTSD and the non-significant trend towards less sigma activity during both REM and NREM sleep in combat veterans with PTSD suggests that differential information processing during sleep may characterize combat-exposed military veterans with and without PTSD.

AB  - Summary Fusarium circinatum causes pitch canker disease in a wide range of pine trees, including Pinus radiata, with devastating economic consequences. To assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of growth of this pathogen in radiata pine, we examined the process of infection using both real-time PCR to quantify fungal biomass inside the plant host, and confocal microscopy using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain of F. circinatum. Pathogen growth exhibited three distinct phases: an initial exponential increase in fungal biomass, concomitant with pathogen colonization of the cortex and phloem; a slowdown in fungal growth coincident with sporulating hyphae deep within the host; and stabilization of the fungal biomass when the first wilting symptoms appeared. The number of resin ducts in the xylem was found to increase in response to infection and the fungus grew inside both constitutive and traumatic resin ducts. These results indicate that conidiation may contribute to the spatial or temporal dissemination of the pathogen. Moreover, the present findings raise the intriguing possibility that the generation of traumatic resin ducts may be of more benefit to the fungus than to the plant.

AB  - Abstract Based upon analyses of interview data collected from twenty-six clinician respondents, this study explores two facets of clinician uncertainty related to the diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. First, this study explores clinician reservations about the diagnostic validity of ADHD as it is described by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) in DSM IV. Second, this study explores clinician ambivalence regarding the physical and social-psychological side-effects of stimulant medications, such as Ritalin. In applying the sociological discussions that address uncertainty in clinical settings and through reviewing a sizable cross-section of the popular and research-oriented literature demonstrating the contentious nature of the ADHD phenomenon, this study illustrates that clinicians do not practice within a vacuum, but are instead largely affected by the marked scepticism that surrounds ADHD. In being affected by this scepticism, it is concluded that clinicians who assess and treat ADHD are autonomous in how they interpret the diagnostic and treatment protocols for this mental disorder.

AB  - Objective? To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported. Design? Retrospective/prospective study. Results? Nocardia spp infections were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable, from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1 entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured. Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion? Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of therapy leads to disease recurrence.

AB  - This study explored whether perceived distress from specific stressors during and after torture explain long-term complex post-traumatic symptoms of South Korean torture survivors. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of survivors who had been tortured by the homeland regime from the 1970s to the 2000s. Data from 206 survivors were gathered by key informants using target sampling and snowballing techniques. Project staff designed scales to encompass the specific types of stressors related to torture techniques used in Korea. Frequencies and distress ratings of exposure to torture, post-torture psychosocial stressors and physical damage related to torture were gathered. Psychological symptoms were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean version and subscales of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised-Korean version. Perceived distress from torture stressors was mainly divided into factors representing physical, psychological and deprivation torture by adapting a principal axis factor analysis. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that distress from psychological torture explained post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that distress from deprivation explained PTSD and anxiety after controlling for demographic variables, psychological preparedness, time span since torture and distress from trauma other than torture. Among post-torture stressors, distress from physical damage related to torture and social exclusion were strong indicators of complex symptoms.

AB  - Summary Despite the high levels of comorbidity between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sleep disturbance, little research has examined the predictors of insomnia and nightmares in this population. The current study tested both PTSD-specific (i.e. PTSD symptoms, comorbid anxiety and depression, nightmares and fear of sleep) and insomnia-specific (i.e. dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, insomnia-related safety behaviours and daily stressors) predictors of sleep quality, efficiency and nightmares in a sample of 30 individuals with PTSD. Participants participated in ecological momentary assessment to determine how daily changes in PTSD- and insomnia-related factors lead to changes in sleep. Multi-level modelling analyses indicated that, after accounting for baseline PTSD symptom severity, PTSD-specific factors were associated with insomnia symptoms, but insomnia-specific factors were not. Only daytime PTSD symptoms and fear of sleep predicted nightmares. Both sleep- and PTSD-related factors play a role in maintaining insomnia among those with PTSD, while nightmares seem to be linked more closely with only PTSD-related factors.
