AB  - Abstract Background: We report a multi-institutional experience with intravascular stenting (IS) for treatment of coarctation of the aorta. Methods and Results: Data was collected retrospectively by review of medical records from 17 institutions. The data was broken down to prior to 2002 and after 2002 for further analysis. A total of 565 procedures were performed with a median age of 15 years (mean = 18.1 years). Successful reduction in the post stent gradient (<20 mm Hg) or increase in post stent coarctation to descending aorta (DAo) ratio of >0.8 was achieved in 97.9% of procedures. There was significant improvement (P < 0.01) in pre versus post stent coarctation dimensions (7.4 mm ± 3.0 mm vs. 14.3 ± 3.2mm), systolic gradient (31.6 mm Hg ± 16.0 mm Hg vs. 2.7 mm Hg ± 4.2 mm Hg) and ratio of the coarctation segment to the DAo (0.43 ± 0.17 vs. 0.85 ± 0.15). Acute complications were encountered in 81/565 (14.3%) procedures. There were two procedure related deaths. Aortic wall complications included: aneurysm formation (n = 6), intimal tears (n = 8), and dissections (n = 9). The risk of aortic dissection increased significantly in patients over the age of 40 years. Technical complications included stent migration (n = 28), and balloon rupture (n = 13). Peripheral vascular complications included cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) (n = 4), peripheral emboli (n = 1), and significant access arterial injury (n = 13). Older age was significantly associated with occurrence of CVAs. A significant decrease in the technical complication rate from 16.3% to 6.1% (P < 0.001) was observed in procedures performed after January 2002. Conclusions: Stent placement for coarctation of aorta is an effective treatment option, though it remains a technically challenging procedure. Technical and aortic complications have decreased over the past 3 years due to, in part, improvement in balloon and stent design. Improvement in our ability to assess aortic wall compliance is essential prior to placement of ISs in older patients with coarctation of the aorta. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Aims To develop and validate a scoring method for assessing ?-amyloid precursor protein (APP) staining in cerebral white matter and to investigate the occurrence, amount and deposition pattern based on the cause of death in infants and young children. Methods Archival cerebral tissue was examined from a total of 176 cases (0 to 3 years of age). Each of the APP-stained sections was graded according to a simple scoring system based on the number and type of changes in eight anatomical regions. Results Examination of the sections revealed some degree of APP staining in 95% of the cases. The highest mean APP scores were found in cases of head trauma, and the lowest scores were found in the cases of drowning. APP staining, although sometimes minimal, was found in all 48 cases of and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Patterns of APP staining (the amount and distribution) were different in cases of head trauma, infection and SIDS but were similar in the SIDS and asphyxia groups. Conclusion This study demonstrates the use of an integrated scoring system that was developed to assess APP staining in the brain. APP staining was seen in a high proportion of cases, including relatively sudden deaths. The amount of APP was significantly higher in cases of trauma than in nontraumatic deaths. However, APP was detected within all groups. The pattern of APP staining was similar in infants who had died of SIDS and from mechanical asphyxia.

AB  - Abstract Advanced therapies such as bioengineered skin substitutes (BSS) and dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) have been shown to promote healing of chronic diabetic ulcers. An interim analysis of data from 60 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel group, multi-centre clinical trial showed that dHACM (EpiFix?, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, GA) is superior to standard wound care (SWC) and BSS (Apligraf?, Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA) in achieving complete wound closure within 4?6 weeks. Rates and time to closure at a longer time interval and factors influencing outcomes remained unassessed; therefore, the study was continued in order to achieve at least 100 patients. With the larger cohort, we compare clinical outcomes at 12 weeks in 100 patients with chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers treated with weekly applications of Apligraf (n = 33), EpiFix (n = 32) or SWC (n = 35) with collagen-alginate dressing as controls. A Cox regression was performed to analyse the time to heal within 12 weeks, adjusting for all significant covariates. A Kaplan?Meier analysis was conducted to compare time-to-heal within 12 weeks for the three treatment groups. Clinical characteristics were well matched across study groups. The proportion of wounds achieving complete closure within the 12-week study period were 73% (24/33), 97% (31/32), and 51% (18/35) for Apligraf, EpiFix and SWC, respectively (adjusted P = 0·00019). Subjects treated with EpiFix had a very significant higher probability of their wounds healing [hazard ratio (HR: 5·66; adjusted P: 1·3 x 10?7] compared to SWC alone. No difference in probability of healing was observed for the Apligraf and SWC groups. Patients treated with Apligraf were less likely to heal than those treated with EpiFix [HR: 0·30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·17?0·54; unadjusted P: 5·8 x 10?5]. Increased wound size and presence of hypertension were significant factors that influenced healing. Mean time-to-heal within 12 weeks was 47·9 days (95% CI: 38·2?57·7) with Apligraf, 23·6 days (95% CI: 17·0?30·2) with EpiFix group and 57·4 days (95%CI: 48·2?66·6) with the SWC alone group (adjusted P = 3·2 x 10?7). Median number of grafts used per healed wound were six (range 1?13) and 2·5 (range 1?12) for the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, respectively. Median graft cost was $8918 (range $1,486?19,323) per healed wound for the Apligraf group and $1,517 (range $434?25,710) per healed wound in the EpiFix group (P?<?0·0001). These results provide further evidence of the clinical and resource utilisation superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic wounds.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU). A population-based cohort study involving 1018 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n?=?865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n?=?147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n?=?110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n?=?37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p?<?0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR?=?7.279, 95% CI: 1.299?40.784, p?<?0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p?<?0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR?=?4.554, 95% CI: 3.14?5.12, p?<?0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C?>?1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) uses x-ray beams and reconstructive computer technology to create tomographic slices (sections) of the area being imaged. Computed tomography has higher contrast resolution than conventional radiography allowing for more accurate differentiation of soft tissues and fluids. This form of 3D imaging removes problems caused by superimposition of multiple anatomical structures, which is a major impediment when viewing radiographs of the equine head. Once the images are acquired, multi-planar and 3D reconstructions can be performed to view different teeth or associated structures in an optimal way. Anatomical and pathological changes in the dental tissues, periodontal tissues, alveolar bone and adjacent sinuses can then be assessed. Scintigraphy with 99m technetium methyl-diphosphate (methylene-diphosphonate) can detect changes in bone that precede radiographic changes, and this makes it a very useful imaging modality for diagnosis of early periapical infection of the equine cheek teeth. Additionally, it is invaluable for imaging suspected infections of supernumerary or dysplastic teeth where the results of radiography or even CT may be equivocal. Periapical infections of the cheek teeth typically result in focal and intense increased radionuclide uptake located over the apical region of the affected tooth.

This chapter focuses on the complex matters and provides some guidance about developing or selecting strategies for change and ensuring they match the characteristics of the innovation, target groups and setting to create the most effective intervention possible. Systematic and rigorous methods are needed to enhance the linkage between identified barriers and change strategies. The chapter explores several of such methods. In order to select the best strategy for the change at hand, it is recommended to supplement the problem analyses with the use of scientific literature on effective change in patient care.

AB  - Aims To verify the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravesical administration of 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride compared to its oral administration for treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in a randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, multi-center trial in 35 adult patients. Methods NDO was confirmed within the previous 24 months by urodynamic studies (UDS). Group 1 (n?=?18) received 10?ml 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride intravesically three times per day and group 2 (n?=?17) 5?mg oxybutynin hydrochloride orally three times per day for a period of 28 days. Primary efficacy criterion was the change in the maximum bladder capacity between the beginning of the study and after 4 weeks as assessed by UDS. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) were collected and an evaluation of anticholinergic effects was conducted. Results The increase in maximum bladder capacity was 117?ml with intravesical application (P?=?0.0002) versus 18?ml with the oral application (P?=?0.51). The difference was statistically significant (P?=?0.0086). ADR were reported by 10 (55.6%) of patients with intravesical administration, and by 14 (82.4%) of patients with oral administration. Significant differences in favor of the intravesical application were observed in ADR affecting vision (1/10 vs. 9/14), gastrointestinal tract (8/10 vs. 14/14), nervous system (2/10 vs. 8/14), and skin and subcutis (1/10 vs. 6/14). No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Conclusions This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of intravesical 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride in the treatment of NDO with respect to the increase in maximum bladder capacity. Neurourol.

AB  - Neuropsychological evaluation of persons with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) symptoms is complicated by multiple factors. The authors explored the impact of mechanism of injury, effort testing performance, and neuropsychiatric status in a sample of military veterans (V-TBI) and civilians (C-TBI) with chronic TBI. V-TBI (n?=?74), C-TBI (n?=?67), and healthy civilian control (C-HC) participants (n?=?66), completed a battery of neuropsychological, effort, and self-report neuropsychiatric measures. Results indicated that C-HC and C-TBI participants exhibited comparably low failure rates on effort tests (6% and 3%, respectively). V-TBI participants exhibited significantly higher rates of failure (18%). Subgroups (n?=?20) of effort-screened participants matched for demographics and disability level were compared regarding neuropsychological performance and neuropsychiatric self-report. Both TBI groups exhibited limited neuropsychological impairment, relative to the C-HC participants. The V-TBI group exhibited pronounced neuropsychiatric symptomology compared with the other participant groups. The implications of these findings are discussed for evaluation in the context of disability and litigation. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - With an increasing instance of traumatic brain injury and little advancement over recent decades in the rehabilitation of brain injury survivors and their family members, focus has shifted toward the establishment of effective whole-family resilience promotion interventions. Using the Brain Injury Family Intervention as a model, clinicians constructed two curriculum-based interventions grounded in resilience theory and drawing from the interdisciplinary approaches of neuropsychology and marriage and family therapy: (a) the Resilience and Adjustment Intervention, for individual survivors of traumatic brain jury, and (b) the Therapeutic Couples Intervention, designed to increase relational satisfaction in couples following a traumatic brain injury. The present study outlines the need for the integration of resilience tenets into rehabilitation techniques, summarizes the empirical justification for the use of an interdisciplinary approach, and offers an overview with implementation specifics regarding these two newly designed interventions.

AB  - ?Thinking a lot? (TAL)?also referred to as ?thinking too much??is a key complaint in many cultural contexts, and the current article profiles this idiom of distress among Cambodian refugees. The article also proposes a general model of how TAL generates various types of distress that then cause PTSD-type psychopathology, a model we refer to as the TAL?PTSD model. As tested in this Cambodian refugee sample, the model is supported by the following: (1) the close connection of TAL to PTSD as shown by odds ratio (OR = 19.6), correlation (r = .86), and factor loading; and (2) the mediation of most of the effect of TAL on PTSD by TAL-caused somatic symptoms, catastrophic cognitions, trauma recall, insomnia, and irritability. The questionnaire used in the present study is provided and can be used to examine TAL in other cultural and global contexts to advance the study of this commonly encountered distress form.

AB  - Background:? Axis I psychiatric disorders (PD) and substance use disorders (SUD) are common in prison, but only few studies have focused on their association in this setting. Dual diagnosis (DD) (the co-occurrence of a SUD and any axis I disorder) is known to have a poorer prognosis and to require more intense supportive care. Objectives:? The objectives of this study were (1) to describe prisoners with DD (prevalence and characteristics); (2) to compare DD prisoners with 3 other groups of prisoners: no diagnosis (ND), SUD alone, or other isolated PD; and (3) to evaluate the impact of DD on suicide risk in prison. Method:? A random stratified strategy was used to select 23 various types of prisons and 998 prisoners. Diagnoses were assessed using a unique procedure, each prisoner being evaluated by 2 psychiatrists, 1 junior, using a structured interview (MINI 5 plus), and 1 senior, using an open clinical interview. Following interviews, clinicians met to establish a list of diagnoses. Cloninger?s temperament and character inventory was also used. Results:? Of the prisoners, 26.3% had a DD. DD prevalence was almost 80% in prisoners with SUD, while only one-third of the prisoners with an axis I PD had co-morbid SUD. No significant differences were observed in drug use patterns between DD and SUD without co-morbid PDs. DD showed the strongest association with suicide risk [OR?=?5.7 (1.7?4.6)]. Conclusion:? DD is very frequent in prison and is a major risk factor for suicide. Systematic psychiatric/SUD screening of prisoners with either a SUD or an axis I PD should be encouraged.

AB  - Severe Traumatic brain injury (sTBI) often instigates widespread long-lasting disability and is accompanied by extensive rehabilitation. Unsurprisingly, sTBI also holds malignant consequences for patients? close relatives. The burden caused by the injury and its severity explains some of the ramifications for the relatives. Additionally, some findings demonstrate that patients with sTBI and their relatives develop posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, although the link between PTS symptoms and physical and mental health is well-documented in literature, the effect of PTS symptoms on relatives of patients with sTBI has barely been examined. This study examines the influence of PTS symptoms of patients with sTBI and their relatives on the physical and mental health and functioning of the relatives. Patients who sustained a severe sTBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale of the head region > 3) and close relatives were included in a multi-center, prospective cohort study (TRAST-MI). One-hundred patients and their relatives were assessed at 2, 6, and 12 months post injury. Outcome variables included health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as emotional, cognitive, interpersonal, and total functioning (PCRS). Relatives? physical health was predicted by relatives? PTS symptoms (Slope=?1.76; p = .043), and mental health was predicted by both patients? (Slope=?2.77; p = .034) and relatives? (Slope=?6.59; p < .001) PTS symptoms. Functioning level was only predicted by patients? PTS symptoms (Slope=?.25; p<.001). The findings emphasize that TBI should be considered a comprehensive traumatic experience reaching further than mere physical damage to the brain and its direct consequences, affecting the injured individual and close relatives.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To examine the prospective associations among peer victimization and somatic symptoms across 5 years of adolescence using multiple informants and disaggregating effects at the within-person and between-person level. Methods From age 13?17 years, 612 Canadian children (54% girls; 76% White) completed measures of peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Parents (89% mothers) reported on their child's somatic symptoms. We built autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals, controlling for diagnosed medical and psychiatric conditions, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results Within-person, self-reported somatic symptoms were stable across time and there were bidirectional associations between peer victimization and somatic symptoms across the 5-year period. The magnitude of effect was strongest from somatic symptoms to peer victimization. Between-person, being a girl or having a psychiatric diagnosis predicted higher mean levels and rising trajectories of somatic symptoms and higher mean levels of peer victimization. The level of peer victimization among non-White participants increased over time. In the parent-reported model, somatic symptoms were less stable and did not predict peer victimization. Conclusions The results highlight the dynamic processes between peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Increased effort is needed to protect adolescents with psychiatric problems, girls, and ethnic minorities from peer abuse.

AB  - Background The prognostic value of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in dogs after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear. Objectives Determine whether MRI findings are associated with prognosis after TBI in dogs. Animals Fifty client-owned dogs. Methods Retrospective study of dogs with TBI that underwent 1.5T MRI within 14 days after head trauma. MRI evaluators were blinded to the clinical presentation, and all images were scored based on an MRI grading system (Grade I [normal brain parenchyma] to Grade VI [bilateral lesions affecting the brainstem with or without any lesions of lesser grade]). Skull fractures, percentage of intraparenchymal lesions, degree of midline shift, and type of brain herniation were evaluated. MGCS was assessed at presentation. The presence of seizures was recorded. Outcome was assessed at 48 h (alive or dead) and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results Sixty-six percent of the dogs had abnormal MRI findings. MRI grade was negatively correlated (P < .001) with MGCS. A significant negative correlation of MRI grade, degree of midline shift, and percentage of intraparenchymal lesions with follow-up scores was identified. The MGCS was lower in dogs with brain herniation (P = .0191). Follow-up scores were significantly lower in dogs that had brain herniation or skull fractures. The possibility of having seizures was associated with higher percentage of intraparenchymal lesions (P = 0.0054) and 10% developed PTE. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Significant associations exist between MRI findings and prognosis in dogs with TBI. MRI can help to predict prognosis in dogs with TBI.

AB  - Summary The physiological derangements that are frequently witnessed in the heartbeating brainstem-dead multiorgan donor are a result of both the adverse somatic consequences of treatment strategies for acute catastrophic brain injury as well as the well-described and specific consequences of brainstem ischaemia. The latter include diabetes insipidus, hypothermia, cardiovascular instability, neurogenic pulmonary oedema and systemic inflammation, and together they jeopardise the donation potential of the brainstem-dead donor. Donor management protocols are designed to help clinical staff detect and reverse these various derangements and require a continuation, and on occasion escalation, of physiological monitoring and support on the intensive-care unit. By increasing the number and quality of organs that are available for transplantation, physiological optimisation more completely fulfils the altruistic gift being made by the donor and their family, and should therefore be seen as an important component of the donor's end of life care.

AB  - Abstract ?? Introduction ?? Classifying TBI -? Clinical injury severity -? Focal injury or diffuse injury ?? Clinical characteristics -? Coma, confusion and subacute impairments -? Imaging TBI -? Focal and diffuse TBI: separate entities? ?? Pathophysiological mechanisms of focal injury -? The essentials: glutamate and Ca2+ ?? Pathophysiological mechanisms of diffuse injury -? A heterogeneous cascade of changes -? After axonal disconnection ?? Conclusions Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent and clinically highly heterogeneous neurological disorder with large socioeconomic consequences. TBI severity classification, based on the hospital admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ranges from mild (GCS 13?15) and moderate (GCS 9?12) to severe (GCS ≤ 8). The GCS reflects the risk of dying from TBI, which is low after mild (?1%), intermediate after moderate (up to 15%) and high (up to 40%) after severe TBI. Intracranial damage can be focal, such as epidural and subdural haematomas and parenchymal contusions, or diffuse, for example traumatic axonal injury and diffuse cerebral oedema, although this distinction is somewhat arbitrary. Study of the cellular and molecular post-traumatic processes is essential for the understanding of TBI pathophysiology but even more to find therapeutic targets for the development of neuroprotective drugs to be eventually used in human beings. To date, studies in vitro and in vivo, mainly in animals but also in human beings, are unravelling the pathological TBI mechanisms at high pace. Nevertheless, TBI pathophysiology is all but completely elucidated. Neuroprotective treatment studies in human beings have been disappointing thus far and have not resulted in commonly accepted drugs. This review presents an overview on the clinical aspects and the pathophysiology of focal and diffuse TBI, and it highlights several acknowledged important events that occur on molecular and cellular level after TBI.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Infratentorial tumour site and health-related quality of life (HRQL) 1 month after diagnosis have been shown to predict HRQL 1 year after diagnosis in children with brain tumours. This study aimed to identify additional early child-related determinants of parent- and child-report HRQL. Methods Longitudinal prospective study. Semi-structured interviews took place approximately 1 and 12 months after diagnosis. HRQL was measured using the self- and parent-report Pediatric Quality of Life Scales (PedsQL 4.0) Total Scale Score and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) multi-attribute utility function. Child variables included performance and verbal IQ, general memory, selective attention executive function, behaviour problems, adaptive behaviour, symptoms of depression and anxiety and event related anxiety. Univariate analyses were used to identify potential early predictors of HRQL. Regression analysis was then used to identify the most important determinants of HRQL at 1 year. Results Thirty-five patients completed the 12-month interviews. Multivariate analysis showed infratentorial tumour site remained an important determinant of HRQL 1 year after diagnosis. Infratentorial tumour site and selective attention at 1 month generally best predicted poor self- and parent-report HRQL at 12 months. Adaptive behaviour and performance IQ may be important. Conclusion Selective attention and infratentorial tumour site are most important in predicting both parent- and self-report HRQL at 1 year after diagnosis. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. Cognitive remediation or/and pharmacological intervention, particularly aimed at children with infratentorial tumours may improve attention and subsequently HRQL and both merit further investigation.
