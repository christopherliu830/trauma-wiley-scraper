AB  - Abstract Objectives Infratentorial tumour site and health-related quality of life (HRQL) 1 month after diagnosis have been shown to predict HRQL 1 year after diagnosis in children with brain tumours. This study aimed to identify additional early child-related determinants of parent- and child-report HRQL. Methods Longitudinal prospective study. Semi-structured interviews took place approximately 1 and 12 months after diagnosis. HRQL was measured using the self- and parent-report Pediatric Quality of Life Scales (PedsQL 4.0) Total Scale Score and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) multi-attribute utility function. Child variables included performance and verbal IQ, general memory, selective attention executive function, behaviour problems, adaptive behaviour, symptoms of depression and anxiety and event related anxiety. Univariate analyses were used to identify potential early predictors of HRQL. Regression analysis was then used to identify the most important determinants of HRQL at 1 year. Results Thirty-five patients completed the 12-month interviews. Multivariate analysis showed infratentorial tumour site remained an important determinant of HRQL 1 year after diagnosis. Infratentorial tumour site and selective attention at 1 month generally best predicted poor self- and parent-report HRQL at 12 months. Adaptive behaviour and performance IQ may be important. Conclusion Selective attention and infratentorial tumour site are most important in predicting both parent- and self-report HRQL at 1 year after diagnosis. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. Cognitive remediation or/and pharmacological intervention, particularly aimed at children with infratentorial tumours may improve attention and subsequently HRQL and both merit further investigation.

AB  - Background:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have gained popularity in colonic surgery. Hospital stay has been reduced dramatically as a result, but remains varied in the published literature. We were interested in investigating the factors that influence hospital stay in an ERAS setting. Methods:?? Between October 2005 and November 2008 prospective data were collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resection, without a stoma, at a single site. Patients were managed within an ERAS program. Patients unable to communicate in English, with dementia or ASA >4 were excluded. Variables were tested using the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman's two tailed correlation table for continuous data. Cox regression analysis was used for modelling. Results:?? 102 patients were included. There were 57 right sided, 43 left sided and 2 total colectomies. Mean age was 66?years (95% CI, 40?88). Median day stay was 4?days (range 3?46). Indications for surgery were: malignancy (80%), diverticular disease (13%) and other (7%). Age, operation site, ASA, indication for surgery and BMI were not significant predictors of hospital stay. Factors with the strongest correlation for reduced day stay were Cr-Possum score (p = 0.006), female sex (p = 0.013), laparoscopic (n = 6) and transverse (n = 32) incisions (p < 0.001), and the operating surgeon (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression modeling, surgeon and patient gender could be eliminated as independent predictors of day stay. The other two factors added significant strength to the model. Conclusion:?? Choice of incision and Cr-POSSUM score are independent predictors of day stay in the ERAS setting.

Abstract:? Introduction:? Recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand IgG fusion protein, rPSGL-Ig (YSPSL), a fusion protein of human P-selectin ligand and IgG1-Fc, blocks leukocyte adhesion and protects against ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in animal models. Patients and Methods:? This randomized 15-center, double-blind, 59-patient Ph2a study assessed YSPSL?s safety in recipients of deceased-donor kidney allografts and its potential efficacy in improving early graft function. Two doses and two dosing modalities were evaluated. Results:? No drug-specific toxicities or increased adverse event rates were noted. Two YSPSL-treated patients died of causes determined as unrelated to study drug. YSPSL did not reduce the incidence of dialysis within the first week post-transplant (41% in treated vs. 20% in placebo patients). Renal function endpoints scored at post-operative days 1 & 2 were also not impacted by YSPSL. However, at day 5, the fraction of patients with serum creatinine above 6?mg/dL was lower in the YSPSL vs. placebo group (26% vs. 55%, p?=?0.043). Large variations in the dialysis-delayed graft function (DGF) rates were observed between centers, independently of treatment assignment, indicating subjectivity of this endpoint. Conclusion:? In this first Ph2a study in kidney transplantation, YSPSL was safe but did not impact the dialysis-DGF rate. Further studies with more objective efficacy endpoints are required to define the impact of YSPSL on early renal allograft function.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims:? There is a paucity of literature regarding the clinical profile of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in children. The aims of this retrospective study were to determine the etiology and clinical presentation, and to present our experience in diagnosing CP in children in China. Methods:? Clinical data of children who were treated for CP at Changhai Hospital from January 1997 to August 2006 were reviewed. Results:? A total of 427 CP patients presented to our center. There were 42 (9.8%) children with CP, including 21 males and 21 females, with a mean age of 11.7?years at the first onset. The main etiological factor was idiopathic (73.8%). Of the patients, 78.5% had episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain and 54.8% had multiple (≥?4) episodes. The mean duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis was 41.6?months and a definite diagnosis was not made until 2?years later in 57.1% of these patients. The positive rates of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for detecting ductal changes and intraductal stones or pancreatic calcification were 51.4% and 45.4%, 71.4% and 87.5%, 80.0% and 61.5%, respectively. Conclusion:? The main etiological factor of Chinese children with CP is idiopathic. The main symptom in these patients is multiple episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain, which often lead to a delay in the definite diagnosis. CT and MRCP (or MRI) should be used as the first investigation in the evaluation of these cases.

AB  - ABSTRACT Purpose Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are widely used for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although without strong evidence base. With substantial numbers of veterans returning from Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts with PTSD, it is important to characterize the extent of SGA use and identify associated factors. Methods We determined time trends and patient characteristics associated with the use of SGAs in veterans with PTSD, without comorbid schizophrenia or bipolar disorders, using the Department of Veterans Affairs national administrative data 2003?2010. Results Among 732?085 veterans with PTSD, 27.6% received an intentional trial of an SGA in 2003?2010. The annual number treated with SGAs almost doubled (45?268 to 84?197, p?<?0.001), while prescribing rates decreased (28.6% to 21.5%, p?<?0.001). In multivariate analyses, African Americans (odds ratio (OR)?=?1.07, 95%confidence interval (CI)?=?1.06?1.09) and Hispanics (OR?= 1.13, 95%CI?=?1.10?1.17) were more likely to receive SGAs than Whites. Strongest clinical associations were with prior diagnosis of depression (OR?=?1.96; 95%CI?=?1.94?1.99), substance use disorders (OR?=?1.86; 95%CI?=?1.84?1.88), and other anxiety disorders (OR?=?1.27; 95%CI?=?1.26?1.29) (all p???<?0.0001) as well as cardiovascular risk factors. Veterans previously deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan had lower likelihood of SGA receipt. Substantial regional differences were demonstrated (South?>?Northeast; Midwest and West?<?Northeast; p?<?0.0001); regional administrative units (veterans integrated service networks) contributed minimally to regional differences. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress disorder population growth is driving substantial increases in SGA use. Decreasing rates of the Department of Veterans Affairs prescribing may be due to integrated system-wide mechanisms (e.g., national practice guidelines), although regional variations remain prominent. These analyses provide foundational steps for identifying modifiable provider-level and organization-level determinants of SGA prescription in this growing population. Published 2013.

AB  - Summary Background Previous studies investigating factors associated with survival following endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursa are limited. Objectives To investigate the factors associated with survival in horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated endoscopically and to describe the bacterial isolates involved in the synovial infections. Study design Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Methods Medical records from 128 horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated by endoscopic lavage at seven equine hospitals were reviewed. A follow-up questionnaire was used to determine survival and return to athletic performance. Descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards survival models were used to determine factors associated with survival. Results Horses underwent one (n = 107), two (n = 19), or three (n = 2) surgeries. Survival to hospital discharge was 84.4%. Univariable survival analysis revealed that administration of systemic antimicrobials prior to referral was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.18?0.91, P = 0.03). Increased mortality was associated with bone fracture/osteomyelitis (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.12?5.26, P = 0.03), tendon involvement (≥30% cross sectional area) (HR 3.78 95% CI 1.78?8.04, P = 0.001), duration of general anaesthesia (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00?1.02, P = 0.04), post-operative synoviocentesis (HR 3.18, 95% CI 1.36?7.43, P = 0.006) and post-operative wound dehiscence (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.08?5.65, P = 0.04). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed reduced mortality after systemic antimicrobial administration prior to referral (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11?0.60, P = 0.002) and increased mortality with tendinous involvement (≥30% cross-sectional area) (HR 7.92, 95% CI 3.31?19.92, P<0.001). At follow-up (median 30 months, range 0.25?13 years, n = 70) 87.1% horses were alive, 7.1% had been euthanised due to the calcaneal injury and 5.7% had been euthanised for unrelated reasons. From 57 horses with athletic performance follow-up, 91.2% returned to the same/higher level of exercise, 5.3% to a lower level and 3.5% were retired due to persistent lameness of the affected limb. Main limitations Retrospective study and incomplete follow-up. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae has an 84% survival rate to hospital discharge. Tendinous involvement reduced survival whilst systemic antimicrobials administration prior to referral improved survival.

AB  - Abstract Background Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a worse prognosis than individuals with BPD alone. A common view is that the emotional instability and impulsivity of BPD should be treated before attempting to address trauma. However, PTSD symptoms may interfere with patients' ability to benefit from such ?stabilizing? treatments. Methods The effect of BPD?PTSD comorbidity on self-harm and BPD symptom outcomes was evaluated in 89 patients receiving dialectical behaviour therapy, using multilevel modelling. Results Patients with comorbid BPD?PTSD showed a trend towards elevated BPD symptoms throughout the treatment year (??=?2.12, 95% CI?=??0.21?4.44, p?=?0.07). There was a three-way interaction between PTSD comorbidity, treatment completion and time, whereby PTSD comorbidity was associated with less reduction in self-harm frequency over time, but only in those completing the full 12?months of treatment (incident risk ratio?=?1.16, 95% CI?=?1.04?1.30, p?<?0.01). Conclusion Patients with comorbid PTSD had a poorer outcome from dialectical behaviour therapy than those with BPD alone, possibly because of the negative impact of unaddressed trauma. The results provide further grounds for recently developed treatments targeting BPD traits and PTSD symptoms simultaneously. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A mixed breed dog presented with diffuse unilateral hind limb swelling, which ultrasound and cytology confirmed to be caused by severe haematoma formation. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography allowed distinct visualisation of an anomalous segment of the proximal popliteal artery, the presumed origin of the self-sustaining haematoma. Histopathology classified the malformed vessel as a haemangioendothelioma, a neoplasia of intermediate malignancy. Considering this as differential diagnosis to a neoplastic vascular alteration of high malignancy (such as haemangiosarcoma) might alter choice of treatment in future cases with similar clinical and imaging findings.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Patients with co-occurring substance use and other mental disorders are vulnerable to crime victimization, yet no evidence-based preventive interventions exist. Our aim was to test the efficacy of a new intervention, Self-wise, Other-wise, Streetwise training (SOS training), to prevent victimization in these dual-diagnosis patients as an add-on to care as usual. Design Multi-site single-blind parallel randomized controlled trial. Setting Three sites within one psychiatric service in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants Adult in-patients and out-patients with dual diagnosis (n = 250), who were predominantly male (70.4%), aged on average 42.1 years, and diagnosed with 3.7 DSM-IV disorders. Intervention and comparator Care as usual, consisting of pharmacotherapy combined with individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy and/or supportive counselling (n = 125) was compared with care as usual plus SOS training: a 6-week, 12-session manualized group training focused on enhancing emotion regulation skills, conflict resolution skills and street skills (n = 125). Measurements Victimization was assessed with the Safety Monitor, the Dutch equivalent of the International Crime Victims Survey, in a face-to-face assessment. The primary outcome measure was treatment response (yes/no), with ?yes? defined as reporting at least a 50% reduction in the number of past-year victimization incidents at the 14-month follow-up compared with baseline. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Findings The proportion of participants achieving treatment response for total victimization was 54.0% in the control group and 67.6% in the experimental group, a significant difference [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02?3.11, P = 0.042]. Treatment response for violent victimization was achieved by 68.7% of the control group and 79.3% of the experimental group (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 0.91?3.34, P = 0.092). With a Bayes factor of 2.26, this result was inconclusive. Conclusions Among dual-diagnosis patients, care as usual plus Self-wise, Other-wise, Streetwise training was more effective in preventing victimization than care as usual alone.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To present a clinical case of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), differential diagnoses, selected treatments, and the pathology involved. Data sources: An Ovid data base search (covering 635 medical, neurologic, and psychiatric journals) was conducted using the search term RBD and limited to the years 2005?2009. This search strategy was used to locate clinical, research, and review articles providing the state of the science about RBD. A hand search was also conducted for seminal research papers as well as recent publications within the specialty of sleep disorders. Conclusions: RBD is a parasomnia with symptoms common to other disorders making it important to identify unique symptoms and diagnostic testing that helps differentiates these diseases. RBD can put the patient and the bed partner at risk for injury. Its prevalence is estimated to be 0.5% in older adults. Implications for practice: Nurse practitioners are primary care providers for older adults who may have complaints about behaviors associated with RBD. Knowledge of this disease process as well as its relationship with four other neurodegenerative diseases may provide an opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment of RBD and surveillance for and early diagnosis of the other neurodegenerative diseases in these patients.

AB  - A taxonomy of alcohol problem involvement is proposed which encompasses categorical and dimensional approaches to classification. It is argued that contemporary nosology such as that described in DSM or ICD cannot, in principle, yield discrete categories containing homogeneous membership. Nor does current classification and diagnosis yield sufficient specific information necessary for effective treatment. These limitations are not resolvable by additional empirical research; rather, as discussed herein, a new conceptual framework and focus are required. The proposed new taxonomy comprises the first step in developing a comprehensive and clinically useful method for characterizing the alcohol consuming population.

AB  - Each year, exposure to violent trauma takes its toll on the development of millions of children. When their trauma goes unaddressed, children are at greater risk for school failure; anxiety and depression and other post-traumatic disorders; alcohol and drug abuse, and, later in life, engaging in violence similar to that to which they were originally exposed. In spite of the serious psychiatric/developmental sequelae of violence exposure, the majority of severely and chronically traumatized children and youth are not found in mental health clinics. Instead, they typically are seen as the ?trouble-children? in schools or emerge in the child protective, law enforcement, substance abuse treatment, and criminal justice systems, where the root of their problems in exposure to violence and abuse is typically not identified or addressed. Usually, providers in all of these diverse service systems have not been sufficiently trained to know and identify the traumatic origins of the children's presenting difficulties and are not sufficiently equipped to assist with their remediation. This multiplicity of traumatic manifestations outside the mental health setting leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are dealing with a supra-clinical problem that can only be resolved by going beyond the child's individual clinical needs to enlist a range of coordinated services for the child and the family. This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of violent traumatization and will (a) describe the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the opportunities for, as well as the barriers to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.

AB  - Abstract Using a quasi-experimental design, this study examined the effectiveness of a standardized intervention model designed to build resiliency in children of women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders and histories of interpersonal abuse. The children and mothers who participated in this study were a subset of the sample used for the Women, Co-occurring Disorders and Violence Study (WCDVS). The children's intervention model consisted of three components: clinical assessment, service coordination and advocacy, and a psychoeducational skills-building group. Children in the comparison group received individual, group, and family services. Six-month and 12-month outcomes were examined among 253 children. Children in the intervention group improved significantly more than children in the comparison group. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comm Psychol 35: 823?843, 2007.

AB  - Summary Chronic venous disease is a common disorder associated with a variety of symptoms in later disease stages but also with complications such as venous leg ulcer. This, in turn, has substantial socioeconomic effects and significantly impacts patients? quality of life. While there are a number of diagnostic procedures available, color-flow duplex ultrasound has become the gold standard. As regards therapeutic options, major advances have been made in recent decades. Today, there are alternatives to saphenofemoral ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein, including endovenous thermal ablation techniques. However, treatment selection continues to depend on many factors such as individual anatomical circumstances and disease stage. The following article provides an overview of the anatomy and pathophysiology as well as current diagnostic and therapeutic standards.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.
