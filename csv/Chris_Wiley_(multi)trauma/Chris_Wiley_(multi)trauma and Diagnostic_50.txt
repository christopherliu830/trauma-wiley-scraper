AB  - Abstract Periodontal diseases have been recognized and treated for at least 5000?years. Clinicians have recognized for many years that there are apparent differences in the presentation of periodontal diseases and have attempted to classify these diseases. Systems of classifications of disease have arisen allowing clinicians to develop structures which can be used to identify diseases in relation to aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment. It allows us to organize effective treatment of our patients? diseases. Once a disease has been diagnosed and classified, the aetiology of the condition and appropriate evidence-based treatment is suggested to the clinician. Common systems of classification also allow effective communication between health care professionals using a common language. Early attempts at classification were made on the basis of the clinical characteristics of the diseases or on theories of their aetiology. These attempts were unsupported by any evidence base. As scientific knowledge expanded, conventional pathology formed the basis of classification. More recently, this has been followed by systems of classification based upon our knowledge of the various periodontal infections and the host response to them. Classification of periodontal diseases has, however, proved problematic. Over much of the last century clinicians and researchers have grappled with the problem and have assembled periodically to review or develop the classification of the various forms of periodontal disease as research has expanded our knowledge of these diseases. This has resulted in frequent revisions and changes. A classification, however, should not be regarded as a permanent structure. It must be adaptable to change and evolve with the development of new knowledge. It is expected that systems of classification will change over time. This review examines the past and present classifications of the periodontal diseases.

AB  - SUMMARY Recently it has been demonstrated that the CD14 molecule which is expressed on monocytes and macrophages serves as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bound to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and thus mediates LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production. Here we report that CD14 is found as a soluble (s) molecule in serum. In healthy volunteers sCD14 levels (mean ± s.e.m.) were 3.7±0.05 ?g/ml (n= 30, 25?50 years of age) as determined by ELISA (detection limit 20 ?g/ml serum) using two monoclonal antibodies in a sandwich technique. In polytraumatized patients (n= 16) significantly decreased levels (1.7 ± 0.3) were detected immediately after the trauma, which increased to 4.9±0.3 ?g/ml within the first 6 days post trauma. sCD14 remained elevated during the first 14 days post trauma in patients with the most severe injuries (injury severity score > 45 points), whereas a return to normal levels was observed in patients with an injury score of < 45 points. In addition, the levels of the high-density lipoproteins that partially inactivate free endotoxin are significantly decreased post trauma. No correlation between parameters of inflammation (C3a and neopterin levels, leucocyte counts, amount of band cells), liver function and sCD14 levels was established. Comparable to polytraumatized patients, increased sCD14 serum levels were observed in five patients with burn trauma (burned area > 35%) within the second week post trauma when clinical signs of septicaemia were evident.

AB  - Summary Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for several diseases of the aging brain, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While advancing age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, onset and progression can be strongly influenced by genetics, comorbid conditions, and environmental exposures. Cumulative subconcussive blows, such as those sustained in amateur or professional contact sports, may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite gaps in knowledge, the Committee on Long Term Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of studies, that there was sufficient evidence to support an association between severe TBI and dementia, and a ?suggestive? association between moderate TBI and dementia.

AB  - Abstract Background Women are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men. Limited research exists evaluating the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) among military women with PTSD. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using US Department of Defense (DoD) data comprised of all active-duty women giving birth to their first, liveborn singleton infant using DoD-sponsored health insurance from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008 (n = 34 176). Birth hospitalisation records, maternal mental health visits, and Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) and Reassessment (PDHRA) screenings were included. The HDP outcome (yes vs no) was defined using ICD-9-CM codes in the maternal birth hospitalisation record. Women fit into one of four PTSD exposure categories (confirmed, probable, possible, none). Confirmed cases had a PTSD ICD-9-CM diagnosis code. Probable/possible cases were classified using PDHA screening items. We used multiple log-linear regression to assess PTSD (confirmed, any vs none) and the risk of HDP overall, and then explored effect modification by military service and demographic variables. We assessed the risk of HDP among deployed mothers with PTSD (confirmed, probable/possible vs none) who completed a PDHA, and explored effect modification by race/ethnicity. We also assessed risk of HDP with differing PTSD lead times. Results Overall, PTSD was not associated with HDP except among mothers whose PTSD was diagnosed ≥1 year prior to conception (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06, 1.90). Conclusions Post-traumatic stress disorder preceding conception by at least a year appeared to confer an increased risk of HDP, but further research is needed using more thorough PTSD assessment.

AB  - Summary.? We conducted a review of a single institutional experience of patients with haemophilia presenting with suspected intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) who underwent computed tomographic (CT) neuro-imaging. We found that over a 9-year period (1996?2004) 43 patients with haemophilia presented 73 times with suspected ICH: 10 presented multiple times (range: 2?9 times). The median age at presentation was 3.5?years (range: 0.5?17). Preceding trauma occurred in most (62/73; 85%) episodes. ICH was confirmed in 11 of the 73 (16%) episodes in eight patients. Patients with severe haemophilia accounted for a disproportionate number of episodes of suspected (60/73; 82%) and of confirmed ICH (10/11; 91%). All ICH occurred in patients not on prophylaxis; five occurred in three inhibitor-positive patients. Altered consciousness at presentation was present in 10/11 (91%) cases of confirmed ICH but only in 5/62 (8%) (ICH-negative) episodes. The positive and negative predictive values of altered consciousness to predict/rule out an ICH was 67% and 98%, respectively. The following were associated with an increased risk of presenting with suspected ICH and of having a confirmed ICH: (i) having severe haemophilia; (ii) not being on prophylaxis; (iii) having an inhibitor; and (iv) presenting with an altered level of consciousness. Patients without any of these features may not need to undergo CT imaging when presenting with suspected ICH. Ideally a prospective study to evaluate this hypothesis should be conducted.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess whether prehospital triage guidelines, based on mechanistic criteria alone, accurately identify victims of motor vehicle accidents (MVA) with major injury. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the Royal Melbourne Hospital trauma database. Mechanisms analysed were those outlined by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and Advanced Trauma Life Support/Early Management of Severe Trauma prehospital triage guidelines. Results: There were 621 MVA analysed, 253 with major injury (40.7%). Multivariate logistic regression indicated prolonged extrication time (P < 0.0001), cabin intrusion (P = 0.047), high speed (P = 0.003) and ejection from vehicle (P = 0.04) were statistically associated with major injury. Vehicle rollover and fatality in the same vehicle were not statistically associated with major injury. Conclusions: These data suggest that existing guidelines for the prehospital triage of MVA victims, based on mechanistic criteria alone may need revision.

AB  - Summary Whereas the gap between organ supply and demand remains a worldwide concern, resuscitation of out-of-hospital traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) remains controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate, in a prehospital medical care system, the number of organs transplanted from victims of out-of-hospital TCA. This is a descriptive study. Victims of TCA are collected in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry of the French North Alpine Emergency Network from 2004 to 2008. In addition to the rates of admission and survival, brain-dead patients and the organ transplanted are described. Among the 540 resuscitated patients with suspected TCA, 79 were admitted to a hospital, 15 were discharged alive from the hospital, and 22 developed brain death. Nine of these became eventually organ donors, with 31 organs transplanted, all functional after 1 year. Out-of-hospital TCA should be resuscitated just as medical CA. With a steady prevalence in our network, 19% of admitted TCA survived to discharge, and 11% became organ donors. It is essential to raise awareness among rescue teams that out-of-hospital TCA are an organ source to consider seriously.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether past history of depression is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, and whether history of gestational diabetes is associated with increased rates of postpartum depression. Research design Data for this case?control study consisted of de-identified chart records for 1439 women who received pregnancy care at a large university hospital between 1998 and 2017. Results A history of depression prior to pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes requiring insulin, although not with subtler degrees of gestational hyperglycemia. Diabetes in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Trauma history was associated with both impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy and postpartum depression. Conclusions Past episodes of depression increase risk for the most severe form of gestational diabetes; however, gestational diabetes does not contribute significantly to risk for postpartum depression. This suggests a unidirectional association, unlike the bidirectional association of diabetes with depression among the general population. History of trauma increases risk for both gestational hyperglycemia and postpartum depression, suggesting important health effects of trauma that may differ measurably from those associated with depression.

AB  - Summary Background? MMX? mesalazine [LIALDA? (US), MEZAVANT? XL (UK and Ireland) MEZAVANT? (elsewhere)] utilizes MMX Multi Matrix System? (MMX) technology which delivers mesalazine throughout the colon. Two phase III studies have already evaluated MMX mesalazine in patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Aim  To provide more precise estimates of the efficacy of MMX mesalazine over placebo by combining the patient populations from the two phase III studies. Methods? Combined data from two 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Patients randomized to MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day (once daily or 1.2?g twice daily), 4.8?g/day (once daily) or placebo were reviewed. The primary end point was clinical and endoscopic remission (modified Ulcerative Colitis-Disease Activity Index of ≤1 calculated as: rectal bleeding and stool frequency scores of 0, a combined Physician?s Global Assessment and sigmoidoscopy score of ≤1, no mucosal friability and a ≥1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from week 0). Results? Data from 517 patients were analysed. 8-week remission rates were 37.2% and 35.1% in the MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day and 4.8?g/day groups, vs. 17.5% on placebo (P?<?0.001, both comparisons). 8-week complete mucosal healing rates were 32% in both MMX mesalazine groups compared with 16% on placebo. Adverse event frequency was similar in all groups. Conclusion? MMX mesalazine is effective and generally well tolerated for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.

AB  - The differential diagnosis of adnexal masses still represents a challenge. The main goal is to determine whether a given mass is malignant or benign, in order to establish the best therapautical approach. When a clinician face to a woman diagnosed as having an adnexal tumor several parameters may be used to determine the nature of the mass, such as patient's age, menopausal status, clinical complaints, physical examination, tumor's sonographic and Doppler features and serum tumor markers. When these data are collected may be difficult to interpret them all together and the clinician has to rely in one or two of them to predict the diagnosis and to decide the management strategy, guided many times by own experience or strict protocols. A possible solution to this question may be the use of computer modelling. This means the use of statistical or mathematical models developed, using computer aid, to predict adnexal malignancy. Currently, there are two methods that may be used: Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis (MLRA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Both techniques allow to calculate the probability of a particular event has occurred, in this case a mass to be malignant or benign. By computer modelling, actual independent predictors parameters are identified and may be used combined and simultaneously to predict malignancy. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, being MLRA the statistical technique of choice and ANN a potential newer alternative to MLRA. Several studies have been published using one or both technique to predict adnexal malignancy. The results of these studies are encouraging showing a high diagnostic performance. All studies comparing MLRA to ANN showed the latter seems to be superior. However, it should be taken into account that most of these models have not tested prospectively.

AB  - Abstract Psychotherapy with the elderly has tended to be restricted to family or behavioural paradigms with some contribution from cognitive approaches, but at least until recently, very little input from psychodynamic therapy. The reasons for this are discussed and include both patient and therapist factors. Freud himself was pessimistic regarding the prospects of working with the elderly, a viewpoint he changed as he aged. As the discipline of old age psychiatry also matures there may be increasing scope for collaboration between the mental health of the elderly teams and psychodynamically orientated therapists. We describe here one model of such collaboration, a weekly case discussion seminar, conducted in an acute admission old age psychiatry in-patient unit. The role of the seminar in discussing difficult cases will be described and a case will be discussed to illustrate the work. Finally, recommendations for broadening the scope of the work are advanced. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among young adults. Substance abusers constitute a disproportionate percentage of these patients. A history of substance abuse predicts increased disability, poorer prognosis, and delayed recovery. While consensus in the literature indicates that substance-abuse rates decline following injury, conflicting literature shows a significant history of brain injury in addicts. We reviewed the literature on substance abuse after TBI to explore the state of knowledge on TBI as a risk factor for substance abuse. While recent reviews regarding substance abuse in TBI patients concur that substance-abuse rates decline even after mild TBI, an emerging literature suggests mild TBI may cause subtle impairments in cognitive, executive, and decision-making functions that are often poorly recognized in early diagnosis and treatment. When combined with difficulties in psychosocial adjustment and coping skills, these impairments may increase the risk for chronic substance abuse in a subset of TBI patients. Preliminary results from veterans indicate these patterns hold in a combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder population with TBI. This increasingly prevalent combination presents a specific challenge in rehabilitation. While this comorbidity presents a challenge for the successful treatment and rehabilitation of both disorders, there is sparse evidence to recommend any specific treatment strategy for these individuals. Mild TBI and substance abuse are bidirectionally related both for risks and treatment. Further understanding the neuropsychiatric pathology and different effects of different types of injuries will likely improve the implementation of effective treatments for each of these two conditions.

AB  - This study examined factors related to children's acute symptoms following a potentially traumatic event (PTE) to more clearly identify domains that should be included in screenings of youth exposed to a PTE. In particular, the authors examined whether trauma category (i.e., sexual abuse/disclosure of abuse, intentionally perpetrated traumas other than sexual abuse, and unintentional traumas) was related to symptoms after controlling for other relevant factors. Participants were 112 youth presenting for clinical evaluation within a month of a PTE and their nonoffending caregivers. Using data from baseline assessments collected as part of a randomized controlled trial of a secondary prevention program, the following factors were tested in 3 hierarchical regression models: index PTE category, history of traumatic exposure, preindex event functioning, and parenting behaviors. Prior trauma exposure, preindex event functioning, and hostile parenting were uniquely related to children's symptoms in the acute posttraumatic period after controlling for time since the event and child age, but trauma category was not. Implications for identifying and referring children at high risk for poor outcomes in the early aftermath of a PTE are discussed. An exclusive focus on the event is insufficient and more comprehensive understanding of the child and family is required.

AB  - Abstract Ethnoracial minority status contributes to an increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after trauma exposure, beyond other risk factors. A population-based sampling frame was used to examine the associations between ethnoracial groups and early PTSD symptoms while adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic characteristics. Acutely injured trauma center inpatients (N = 623) were screened with the PTSD Checklist. American Indian and African American patients reported the highest levels of posttraumatic stress and preinjury cumulative trauma burden. African American heritage was independently associated with an increased risk of higher acute PTSD symptom levels. Disparities in trauma history, PTSD symptoms, and event related factors emphasize the need for acute care services to incorporate culturally competent approaches for treating these diverse populations.

AB  - Objective? To determine whether the introduction of multi-professional simulation training was associated with improvements in the management of cord prolapse, in particular, the diagnosis?delivery interval (DDI). Design? Retrospective cohort study. Setting? Large tertiary maternity unit within a University Hospital in the United Kingdom. Sample? All cases of cord prolapse with informative case record: 34 pre-training, 28 post-training. Methods? Review of hospital notes and software system entries; comparison of quality of management for umbilical cord prolapse pre-training (1993?99) and post-training (2001?07). Main outcome measures? Diagnosis?delivery interval; proportion of caesarean section (CS) in whom actions were taken to reduce cord compression; type of anaesthesia for CS births; rate of low (<7) 5-minute Apgar scores; rate of admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (if birthweight >2500?g). Results? After training, there was a statistically significant reduction in median DDI from 25 to 14.5?minutes (P?<?0.001). Post-training, there was also a statistically significant increase in the proportion of CS where recommended actions had been performed (from 34.78 to 82.35%, P?=?0.003). There was a nonsignificant increase in the use of spinal anaesthesia for CS, from 8.70 to 17.65%, and a nonsignificant reduction in the rate of low Apgar scores from 6.45 to 0% and in the rate of admission to NICU from 38.46 to 22.22%. Conclusions? The introduction of annual training, in accordance with national recommendations, was associated with improved management of cord prolapse. Future studies could assess whether this improved management translates into better outcomes for babies and their mothers.
