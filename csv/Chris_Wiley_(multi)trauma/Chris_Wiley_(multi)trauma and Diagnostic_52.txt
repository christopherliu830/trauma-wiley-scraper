AB  - Structured Abstract Authors??? Strauss RP, Ramsey BL, Edwards TC, Topolski TD, Kapp-Simon KA, Thomas CR, Fenson C, Patrick DL Objectives??? To describe stigma experiences of adolescents with congenital and acquired facial differences. Design??? Used baseline cross-sectional stigma-related responses from a four site (Seattle WA, Galveston TX, Chicago IL and Chapel Hill NC) US study enrolling 185 English speaking, US participants ages 11?18?years old with facial differences (60% male; 80% congenital conditions). Closed-ended, self-administered questions drawn from the Youth Quality of Life Instrument ? Facial Differences Module (YQOL-FD) determined perceptions of stigmatization. Mothers (n?=?153) were independently asked seven matching questions. Results??? Frequencies report combined responses of ?sometimes,??fairly often,? and ?very often.? Mother's responses are in parentheses. ?? 35% (47%) noticed people staring at their face in the past week. ?? 28% (43%) talked with others about how their face looks in the past month. ?? 29% (31%) heard others say something about their face in the past month. ?? 32% (32%) told peers about their facial difference in the past month. ?? 12% (12%) felt left out of doing things with peers because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 11% (8%) got into a fight because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 20% (18%) were teased about how their face looks in the past month. Conclusions??? Stigma experiences were frequently reported by youth with facial differences and were correlated with independent parental report. This level of stigma suggests that media and public health interventions may be warranted to reduce discrimination, prejudice and negative adolescent social experiences related to facial difference.

AB  - Summary Fragility fracture accounts for a large percentage of hospital attendances and admissions in orthopaedic trauma settings. Such fractures occur as a result of weakened bone mainly due to osteoporosis. The majority of this type of fracture occurs in older people who have sustained the injury following minimal trauma or following a fall. The most common reason for hospital admission is following a hip fracture. This chapter considers fragility fracture generally and then focusses on the care of the older following hip fracture. This type of injury presents numerous challenges for the orthopaedic practitioner because it often occurs in frail older people and necessitates surgery followed by a protracted period of rehabilitation. The chapter considers how evidence based practice can be applied to ensuring that this vulnerable group of patients can receive care that is focused on achieving the best outcomes.

AB  - Background Multiple malformation syndromes are generally heterogeneous diseases with inappropriate clinical delineation most cases. Geneticists are facing problems with lack of proper knowledge inspite of the overwhelming information available regarding a certain syndrome. Emphasis should be placed on the characteristic features of the suspected syndrome, or any major or detectable minor anomaly with significant effect on the course of the pregnancy. Conclusion Detailed ultrasonography by experienced personnel provides a valuable tool in diagnosing morphological alterations of the fetus in mid-gestation. After termination of the pregnancy, the effected fetus must be examined thoroughly by an experienced fetopathologist. Careful and comprehensive examinations reveals all major and minor morphological alterations that might outline a certain syndrome or other multiple abnormality entity. Computer based syndromological programs are important in this process, for they help geneticists and fetopathologists by matching the most suitable syndrome to the given case. Genetic counseling can be completed only with the establishment of the most probable diagnosis. Declaration of recurrence rate and possible application of other prenatal diagnostic methods must be included in the counseling. Different types of multiple malformation syndromes of the fetus will be presented in the lecture.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To determine injuries significantly associated with traumatic thoracic spine (T-spine) fractures Methods:? This was a case?control study undertaken in an adult trauma centre. Cases were patients admitted with a traumatic T-spine fracture between January 1999 and August 2007. Each case had two controls matched for sex, age (±5?years) and injury severity classification (major/minor). Data were collected from patient medical records and the trauma service database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine injuries significantly associated with T-spine fracture. Results:? Two hundred and sixty-one cases and 512 controls were enrolled. In both groups, mean age was 41?years and 70% of patients were male. Univariate analysis revealed a range of injuries that were significantly more common among the cases, especially cervical and lumbar spine injuries, sternal/scapular/clavicular/rib fractures, pneumo/haemothorax and pulmonary contusions (P < 0.01). Skull fractures and lower limb injuries were significantly more common among the controls (P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that only cervical and lumbar spine injuries and rib fractures were positively associated with T-spine fracture (P < 0.001). Skull fractures and lower limb injuries were negatively associated with T-spine injury (P < 0.001). Conclusion:? Cervical and lumbar spine injuries and rib fractures are significantly associated with T-spine fracture. The presence of these injuries should raise suspicion of concomitant T-spine injury.

AB  - Reliable, clinically useful, and globally applicable diagnostic classification of mental disorders is an essential foundation for global mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) is nearing completion of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The present study assessed inter-diagnostician reliability of mental disorders accounting for the greatest proportion of global disease burden and the highest levels of service utilization ? schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically associated with stress ? among adult patients presenting for treatment at 28 participating centers in 13 countries. A concurrent joint-rater design was used, focusing specifically on whether two clinicians, relying on the same clinical information, agreed on the diagnosis when separately applying the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. A total of 1,806 patients were assessed by 339 clinicians in the local language. Intraclass kappa coefficients for diagnoses weighted by site and study prevalence ranged from 0.45 (dysthymic disorder) to 0.88 (social anxiety disorder) and would be considered moderate to almost perfect for all diagnoses. Overall, the reliability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines was superior to that previously reported for equivalent ICD-10 guidelines. These data provide support for the suitability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for implementation at a global level. The findings will inform further revision of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines prior to their publication and the development of programs to support professional training and implementation of the ICD-11 by WHO member states.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine, within the first-year post?head and neck cancer (HNC) diagnosis, the contribution of past and upon HNC psychiatric diagnoses (ie, substance use disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder) to the extent (ie, cumulated dose) of opioid prescription. Methods Prospective longitudinal study of 223 consecutive adults (on 313 approached; 72% participation) newly diagnosed (<2 weeks) with a first occurrence of primary HNC, including Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV disorders, validated psychometric measures, and medical chart reviews. Opioid doses were translated into standardized morphine milligram equivalents (MME) using CDC guidelines. A model of variables was tested using multiple linear regression. Results Fifty-five percent (123/223) of patients received opioids at some point during the first 12 months post?HNC diagnosis, 37.7% (84/223) upon HNC diagnosis (pre-treatment), 40.8% (91/223) during treatments, and 31.4% (70/223) post-treatment. The multiple linear regression indicated that an AD (P = 0.04) upon HNC diagnosis in early stage contributes to cumulated MME dose in the first year post?HNC diagnosis. Conclusion This study underlines how anxiety has important repercussions on the management of pain and illustrates the importance of screening for AD upon HNC diagnosis to allow for early prophylactic treatment and support.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the seriously injured older adult; characterize and compare the differences in injury characteristics and outcomes in three subgroups of seriously injured older adults: aged 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 and older; and identify risk factors for death, complications, and discharge placement at hospital discharge. DESIGN: A retrospective secondary analysis of a statewide trauma data set from 1988 through 1997. SETTING: Data submitted from all designated trauma centers in Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: The data set yielded 38,707 patients with a mean age of 77.5 years with serious injury (mean number of injuries = 3.6, mean number of body systems involved = 2). MEASUREMENTS: Key outcomes were mortality, complications, and discharge placement. Abbreviated Injury Score categorized injuries and Injury Severity Score (ISS) quantified anatomic severity of injury. RESULTS: Mortality was 10%. Mean length of stay was 11.5 days. Just over half (52.2%) of survivors were discharged home; 25.4% were discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Injury severity, total number of injuries, complications, and increasing age were predictors of mortality (P < .01). The presence of preexisting comorbid medical conditions increased the odds of experiencing a complication over threefold. Increasing age, total number of injuries, injury to extremities or abdominal contents, injuries due to falls, and lower functional level predicted discharge to a skilled nursing facility (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic injuries affect older adults of all ages and are typically multisystem and life threatening. The standard ISS does not fully capture the potential for mortality in older adults and does not predict discharge placement. The majority of older adults survive multisystem injury. Our findings indicate the need to examine outcomes beyond mortality and to make the identification and management of comorbid conditions a priority. A geriatric consultation service could be an important addition to the interdisciplinary trauma team.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a developmentally disabling disorder of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that affects 3%-20% of school-aged children. It affects the child at home, at school, and with peers, and persists into adolescence and young adulthood. The author reviews the diagnostic criteria, etiological considerations, evaluation process, and management of this handicapping disorder. Included is a discussion of the most frequently used medications and suggestions for home and classroom management strategies that assist the child to behave and achieve success in school. It is pertinent to all nurses, since children with ADHD are in all settings and nurses are often asked questions about this controversial health care issue in both professional and personal arenas.

AB  - Abstract Background Although lung transplantation improves quality of life, most psychosocial research focuses on adverse psychological and social functioning outcomes. Positive effects, particularly in the late-term years as physical morbidities increase, have received little attention. We provide the first data on a psychological benefit ? post-traumatic growth (PTG) ? and we focused on long-term (>5 yr) survivors. Methods Among 178 patients from a prospective study of mental health during the first two yr post-transplant, we recontacted survivors 6?11 yr post-transplant. We assessed PTG (i.e., positive psychological change resulting from the transplant) and examined its relationship to other patient characteristics with multivariable regression analyses. Results Sixty-four patients (86% of survivors) were assessed (M = 8.1 yr post-transplant, SD = 1.2). Mean PTG exceeded the scale's midpoint (M = 38.6, SD = 10.0; scale midpoint = 25). Recipients experiencing greater PTG were female (p = 0.022), less educated (p = 0.014), and had a history of post-transplant panic disorder (p = 0.005), greater friend support (p = 0.048), and better perceived health (p = 0.032). Neither other pre- or post-transplant mood and anxiety disorders nor transplant-related morbidities (acute rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) predicted PTG. Conclusions PTG exceeded levels observed in other chronic disease populations, suggesting that lung transplantation may uniquely foster positive psychological change in long-term survivors. PTG occurs despite physical and psychiatric morbidities. Whether PTG promotes other positive post-transplant psychosocial outcomes deserves attention.

AB  - Objectives. This study investigated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and illness perceptions in people who suffered the acute medical trauma of a myocardial infarction (MI) or a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The study tested hypotheses regarding changes in PTSD symptoms and illness perceptions over time, associations between PTSD and illness perceptions and cognitive predictors of PTSD. Design and method. The study employed a longitudinal design and measured the illness perceptions and PTSD symptoms of an MI group (N = 17) and a SAH group (N = 27). Data were collected within 2 weeks of admission (T1), 6 weeks after admission (T2) and 3 months after admission (T3). Statistical analysis was undertaken to examine associations between illness perceptions and PTSD and to examine cognitive predictors of PTSD. Results. The prevalence of PTSD within the total acute medical trauma sample was 16% at 2 weeks, 35% at 6 weeks and 16% at 3 months. Illness perception factors of identity, timeline (acute/chronic), consequences and emotional representation were strongly correlated with PTSD at all three time points. PTSD symptoms and illness perceptions were shown to have changed over time. The results also showed that several illness perception factors are significant predictors of PTSD. Conclusions. Both PTSD symptoms and illness perceptions changed significantly over time following an MI or SAH. Illness perception factors are significant predictors of PTSD.

AB  - Summary Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of equine stifle disorders is challenging. We describe a routine technique for low-field stifle MRI under general anaesthesia in clinical cases and report the main findings. We hypothesised that MRI can be safely and routinely performed and portray bone and soft-tissue pathology. In this retrospective study, medical records of 76 stifles with positive response to intra-articular anaesthesia without abnormalities on conventional diagnostic imaging were reviewed for breed, age, gender, MRI anaesthesia time and findings. Under anaesthesia, limbs were extended in a rotating MR gantry. Different sequences in several planes were acquired in an average time of 62 min. In all horses, the stifle examinations were successful and complete. Typical MRI lesions included bone marrow lesions, osseous cyst-like lesions, cruciate desmopathy, meniscal tearing or a combination thereof. Retrospective reviewing confirmed that initial radiographic and ultrasonographic images failed to identify these lesions. Surgically accessible lesions were confirmed in arthroscopy if exploration was indicated. However, MRI was useful to estimate extent of cruciate and meniscal pathology as well as bone marrow lesions and bone cystic-like lesions more thoroughly. Our protocol allows for routine stifle MRI, independent of breed, age and gender. Based on our preliminary results, low-field stifle MRI is safe and can delineate bone and soft-tissue pathology. Low-field MRI appears to be a promising approach for better understanding stifle pathology and thus treatment and prognosis.

AB  - SYNOPSISThis study attempts to replicate and synthesize previous headache/MMPI research by investigating scale differences amongst diagnoses and between a control group; re-examining the occurrence of the conversion ?V? pattern; evaluating the Kudrow-Sutkus (1979) classification system; measuring score changes which occur with prognosis; and observing the effect that ?headache items? have on scale score elevations. Several mean scale scores differed from previous studies. A number of these differences were clinically significant. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (sex [370 males and females] and headache diagnosis) for each scale determined that males had higher L scores; the control group had higher K scores than post trauma, mixed, or vascular patients; each headache diagnosis had higher 1, 2, 3, and 7 scores than the control group (scales 1, 2, and 3 were clinically elevated in only the post trauma and mixed conditions); scale 9 scores varied between conditions; and scale 10 scores were higher for migraine, mixed, cluster, and post trauma patients. Chi-square analysis determined that the conversion ?;V? pattern occurred in a significantly greater degree in headache patients. However, the percentage of occurrence ranged from only 12.50 to 31.03 percent. The Kudrow-Sutkus system correctly diagnosed only 40.08 percent of 90 randomly selected subjects. One-way ANOVA determined that no significant change occurred in group scale scores in 20 headache sufferers who received treatment ranging from a multi-disciplinary hospital program to none at all and whose prognosis ranged from excellent to poor. One-way ANOVA determined that the removal of items which inquire about ?headache symptoms? produced significant reductions on scales 1 and 3.The inability of this study to replicate previous empirical investigations raises questions of the MMPI's reliability as a diagnostic classifier in chronic headache. Certain elevations on the MMPI may be the result of symptom measurement and not psychopathology.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the importance of including cultural dimensions as a fundamental component of nursing curricula and to provide some indications as to how this may be achieved. The concept of ?institutionalized racism? is examined, with reference to the absence of the cultural dimension in nursing education, and it is suggested that nurses, as members of a ?caring profession', should be in the forefront in promoting mutual cultural understanding. The argument for promoting cultural awareness is developed in the context of individualized nursing care and the nursing process. The needs of ethnic minority learners are considered along with their potential role, and that of tutors, in breaking down barriers to the acceptance of cultural diversity. Some possible reasons for the failure to include ethnographic perspectives in nurse education programmes are postulated, and finally suggestions as to how this curriculum deficit may be rectified are made. The paper concludes that British nurse educators should ensure that the needs fo learners and patients are better provided for in the future by directing more attention to ethnographic perspectives relating to learning and the provision of nursing care.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the relationship between spirituality, science and therapy was explored. In this paper spirituality is discussed in a more clinical context. Family response to trauma is outlined, concentrating on the area of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and several models of adaptation are reviewed. There appear to he commonalities in response to different types of trauma. However in the area of ABI, positive outcomes have been under-reported in the literature which has focussed for various reasons on maladaptation. In viewing response to trauma as involving both the potential for positive transformation as well as suffering and burden, concepts of Frankl and Jung, spiritual belief and ?near death experience? are discussed. Examples of how families find meaning and positively appraise their experience of ABI are given.
