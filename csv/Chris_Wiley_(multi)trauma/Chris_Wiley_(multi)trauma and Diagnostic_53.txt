AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has a number of indications in paediatric musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, and provides many advantages over traditional imaging and diagnostic techniques. This chapter attention focusses on PoCUS and its application to more acute presentations, including infectious, inflammatory and traumatic conditions. In terms of examiner technique, adequate ultrasound gel, appropriate probe manipulation, probe stabilisation using the hypothenar eminence and little finger of the examiner's hand, as well as multi-angle views to evaluate for anisotropy, are all important to obtaining high-quality clinically useful ultrasound images. PoCUS can be useful in the diagnosis, evaluation and also often the treatment of paediatric skin and soft-tissue infections. Common entities evaluated are cellulitis, abscess and acute haematogenous osteomyelitis. Retained foreign bodies (FBs), dislocation/subluxation in children, ligament, tendon injuries, and joint effusions are also discussed. A high-frequency (7-12?MHz) probe with paediatric hip/MSK preset should be used if available.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To describe postoperative adverse events (AEs) and outcomes after transoral surgery for bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP). Study Design Prospective observational multicenter study. Methods Thirty-six patients with BVFP underwent transoral surgery using standard surgical procedures to unilaterally widen the glottic area. Postoperative adverse events (AEs) including severe adverse events (SAEs) were registered continuously. Pre- and 6-month postoperative evaluations included the 6-Minute Walk Test, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, the 12-Item Voice Handicap Index (VHI-12), and a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing graded according to the Penetration?Aspiration-Scale. Results The patients underwent posterior cordotomy, partial arytenoidectomy, or permanent laterofixation as single procedures or in combination. Forty-seven percent of the patients had postoperative AEs. Dyspnea was the most frequent AE (45%). In 40% of AEs, the events were severe (SAEs), and 72.5% were related to the study intervention. Revision surgery leading to prolonged hospitalization or rehospitalization was necessary in nine cases (25%). Laterofixation was correlated to a decreased risk of AEs (P?=?0.042). Six months after surgery, a significant improvement was seen in the SF-domains: Physical component score (P?=?0.008), physical functioning (P?=?0.001), physical role (P?=?0.031), and vitality (P?=?0.032). Concerning the voice handicap, only the VHI-12 physical subscore showed a decrease (P?=?0.005). The total score and other VHI-12 subscores did not change significantly (all P?>?0.05). Conclusion BCVP patients profit from modern transoral surgery for unilateral glottic widening; quality of life is improved; and the voice is preserved. Nevertheless, postoperative complications are frequent. Level of Evidence 2b. Laryngoscope, 125:1401?1408, 2015

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Most interviews of eating disorders have been developed on homogeneous, English-speaking samples at particular academic institutions for research purposes, and tend to put scientific rigour before clinical utility. The present study deals with the development and preliminary validation of the Rating of Anorexia and Bulimia (RAB), a 56 item interview covering a wide range of eating disorder symptoms, related psychopathology and background variables, which can be used to generate operational DSM-IV diagnoses. Eating disorder variables on the RAB can be compiled into four subscales: Body-shape and Weight Preoccupation, Binge-Eating, Anorexic Eating Behaviour and Compensatory Behaviour. The instrument was investigated among 409 patients participating in the Swedish multi-centre study of eating disorders. Measures of internal consistency, diagnostic discrimination and correlations with the EDI-2 suggest that the RAB is a promising measure that reliably measures important aspects of eating disorder psychopathology.

AB  - Summary Up to 75% of pre-hospital trauma patients experience moderate to severe pain but this is often poorly recognised and treated with insufficient analgesia. Using multi-level logistic regression analysis, we aimed to identify the determinants of pre-hospital analgesia administration and choice of analgesic agent in a single helicopter-based emergency medical service, where available analgesic drugs were fentanyl and ketamine. Of the 1156 patients rescued for isolated limb injury, 657 (57%) received analgesia. Mean (SD) initial pain scores (as measured by a numeric rating scale) were 2.8 (1.8), 3.3 (1.6) and 7.4 (2.0) for patients who did not receive, declined, and received analgesia, respectively (p < 0.001). Fentanyl as a single agent, ketamine in combination with fentanyl and ketamine as a single agent were used in 533 (84%), 94 (14%) and 10 (2%) patients, respectively. A high initial on-scene pain score and a presumptive diagnosis of fracture were the main determinants of analgesia administration. Fentanyl was preferred for paediatric patients and ketamine was preferentially administered for severe pain by physicians who had more medical experience or had trained in anaesthesia.

AB  - Acute bacterial infection of the central nervous system requires rapid and adequate management. Etiological diagnosis is hence crucial. Moreover, the epidemic threat of certain bacteria necessitates a reliable characterization of the involved bacterial strains to follow the spread of epidemic strains. Conventional identification and characterization of etiological agents are basically based on culture and identification of bacterial markers most frequently by serological assays. Molecular identification and characterization of bacteria have been employed. They provide more reliable analysis of bacterial isolates. Molecular methods for non-culture diagnosis of bacterial infections have recently been developed. In many cases, the molecular assays have decreased the identification time of positive cultures and rescued detection of pathogens in culture-negative clinical samples.

AB  - Context? Reflective practice has been suggested to be an important instrument in improving clinical judgement and developing medical expertise. Empirical evidence supporting this suggestion, however, is absent. This paper reports on an experiment conducted to study the effects of reflective practice on diagnostic accuracy. Methods? Participants were 42 internal medicine residents in hospitals in 2 states in the northeast of Brazil. They diagnosed 16 clinical cases. The experiment employed a repeated measures design, with 2 independent variables: the complexity of clinical cases (simple or complex), and the reasoning approach induced to diagnose the case (participants were instructed to diagnose each case either through pattern recognition or reflective reasoning). The dependent variable was the accuracy of the diagnosis provided for each case. All participants participated in each of the 2 levels of both independent variables. Results? A main effect of case complexity emerged. There was no statistically significant main effect of reflective practice. However, a significant interaction effect was found between case complexity and mode of processing (F[1,41]?=?4.48, P?<?0.05), indicating that although reflective practice did not make a difference to accuracy of diagnosis in simple cases, it had a positive effect when diagnosing complex cases. Conclusions? Reflective practice had a positive effect on diagnosis of complex, unusual cases. Non-analytical reasoning was shown to be as effective as reflective reasoning for diagnosing routine clinical cases. Findings support the idea that reflective practice may particularly improve diagnoses in situations of uncertainty and uniqueness, reducing diagnostic errors.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the impact of postdischarge surveillance on surgical site infection (SSI) diagnosis. Study design Prospective enrollment with retrospective case review Sample Population Dogs and cats (n?=?1271) undergoing surgery April 2012-November 2013. Methods The medical record of each animal was reviewed and a 30-day follow-up questionnaire was sent to each pet owner. A standardized definition of SSI was used to identify all animals with SSI. The method of SSI detection was recorded as: re-presentation to the hospital, scheduled recheck, questionnaire, communication with the referring veterinarian, or a combination of the above. Results SSI was identified in 36 (2.83%) of the 1271 animals included. All SSIs were diagnosed after discharge from the hospital. Seven of the 36 animals with SSI were diagnosed at re-presentation to the hospital, 5/36 at scheduled recheck, 10/36 on questionnaire, 10/36 at re-presentation to the hospital AND on questionnaire, and 4/36 on communication with referring veterinarian. Of the diagnosed SSIs, 72.2% were documented in the medical record. Therefore, without active postdischarge surveillance, 10/36 SSIs (27.8%) would have gone unknown to surgeons at our institution. Conclusion Understanding the incidence of SSI with feedback to surgeons is an important aspect of an infection control program and has been shown to reduce SSI risks. Without active postoperative surveillance, 27.8% of SSIs would have gone unknown to surgeons. Implementing active surveillance will allow accurate reporting of incidence of SSIs in veterinary hospitals.

AB  - In this article, I explore the reluctance of Japanese ob-gyns to discuss prenatal diagnosis (PND) tests with pregnant women. The analysis focuses on the culturally specific ways in which ob-gyns formulate their cautiousness and criticism toward PND while invoking a local moral economy. Analyzing ob-gyns' accounts, I show how the ambiguities of PND are constituted in a specific moment in Japanese culture, history, disability politics, and national reproductive policies and are formulated through local paradigms of thinking about pregnant women, their fetuses, and the process of becoming a person in Japanese society. Finally, I show how PND in Japan is pushed to a ?back-stage? realm in which the diagnosis for fetal anomalies is practiced in secrecy.

AB  - Abstract Methamphetamine abuse and dependence, frequently accompanied by schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms [methamphetamine-associated psychosis (MAP)], is a serious public health problem worldwide. Few studies, however, have characterized brain dysfunction associated with MAP, nor investigated similarities and differences in brain dysfunction between MAP and schizophrenia. We compared prefrontal cortical activity associated with stop-signal inhibitory task in 21 patients with MAP, 14 patients with schizophrenia and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls using a 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. Both the MAP and the schizophrenia groups showed significantly reduced activation in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared with controls; however, only the MAP group showed reduced activation in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex. The MAP group demonstrated significant positive correlations between task performance and hemodynamic responses in the bilateral ventrolateral, polar and left dorsolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex. The MAP and schizophrenia groups demonstrated a significant difference in the relationship of impulsivity to hemodynamic changes in the bilateral premotor cortex. These findings characterize similarities and differences in prefrontal cortical dysfunction between psychosis associated with methamphetamine and schizophrenia. The reduced hemodynamic changes in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex suggest a common underlying pathophysiology of MAP and schizophrenia, whereas those in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex point to an impaired state that is either inherent or caused specifically by methamphetamine use.

AB  - Abstract Much of the extant literature addressing the psychosocial aspects of BRCA1/2 mutation testing and risk management aggregates mutation carriers of all ages in study recruitment, data analysis, and interpretation. This analytic strategy does not adequately address the needs of the youngest genetic testing consumers, i.e., women aged 18?25. Despite low absolute cancer risk estimates before age 30, BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women aged 18?25 feel vulnerable to a cancer diagnosis but find themselves in a management quandary because the clinical utility of screening and prevention options are not yet well defined for such young carriers. We present three cases, selected from a larger study of 32 BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women who completed or considered genetic testing before age 25, to demonstrate the unique developmental, relational and temporal influences, as well as the challenges, experienced by very young BRCA mutation-positive women as they complete genetic testing and initiate cancer risk management. The first case describes the maturation of a young woman whose family participated in a national cancer registry. The second addresses the experiences and expectations of a young woman who completed genetic testing after learning that her unaffected father was a mutation carrier. The third case highlights the experiences of a young woman parentally bereaved in childhood, who presented for genetic counseling and testing due to intense family pressure. Together, these cases suggest that BRCA1/2-positive women aged 18?25 are challenged to reconcile their burgeoning independence from their families with risk-related support needs. Loved ones acting in ways meant to care for these young women may inadvertently apply pressure, convoluting family support dynamics and autonomous decision-making. Ongoing support from competent healthcare professionals will enable these young women to remain informed and receive objective counsel about their risk-management decisions.

AB  - Abstract Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was initially conceptualized as a psychopathology that arose as a consequence of war time experiences. More recently, available evidence has demonstrated that post-traumatic stress (PTS) as a consequence of war is buffered by social identity processes. In such contexts, identity resources are arguably more readily accessible given the integral relationship between social identities and intergroup violence. There is no evidence as yet to suggest that social identity processes may act to reduce PTS responses to naturally occurring disasters such as earthquakes and even less data pertaining to non-Western contexts where the impact of such disasters tends to be particularly catastrophic. This article reports on a study undertaken in earthquake-affected regions in Nepal devastated by the April 2015 quake and its major aftershock a month later. Participants (n=399) completed measures of their earthquake experience, Post-Traumatic Stress and Post Traumatic growth (PTG), as well as measures of community identification and collective efficacy. In total 399 people completed the measures approximately six months after the quakes. Results of the study indicated that consistent with tenets of the social identity framework, ethnic and gender group memberships impacted on reported experiences during the earthquake. Reported experience during the quakes and ethnic group membership were both related to increased symptoms of PTS. Ethnicity was also linked to the proportion of respondents reporting clinical levels of PTSD symptoms. The relationship between earthquake experience and PTG was mediated by community identification and collective efficacy. Earthquake experience also had an indirect effect on PTS through collective efficacy. Implications of these findings for those working with traumatized groups are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the population-based incidence and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalised traumatic brain injury (TBI) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods: One-year statewide hospital admission data from the NSW Department of Health were analysed. TBI cases were identified using a combination of TBI-related diagnostic and external cause codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10th Revision). Sociodemographics, causes, associated factors, severity and medical details of hospitalisation were examined. Results: There were 6,827 hospitalised TBI cases that met review criteria. Incidence rate was 99.1/100,000 population. Incidence in persons older than 75 years of age and residents in remote areas was three times higher. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were 1.7 times more likely to sustain a TBI than the general population, and risk was greater for all NSW residents from areas that were remote and disadvantaged-socioeconomically. Older adults and those with severe injuries showed prolonged hospitalisation, higher morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: Overall TBI incidence in NSW is lower than international estimates. Nevertheless, groups with higher incidence rates and/or poor in-hospital outcomes were identified, highlighting directions for prevention and future research. Implications for public health: There is a need for identifying risk factors/barriers and assessing the impact of recent policies on these population groups.

AB  - SYNOPSIS Potential availability of a reliable non-invasive system for measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)prompted measurement of rCBF in patients with vascular headache in order to assess its diagnostic value. The rCBF in migraine varied with the clinical phase. During the prodrome phase the blood flow was reduced; whereas during the headache phase, a striking cortical hyperperfusion was noted. Patients who continued to have neurologic symptoms of the prodrome in the headache phase showed a mixed pattern of reduced and increased blood flow. The rCBF was found normal in the headache phase in patients with muscle contraction and psychogenic headache. In patients with headache as a prominent symptom of cerebrovascular insufficiency, rCBF was reduced but was not significantly different from rCBF in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency without headache.
