AB  - Abstract Introduction Use of indication-specific CT protocols and adjustment of scan parameters to decrease radiation exposure may result in significant dose reduction. We implemented these strategies and compare pre- and post-implementation radiation dose in emergency department (ED) patients. Method This was a descriptive, retrospective study. Patients older than 15 years who had undergone emergency CT examinations of the head, chest, abdomen, pelvis and abdominopelvic region in periods before and after dose-reduction implementation were included. The primary outcome was volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length products (DLP). Results There were 786 studies in the pre-implementation (group 1) and 955 studies in the post-implementation (group 2) periods. Radiation dose from all CT types significantly reduced in the post-implementation period. Average CTDIvol for head, chest, abdomen, pelvis and abdominopelvic region (doses during pre-implementation period in parentheses) were 51.5 (109), 8.1 (30.4), 13.1 (41.8), 11 (38), 11.2 (41.8) mGy, respectively. Average DLP was also significantly lower (pre-implementation dose in parentheses) in all CT types, which were 943 (2232), 324 (2517), 944 (5605), 280 (4024), 809 (7118) mGy?cm, respectively. Patients' age, gender, body mass index and size were not significantly different between the two groups. Image quality decreased but almost all examinations received an acceptable diagnostic subjective image quality. Conclusion Simple methods could help significantly reduce CT radiation exposure in ED patients while maintaining an acceptable level of diagnostic image quality.

AB  - Abstract The present study highlights the role of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining in diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis and correlates the cytomorphological features with histopathology. FNAC and biopsy was performed on 30 cases of cutaneous tuberculosis and along with the routine stains, ZN and periodic acid Schiffs staining was carried out in all cases. On cytology, out of 9 cases of lupus vulgaris, 89% showed cohesive epithelioid cell granulomas with or without chronic inflammatory infiltrate; however, acid fast bacilli (AFB) could be demonstrated only in 22.2% on cytology while none on histopathology. Of 19 cases diagnosed as Scrofuloderma, 79% showed caseation necrosis with or without granulomas, 10.5% revealed granulomas with acute inflammatory infiltrates. AFB was demonstrated in 78.9% cases on cytology when compared with 15.8% on histopathology. No conclusion could be drawn in one case each of TBVC and lichen scrofulosorum. Hence, correlating cytomorphological patterns with clinical presentations often yields diagnostic information in cases of cutaneous tuberculosis and frequently obviates the need for biopsy especially in cases of scrofuloderma.

AB  - As a result of the limitations of a single nursing diagnosis, NANDA has encouraged the development of ?syndromes.? A study was undertaken using an investigator-developed tool to identify the cluster of defining characteristics, nursing diagnoses and nursing interventions for terminally ill patients, regardless of disease origin. The sample consisted of completed medical records of 15 randomly selected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and 15 randomly selected cancer patients. For all three areas there were commonalities, specifically 10 defining characteristics, seven nursing diagnosis and a 27%?48% agreement on the nursing interventions selected. A clustering of data has been documented to support the establishment of the nursing diagnosis, terminal syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim A previous cross-sectional study found that young adults with depression were more likely to have traumatic dental injuries (TDIs). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms during early and middle adolescence, and TDIs at age 15-16 years. Method This study used longitudinal data from phases 1 and 3 of the Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey (RELACHS), a school-based survey following a representative, multi-ethnic sample of adolescents attending public schools in East London (England). Information on depressive symptoms was collected using the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) during early (age 11-12 years) and middle adolescence (age 15-16 years). TDIs were identified during clinical examinations in phase 3 when pupils were 15-16 years old. Logistic regression was used to test the association between depressive symptoms at different stages of adolescence and TDIs adjusting for confounders (age, gender, ethnicity, parental employment and overjet). Results Depressive symptoms were reported by 24% and 32% of adolescents in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Evidence of TDIs was found in 18% of adolescents at age 15-16 years. Adolescents with depressive symptoms, either in early or middle adolescence, had greater odds of experiencing TDIs. However, these estimates were not statistically significant. In regression models adjusted for confounders, the odds of having TDIs were 1.23 (95% CI: 0.77-1.96) and 1.23 (95% CI: 0.76-1.95) among pupils with depressive symptoms in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Conclusion There was no association between depressive symptoms and TDIs in early and middle adolescents.

AB  - Summary Acute pain follows surgery, diagnostic procedures, or trauma. In addition, there are many medical conditions that cause acute inflammatory pain. Acute pain after surgery or a diagnostic intervention is preventable with the pre-emptive use of analgesics. Acute pain from trauma cannot be pre-empted, and its treatment may require the use of combinations of drugs and larger dosages. The drugs used to treat acute pain can be divided into five main classes: opioids, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), α-2 adrenoceptor agonists, and miscellaneous drugs or adjuncts. Most opioids have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system and, consequently, are often used in protocols for dogs suffering from cardiovascular disease. The most common adverse effects reported are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Physical therapy techniques including passive range of motion, massage, ultrasound, low-level laser, and acupuncture can be useful adjuncts to pharmaceutical treatment of acute pain in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in both developing and developed countries. Biomarkers for stroke and its outcome can greatly facilitate early detection and management of the disease. miRNAs have been explored for their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and brain injury in ischaemic stroke. A substantial body of evidence suggests that miRNAs play key roles in numerous cellular changes following ischaemic stroke including mitochondrial dysfunction, energy failure, cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, activation of glial cells, increased intracellular calcium levels inflammatory responses and disruption of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). In addition, targeting specific miRNAs, therapeutic modulation of brain injury and apoptosis can also be achieved. Therefore, the current review has been compiled within an aim to give an overview of the developments exploiting miRNAs at different stages of stroke as prognostic, diagnostic, protective and therapeutic biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The chronic effects of neurotrauma consortium (CENC) observational study is a multisite investigation designed to examine the long-term longitudinal effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). All participants in this initial CENC cohort had a history of deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), and/or their follow-on conflicts (Operation Freedom's Sentinel). All participants undergo extensive medical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments and either meet criteria for any lifetime mTBI or not. These assessments are integrated into six CENC core studies?Biorepository, Biostatistics, Data and Study Management, Neuroimaging, and Neuropathology. Methods The current study outlines the quantitative neuroimaging methods managed by the Neuroimaging Core using FreeSurfer automated software for image quantification. Results At this writing, 319 participants from the CENC observational study have completed all baseline assessments including the imaging protocol and tertiary data quality assurance procedures. Conclusions/Discussion The preliminary findings of this initial cohort are reported to describe how the Neuroimaging Core manages neuroimaging quantification for CENC studies.

AB  - Objectives: The diagnostic utility of routine faecal examinations can be greatly enhanced through an appreciation of risk factors most commonly associated with endoparasitism. Methods: From a sample of 6578 canine patients presenting to a veterinary teaching hospital between 1996 and 2006, this study used univariate and multi-variable techniques to examine putative signalment, medical history and demographic factors predisposing dogs to intestinal parasites. Results: Age and median household income were the strongest predictors of endoparasitism. The odds of a patient being diagnosed with endoparasites were 0·82 times smaller for every 1 year increase in age (OR=0·82, 95% CI: 0·80 to 0·84) and for every $10,000 increase in median household income, the odds were 0·86 times lower (OR=0·86, 95% CI: 0·83 to 0·89). The variables gender, neuter status, month of diagnosis, admitting clinical service and primary diagnosis were not significant predictors. Animals that were presented for underlying medical conditions were less likely to have parasites and the presence of diarrhoea was associated with 76% lower odds of endoparasitism compared to healthy animals (OR=0·76, 95% CI: 0·64 to 0·90). Clinical Significance: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for parasites in younger patients that live in high population density and low income neighbourhoods.

Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

The definitive diagnosis of such cystic lesions may be difficult and needle aspiration or biopsy or even operation may be necessary. Clinical and biochemical features may be helpful and in five of the six patients presented, the liver function tests were abnormal. In two patients, diagnostic imaging could not distinguish the tumour from a benign cyst. The differential diagnosis of such cystic liver tumours includes simple cyst, polycystic liver disease, hydatid, liver abscess, haematoma and biloma.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal brain functional connectivity may be the neural underpinning of addiction to illicit drugs and of relapse after successful cessation therapy. Aberrant brain networks have been demonstrated in addicted patients and in newly abstinent addicts. However, it is not known whether abnormal brain connectivity patterns persist after prolonged abstinence. In this cross-sectional study, whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (8 min) were collected from 30 heroin-addicted individuals after a long period of abstinence (more than 3 years) and from 30 healthy controls. We first examined the group differences in the resting-state functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in relapse-related processes, including craving and reactivity to stress following acute and protracted withdrawal from heroin. We then examined the relation between the duration of abstinence and the altered NAc functional connectivity in the heroin group. We found that, compared with controls, heroin-dependent participants exhibited significantly greater functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the NAc and weaker functional connectivity between the NAc and the left putamen, left precuneus, and supplementary motor area. However, with longer abstinence time, the strength of NAc functional connectivity with the left putamen increased. These results indicate that dysfunction of the NAc functional network is still present in long-term-abstinent heroin-dependent individuals. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aim: The aim of this study was to describe a service operating in Milan, Italy, that provides early intervention for young people aged 17?30?years at the onset and at high risk of psychosis. Method: Following 2?years of preliminary study and organization, Programma2000 was launched in Milan in 1999. This programme was targeted at early detection and intervention in subjects at the onset of, at risk of, or showing ?prodromal? signs of psychosis. This paper contains data on the organization and activities of Programma2000. Results: The service has been active since its launch and has received 378 referrals as of March 2009, 342 of which were thoroughly evaluated. At entry, patients undergo a detailed evaluation of their psychopathology, personal and social role functioning, and cognitive status, with repeated testing over time in order to multidimensionally assess outcome. Treatment involves cognitive?behavioural psychotherapy, structured and unstructured psychosocial interventions, and pharmacotherapy when deemed necessary. Treatment appears effective in reducing morbidity and improving social functioning. Conclusion: A team dedicated to the early identification and treatment of young people with early psychosis is a feasible and sustainable extension of the traditional methods of care for people with mental disorders in Italy.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at a high incidence, involving millions of individuals in the U.S. alone. Related to this, there are large numbers of litigants and claimants who are referred annually for forensic evaluation. In formulating opinions regarding claimed injuries, the present review advises experts to rely on two sets of information: TBI outcome and neuropsychological dose?response studies of non-litigants and non-claimants, and response bias literature that has demonstrated the relatively high risk of invalid responding among examinees referred within a secondary gain context, which in turn has resulted in the development of specific assessment methods. Regarding prospective methods for detecting possible response bias, both symptom validity tests, for measuring over-reporting of symptoms on inventories and questionnaires, and performance validity tests, for measuring insufficient effort on ability tests, are considered essential.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multi-faceted, often chronic syndrome that may develop following an exposure to a highly-traumatic event. Given the complexity, heterogeneity, and incomplete theoretical description of this disorder, computational models of PTSD are an important tool to help understand the mechanisms, and course, of symptom presentation and maintenance in PTSD. This chapter reviews several computational modeling approaches and their implications for PTSD, including models focused on fear learning and expression, changes in arousal and reactivity, avoidance, changes in cognition and mood and intrusive recollection. It also discusses the limitations of each approach, and suggests possible directions for future research that could both advance our understanding of PTSD and help move toward a comprehensive computational account of this disorder.
