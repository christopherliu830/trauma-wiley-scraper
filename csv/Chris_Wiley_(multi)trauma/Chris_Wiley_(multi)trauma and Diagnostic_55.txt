AB  - Background PTSD in youth may lead to long-lasting psychological implications, educational difficulties and increased healthcare costs. Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological interventions for children and young people with PTSD. Methods A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 10 psychological interventions and no treatment for children and young people with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion. Results Cognitive therapy for PTSD, a form of individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), appeared to be the most cost-effective intervention for children and young people with PTSD (with a probability of .78 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY), followed by narrative exposure (another form of individual TF-CBT), play therapy, and other forms of individual TF-CBT. After excluding cognitive therapy from the analysis, narrative exposure appeared to be the most cost-effective option with a .40 probability of being cost-effective amongst the remaining 10 options. EMDR, parent training and group TF-CBT occupied middle cost-effectiveness rankings. Family therapy and supportive counselling were less cost-effective than other active interventions. There was limited evidence for some interventions, in particular cognitive therapy for PTSD and parent training. Conclusions Individual forms of TF-CBT and, to a lesser degree, play therapy appear to be cost-effective in the treatment of children and young people with PTSD. Family therapy and supportive counselling are unlikely to be cost-effective relative to other interventions. There is a need for well-conducted studies that examine the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological treatments for children and young people with PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. Procedure This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m2/day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m2/day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Results Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m2/day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10?3 by polymerase chain reaction?based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Conclusions Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m2/day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.

AB  - Summary Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an important dermatologic autoimmune disease. In many respects, it may be regarded as a model autoimmune disease due to its spectrum of autoimmune antibodies and involvement of different organ systems, as well as response to immunosuppressive agents which target B cells and T cells and their cytokines. A recently published article in this Journal summarized the most important knowledge about epidemiology, genetics, and immunology of LE. Here, the different clinical manifestations, diagnostic procedures and current therapeutic approaches will be described. Special emphasis is placed on different cutaneous manifestations of LE. In regard to treatment, the classic treatment approaches such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be described. Lastly, new therapeutic approaches with specific monoclonal antibodies which are currently used in systemic LE, such as belimumab (Benlysta?), will be addressed. The most recent developments in this area could have implications even for purely cutaneous forms of LE.

AB  - Abstract Objective: An innovative health?justice partnership was established to deliver legal assistance to women experiencing family violence who attended an Australian hospital. This paper reports on a multifaceted response to build capacity and willingness of health professionals to identify signs of family violence and engage with referral pathways to on-site legal assistance. Methods: A Realistic Evaluation analysed health professionals? knowledge and attitudes towards identification, response and referral for family violence before and after training; and use of referral pathways. Results: Of 123 health professionals participating in training, 67 completed baseline and follow-up surveys. Training improved health professionals? self-reported knowledge of, and confidence in, responding to family violence and understanding of lawyers? roles in hospitals. Belief that patients should be referred to on-site legal services increased. Training did not correspond to actual increased referrals to legal assistance. Conclusion: The program built capacity and willingness of health professionals to identify signs of, and respond to, family violence. Increase in referral rates to legal assistance was not shown. Potential improvements include better data capture and greater availability of legal services. Implications for public health: Strong hospital system supports and reliable recording of family violence referrals need to be in place before introducing such partnerships to other hospitals.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the extent of visual recovery after multi-disciplinary approach of treatment in serious ocular injuries; to determine the prognostic factors associated with poor final visual outcome and suggest adequate precautionary measures. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 325 consecutive patients with direct ocular trauma who were examined and treated at a tertiary eye care centre in South India over a 3-year period was undertaken. Results: Males (86.8%) outnumbered the females (13.2%) and children (<16 years) constituted 46.8% of the total affected population. Anterior segment was involved in 51.1%, the posterior segment in 8.9% and both anterior and posterior segments were involved in 31.4% of patients. Prompt and meticulous surgical treatment restored useful vision (better than or equal to 6/18) in 60.5% of patients. Post-treatment, a reduction in blindness and visual impairment rates in the affected eye with respect to WHO classification was 66.7 and 54.1% respectively (P < 0.0001). Two eyes needed prompt enucleation. The factors associated with visual impairment (visual acuity less than 6/18) were poor initial visual acuity, full chamber hyphema, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and vitreous haemorrhage. Conclusions: Direct ocular trauma remains an important potentially preventable cause of ocular morbidity, but the advent of modern surgical techniques can often restore useful vision in such situations. Mandatory use of protective eye wear at work, public health education including awareness on the part of parents to the potential dangers of some childrens? toys can to an extent help reduce ocular morbidity due to direct ocular trauma.

AB  - Summary Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a limb- and life-threatening condition that necessitates prompt recognition and treatment. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of ALI. Diagnostic and therapeutic treatment strategies are presented in the context of the best available evidence in the field. The primary causes for ALI may be categorized into two major groups: embolic and thrombotic. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) may be less desirable in a patient with underlying anemia or risk of bleeding, since systemic effects of thrombolytic agents may worsen these issues. The initial treatment of a patient with a cold limb and high suspicion for ALI should include the institution of intravenous unfractionated heparin. The administration of aspirin, while generally recommended for primary or secondary prevention purposes, can be considered in most patients presenting with ALI, assuming no drug allergy or concurrent bleeding diathesis.

AB  - Abstract Although the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high among those with severe mental illness, little is known about the use of interventions to lessen the burden of PTSD in this population. Currently, there are limited data about safe and effective interventions to treat these individuals. This systematic published work review presents the scientific published work reporting studies of psychological treatment approaches for individuals with comorbid PTSD and severe mental illness. A secondary aim of this study was to identify the specific models implemented and tested, and their impact upon patient outcomes. A review of the published work from January 2001 through January 2012 of English-language publications retrieved from the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, and the American Psychological Association generated abstracts (PsycINFO) databases was conducted. Six studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The treatment programs described were cognitive?behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, exposure-based cognitive?behavioural therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Evidence of the effectiveness of these programs is examined. Data to support the use of these interventions are limited, indicating the need for further research and efficacy trials. Future areas of research and implications for nursing are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Shoulder injuries are a commonly presenting complaint to the ED. In the absence of an obvious deformity, they can be difficult to assess and definitively diagnose because of the multiple structures that cause shoulder pain, the acuity and severity of pain and the lack of range of motion in the ED setting. The quality of ED care provided to patients with musculoskeletal shoulder pain is crucial to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common shoulder injuries and conditions in the ED. Databases were searched in 2017, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines published in English-language in the past 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management, follow-up plan or prognosis were considered for inclusion. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence. The search revealed 1902 articles, of which 73 were included in the review (n =?12 primary articles, n =?49 systematic reviews and n =?12 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians who manage shoulder dislocations, fractures and soft tissue injuries in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. There is strong evidence to support taking a thorough history and physical examination, with cautious use of special tests because of their poor diagnostic accuracy. Key points regarding the diagnosis and management of these injuries are provided.

AB  - Summary Background Early results from the use of neuromodulation by percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in horses were promising but lacked sufficient case numbers and long-term follow-up. The neuromodulatory procedure has since been established as EquiPENS?. Objectives The aim of this study was to report long-term results from a larger number of cases and to investigate for predictors of outcome. Study design Prospective case series using international, multi-centre data. Methods Eligible cases were horses with a veterinary diagnosis of trigeminal-mediated headshaking, which received EquiPENS? neuromodulation at trained centres between August 2013 and November 2017. The standard protocol was an initial three-procedure course, with additional procedures should a horse go into remission but then relapse. Data collected included signalment, history, diagnostic tests performed, details of any complications, whether horses had gone into remission and the length of remission. Results Results were obtained from 168 horses, with 530 procedures. The complication rate was 8.8% of procedures. In all but one case, complications were mild and transient, without self-trauma. Remission of headshaking following the initial course occurred in 53% (72/136) of horses. Median length of time recorded in remission was 9.5 weeks (range 2 days to 156 weeks ongoing). Where signs recurred, most horses went back into remission following additional procedures, usually for longer than from the previous procedure. No predictors for outcome were determined. Main limitations No placebo or control group, owner-assessed results. Conclusions EquiPENS? neuromodulation can be an effective and safe treatment for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in some horses. An increased understanding of neuromodulation could help optimise the technique. Advances in treatment for trigeminal-mediated headshaking will remain limited until there is a greater understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the condition.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the aetiological associations, neurological sequelae and role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in term newborn infants with seizures. Methods Cohort study of infants ≥37 weeks' gestation delivered in a tertiary level centre, prospectively identified and followed longitudinally for 18?24 months. Results An underlying aetiology was found in 95% of the 77 infants identified with seizures (3.0/1000 live births). The most common diagnosis was hypoxic?ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) (65%), followed by neonatal stroke (12%). Nine infants died, 28 of the 68 survivors developed neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), and 15 had recurrent seizures in the first 2 years, with both outcomes more likely in those with a diagnosis other than HIE. Abnormal MRI findings were found in 45 of the 70 infants imaged. The absence of major cerebral lesions was highly predictive of a normal neurological outcome. Conclusion We report the first cohort of term infants with seizures fully investigated by MRI. The universal use of MRI enabled a cause to be identified in 95% of cases. The probability of having NDI or recurrence of seizures was extremely low with absence of major cerebral lesions on MRI. This study demonstrates the added value of MRI for diagnosis of aetiology and the prediction of neurological outcome.

AB  - Summary The main approaches to the classification of mental disorders put forward by GPs are described, and contrasted with those suggested by psychiatrists, and adapted to the conditions of primary care. Some differences exist between the kinds of disorder seen in the two settings, especially the comorbidity with physical illness in primary care. Classifications should be derived from existing nosologies by a process of condensation and simplification, although the psychiatrist's concept of ?somatoform disorder? is a far cry from the GP's necessary concept of ?unexplained somatic symptoms?. Special problems of classification at each end of the life cycle are described, and the importance of assessing the disability associated with mental disorders. The form and structure of common mental disorders in primary care does not vary widely across countries or cultures, although inevitably there are local variations in prevalence. The sheer size of the problem in primary care necessitates special training not just for medical officers but also for all other primary care staff.

Methods Eighteen consecutive patients of TSD were included in the study from March 2011 to March 2015, and the medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. There were 14 men and 4 women with an average age of 33.1?±?1.4 years (range, 18?55 years). A total of 16 cases were caused by falling, and 2 cases were caused by traffic accident. All sacral fractures had associated injuries. According to the morphology of sacral fracture, U-shaped fractures were present in 10 cases, H-shaped fractures in 6 cases, and Y-shaped fractures in 2 cases. According to Roy?Camille classification, there were 12 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. All patients received surgical treatment with modified bilateral triangular fixation, and the sacral plexus decompression was performed simultaneously on 6 cases whose scores were more than 2 according to Gibbons classification and were found having traumatic canal stenosis or sacral nerve compression detected by preoperative imaging examination. Mears? radiological evaluation criterion was applied to evaluate the reduction quality of fractures; Gibbons score was applied as the index of neurological deficiency healing, and the clinical outcome of fracture was evaluated with Majeed function assessment at last follow-up. Results All patients were followed up continuously within an average of 32.4?±?3.6?months (range, 22?48?months). All sacral fractures were healed in an average time of 11.3?±?2.8?months (range, 8?28?months). According to the Majeed function evaluation, 12 cases were classified as excellent, 4 cases as good, and 2 cases as fair. Meanwhile, the anatomical reduction was obtained in 11 cases, satisfactory reduction in 6 cases, and unsatisfactory reduction in 1 case according to Mears? radiological evaluation criterion. The average Gibbons score changed from 2.5?±?0.2 preoperatively to 1.4?±?0.5 24?months postoperatively, which had a significant difference (t?=?2.15, P?<?0.05). Conclusion Modified triangular fixation combined with internal fixations shows satisfactory clinical outcomes in the treatment of TSD, which is recommended as an effective and advanced surgical choice.

AB  - Summary Background Colletotrichum is a rare cause of human infection. Previous reports about Colletotrichum keratitis were limited, and most diagnoses from past reports were based on morphological distinction, which could have led to underestimation of the prevalence of Colletotrichum species. Objective We reported phylogenetic analysis, clinical feature and treatment outcome of molecularly diagnosed Colletotrichum keratitis in our hospital. Patients/Methods We recruited 65 patients with culture-proven filamentous fungal keratitis between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. Through molecular sequencing including internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of fungal DNA, seven patients were verified as infected with Colletotrichum species, and their medical records were reviewed to determine the clinical characteristics. Results Six of seven patients had predisposing factors including trauma (5) and immunosuppressive status (1). Six isolates were initially misidentified as other fungi through morphological identification. ITS sequencing identified the isolates belonged to two species complex (SC): C. truncatum and C. gloeosporioides; multi-locus phylogenetic analysis enabled species identification including C. tropicale (3), C. fructicola (2), C. truncatum (1) and C. fusiforme (1). Five patients with C. gloeosporioides SC responded well to medical treatment and two patients with C truncatum SC underwent evisceration because of either no visual potential or intractable pain. Conclusions The molecular approach provides accurate diagnosis and raises epidemiological awareness of Colletotrichum keratitis. Through multi-locus phylogenetic analysis, we report the human infections caused by C. tropicale, C. fructicola and C. fusiforme. We also highlight the different clinical outcomes between C. gloeosporioides SC and C. truncatum SC.

AB  - Abstract Background The intranasal (IN) route for rapid drug administration in patients with brain disorders, including status epilepticus, has been investigated. Status epilepticus is an emergency, and the IN route offers a valuable alternative to other routes, especially when these fail. Objectives To compare IN versus IV midazolam (MDZ) at the same dosage (0.2?mg/kg) for controlling status epilepticus in dogs. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 44) with idiopathic epilepsy, structural epilepsy, or epilepsy of unknown origin manifesting as status epilepticus. Methods Randomized parallel group clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated to the IN-MDZ (n = 21) or IV-MDZ (n = 23) group. Number of successfully treated cases (defined as seizure cessation within 5?minutes and lasting for ≥10?minutes), seizure cessation time, and adverse effects were recorded. Comparisons were performed using the Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests with statistical significance set at α?<?.05. Results IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ successfully stopped status epilepticus in 76% and 61% of cases, respectively (P = .34). The median seizure cessation time was 33 and 64?seconds for IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ, respectively (P = .63). When the time to place an IV catheter was taken into account, IN-MDZ (100?seconds) was superior (P = .04) to IV-MDZ (270?seconds). Sedation and ataxia were seen in 88% and 79% of the dogs treated with IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Both routes are quick, safe, and effective for controlling status epilepticus. However, the IN route demonstrated superiority when the time needed to place an IV catheter was taken into account.

AB  - ABSTRACT We report our experience of 42 patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrating intrinsic lesions of the spinal cord, excluding those secondary to spondylosis, trauma or congenital malformations. Histological confirmation of the radiological diagnosis was obtained in 15 (36%). MRI is more sensitive than either myelography or CT. MRI identified a previously non-visualised lesion in 17 of 30 cases. In a further 13 cases, MRI contributed by identifying associated features such as cysts and haemorrhage which have aided in the diagnosis and management of the patients. The last 12 cases, which were patients with multiple sclerosis, had MRI as the only neuroradiological examination. These illustrate a range of appearances. The overlap of imaging appearances of the various pathologies implies that a useful diagnosis and differential can only be offered by considering the MRI appearances of a lesion, with its associated features, with the clinical presentation, and with other imaging modalities where appropriate.

AB  - Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MR technique that depicts and quantifies magnetic susceptibility sources. Mapping iron, the dominant susceptibility source in the brain, has many important clinical applications. Herein, we review QSM applications in the diagnosis, medical management, and surgical treatment of disease. To assist in early disease diagnosis, QSM can identify elevated iron levels in the motor cortex of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, in the globus pallidus, putamen, and caudate of Huntington's disease patients, and in the basal ganglia of Wilson's disease patients. Additionally, QSM can distinguish between hemorrhage and calcification, which could prove useful in tumor subclassification, and can measure microbleeds in traumatic brain injury patients. In guiding medical management, QSM can be used to monitor iron chelation therapy in PD patients, to monitor smoldering inflammation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions after the blood?brain barrier (BBB) seals, to monitor active inflammation of MS lesions before the BBB seals without using gadolinium, and to monitor hematoma volume in intracerebral hemorrhage. QSM can also guide neurosurgical treatment. Neurosurgeons require accurate depiction of the subthalamic nucleus, a tiny deep gray matter nucleus, prior to inserting deep brain stimulation electrodes into the brains of PD patients. QSM is arguably the best imaging tool for depiction of the subthalamic nucleus. Finally, we discuss future directions, including bone QSM, cardiac QSM, and using QSM to map cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The histological distinction between dermatofibroma (DF) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) may be difficult. CD34 and Factor XIIIa have been used to differentiate DF from DFSP, but there is a lack of specificity. CD44 is a membrane glycoprotein which has multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing of variant exons. CD44 is the principal cell surface receptor for hyaluronate (HA). In this study we explored the expression of standard CD44 (CD44s) and its isoforms (CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7, CD44v7v8, and CD44v10), and HA in DF and DFSP. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the biopsy specimens of 15 cases of DF and 4 cases of DFSP, using antibodies for the CD44s and its isoforms, and hyaluronate binding protein (HABP). Tumor cells displayed a strong CD44s immunoreactivity in all cases of DF whereas a faint HA positivity was observed in the tumor stroma. DF cells were negative for CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v6, CD44v7 and CD44v7v8 but they showed a strong reactivity for CD44v5 and CD44v10. CD44s expression was significantly reduced or absent in all DFSP lesions and the tumor stroma displayed a strong staining for HA. Our results indicate that CD44 and HA can be used as additional diagnostic markers to distinguish DF from DFSP.

AB  - Objective:? To examine associations between exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and clinical patterns of symptoms and disorders in preschool children. Method:? Two hundred and thirteen referred and non-referred children, ages 24 to 48 months (MN = 34.9, SD = 6.7 months) were studied. Lifetime exposure to PTEs (family violence and non-interpersonal events) and recent stressful life events were assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) and Child Life Events Scale. Child psychiatric symptoms and disorders were assessed with parent-reports in the PAPA, a comprehensive, developmentally sensitive interview. Sociodemographic risk, parental anxiety and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression, Beck Anxiety Inventory), and child developmental level (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) also were assessed. Results:? Violence exposure was broadly associated with psychiatric status in the areas of depression, separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and conduct problems, whereas potentially traumatic non-interpersonal exposure was associated with phobic anxiety. The majority of the associations between violence exposure and preschoolers? symptoms were significant even when other key factors, including economic disadvantage and parental mood and anxiety symptoms, were controlled statistically. However, parental depressive/anxious symptoms may have partially or fully mediated the relationships between violence exposure and depressive and conduct symptoms. Conclusions:? Evidence of robust associations between violence exposure and early childhood internalizing and externalizing disorders and symptoms highlights the need for longitudinal prospective research concerning neurodevelopmental mechanisms and pathways. Findings underscore the relevance of assessing trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence, to identify young children at risk.
