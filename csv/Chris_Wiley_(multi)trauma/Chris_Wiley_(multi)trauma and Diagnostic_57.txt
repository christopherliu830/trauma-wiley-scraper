AB  - Abstract Patients presenting with swelling arising from the floor of the mouth (FOM) should be examined prudently, with the aid of appropriate diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography, ultrasound guided aspirational biopsy, CT with contrast or MRI. Clinicians should include even the rare occurrences, like lipomas, especially while categorising intra-oral lesions because this can impede appropriate surgical planning, which can consequently cause recurrence or even malignant transformation of the lesion. This case report presents a painless sublingual lipoma situated on the left side of the FOM. The size gradually increased and eventually interfered with the movement of tongue and swallowing that was initially attributed as either sublingual cyst (dermoid/epidermoid) or ranula. Although lipomas are considered to originate at any site in the body, their incidence in the oral cavity is rare (1%?4%). In the present case, a sublingual lipoma presented as a painless and slow-growing swelling located on the left side of FOM associated with restricted tongue movement. Complete resection of the lesion was performed with the preservation of Wharton?s duct, lingual nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Post-operative recovery was uneventful and subsequent follow-up was satisfactory showing no sign of wound dehiscence or infection. The salivary flow was normal in both Wharton?s ducts.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sporadic measurement of serum triglycerides in depressed and inappetant clinically ill horses revealed severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible evidence of lipaemia on several occasions, leading to the inclusion of serum triglyceride concentrations in the routine serum biochemistry evaluation of our hospital. Since then, more cases have been identified and treated for hypertriglyceridaemia, raising questions about the prevalence, predisposing factors and significance of these findings. Hypotheses: 1) Severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible opacity of the serum occurs more commonly in clinically ill and inappetant horses than previously described and 2) appropriate treatment using i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition would decrease serum triglycerides to normal limits and might result in improved appetite and attitude of the patient. Methods: The laboratory computer database from 2000 and 2001 was searched for increased serum triglycerides (>5.65 mmol/l) in any horse breed, ponies and miniature breeds excluded. Data analysed included subject details, diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, treatment, response to treatment and outcome. Results: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in 13 horses, with serum triglyceride concentrations 6.17?18.29 mmol/l, while none showed visible lipaemia. All horses had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and all but one had an increased serum creatinine concentration. Treatment with i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition resulted in decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Conclusions: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in inappetant and clinically ill horses without evidence of serum opacity more commonly than previously described. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose horses to hypertriglyceridaemia, while the increased creatinine concentration might be a predisposing factor or result of the condition. Horses identified in our study readily responded to treatment and appetite and attitude improved coincident with decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Potential relevance: Hypertriglyceridaemia could perpetuate inappetance and depression in clinically ill horses and potentially predispose to fatty infiltration of the liver and other organ systems.

AB  - Background: Unplanned readmissions serve as a marker for health care quality. Risk factors associated with unplanned readmission after microvascular free tissue transfer have never been examined. In this study, we sought to identify perioperative predictors of 30-day unplanned readmission in free flap patients. Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients who underwent microvascular free tissue transfer in 2011. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate independent predictors of unplanned readmission. Results: Among free flap patients, unplanned readmission rate was 7.9%. In multivariate analysis, the only factor that significantly predicted unplanned readmission (P?<?0.05) was open wound/wound infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.71). Postoperative variables significantly associated with unplanned readmission included surgical complications (OR 5.43), medical complications (OR 5.62), and unplanned reoperation (OR 3.94). Flap failure was not associated with unplanned readmission. Conclusions: In our study, the presence of either open wound/wound infection, development of surgical complications, medical complications, and unplanned reoperations were associated with unplanned readmissions. Further research in predictive factors is suggested to avoid costly, unnecessary, and preventable readmissions. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 35:13?20, 2015.

AB  - Retinal haemorrhages (RH) in a young child suggest child abuse, yet other causes merit consideration. This systematic review addresses non-traumatic causes of RH in children with one or more overlapping clinical features of abuse (bruising, fractures, intracranial haemorrhage). Searching 12 databases (1950?2009) identified 338 studies for review by two reviewers. Inclusion criteria included: children?<?15?years examined by an ophthalmologist detailing retinal findings, confirmed organic cause and exclusion of abuse. Exclusion criteria included: diagnosed coagulopathy, ocular mass lesion and post-mortem cases. Twenty included studies identified nine relevant conditions (metabolic diseases, bony dysplasias, bleeding disorders and vascular malformations). Where detailed, the RH were bilateral and involved only one area of the retina (the posterior pole). Among proposed confounders of RH, no child with a cough (100 children) or acute life-threatening event (184 cases) had RH. Just two of 217 children with seizures had posterior pole RH, one unilateral and one bilateral. One cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) study (43 cases) was included where a child with co-existent clotting abnormalities had tiny (bilateral dot) RH after 60 minutes? resuscitation. Child abuse remains the commonest cause of RH in young children, although rarer disorders merit consideration. There are insufficient data to conclude that CPR is a confounder in children with RH. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ?Searching 12 databases (1950?2009) identified 338 studies for review? ?There are insufficient data to conclude that CPR is a confounder in children with RH? Key Practitioner Message Retinal Haemorrhages are strongly associated with Abusive Head Trauma, but have been described in certain medical conditions. Neither cough nor ALTE are associated with RH, which have been found in <?3% of children with seizures. There are inadequate data to conclude that CPR is associated with RH. Case series have reported RH in children who also have clinical features that may overlap with physical abuse, namely certain metabolic, vascular, haematologic disorders and bony dysplasias (specifically osteogenesis imperfecta).

AB  - Abstract Unlocking the secrets of the brain is a task fraught with complexity and challenge ? not least due to the intricacy of the circuits involved. With advancements in the scale and precision of scientific technologies, we are increasingly equipped to explore how these components interact to produce a vast range of outputs that constitute function and disease. Here, an insight is offered into key areas in which the marriage of neuroscience and nanotechnology has revolutionized the industry. The evolution of ever more sophisticated nanomaterials culminates in network-operant functionalized agents. In turn, these materials contribute to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including drug delivery, neuroprotection, neural regeneration, neuroimaging and neurosurgery. Further, the entrance of nanotechnology into future research arenas including optogenetics, molecular/ion sensing and monitoring, and piezoelectric effects is discussed. Finally, considerations in nanoneurotoxicity, the main barrier to clinical translation, are reviewed, and direction for future perspectives is provided.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To analyse and evaluate the correlation between traumatic head injuries (THIs) and maxillofacial fractures (MF). Age, gender and trauma mechanism correlated with THI were also investigated. Patients and Methods We conducted a hospital-based retrospective case?control study at Stomatology College and Hospital, Wuhan University. From January 2000 to December 2009, a total of 1131 patients with MF were enrolled in the statistical study to evaluate the association of THI and other risk factors with MF. Among these patients, 86 presented with THI. We utilized binary logistic regression and risk analysis to investigate the associations among MF and other risk factors with HI. Results Head injuries (103 injuries) were sustained by 86 patients (7.6%), with male-to-female ratio of 4.1:1.0. Most of the patients (52 patients, 50.5%) also exhibited cranial bone fractures. The age group with most patients was the 30?39 years age group (26 patients, 30.2%), followed by the 19?29 years age group (22 patients, 25.6%). Motor vehicle accident (MVA) was the most common mechanism of injury (49 patients, 74.1%). Patients older than 50 years showed the highest risk for head injury (OR, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1?3.7; P = 0.025). MVA had a sixfold risk of head injury (OR, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5?26.1; P = 0.013). Head injuries were more prone to occur in patients who had combined fracture of the mid-face and mandible (OR = 4.6, P < 0.001), and only a 0.3-fold risk of multimandible fractures (P < 0.001), 0.5-fold risk of single mandibular fracture (P = 0.017) and 0.3-fold risk of patients who sustained only single mandibular condylar fracture (P = 0.019). Conclusions The occurrence of head injuries is significantly related to age, aetiology and the pattern and position of maxillofacial fractures.

AB  - Abstract This unit discusses an approach to identifying a genetic etiology in an individual with nonsyndromic hearing loss. The unit begins with a discussion of the decision-making process that can be used to determine whether specific genes and/or a large gene panel should be used for molecular diagnosis of a patient presenting with nonsyndromic hearing loss. Next, two protocols are presented: (1) a full gene-sequencing assay to identify mutations in the GJB2 gene (encoding connexin 26), the most common cause of congenital hearing loss, and (2) an assay to detect the presence of the GJB6-D13S1830 deletion, a 342-kb deletion that causes hearing loss in homozygosity or in combination with a single GJB2 mutation. Finally, the unit ends with a strategy for determining the clinical significance of the test results, which can be challenging given the extensive genetic heterogeneity associated with hearing loss.

AB  - Abstract Seven large European Union (EU)?funded epilepsy-related research projects joined forces in May 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, in a unique community building event?the epiXchange conference. During this conference, 170 investigators from the projects DESIRE, EpimiRNA, EPISTOP, EpiTarget, EpiXchange, and EpiPGX as well as the European Reference Network EpiCARE, met up with key stakeholders including representatives of the European Commission, patient organizations, commercial partners, and other European and International groups. The epiXchange conference focused on sharing and reviewing the advances made by each project in the previous 5 years; describing the infrastructures generated; and discussing the innovations and commercial applications across five thematic areas: biomarkers, genetics, therapeutics, comorbidities, and biobanks and resources. These projects have, in fact, generated major breakthroughs including the discovery of biofluid-based molecules for diagnosis, elucidating new genetic causes of epilepsy, creating advanced new models of epilepsy, and the pre-clinical development of novel compounds. Workshop-style discussions focused on how to overcome scientific and clinical challenges for accelerating translation of research outcomes and how to increase synergies between the projects and stakeholders at a European level. The resulting advances would lead toward a measurable impact of epilepsy research through better diagnostics, treatments, and quality-of-life for persons with epilepsy. In addition, epiXchange provided a unique forum for examining how the different projects could build momentum for future novel groundbreaking epilepsy research in Europe and beyond. This report includes the main recommendations that resulted from these discussions.

AB  - Abstract Objective Abdominal pain is a common paediatric presentation to the ED. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging, with the best-performing clinical scoring systems having sensitivities between 72% and 100%. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to seniority in diagnosing paediatric acute appendicitis in ED. Methods This is a prospective multi-centre observational study of clinician's prediction of appendicitis in children under the age of 16?years presenting to four EDs with abdominal pain over a 1 month period at each site. Clinician-estimated likelihood of acute appendicitis was compared with the final diagnosis determined by histopathology or operative findings and supplemented by telephone follow up for those without an operation. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to clinician seniority in diagnosing appendicitis. Results There were 381 children enrolled with completed clinician questionnaires, and 224 children had complete follow up or underwent appendicectomy. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range 6?12) and the incidence of appendicitis was 31/224 (13.8%, 95% confidence interval 9.3?18.4). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of clinician gestalt were 0.84 (0.76?0.91), 81% (63?93%), 76% (69?82%), 35% (28?42%) and 96% (92?98%), respectively, giving an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76% (70?82%). AUC stratified by clinician seniority (junior, intermediate and senior) were 0.89 (0.80?0.98), 0.82 (0.69?0.95) and 0.76 (0.56?0.96), respectively. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of ED clinician gestalt in paediatric appendicitis is comparable to current clinical scoring systems irrespective of seniority.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of social support and coping strategies in enhancing post-traumatic growth (PTG) in cancer patients. The study focused on both avoidance and approaching coping and on four distinct types of social support: (a) perceived availability, (b) actual received, (c) satisfaction with received support, and (d) the competence of caregiver to satisfy the patient's basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted with a group of 41 cancer patients currently in the treatment and management phase of their illness. Data were collected by means of a written questionnaire, at two time points (T1 and T2) that were 6 months apart. Social support was assessed using the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and the Need Satisfaction in Relationship Scale. Coping strategies were assessed using the Brief COPE questionnaire. Social support and coping strategies were assessed only at T1. PTG was assessed using the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory at T1 and T2. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the association between social support and coping strategies with short-term reports of post-traumatic growth. Results: Regression analyses showed that autonomy-supportive caregivers and a problem-focused strategy of coping significantly predicted greater PTG at T2. Conclusions: This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the type of social support that may specifically aid cancer patients in experiencing PTG. Furthermore, findings confirm the important role of problem-focused coping strategies in growing psychologically. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
