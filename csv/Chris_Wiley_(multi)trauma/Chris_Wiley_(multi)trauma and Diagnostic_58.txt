AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season. Restoration of fertility in this study was lower than that previously reported and potential reasons for this include limited pre-surgical diagnostic testing, differing prior pathologies or reasons for sub-fertility, and case selection.

AB  - Establishing methods for ascertainment of dementia and cognitive impairment that are accurate and also cost-effective is a challenging enterprise. Large population-based studies often using administrative data sets offer relatively inexpensive and reliable estimates of severe conditions including moderate to advanced dementia that are useful for public health planning, but they can miss less severe cognitive impairment which may be the most effective point for intervention. Clinical and epidemiological cohorts, intensively assessed, provide more sensitive detection of less severe cognitive impairment but are often costly. In this article, several approaches to ascertainment are evaluated for validity, reliability, and cost. In particular, the methods of ascertainment from the Health and Retirement Study are described briefly, along with those of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS). ADAMS, a resource-intense sub-study of the Health and Retirement Study, was designed to provide diagnostic accuracy among persons with more advanced dementia. A proposal to streamline future ADAMS assessments is offered. Also considered are algorithmic and Web-based approaches to diagnosis that can reduce the expense of clinical expertise and, in some contexts, can reduce the extent of data collection. These approaches are intended for intensively assessed epidemiological cohorts where goal is valid and reliable case detection with efficient and cost-effective tools.

AB  - Summary.? Platelets play a pivotal role in the arrest of bleeding at sites of vascular injury. Following endothelial damage, they respond rapidly by adhesion to subendothelial matrix proteins resulting in platelet activation, spreading, aggregation, secretion and recruitment of additional platelets to form the primary haemostatic plug. This mass provides a surface for thrombin generation and fibrin mesh formation that stabilizes the clot. Careful study of patients with inherited platelet disorders and, subsequently, of informative animal models, has identified structural platelet abnormalities that have enhanced our understanding of platelet function. The investigations of rare, but severe, inherited platelet disorders have led us to the discovery of causative molecular defects. One of the most informative is the rare autosomal recessive disorder Glanzmann thrombasthenia, caused by defect or deficiency in the platelet integrin αIIb?3, resulting in absent platelet aggregation and a significant clinical bleeding diathesis. Our new challenge is to understand the mechanisms underlying more common, but less well-defined, mucocutaneous bleeding (MCB) disorders. Present diagnostic testing for platelet function disorders and von Willebrand?s Disease often fails to identify the cause of bleeding in individuals with inherited MCB.

AB  - Abstract Surgical site infections (SSI) are infectious complications that manifest at the incision site of a surgical patient, and are the result of a combination of host, pathogen, and environmental factors resulting in the establishment of infection. Because of the high prevalence of cruciate ligament rupture, and the popularity of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO), more studies have focused on this procedure than on any other stifle procedure. Extracapsular techniques for cruciate ligament stabilization have generally been associated with a lesser risk of infection. Even though SSI can occur up to a year postoperatively, most infections are diagnosed within the first couple of months after surgery. Radiographic signs of infection are generally mild and non-specific unless the infection is severe and chronic. Infections associated with the implant that develops after bone consolidation is often treated by implant removal, followed by a short course of antibiotics.

AB  - Objectives To define a uroflowmetry-based non-invasive predictive tool for the primary diagnosis of urethral stricture disease. Methods A total of 300 male patients (150 with urethral stricture disease and 150 with benign prostatic obstruction), treated surgically between 2005 and 2015, and 75 healthy males were included in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups (75 benign prostatic obstruction patients and 75 urethral stricture disease patients in each group). A model, able to objectively differentiate between benign prostatic obstruction and urethral stricture disease, was created by use of original and hybrid uroflowmetry variables in logistic regression in group A (test group). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used for validation in group B (validation group) and to calculate cut-off values to distinguish healthy individuals from benign prostatic obstruction as a result of urethral stricture disease. Results Receiver operating characteristics area under the curve values of the created model were 0.841 (0.777?0.905) and 0.807 (0.735?0.879) in groups A and B, respectively. Optimal cut-off values were 2.2847 and 0.1182 to distinguish healthy individuals versus benign prostatic obstruction and benign prostatic obstruction versus urethral stricture disease. Conclusions A triphasic uroflowmetry-based model is able to objectively distinguish voiding patterns of healthy individuals, benign prostatic obstruction and urethral stricture disease. The probability of urethral stricture disease can be objectively calculated for each individual patient based on a non-invasive uroflowmetry test. Uroflowmetry pattern interpretation by use of statistical models could become a new standard.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To perform a retrospective audit of cases of uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM) at The Canberra Hospital and review of recent literature reporting pregnancies occurring after the diagnosis of UAVM aiming to devise a diagnostic and treatment protocol to optimise pregnancy post UAVM. Methods: A retrospective audit of cases of UAVM at the Canberra Hospital from a prospectively managed patient database was performed. A search of the electronic database PubMed, for articles between 2000?2011 relating to pregnancy post UAVM. Individual case studies were analysed separately to case series. Results: The study included 28 individual studies and five case series (61 women). Average age was 29.5 ± 6.7 (range 18?42). Most women (24, 85.7%, 100% in case series) presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding; 11 (41%) individuals presented post interruption of pregnancy. All women had had a previous pregnancy (mean gravidity 3.1 ± 3.1, range 1?15 for case studies) and only four women (14.2 %) had no history of uterine trauma. Only one woman (3.6 %) did not have any ultrasound and most women underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography (20, 71.4% in case studies; 61, 83.6% in case series). Of the women, 72 (53.6 % of case studies, 78.1 % of case series) were treated with uterine artery embolisation, seven (25%) were treated expectantly. A total of 63 pregnancies occurred post treatment, seven (13.9%) ending in miscarriage. Average time to conceive post diagnosis was 19 months ± 16.3 (range 2?72). A total of 54 healthy infants were born to mothers post AVM diagnosis. Conclusion: UAVM are likely to exist on a continuum with other pregnancy related pathologies, such as sub involution of the placental bed, making a single best diagnostic and treatment plan difficult. However, this study shows that successful uncomplicated pregnancy is achievable for women after the diagnosis of UAVM.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the purposes of assessments of symptoms and diagnostic criteria of anxiety disorders and discusses advantages and disadvantages of different formats. It refers to challenges associated with the assessment of anxiety symptoms and disorders in terms of diagnostic reliability, comorbidity, age, and sources of information. The chapter then delineates a selection of the most important clinical ratings and self-evaluation measures that can easily be used in standard clinical settings without modification. Though therapists are aware of the advances and benefits of diagnostic interviews, they prefer clinical judgments due to expected shorter duration, and consider the formalism of diagnostic interviews to lead to inflexibility and negative effects on the patient?therapist relationship. Finally, the chapter reports on the clinical significance and reliability of change and on some critical debates concerning clinical assessment.

AB  - Introduction Blood is often collected from performing poorly horses to measure blood variables that may indicate a reason. However, intense exercise affects many blood variables and therefore time of sampling can affect the interpretation of results. This study examined the behaviour of blood variables after racing to determine the magnitude of the changes and to determine when it is better to collect samples. Methods Blood was sampled in 17 Standardbred racehorses 3 and 2 days before as well as 2 and 3 days after racing. GGT, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, CK, AST, LDH and cortisol were measured in plasma, and haematocrit, haemoglobin, number of erythrocytes, total white blood cells, granulocytes and lymphocytes were measured in EDTA blood. Parametric data was analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher test; non-parametric data with Friedman test and Wilcoxon test. Results Plasma Ca concentration was lower on day 3 after racing than on day 2 before racing (P<0.01). P concentration and GGT activity were higher at days 2 and 3 after racing compared to before racing (P?=?0.01). Erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin were higher at day 2 after racing than before and 3 days after racing (P<0.01). The other variables were not affected. Conclusions Some slight but significant changes in blood variables have to be taken in account when interpreting biochemical and haematologic variables for poor performance diagnosis in Standardbreds. It seems preferable to take blood samples on the third day after racing than on the second day.

AB  - Summary The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary diagnostic process to determine the medical, psychological and functional capabilities of an older person in order to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and long-term follow-up. The CGA assesses the whole patient, and can reduce length of stay and institutionalization, and improve quality of life. Geriatric syndromes such as falls, delirium or immobility can be used to stream patients towards CGA interventions. Whilst integrating standard medical diagnostic evaluation, CGA emphasizes problem solving, functional status and prognosis, with the aim of restoring independence and alleviating distress. Typically, CGA involves a team of people from various disciplines (geriatric medicine, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, nursing) or a combination of these, working towards a shared common goal using standardized assessment tools, pathways and documentation. CGA produces a list of medical and non-medical problems, which can be constructed by any or all the members of the multidisciplinary care team.

AB  - Abstract Objective To characterize the effects of caregiver mental health and coping strategies on interactions with an injured adolescent acutely after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design Multi-site, cross-sectional study. Setting Outpatient setting of 3 tertiary pediatric hospitals and 2 tertiary general medical centers. Participants Adolescents (N = 125) aged 12-17 years, 1-6 months after being hospitalized with complicated mild to severe TBI. Methods Data were collected as part of a multi-site clinical trial of family problem-solving therapy after TBI. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of caregiver and environmental characteristics to the dimensions of effective communication, warmth, and negativity during caregiver-adolescent problem-solving discussions. Main Outcomes Measures Adolescent and caregiver interactions, as measured by the Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scales. Results Caregivers who utilized problem-focused coping strategies were rated as having higher levels of effective communication (P < .01), as were those with higher socioeconomic status (P < .01). Problem-focused coping style and higher socioeconomic status were also associated lower levels of negative interactions (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Female gender of the adolescent and fewer children in the home were associated with increased parental warmth during the interaction (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Neither adolescent TBI severity nor caregiver depression significantly influenced caregiver-teen interactions. Conclusions Problem-focused coping strategies are associated with higher levels of effective communication and lower levels of caregiver negativity during the initial months after adolescent TBI, suggesting that effective caregiver coping may facilitate better caregiver-adolescent interactions after TBI.

Liposarcomas are classified into five histologic subtypes: well-differentiated, dedifferentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic, which differ in outcomes and patterns of recurrence. Surgical resection is the mainstay of curative treatment; however, large, high grade liposarcomas may benefit from multimodality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. A histologic-subtype specific nomogram provides accurate survival predictions. Prospective randomized clinical trials will continue to improve our care of patients with liposarcoma. J. Surg.

AB  - A cat with a history of seizures and clinical suspicion of forebrain disorder underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the left temporal lobe. The mass was surgically removed, and cytological, histological and immunohistochemical examinations documented the presence of Toxoplasma gondii. A definitive diagnosis of an intracranial T gondii granuloma was made. The cat was treated with clindamycin and phenobarbital and the seizures did not recur. After 10 months, a second magnetic resonance imaging showed severe brain atrophy, but T gondii granuloma recurrence was not noted. Twenty-one months after surgery, the cat?s condition deteriorated, and another magnetic resonance imaging showed a presumptive recurrence of T gondii granuloma. In cats, T gondii granuloma must be considered as a differential diagnosis even when only a single intracranial mass is present. Cytology and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in making a definitive diagnosis and to follow the evolution of the lesion.

AB  - Purpose: To present the theory for image reconstruction of a high-pitch, high-temporal-resolution spiral scan mode for dual-source CT (DSCT) and evaluate its image quality and dose. Methods: With the use of two x-ray sources and two data acquisition systems, spiral CT exams having a nominal temporal resolution per image of up to one-quarter of the gantry rotation time can be acquired using pitch values up to 3.2. The scan field of view (SFOV) for this mode, however, is limited to the SFOV of the second detector as a maximum, depending on the pitch. Spatial and low contrast resolution, image uniformity and noise, CT number accuracy and linearity, and radiation dose were assessed using the ACR CT accreditation phantom, a 30 cm diameter cylindrical water phantom or a 32 cm diameter cylindrical PMMA CTDI phantom. Slice sensitivity profiles (SSPs) were measured for different nominal slice thicknesses, and an anthropomorphic phantom was used to assess image artifacts. Results were compared between single-source scans at and dual-source scans at . In addition, image quality and temporal resolution of an ECG-triggered version of the DSCT high-pitch spiral scan mode were evaluated with a moving coronary artery phantom, and radiation dose was assessed in comparison with other existing cardiac scan techniques. Results: No significant differences in quantitative measures of image quality were found between single-source scans at and dual-source scans at for spatial and low contrast resolution, CT number accuracy and linearity, SSPs, image uniformity, and noise. The pitch value had only a minor impact on radiation dose and image noise when the effective tube current time product (mA?s/pitch) was kept constant. However, while not severe, artifacts were found to be more prevalent for the dual-source scan mode when structures varied markedly along the axis, particularly for head scans. Images of the moving coronary artery phantom acquired with the ECG-triggered high-pitch scan mode were visually free from motion artifacts at heart rates of 60 and 70 bpm. However, image quality started to deteriorate for higher heart rates. At equivalent image quality, the ECG-triggered high-pitch scan mode demonstrated lower radiation dose than other cardiac scan techniques on the same DSCT equipment (25% and 60% dose reduction compared to ECG-triggered sequential step-and-shoot and ECG-gated spiral with x-ray pulsing). Conclusions: A high-pitch (up to), high-temporal-resolution (up to 75 ms) dual-source CT scan mode produced equivalent image quality relative to single-source scans using a more typical pitch value . The resultant reduction in the overall acquisition time may offer clinical advantage for cardiovascular, trauma, and pediatric CT applications. In addition, ECG-triggered high-pitch scanning may be useful as an alternative to ECG-triggered sequential scanning for patients with low to moderate heart rates up to 70 bpm, with the potential to scan the heart within one heart beat at reduced radiation dose.

AB  - Background: Several studies have shown that GTR therapy of intrabony defects results in significantly better outcomes than access flap alone. Most of the available data, however, have been produced in highly controlled research environments by a small group of investigators. Generalizability of results to different clinicians and different subject populations has not been evaluated so far. Methods: This parallel group study involved 143 patients recruited in a practicebased research network of 11 offices in 7 countries. It was designed to evaluate: 1) the applicability of the documented added benefits of GTR in the treatment of intrabony defects to different populations, and 2) the generalizability of the expected results to different clinicians. GTR was compared to access flap alone. Defects, one in each patient, were accessed with a previously described papilla preservation flap in both the test and control group. In addition, GTR sites received application of a bioabsorbable poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide membrane. A stringent plaque control regimen was enforced in all patients during the 1-year observation period. Outcomes included gains in clinical attachment (CAL) and reductions in probing depth. Results: Observed gains in CAL were 2.18 ± 1.46 mm for access flap and 3.04 ± 1.64 mm for the GTR-treated group. The treatment-associated difference was statistically significant (P = 0.03) after correcting for both center effect and defect anatomy. Among the various centers, a 1.73 mm difference in CAL gain was observed. This is a clinically relevant amount, which underlines the significance of center variability in the outcome of periodontal surgical procedures. A frequency distribution analysis of the obtained CAL gains indicated that GTR treatment of deep intrabony defects decreased, with respect to the access flap control, the probability of obtaining only a modest attachment gain at 1 year. Conversely, CAL gains of 4 mm or more were observed in more than 40% of GTR-treated defects and in less than 20% of the controls (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: These data indicate that GTR therapy of deep intrabony defects performed by different clinicians on various patient populations resulted in both greater amounts and improved predictability of CAL gains than access flap alone.

AB  - Severe variants of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) affect <2% of all FOP patients worldwide, but provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the phenotype?genotype relationships that propel the pathology of this disabling disease. We evaluated two unrelated children who had severe reduction deficits of the hands and feet with absence of nails, progressive heterotopic ossification, hypoplasia of the brain stem, motor and cognitive developmental delays, facial dysmorphology, small malformed teeth, and abnormal hair development. One child had sensorineural hearing loss, microcytic anemia, and a tethered spinal cord and the other had a patent ductus arteriosus and gonadal dysgenesis with sex reversal (karyotype 46, XY female). Both children had an identical mutation in ACVR1 c.772A>G; p.Arg258Gly (R258G), not previously described in FOP. Although many, if not most, FOP mutations directly perturb the structure of the GS regulatory subdomain and presumably the adjacent αC helix, substitution with glycine at R258 may directly alter the position of the helix in the kinase domain, eliminating a key aspect of the autoinhibitory mechanism intrinsic to the wild-type ACVR1 kinase. The high fidelity phenotype?genotype relationship in these unrelated children with the most severe FOP phenotype reported to date suggests that the shared features are due to the dysregulated activity of the mutant kinase during development and postnatally, and provides vital insight into the structural biology and function of ACVR1 as well as the design of small molecule inhibitors. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - We present a case of a male infant born to a 21 year-old mother without significant past medical history. Clinically, he presented with diffuse bullae and thickened patches of yellow to brown skin exhibiting Darier?s Sign. This condition affected the infant?s entire integument. There was also mild hepatosplenomegaly, detected radiologically. Blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy were normal. The differential diagnosis, clinically, included diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, bullous genodermatosis, epidermolysis bullosa, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, incontinentia pigmenti, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Histologically, there was a proliferation of mast cells within the papillary and reticular dermis, which exhibited positivity with Leder staining, thereby confirming the diagnosis of diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. Mastocytosis is a condition characterized by mast cell hyperplasia in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Diffuse cutaneous matocytosis is a rare subset limited to the skin. It occurs in about two percent of cases of mastocytosis and usually affects children before the age of three. This case, although extremely rare, gives an excellent overview of the differential diagnosis of bullous lesions in the pediatric population.

AB  - Abstract Molecularly, breast cancer represents a highly heterogenous family of neoplastic disorders, with substantial interpatient variations regarding genetic mutations, cell composition, transcriptional profiles, and treatment response. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient-by-patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA-specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene-therapy, while its catalytically-dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses. In this review, CRISPR strategies for the advancement of breast cancer diagnostics, modeling, and treatment are highlighted, culminating in a perspective on developing a precision medicine-based approach against breast cancer.

AB  - The histopathologic differential diagnosis of subepidermal blisters is broad and most commonly includes primary dermatologic diseases (i.e. bullous pemphigoid), secondary blistering conditions (i.e. bullous lichen planus), and drug reactions (i.e. toxic epidermal necrolysis); however, when examining blister specimens taken during autopsy, several other entities need to be added to the differential diagnosis. For one year, we biopsied cutaneous blisters and erosions found during autopsies performed at the Dallas County Medical Examiner?s Office and examined them histologically. The objective of this study was to determine the primary cause of blisters and erosions seen at autopsy, characterize them histologically in order to allow differentiation from other blistering conditions, and emphasize causes of subepidermal blisters that are often not considered in the differential diagnosis. We present eight representative cases in order to illustrate the following points. The majority of blisters and erosions examined were subepidermal and secondary to physical causes, such as burns, defibrillation, submersion, fetal maceration, and decomposition. Although primary skin conditions need to be considered when examining blisters and erosions at autopsy, the most common entities are secondary to physical causes, and these need to be included in the differential diagnosis in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.
