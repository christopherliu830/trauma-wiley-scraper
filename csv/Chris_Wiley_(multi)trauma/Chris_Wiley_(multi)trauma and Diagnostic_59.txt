AB  - Summary This case report describes a retrobulbar dermoid cyst in an 18-year-old pony with an invasive character into the frontal sinus. CT imaging was important for the appropriate management of this case and the definitive diagnosis was obtained from histopathology. Surgical excision was performed successfully without recurrence 1-year post-operatively. The pony returned to its intended use and previous performance level, although complaints of mild symptoms of headshaking were noted in bright light only.

AB  - Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients with comorbid panic disorder (PD) may express additive symptoms of central fear system disturbance. They endorse elevated levels of sleep and nightmare disturbance [Leskin GA, et al., J Psychiatr Res 2002;36:449?452], and demonstrate movement suppression during laboratory sleep [Woodward SH, et al., Sleep 2002;25:681?688]. We estimated respiratory rate and rate variability separately for rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep. Subjects were 49 Vietnam combat-related PTSD inpatients (11 with comorbid PD and 38 without) and 15 controls. Computer-based estimates of respiratory rate and variability were derived from 10 to 18 hr of baseline sleep collected over two or three nights. Neither rate nor rate variability distinguished PTSD patients with comorbid PD from those without, or PTSD patients from controls; however, PTSD patients failed to exhibit the expected differences between REM and NREM respiratory rates. Moreover, the difference between REM and NREM respiratory rate was inversely related to a continuous measure of PTSD severity. PTSD patients with trauma-related nightmare complaint exhibited higher sleep respiration rates over both REM and NREM sleep. Conversely, in addition to slowed respiration, nightmare-free patients exhibited reduced respiratory rate variability in REM relative to NREM sleep, which was a reversal of the normal pattern. These finding are discussed in light of known telencephalic regulatory influences upon respiration rate. Depression and Anxiety 18:198?204, 2003 ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Functional chronic visceral pain (FCVP) is one of the most common causes of morbidity in the general population. Pain perceived within the abdomen may occur due to a range of different mechanisms according to the organ and their afferent pathways. Advances in our understanding of the complexities of FCVP could lead to the exploitation of contemporary research in order to develop and utilize our understanding of neurobiological and psychobiological visceral mechanisms in a clinical setting. This progression, together with increasing amounts of epidemiological and gender based information concerning specific abdominal pain syndromes can allow us to develop assessment tools that go beyond disease only analysis and move toward a more comprehensive assessment model so that patients may have access to expert or multidisciplinary management sooner, rather than later. Based on current evidence, one must consider the main contributors to pain, whether it is nociceptive, neuropathic or psychosocial or as is common with FCVP, a combination of all three. Aim.? This comprehensive assessment model should encompass not only systematic evaluation for reliable communication, but should also progress toward idiographic diagnosis relating to the uniqueness of the patient. This model should be practical in a multidisciplinary setting, taking into account the multi-faceted nature of this presentation.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a method that uses the intrinsic nature of local magnetic fields to enhance image contrast in order to improve the visibility of various susceptibility sources and to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. It is also the precursor to the concept of the use of phase for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Nowadays, SWI has become a widely used clinical tool to image deoxyhemoglobin in veins, iron deposition in the brain, hemorrhages, microbleeds and calcification. In this article, we review the basics of SWI, including data acquisition, data reconstruction and post-processing. In particular, the source of cusp artifacts in phase images is investigated in detail and an improved multi-channel phase data combination algorithm is provided. In addition, we show a few clinical applications of SWI for the imaging of stroke, traumatic brain injury, carotid vessel wall, siderotic nodules in cirrhotic liver, prostate cancer, prostatic calcification, spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc degeneration. As the clinical applications of SWI continue to expand both in and outside the brain, the improvement of SWI in conjunction with QSM is an important future direction of this technology.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of small intestine, appendix, and colorectal. Carcinoid tumors are rare gastrointestinal tumors, the majority of which are found on the appendix. These tumors may appear as a dense mass on CT imaging, resembling a fecolith, and thus are often found incidentally on pathology when the suspected diagnosis is appendicitis. Cecal volvulus occurs in younger patients who are less-debilitated than those presenting with sigmoid volvulus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is successful in over 50% of cases of sigmoid volvulus, but decompressive colonoscopy is almost never successful in cecal volvulus. Routine diversion of extraperitoneal rectal injury such as with a loop colostomy is recommended in an attempt to avoid pelvic sepsis. New techniques for using trans-anal endoscopic placement of vacuum assisted closure sponge devices have been described for management of prolonged colorectal anastomotic leaks, but not for acute rectal trauma.

AB  - Abstract Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA), also known as Morquio-Brailsford or Morquio A syndrome, is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulphate sulphatase (GALNS). MPS IVA is multisystemic but manifests primarily as a progressive skeletal dysplasia. Spinal involvement is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in MPS IVA. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of problems involving the spine are critical in preventing or arresting neurological deterioration and loss of function. This review details the spinal manifestations of MPS IVA and describes the tools used to diagnose and monitor spinal involvement. The relative utility of radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of cervical spine instability, stenosis, and cord compression is discussed. Surgical interventions, anaesthetic considerations, and the use of neurophysiological monitoring during procedures performed under general anaesthesia are reviewed. Recommendations for regular radiological imaging and neurologic assessments are presented, and the need for a more standardized approach for evaluating and managing spinal involvement in MPS IVA is addressed.

AB  - Abstract This paper will review issues in clinical assessment of minority combat veterans who served in Vietnam. We will specify differences and similarities for assessing minorities within the context of evaluating the larger combat veteran population. As a way of introducing a need for specialized diagnosis and treatment, we will present data demonstrating that minorities may be characterized as a distinct group among Vietnam combat veterans; data demonstrating differential rates of PTSD and other psychological disorders; as well as differences in vocational, social, educational, physical and health adjustment along with differential rates of health services utilization. Throughout this paper, we will attempt to give a historical perspective to the role of the minority soldier before, during, and after military service in Vietnam, as well as inter-related civilian events that impacted minority veterans. We will review pertinent theories that explain higher PTSD rates among minority veterans-considering the special nature of the Vietnam War and its impact on young minority soldiers. We will frankly discuss problems we have observed about clinician prejudice that adversely affect clinical assessment and treatment. We emphasize that every combat veteran, regardless of racial background, is a unique individual with his or her own unique story to tell. We are aware, though, that cross-cultural interactions, because of factors internal to both client and clinician, can impede, if not preclude, effective therapeutic encounter. We recognize that providing information about minorities may do relatively little to alter deeply rooted prejudice of an unconscious nature. We hope to address the issues of ethnicity in ways that do not stir clinical resistance but rather that enhance clinician sensitivity, curiosity, and confidence.

AB  - Objective? To determine whether breed, sex, country of origin, and age are associated with anatomic location of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) in dogs. Study Design? Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Sample Population? Dogs (n=125) with IHPSS from the veterinary teaching hospitals of the University of Florida (21), Sydney University (44), and the University of California?Davis (60). Methods? Dogs with surgical/necropsy confirmation of single IHPSS were identified. Data were analyzed using logistic regression for associations between age, breed, sex, and country with the anatomic location of IHPSS. Results? Right (34%), left (34%), and central divisional IHPSS (32%) were prevalent with approximately equal frequency in Australia; in the United States, the prevalence of right (24%) and central divisional (26%) combined was similar to left divisional IHPSS (51%). Country (P=048), sex (P=.016), and Australian cattle dog ([ACD], P=.025) were significantly associated with IHPSS location. Dogs in Australia had 2.5-fold higher odds of having right versus left divisional IHPSS. Males and ACD had 2.8- and 5.6-fold higher odds of having right versus left divisional IHPSS. Australian dogs were significantly older than those in the United States (P<.0001) and ACD were significantly older than other breeds (P=.0067). Conclusions? Although country of origin, breed, and sex had significant associations with anatomic location of IHPSS, signalment does not appear to be a strong predictor of shunt location when used alone. Clinical Relevance? For the common breeds in this report, signalment is only occasionally helpful in predicting likelihood of anatomic division in IHPSS. Australian cattle dogs and male dogs have a statistical association with right (versus left) divisional IHPSS. If advanced imaging techniques are not available, veterinary surgeons should be prepared to locate and address any anatomic configuration of IHPSS in a dog.

AB  - Abstract Inhibitory control describes a number of distinct processes. Effortless inhibition refers to acts of control that are automatic and reflexive. Effortful inhibition refers to voluntary, goal-directed acts of control such as response flexibility, interference control, cancellation inhibition, and restraint inhibition. Disruptions to a number of inhibitory control processes occur as a consequence of childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI). This paper reviews the current knowledge of inhibition deficits following childhood TBI, and includes an overview of the inhibition construct and a discussion of the specific deficits shown by children and adolescents with TBI and the factors that mediate the expression of these deficits, including injury-related variables and the expression of pre- and post-injury attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The review illustrates that inhibitory control processes differ in terms of measurement, assessment, and neurological underpinnings, and also that childhood TBI may selectively disrupt particular forms of inhibition.

AB  - Abstract Symptom checklists and a follow-up questionnaire were mailed to the first 180 graduates of an inpatient Post Traumatic Stress Treatment program. Eighty-six of the 180 responded to the survey. Their responses were compared to measures obtained on them while they were inpatients at the treatment program. Significant differences were found on one symptom checklist, while positive trends toward symptom reduction were noted on another. Demographic characteristics of the respondents were dicusssed, as were responses to open-ended questions regarding in what ways the program helped most and least. Changes in a positive direction were noted in the area of self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and symptoms of numbing and arousal. PTSD-related intrusive symptoms had the least clear-cut improvement. Implications of these findings for inpatient treatment and aftercare are reviewed, with suggestions for future applied research.

AB  - We present a clinical case of treatment and neurorehabilitation of a patient with severe neurological deficit due to extensive traumatic lesion of the left hemisphere of the brain. Until recently, such cases were considered incurable and remained marginalized throughout their lives. This clinical case illustrates the compensatory brain possibilities under long-term integrated multidisciplinary treatment and neurorehabilitation with mandatory application of medical, medico-psychological, medico-pedagogical, and medico-social methods, the importance and intensity of which vary at different stages of the disease. This process is addressed in the individual patient. The greatest efficiency of the neurorehabilitation treatment of patients with severe consequences of a stroke and traumatic brain injury can be reached under the following conditions: the earliest possible start of rehabilitation with a sufficient duration and intensity; interdisciplinary and integrative rehabilitation process at various stages of rehabilitation treatment; systematic clinical and neuropsychological diagnostics; systematic monitoring of somatic, neurological, psychiatric, and psychological condition of the patient; assistance with sociopsychological and labor issues; and problem-solving support.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of ezetimibe/simvastatin (EZE/SIMVA) tablet and SIMVA monotherapy. This was an extension study of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. Protocol-compliant patients who completed the 12-week base study were eligible to enter a randomised, double-blind, 14-week extension study and were administered 1 of 8 daily treatments: EZE/SIMVA 10/10-, 10/20-, 10/40- or 10/80-mg, or SIMVA 10-, 20-, 40- or 80-mg. Patients receiving these treatments during the base study remained on the same treatment in the extension. Patients administered placebo or EZE 10-mg monotherapy during the base study were re-randomised to EZE/SIMVA 10/10?mg or SIMVA 80?mg. The primary analysis was mean per cent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline to extension study end-point. Mean changes from baseline in LDL-C of ?38.8% and ?53.7% were observed for pooled SIMVA and pooled EZE/SIMVA respectively. The between treatment difference of ?14.9% (95% confidence interval: ?16.4, ?13.3) was statistically significant (p?<?0.001). The incremental LDL-C lowering effect of EZE/SIMVA compared with the corresponding dose of SIMVA alone was consistent across the dose range (p?<?0.001 for each between-group comparison). More patients receiving EZE/SIMVA than SIMVA achieved LDL-C concentrations <?100?mg/dl and <?70?mg/dl (p?<?0.001 for both goals). EZE/SIMVA was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to SIMVA monotherapy. There were no significant between-group differences in the incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver transaminase or creatine kinase levels. In conclusion, EZE/SIMVA had a comparable safety and tolerability profile and was more efficacious than SIMVA monotherapy for up to 6?months.

AB  - Summary Furcation defects present the greatest challenges to the success of periodontal therapy, as a reduced efficacy of periodontal therapy and higher risk of tooth loss have been consistently observed in multi-rooted teeth with furcation involvement, regardless of the treatment modality employed. An accurate and precise pre-surgical diagnosis is essential in order to approach correctly patients affected by periodontal disease complicated by the invasion of molar furcation areas. Root amputation can usually be indicated in the maxillary molars for removing the distal root, thus avoiding the need to restore the tooth with a crown in a conservative treatment plan. Treatment options for molars with furcation involvement could be divided into three different modalities: conservative procedures, regenerative procedures, and resective procedures. Resective techniques have been developed especially for deep class II and class III furcation-involved molars to overcome the anatomical limitations by physically removing both the dental and osseous structures that make up the defect.

AB  - Translations of summary A case study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of psychoanalysis and the persistence of its benefits 20 years later in a young woman with severe depression, professional inhibition, and difficulties in partner selection due to transgenerational mandate (TGM). The investigation was carried out with psychoanalytic interviews with the patient and analyst, which were evaluated by both psychoanalytic and non-psychoanalytic judges following a methodology based on one tested in Germany by Leuzinger-Bohleber et al. (2003). The psychoanalytic treatment began in the early 1980s in Monterrey, Mexico. The study concludes that the psychoanalysis was effective in assisting with the patient's character disorder and partner selection, mainly because of the therapeutic alliance, the analysis of transference and character, and the patient's increased capacity for mentalization as a result of the interpretation of the TGMs.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a high-resolution, multimodal and translatable imaging protocol to characterize experimental models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Small animal imaging modalities include fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either lateral fluid percussion (LFP) or controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI with mild or moderate severity. Baseline FDG-PET and MRI scans were conducted prior to injury and at various times post-TBI. FDG-PET/CT images were acquired on a Siemens Inveon Multimodality scanner based on IV injection of 37 ? 74 MBq (1 ? 2 mCi) of FDG. Diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopic images along with susceptibility and T1/T2-weighted images were acquired on a Bruker Biospec 7T/20 cm magnet running Paravision 5.1. Results: For translatable FDG-PET imaging, a tail vein injection of FDG with 45 minutes of anesthetized uptake and 30 minutes of scanning was optimal. With the brain centered in the field of view, uptakes (ipsilateral and contralateral) were normalized by cerebellar uptake since blood sampling was not conducted. The 2-hour MRI protocol included fast spin echo (100 um), 3D multi-echo gradient echo susceptibility (100 um), 4-shot EPI-based continuous arterial spin labeling (152 um), 8-shot EPI-based with three direction diffusion (100 um), and single voxel PRESS spectroscopy(3 mm) Conclusions: The impact of TBI on military service members is significant with more than 5,500 soldiers diagnosed with TBIs. Early diagnosis and development of an effective treatment for veterans with TBI is a priority for the military. A multimodal and multi-parameter imaging protocol for experimental TBI that is both translatable and efficient (high throughput) is pivotal for studying neuroprotection, regeneration, and plasticity. An optimized small animal imaging protocol was developed to investigate longitudinal changes in glucose utilization (FDG-PET/CT), cortical volume, diffuse axonal injury, perfusion, and metabolite concentration (MRI).

AB  - Abstract Clinical diagnosis of autoinflammatory diseases requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and clinching molecular evidence to substantiate the diagnosis. This is more so in populations with low prevalence of these disorders. In this report, we describe the case of a young man from India with recurrent fever and persistent arthritis. The patient's forefathers were of Egyptian ancestry who practiced consanguinity. Molecular genetic analysis using whole-exome sequencing suggested the presence of variants c.443A>T:p.E148V and c.442G>C:p.E148Q in the MEFV gene, earlier independently shown to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in a compound heterozygous state. The variants were further confirmed by capillary sequencing. This report also highlights the application of whole exome sequencing to delineate the allelic differences in the variants apart from serving as a quick genetic screening approach for autoinflammatory diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a compound heterozygosity for the two well-characterized variants associated with atypical FMF in a patient.
