AB  - Abstract Aim:? To study the incidence, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in breast cancer patients using a PICC catheter for chemotherapy. Methods:? The data of the incidence, diagnosis and treatment of PICC-related upper extremity DVT in 187 breast cancer patients using a PICC catheter for chemotherapy, from August 2009 to July 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Results:? In total 188 PICC were inserted between August 2009 and July 2011 and followed up for a total of 14?399 catheter-days (median placement, 76.6?days; range, 1 to 170?days). Four (2.1%) of 188 PICC were removed as a result of PICC-related upper extremity DVT in 14 to 112 catheter-days, at a rate of 0.28/1000 catheter-days. Conclusion:? The use of PICCs in breast cancer patients for chemotherapy is safe and effective. However, some patients may develop catheter-related upper extremity DVT. In order to minimize complications, we should pay attention to its early symptoms and signs, as well as the timely removal of the catheter and appropriate anti-coagulant treatment.

AB  - Abstract We treated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) and evaluated the effect of treatment on white matter reorganization using MRI. We subjected male Wistar rats (n?=?17) to controlled cortical impact and either withheld treatment (controls; n?=?9) or inserted collagen scaffolds containing hMSCs (n?=?8). Six weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and MRI revealed selective migration of grafted neural progenitor cells towards the white matter reorganized boundary of the TBI-induced lesion. Histology confirmed that the white matter had been reorganized, associated with increased fractional anisotropy (FA; p?<?0.01) in the recovery regions relative to the injured core region in both treated and control groups. Treatment with hMSCs increased FA in the recovery regions, lowered T2 in the core region, decreased lesion volume and improved functional recovery relative to untreated controls. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral cortex at the boundary of the lesion. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging confirmed the immunohistological data and provided information on axonal rewiring. The apparent kurtosis coefficient (AKC) detected additional axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed by immunohistological staining, compared with FA. Our data demonstrate that AKC, FA, FT and T2 can be used to evaluate treatment-induced white matter recovery, which may facilitate restorative therapy in patients with TBI.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper examines and offers a critique of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), underlying principles and assumptions, and the nature and consequences of its nosological framework. The reason for this critique is to look at the rationale for some of the diagnostic categories and also why some categories are retained, including some of the long-standing diagnostic groups, such as schizophrenia. It is not the intention here to rehearse the problems of biological psychiatric thinking, nor argue the strengths and weaknesses of the DSM-IV-TR in its definitions and descriptions of particular syndromes and illnesses. The ideas presented here derive from a range of previous research that argued that the DSM-IV-TR colludes in a system of psychiatric care in which all people, by virtue of characteristically human foibles and idiosyncrasies, are potentially classifiable into a variety of diagnostic mental health categories. In the present study, it was argued that because of resource constraints, professional dispute, and public concern, the major criterion for attracting a formal diagnosis is not classifiability according to the DSM-IV-TR, but rather, that of ?social risk?, defined in terms of risk to oneself and/or others and embodying obvious social control functions. Here, we expand and develop some of these ideas, and relate them more specifically to insights offered by critical or deconstructive psychology and the development of the forthcoming the DSM-V.

AB  - Abstract Trauma surgery lack, substitute, for the reconstruction of large defects of the long bones. Encouraged by the promising results of bone allotransplantation in animal models, we successfully performed vascularized bone transplantation in humans. Vascularized femoral diaphyses were allogenically transplanted into three patients suffering from chondrosarcoma or post-traumatic osteomyelitis with postoperative immunosuppression. The bone segments were harvested from multi-organ donors and perfused with UW solution. After back-table preparation, the grafts were transplanted into the defect zone. Interlocking devices were used in these operations. Vascular anastomoses were performed in end-to-side technique. The early clinical course of the patients was not free of anatomical, technical, or immunological complications. However, all patients are currently free of malignancy and infection. They are also free of pain and full weight bearing. We conclude that allogenic grafting of vascularized bone segments has the potential to become an alternative for the replacement of large bone defects.

AB  - Summary Necropsies were performed on 496 horses that had a fatal injury or illness at a California racetrack during the period February 20th 1990 to March 1st 1992. The primary cause of death was categorised by breed, activity at time of injury or illness and organ system affected. Most of the submissions were Thoroughbred horses (432) and Quarter Horses (46). Most of the injuries occurred while racing (42%) and in training sessions (39%); with fewer non-exercise (12%) and accident (7%) related injuries or illnesses. Musculoskeletal injuries accounted for 83% of the Thoroughbred and 80% of the Quarter Horse submissions. The Thoroughbred horses incurred 306 fractures with 263 in the limbs and 90% of those in the forelimbs. The proximal sesamoid bone(s), third metacarpal bone and humerus were the most common bones fractured in Thoroughbred horses and Quarter Horses. Other major causes of death included respiratory, digestive and multi-organ system disorders.

In segmented hair samples, concentrations of Fe, As, Ag and Au at the tips exceeded values for the contemporary population; however, they decreased towards the hair bulbs, similarly to Hg, indicating that recent exposure that was discontinued ~2?months prior to Brahe's death. Several other elements did not follow this pattern. Analyses of bones revealed signs of long-term exposure to Au, while many other elements were within expected ranges. Histopathological examination of bone sections yielded no signs of severe bone metabolic disorders.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Williams?Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multi-system disorder that requires ongoing management by a primary care physician familiar with the natural history and common medical problems associated with the condition. Some abnormalities are unique to WBS, such as the elastin arteriopathy that often manifests as supravalvar aortic stenosis and hypertension. Still other features, such as diverticulosis, are seen in the general population but tend to present earlier in WBS. Life long monitoring of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems is essential to the clinical management of individuals with Williams?Beuren syndrome. Constipation should be aggressively managed, and symptoms of abdominal pain should prompt an evaluation for diverticulosis/diverticulitis. While the mean IQ of WBS is in the mild mental retardation range, difficulties with attention and anxiety are more likely to negatively impact independent functioning in the adult with WBS. There is no evidence for decline in cognitive ability over time, but adaptive functioning may be improved with treatment of anxiety by both behavior and medical modalities. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Brewin's dual representation theory, Ehlers and Clark's cognitive appraisal model, and Dalgleish's schematic, propositional, analogue and associative representational systems model are considered in the light of recent evidence on the neural substrates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The models' proposals about the cognitive mechanism of memory dysfunction in PTSD are described and evaluated against current knowledge about the neural pathways and functions disrupted in PTSD. A dual pathway model of memory is consistent with neuroscience of memory. The appraisal model also provides an account of the top-down modulation of memory and arousal problems consistent with current neuroscientific evidence of PTSD. Dalgleish's model is less consistent with the evidence because it relies upon assumptions that cannot yet be tested neuroscientifically. All three models under-specify the causal and maintaining influence of hyperarousal relative to the role it plays in current neuroscientific models of PTSD. Implications of the evidence for improving treatment and prevention are discussed.

AB  - Summary The knee is the largest and most complex joint in the body and a wide variety of bone and soft tissue injuries are seen in the knee. Trauma to the knee can result in injury to the bone, articular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments. Fractures of the proximal tibia, particularly those that extend into the knee joint, are serious injuries that frequently result in functional impairment. Recent advances in cross-sectional imaging, particularly in computed tomography (CT), have given this modality a prominent role in the detection and classification of fractures in and around the knee. With the advent of high-performance multi-detector CT, isotropic data sets can be generated with subsecond gantry rotation times and submillimetre slice thickness. CT arthrography can clearly demonstrate many lesions in the plethora of internal derangement of the knee. CT arthrography also deserves its advantage as it may be used to evaluate knee injuries in patients where magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated. In this article we discuss the indications for imaging of knee injuries by CT, present the advantages of multi-detector CT and CT arthrography, and provide examples that highlight the utility of CT in the evaluation of the knee injuries.

AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become an important area for social work practice. Children and adults sustaining TBI often undergo hospitalisation, rehabilitation and face the prospect of lifelong cognitive and psychosocial impairments. Families are profoundly affected by the consequences of the injury. TBI is a ?hidden disability? because there are typically no physical markers indicating a person has brain damage. This paper aims to provide some guidelines for social work practice in the area, in particular, outlining options for social work interventions at individual, family, community, service system and policy levels. Social workers need to acquire specialised knowledge about brain injury, reformulate traditional models of grief counselling to address the adjustment challenges and utilise community education and service innovation to address the social stigma and reduced level of community participation associated with brain damage. Finally, social workers aim to nurture a sense of hope in the face of the tragedy.

This article provides an overview of the research design and methods used which took into consideration the unique characteristics of the country and its multi-ethnic population. A face-to-face household survey of Singapore residents aged 18?years and above was undertaken from 2009 to 2010. The nationally representative probability sample was derived using a disproportionate stratified sampling method. In order to increase precision for subgroup estimations the design was stratified with over-sampling of Malays, Indians and those aged 65?years and above. Respondents were assessed using the English, Chinese (computerized) and Malay (paper and pencil based) version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 3.0 to establish lifetime and 12-month prevalence of mental disorders, the current use of mental health services (both Western and traditional services), the treatment gaps and loss of role functioning.

AB  - Objective??? The clinical condition normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is one of the few conditions with dementia that can be successfully treated. Even though NPH was described more than 40?years ago, information on prevalence and incidence of this disease is scarce. The objective of this study was to obtain information about prevalence of iNPH in a Norwegian population. Methods??? In a stable population of 220,000 inhabitants, structured and intensive efforts were directed towards the public via local newspapers, radio and television channels, and directed towards the healthcare professionals via personal letters and lectures, to recruit patients with idiopathic NPH (iNPH) investigation during a 12-month period. This population is served by only one neurological department and one neurosurgical department, thus avoiding any leakage of patients during the investigation period. We determined those patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of probable iNPH. Results??? Eighty-six patients were referred, of whom 48 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of probable iNPH. This equals a minimum prevalence of iNPH in our population of 21.9/100,000. Most importantly, the prevalence was increasing with age. When excluding patients who had symptoms for more than 1?year, we found an incidence of 5.5/100,000/year. Conclusions??? In this Norwegian population of 220,000 inhabitants, we found a prevalence of probable iNPH of 21.9/100,000 and an incidence of 5.5/100,000. The numbers should be regarded as minimum estimates.

AB  - Abstract:? In oncology, quality of care is a major issue for patients and providers. Significant variations in care, including nonreceipt of adjuvant systemic therapy, nonadherence to therapy, and/or early discontinuation of therapy, occur frequently and may impact survival. Reasons for these variations are not well understood, but may play a role in the prominent disparity in breast cancer survival between blacks and whites. Since May 2006, the Breast Cancer Quality of Care Study (BQUAL) has recruited 1158 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer from several centers across the country, with completed data on 1057 participants to date. Detailed information on demographic, behavioral, biomedical, and emotional factors related to chemotherapy use was collected on each participant at baseline and at two follow-up interviews during the first 6?months. In addition, for women with ER+ tumors, further questionnaires were completed every 6?months regarding hormonal therapy use. Each participant was also asked to provide a DNA sample, and to allow medical record review. We surveyed physicians providing care to the study participants regarding attitudes toward adjuvant treatment. The mean age of participants was 58?years (SD 11.6), and 15% (n?=?160) were black. The majority had an annual household income <$90,000 (n?=?683), had college education or higher (n?=?802), 55.9% were married, and 57.9% were not currently employed. Seventy-six percent had hormone-receptor-positive tumors, 49.9% initiated chemotherapy and 82.7% started hormonal therapy. Blacks were more likely to have lower annual household income (p?<?0001), less education (p?=?0.0005), ER negative tumor status (p?=?0.02), and poorly differentiated cancer (p?=?0.0002). The main endpoints of the study are noninitiation of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, nonadherence to therapy and early discontinuation of therapy. Treatment and outcomes will be compared on the 15% of participants who are black versus other participants. The BQUAL Study will be a rich ongoing source of information regarding reasons for differences in receipt of both adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. This information may be useful in planning interventions to improve quality of care.

AB  - Summary Basic blood work ? complete blood count and biochemical panel ? in combination with a urinalysis is often performed during the work-up of a respiratory patient and can help support the presence of an underlying respiratory tract disease. Pulse oximetry provides an estimate of hemoglobin saturation with oxygen and is inexpensive, non-invasive, and easy to perform. Radiography is often the key to creating an appropriate list of differential diagnoses for the respiratory case and for determining the type of sampling method that is most likely to achieve a final diagnosis. Airway fluoroscopy uses air as the contrast medium to evaluate dynamic changes in the luminal diameter of the airways during normal breathing and during cough. A transoral tracheal wash is appropriate for use in large and small dogs or in cats. Rhinoscopic examination includes evaluation of the caudal nasopharynx to visualize nasal openings at the choanae and inspection of the rostral nasal cavity.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder is a long-lasting psychiatric disease after the traumatic experience of severe fatal stress with the consequence of hippocampal atrophy. Freezing behaviors were more than quintupled on the fear-conditioning test in mice previously subjected to water immersion restrain stress (WIRS) with metronome tones when determined 1?28?days after WIRS, while these mice exhibited the increased immobility time on the forced swimming test with the increased spontaneous locomotion. Prior experience of WIRS led to a transient decrease in subsequent 5-bromo-2?-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into proliferating cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. These behavioral and neurochemical alterations were significantly prevented by the daily injection of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, respectively. Moreover, WIRS significantly decreased the number of cells holding BrdU without affecting the differentiation ratio to astroglial and neuronal lineages 28?days later. Prior administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist significantly prevented the aforementioned changes by WIRS. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may play a role in mechanisms underlying the crisis of a variety of psychiatric symptoms relevant to post-traumatic stress disorder through transient suppression of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the murine hippocampal dentate gyrus.
