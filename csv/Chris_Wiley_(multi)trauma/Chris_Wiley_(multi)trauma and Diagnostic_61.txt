AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The authors conducted a systematic BRS and English-language literature review of the last 10 years of research on the assessment, prevalence, and antidepressant treatment of major depression in the medically ill to determine the current state of knowledge and to make recommendations for future studies. Ninety-three prevalence studies (13,518 patients and 33 conditions or medical settings) met basic methodological inclusion criteria. The great majority (68.8%) of these studies did not describe their methodological approach to the diagnostic assessment of symptoms such as fatigue, which could be due to either a depression or a comorbidphysical disorder. This problem of overlapping symptomatology has been termed the ?problem of etiological assessment.? The 29 (31.2%) studies which did describe an approach to this problem used one or more of four different approaches: an ?inclusive? approach, an ?exclusive? approach, an ?etiological? approach, or a ?substitutive? approach. Prevalence rates of major depression varied greatly (0-78%). Regarding treatment, of eight controlled studies of antidepressant therapies for major depression, six reported statistically significant differences between medications and placebo. The authors conclude that many recent studies concerning the assessment, prevalence, and treatment of major depression in the medically ill have been inadequate to generate reliable and valid information. Guidelines for future research, especially focusing on the collection of validation data, are proposed. Depression 1:181-204 (1993). ? 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) performed by emergency and critical care (ECC) specialists or residents in training improves differentiation of cardiac (C) versus non-cardiac (NC) causes of respiratory distress in dogs compared to medical history and physical examination alone. Design Prospective cohort study (May 2014 to February 2016). Setting University hospital. Animals Thirty-eight dogs presenting with respiratory distress. Interventions FOCUS. Measurements and Main Results Medical history, physical examination, and FOCUS were obtained at presentation. Emergency and critical care clinicians, blinded to any radiographic or echocardiographic data, categorized each patient (C vs NC) before and after FOCUS. Thoracic radiography (within 3 h) and echocardiography (within 24 h) were performed. Percent agreement was calculated against a reference diagnosis that relied on agreement of a board-certified cardiologist and ECC specialist with access to all diagnostic test results. Reference diagnosis included 22 dogs with cardiac and 13 dogs with noncardiac causes of respiratory distress. In 3 dogs a reference diagnosis was not established. Prior to FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8?98.9) and 53.9% (25.1?80.8), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 27 of 35 dogs (77.1%). Two C and 6 NC cases were incorrectly categorized. Following FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 95.5% (77.2?99.9) and 69.2% (38.6?90.9), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 30 of 35 dogs (85.7%). Three dogs with discrepant pre-FOCUS diagnoses were correctly re-categorized post-FOCUS. One C and 4 NC cases remained incorrectly categorized. No correctly categorized dogs were incorrectly re-categorized following FOCUS. The proportions of dogs correctly classified pre- versus post-FOCUS were not significantly different (P = 0.25). Conclusions FOCUS did not significantly improve differentiation of C vs NC causes of respiratory distress compared to medical history and physical examination alone.

AB  - Abstract Objective There is some speculation that an intact distal sphincter complex is of decisive importance for continence, although the external anal sphincter (EAS) is considered to be a single functional and anatomical entity. On trans-labial ultrasound (TLUS), the caudal slice at the level of the subcutaneous EAS is currently omitted from the diagnostic algorithm due to the prevalence of artefact at that level. Hence, we aim to determine the predictive value of assessment of the subcutaneous EAS for anal incontinence. Methods We analysed datasets of 463 women seen at our urogynaecological service in 2015. All underwent a standardized questionnaire including a St Mark's incontinence score (SMIS), clinical examination and 4D TLUS. Slices 1 to 7 were assessed and rated positive for a defect if the defect angle was >=30-degrees. Results While there was a highly significant association between all measures of anal incontinence (AI) and significant EAS trauma in slice 7, addition of the 7th slice to the existing 6-slice model did not improve the predictive value for AI. Conclusion As inclusion of the subcutaneous slice of the EAS on the TLUS does not seem to improve the predictive value of AI, the current methodology for EAS trauma on tomographic ultrasound can remain unchanged.

AB  - Abstract One hundred and six consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer were studied before and after surgery with a clinical psychiatric interview and questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale, General Health Questionnaire and Clinical Global Impression scale). The traumatic stress response after six weeks was related to sociodemographic factors, premorbid health problems, negative life events and clinical-oncological parameters. Symptoms of traumatic distress were significantly reduced post-surgery compared to acutely, and most so among patients with no premorbid health problems and negative life events according to pre-surgery interview and self-report data. Eighteen percent of the patients reported a high level (>19) of intrusive symptoms and 14%, avoidance symptoms. Patients with premorbid impairment in work, family and social functioning and patients who during the last year had experienced the death of a close relative or a serious illness other than cancer showed the greatest distress. Previous consultations for nervous problems, age, marital status, stage of disease, type of surgery (breast-conserving versus mastectomy) and adjuvant cytostatic treatment did not influence the traumaticstress response six weeks after surgery. The level of acute posttraumatic stress response to breast cancer surgery seems best predicted by premorbid variables.

AB  - Abstract This article overviews recent advances in biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. Novel biosensors digitally processing multiple biomarker signals produce a final output in the form of YES/NO response through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular systems. The biocomputing approach applied to biosensors leads to high-fidelity biosensing compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices. By processing complex patterns of multiple physiological biomarkers, such multi-signal digital biosensors should have a profound impact on the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and particularly can provide timely detection and alert of medical emergencies (along with immediate therapeutic intervention). The novel biosensing concept has been exemplified with the systems for logic analysis of various injuries, including soft tissue injury, traumatic brain injury, liver injury, abdominal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and oxidative stress.

AB  - Summary.? Lack of detailed natural history and outcomes data for neonates and toddlers with haemophilia hampers the provision of optimal management of the disorder. We report an analysis of prospective data collected from 580 neonates and toddlers aged 0?2 years with haemophilia enrolled in the Universal Data Collection (UDC) surveillance project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This study focuses on a cohort of babies with haemophilia whose diagnosis was established before the age of two. The mode of delivery, type and severity of haemophilia, onset and timing of haemorrhages, site(s) of bleeding, provision of prophylaxis with coagulation factor replacement therapy, and the role played by the federally funded Haemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) in the management of these infants with haemophilia were evaluated. Seventy-five per cent of haemophilic infants were diagnosed early, in the first month of life, especially those with a family history or whose mothers were known carriers; infants of maternal carriers were more likely to be delivered by C-section. Involvement of an HTC prior to delivery resulted in avoidance of the use of assisted deliveries with vacuum and forceps. Bleeding from the circumcision site was the most common haemorrhagic complication, followed by intra- and extra-cranial haemorrhages and bleeding from heel stick blood sampling. Eight per cent of the infants were administered factor concentrate within 24 h of birth; more than half were treated to prevent bleeding. This study highlights the significant rate and the sites of initial bleeding unique to very young children with haemophilia and underscores the need for research to identify optimal evidence-based recommendations for their management.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Intracavernosal injection (ICI) of a vasoactive agent has been an important part of the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) since its initial description by Virag in 1982. Aim To review the literature and summarize the use of ICI and its role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of ED. Methods Literature review. Main Outcome Measure To define the role of ICI's utility in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of ED. Results When used in conjunction with color penile Doppler ultrasound for ED evaluation and diagnosis, ICI helps to detect penile vascular abnormalities and allows for differentiation between the multiple vasculogenic causes of impotence, thus helping clinicians to select the optimal treatment modality for each patient. Patients utilizing ICI continue to report high efficacy and satisfaction rates relative to other treatment options despite ICI's designation as a second-line therapy since the introduction of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in 1998. In recent years, ICI has also become an important part of penile rehabilitation programs following radical prostatectomy, as regular use of ICI is thought to increase the rate at which patients experience return of spontaneous erection through preservation of penile tissue integrity and prevention of corporeal smooth muscle atrophy. Conclusions ICI of vasoactive agents remains an important tool in treating and diagnosing ED, with high patient satisfaction and efficacy rates. However, the dropout rate for ICI therapy remains relatively high, and it may be associated with priapism, ecchymoses, hematoma formation, and penile fibrosis. Patients should be educated on the benefits and limitations of ICI therapy prior to beginning treatment in order to minimize dropout rates. Additional studies are necessary to better understand the possible long-term benefits of ICI therapy and how to most effectively structure the penile rehabilitation program after radical prostatectomy.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC), the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppressive agents, plays a crucial role in new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT). Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the ? cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC-induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/AKT and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (eg, PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (odds ratio = 2.692, P = .023, n = 135). Integrating grafts? CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs 0.79, P = .048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces ?hematogenous diabetes? via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.

AB  - Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) show varying degrees of response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. This randomised phase III study in patients with CIDP (ProCID trial) will compare the efficacy and safety of 3 different doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg) of IVIg 10% (panzyga) administered every 3 weeks for 24?weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of treatment response, defined as a decrease in adjusted inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment disability score of ≥1 point, in the IVIg 1.0 g/kg arm at week 24. Patients with definite or probable CIDP according to European Federation of Neurological Sciences/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria with IVIg or corticosteroid dependency and active disease are eligible. All potentially eligible patients will undergo IVIg or corticosteroid dose reduction (washout phase) over ≤12?weeks or until deterioration of CIDP (active disease). Patients with deterioration during the washout phase will be randomised to receive study treatment during a dose-evaluation phase starting with a loading dose of IVIg 2.0 g/kg followed by maintenance treatment with IVIg 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g/kg every 3 weeks. Rescue medication (2 doses of IVIg 2.0 g/kg given 3 weeks apart) will be administered to patients in the IVIg 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg groups who deteriorate after week 3 and before week 18 or who do not improve at week 6. Safety, tolerability and quality of life will be assessed. The ProCID study will provide new information on the best maintenance dose of IVIg for patients with CIDP.

AB  - A 24-week-old dog was presented with recurrent rectal prolapse because of colonic duplication. Colonic duplication is an extremely uncommon congenital abnormality, with only six cases reported in veterinary medicine, one diagnosed at necropsy and five after barium enema, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy either alone or in combination. In this case, these techniques failed to identify the abnormality and diagnosis was ultimately achieved via negative contrast computed tomography. The evaluation generated by the computed tomography images allowed a refined surgical approach. To the authors? knowledge, negative contrast computed tomography has not yet been reported in the veterinary literature to diagnose gastrointestinal pathologies. Colonic duplication in this case was treated by removal of the intercolonic septum via colotomy.

AB  - SUMMARY Objective To document blood component usage in the UK medical treatment facility, Afghanistan, over a period of 4 years; and to examine the relationship with transfusion capability, injury pattern and survival. Background Haemostatic resuscitation is now firmly established in military medical practice, despite the challenges of providing such therapy in austere settings. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of blood component use in service personnel admitted for trauma. Data were extracted from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. Results A total of 2618 patients were identified. Survival increased from 76 to 84% despite no change in injury severity. The proportion of patients receiving blood components increased from 13 to 32% per annum; 417 casualties received massive transfusion (≥10 units of RCC), the proportion increasing from 40 to 62%. Use of all blood components increased significantly in severely injured casualties, to a median (IQR) of 16 (9?25) units of red cell concentrate (P?=?0·006), 15 (8?24) of plasma (P?=?0·002), 2 (0?5) of platelets (P?<?0·001) and 1 (0?3) of cryoprecipitate (P?<?0·001). Cryoprecipitate (P?=?0·009) and platelet use (P?=?0·005) also increased in moderately injured casualties. Conclusions The number of blood components transfused to individual combat casualties increased during the 4-year period, despite no change in injury severity or injury pattern. Survival also increased. Combat casualties requiring massive transfusion have a significantly higher chance of survival than civilian patients. Survival is the product of the entire system of care. However, we propose that the changes in military transfusion practice and capability have contributed to increased combat trauma survival.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after kidney transplantation is 15-fold increased. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is one of the known risk factors. We performed a small pilot study to assess the role of non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for intensified screening in renal transplant recipients with ACKD. Renal ultrasound was used to assess the native kidneys of 215 renal transplant recipients. Thirty patients with 54 kidneys, fulfilling the criteria of ACKD, underwent non-enhanced MRI at 1.5T using T2- and T1-weighed as well as diffusion-weighted sequences with a high spatial resolution. Among the 54 kidneys assessed by both methods, three RCCs were identified (6%). Of those, one RCC was detected by both imaging methods (33%), while two RCCs were diagnosed by MRI alone (67%). MRI identified an additional four proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cysts that did not fulfill the criteria for RCC but were classified as suspicious. All of these lesions were stable in size and appearance in follow-up studies. In conclusion, non-enhanced MRI was more sensitive than ultrasound in identifying RCCs and lesions suspicious for RCC and thus appears to be a useful secondary screening tool in patients with ACKD after renal transplantation.

AB  - Background Little is known about specific mood symptoms that may confer risk for suicidal ideation (SI) among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). We evaluated prospectively whether particular symptoms of depression and mania precede the onset or worsening of SI, among adults with or without a history of a suicide attempt. Methods We examined prospective data from a large (N = 2,741) cohort of patients participating in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD). We evaluated history of suicide attempts at baseline, and symptoms of depression and mania at baseline and follow-up visits. Hierarchical linear modeling tested whether specific mood symptoms predicted subsequent levels of SI, and whether the strength of the associations differed based on suicide attempt history, after accounting for the influence of other mood symptoms and current SI. Results Beyond overall current depression and mania symptom severity, baseline SI, and illness characteristics, several mood symptoms, including guilt, reduced self-esteem, psychomotor retardation and agitation, increases in appetite, and distractibility predicted more severe levels of subsequent SI. Problems with concentration, distraction, sleep loss and decreased need for sleep predicted subsequent SI more strongly among individuals with a suicide attempt history. Conclusions Several specific mood symptoms may confer risk for the onset or worsening of SI among treatment-seeking patients with BD. Individuals with a previous suicide attempt may be at greater risk in part due to greater reactivity to certain mood symptoms in the form of SI. However, overall, effect sizes were small, suggesting the need to identify additional proximal predictors of SI.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a very attractive tool in the context of repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue damaged by trauma. The most common source of MPCs to date has been the bone marrow, but aspirating bone marrow from the patient is an invasive procedure. In an attempt to search for alternative sources of MPCs that could be obtained with minimal invasion, we looked into traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. In this study, we determined whether a population of multipotent MPCs could be isolated from acute traumatic knee hemarthrosis in the absence of intra-articular fractures. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the aspirated hemarthrosis by density gradient separation, and cultured. We were able to obtain plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells from the mononuclear cell fractions. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the adherent fibroblast-like cells were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and were negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. These were similar to control bone marrow stromal cells. These cells could differentiate in vitro into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells in the presence of lineage-specific induction factors. In conclusion, acute unfractured traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee contains MPCs with multipotentiality. Because knee hemarthrosis is easy to harvest with minimal pain and without unnecessary invasion, we regard hemarthrosis-derived cells as an additional progenitor cell source for future tissue engineering and cell-based therapy in knee injuries.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In the era of orally active agents, dynamic penile color-duplex ultrasound (D-PCDU) is not considered a necessary first screening for all patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Various parameters, such as peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistance index, acceleration time, and degree of arterial dilatation, have been suggested for the diagnosis of vascular ED by D-PCDU. Aim.? To highlight the clinical utility and evidence-based interpretation of D-PCDU criteria. Methods.? Extensive, unsystematic PubMed literature search reviewing relevant data on D-PCDU in the evaluation of male ED. Results.? The advantage of ultrasound is the minimally invasive nature of the procedure and the ability to screen patients to identify a normal arterial response of cavernous arteries. Men with sexual dysfunctions above 55 years of age and comorbidities are more likely to have multi-organ vascular dysfunction and may necessitate further testing because erectile failure may be the first presenting symptom requiring investigation and treatment even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. All patients affected with Peyronie's disease and younger men with persistent ED, a history of pelvic traumas, or fractures of the penile shaft should be offered ultrasonographic penile blood flow studies before referral to surgery or more invasive vascular investigations. Conclusions.? In the near future, D-PCDU may be used in preference to patients presenting with or without vascular risk factors, particularly those not responding to first-line orally active drugs and seeking an explanation as to why these agents failed.

AB  - Aim:? The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) show differential activation during an emotional activation task compared with age- and sex-matched controls, by measuring changes in the concentration of oxygenated (oxyHb) and deoxygenated (deoxyHb) hemoglobin, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods:? Fourteen patients with PDD and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated in the study. The relative changes of concentrations of oxyHb and deoxyHb were measured on NIRS during an implicit processing task of fearful expression using Japanese standard faces. Results:? PDD patients had significantly reduced oxyHb changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to healthy controls. Conclusion:? PFC dysfunction may exist in PDD.
