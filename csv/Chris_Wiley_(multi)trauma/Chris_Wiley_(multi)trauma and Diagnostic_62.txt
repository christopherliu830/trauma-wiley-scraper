AB  - Pathological specimens from columnar-lined oesophagus (CLO) comprise a considerable proportion of the workload of gastrointestinal pathologists in Western countries. There remain controversies concerning the diagnostic role of pathology. More recently, in the UK at least, the diagnosis has been regarded as primarily an endoscopic endeavour, with pathology being corroborative and only diagnostic when endoscopic features are equivocal or when there are additional features that make the endoscopic diagnosis unclear. There is also recognition that demonstration of intestinalisation or ?goblet cells? is not paramount, and should not be required for the diagnosis. There have been notable changes in the management of CLO neoplasia: pathologists are centrally involved in its management. Pathological assessment of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) specimens provides the most useful means of determining the management of early neoplasia and of determining indications for surgery. This represents an extraordinarily rapid change in management, in that, <10Â years ago, laborious Seattle-type biopsy protocols were recommended, and high grade dysplasia was an indication for resectional surgery. Now, individual patient management is paramount: multi-professional meetings determine management after biopsy and EMR assessment. One significant change is that major resections are undertaken less often, in Western countries, for CLO neoplasia.

AB  - Aim:? The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) show differential activation during an emotional activation task compared with age- and sex-matched controls, by measuring changes in the concentration of oxygenated (oxyHb) and deoxygenated (deoxyHb) hemoglobin, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods:? Fourteen patients with PDD and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated in the study. The relative changes of concentrations of oxyHb and deoxyHb were measured on NIRS during an implicit processing task of fearful expression using Japanese standard faces. Results:? PDD patients had significantly reduced oxyHb changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to healthy controls. Conclusion:? PFC dysfunction may exist in PDD.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a powerful tool for medical screening and diagnosis, where a small capsule is swallowed and moved by means of natural peristalsis and gravity through the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine.

AB  - Background Headache resulting from idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in a population of moderately to obese women of childbearing age. The causes overall remain unclear. With this review, we provide an overview of clinical treatment and management strategies. Results IIH management is dependent on the signs and symptoms presented. Symptomatic treatment should attempt to lower intracranial pressure, reduce pain, and protect the optic nerves. Consideration for lumbar puncture and draining fluid as an option for reducing pressure may be helpful; however, repeated treatment is not usually favored by patients. Traditional prophylactic medications used in migraine may help reduce the primary headache often induced by raised intracranial pressure. We suggested surgical intervention for patients experiencing visual loss or impending visual loss and not responding to medication therapy. Conclusion In this review, we discuss headache associated with IIH and spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Much needs to be learned about treatment options for patients with cerebrospinal fluid leaks including methods to strengthen the dura.

AB  - Abstract Rapid and accurate recognition of lesions masquerading as acute stroke is important. Any incorrect or delayed diagnosis of stroke mimics will not only increase the risk of being exposed to unnecessary and possibly dangerous interventional therapies, but will also delay proper treatment. In this article, written from a neuroradiologist's perspective, we classified these lesions masquerading as acute stroke into three groups: lesions that may have ?normal imaging,? lesions that are ?symptom mimics? but on imaging clearly not a stroke, and lesions that are ?symptom and imaging mimics? with imaging findings similar to stroke. We focused the review on neuroimaging findings of the latter two groups ending with a suggestion for a diagnostic approach in the form of an algorithm. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Since the promulgation of the one-child policy in 1979, most families have had only one child. Shidu parents, as a special group of Sichuan 2008 earthquake victims, are parents who lost their only child in the earthquake. What does this paper added to existing knowledge? Shidu parents are an especially vulnerable group in China. This study was the first systematic population-based investigation to explore quality of life (QOL) risk factors and to examine the moderating role of social support between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and QOL in Shidu parents. What are the implications for practice? The results found that further social support should be provided as a long-term mental health intervention strategy to promote QOL in Shidu parents suffering from PTSD. The research may provide information to assist psychologists in post-disaster mental health interventions with Shidu parents and to inspire decision makers who work with similar groups in other countries. Abstract Introduction Because of the one-child policy in force in China from 1979 to 2015, most parents were only allowed to have a single child. Of all the Sichuan earthquake victims, there was a special group called the Shidu parents who lost their only childÂ in the earthquake. Aim The aim of this study was to identify the related risk factors for the Shidu parents' quality of life (QOL) and to examine the role of socialÂ support as a moderator between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and QOL in Shidu parents. Method A cross-sectional sample survey was conducted toÂ collect data from 10 heavily damaged counties in Sichuan province (nÂ =Â 176). Discussion PTSD was found to be negatively associated with the Shidu parents' QOL, and social support had a major effect on moderating the association between the PTSD and QOL in Shidu parents. Implications for practice Developing suitable social support could be considered a key part of psychological intervention strategies to promote QOL in Shidu parents suffering from PTSD. This study could provide decision support for mental health professionals (e.g. nurses and psychiatrists) working on mental crisis interventions with Shidu parents.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand?s disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficient levels of or dysfunctional von Willebrand factor (VWF). This phase II/III open-label, multicentre study evaluated the efficacy and safety of BIOSTATE?, a high purity plasma-derived double-virus inactivated FVIII/VWF concentrate, when used in non-surgical bleeds, surgical procedures and prophylactic therapy in VWD patients for whom desmopressin treatment was deemed ineffective, inadequate or contraindicated. Twenty three patients (7 type 1, 9 type 2 and 7 type 3; 12 male, 11 female), who received FVIII/VWF concentrate as part of their VWD management, were recruited prospectively between December 2004 and May 2007 from eight centres in Australia and New Zealand. BIOSTATE dosing was based on pre-treatment FVIII:C and/or VWF:RCo plasma levels and a predetermined dosing guide. Haemostatic efficacy of BIOSTATE was rated as excellent or good for all major and minor surgery events, long-term prophylaxis, and for four of the six assessable non-surgical bleeding events. Blood transfusions were required by two major surgery patients as well as one patient with a non-surgical bleed. The median overall exposure to BIOSTATE across all groups was 8?days, greater in the prophylactic group (range 53?197) compared with major surgery (3?24), minor surgery (1?8) and non-surgical bleeds (1?10). BIOSTATE was shown to be efficacious and well tolerated when treating patients with VWD. This study also provides important insights into dosing regimens with BIOSTATE and the role of monitoring therapy with FVIII:C and VWF:RCo.

AB  - Impaired white matter integrity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to deficits in various neurological functions. The differentiation of the underlying pathological processes, e.g. edema, demyelination, axonal damage, to name a few, is of key clinical interest for the assessment of white matter injury. In this study, a combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI was used to study the spatiotemporal changes in white matter at 1?h, 3?h, and 1, 2, 7 and 14?days following TBI, using a rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. Based on radial diffusivity (RD), the rats were divided into two groups: group 1 showed widespread increases in RD along the corpus callosum of the ipsilesional hemisphere at day 2, and group 2 showed normal RD. Based on this group separation, group 1 also showed similar widespread changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2 at day 2, and group 2 showed normal FA and T2. The widespread changes in RD and T2 in group 1 on day 2 were apparently dominated by edema, which obscured possible myelin and axonal damage. In contrast, the susceptibility of group 1 showed more localized increases near the impact site on day 2, and otherwise similar contrast to the contralesional hemisphere. The localized susceptibility increase is probably a result of demyelination and axonal injury. The extent of brain damage between the two groups revealed by MRI was consistent with behavioral results, with the first group showing significantly increased forelimb asymmetry and increased forelimb foot fault deficits. Our results suggest that the combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI may provide an opportunity for the differential assessment of edema and axonal damage in TBI.

AB  - Summary Aim Peri-operative hyperglycaemia is associated with an increased incidence of adverse outcomes. Communication between primary and secondary care is paramount to minimise these harms. National guidance in the UK recommends that the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) should be measured within 3Â months prior to surgery and that the concentration should be less that 69Â mmol/mol (8.5%). In addition, national guidance outlines the minimum dataset that should be included in any letter at the time of referral to the surgeons. Currently, it is unclear how well this process is being carried out. This study investigated the quality of information being handed over during the referral from primary care to surgical outpatients within the East of England. Methods Primary care referrals to nine different NHS hospital Trusts were gathered over a 1-week period. All age groups were included from 11 different surgical specialties. Referral letters were analysed using a standardised data collection tool based on the national guidelines. Results A total of 1919 referrals were received, of whom 169 (8.8%) had previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM). However, of these, 38 made no mention of DM in the referral letter but were on glucose-lowering agents. Only 13 (7.7%) referrals for patients with DM contained a recent HbA1c, and 20 (11.8%) contained no documentation of glucose-lowering medication. Conclusion This study has shown that the quality of referral letters to surgical specialties for patients with DM in the East of England remain inadequate. There is a clear need for improving the quality of clinical data contained within referral letters from primary care. In addition, we have shown that the rate of referral for surgery for people with diabetes is almost 50% higher than the background population with diabetes.

AB  - Summary Head injury is one of the major causes of trauma-related morbidity and mortality in all age groups in the United Kingdom, and anaesthetists encounter this problem in many areas of their work. Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes following traumatic brain injury and a wealth of research, there is currently no specific treatment. Outcome remains dependant on basic clinical care: management of the patient?s airway with particular attention to preventing hypoxia; avoidance of the extremes of lung ventilation; and the maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion, in an attempt to avoid exacerbating any secondary injury. Hypertonic fluids show promise in the management of patients with raised intracranial pressure. Computed tomography scanning has had a major impact on the early identification of lesions amenable to surgery, and recent guidelines have rationalised its use in those with less severe injuries. Within critical care, the importance of controlling blood glucose is becoming clearer, along with the potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia. The major improvement in outcome reflects the use of protocols to guide resuscitation, investigation and treatment and the role of specialist neurosciences centres in caring for these patients. Finally, certain groups are now recognised as being at greater risk, in particular the elderly, anticoagulated patient. You can respond to this article at http://www.anaesthesiacorrespondence.com

AB  - Summary The classification of mental disorders has improved greatly in the last decade of the 20th century and now provides a reliable operational tool. Both the ICD and DSM classifications have greatly facilitated practice, teaching and research by providing better delineation of the syndromes. The absence of aetiological information, linked to brain physiology that could serve as the basis of independent definitional variables, has, however, limited the understanding of mental illness and has been a stumbling block to the development of better classifications. The use of a universal classification for differing cultures has also raised concerns about a lack of sensitivity to local diversity, especially as human behaviour is not always context-free. Given these limitations, and the expectations of scientific advances in the field of genetics, neurobiology, and cultural studies, we should be able to build better classifications based on an international consensus informed by evidence-based research.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarises various actions that should be taken preoperatively to help ensure the patient does not become infected. This involves ensuring the patient is clean, free from infection and less likely to acquire infection during surgery. Actions needed during surgery to reduce the chances of infection may include: hand decontamination; incise drapes; sterile gowns; gloves; antiseptic skin preparation; patient temperature; patient oxygenation; perfusion during surgery; and wound irrigation. Postoperative patients who suffer from infection following surgery need to be monitored and treated urgently to prevent further issues with their health and well-being. Patients who have infections before surgery need to be treated to prevent further problems. Postoperative infections must be treated urgently by using antibiotics to cover the range of possible pathogens. To support the patient, recovery practitioners needs training and understanding of the methods used to care for wounds.

Despite continuous research efforts and advances in technology, the rate of central venous catheter infections has remained relatively constant over the past decade. This article focuses on four pertinent aspects of central venous access infection: microbial etiology and pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. An update of the scientific literature in this area will aid clinicians in their patient care practices and serve to identify unanswered questions.

AB  - Summary This case report describes a geriatric gelding with a 2 month history of fast-growing masses within the parotid and submandibular regions. The horse was dyspnoeic on presentation and upper airway endoscopy revealed partial airway obstruction at the level of the pharynx, secondary to a space-occupying mass. Cytological evaluation of multiple fine-needle aspirates obtained from the masses were suggestive of salivary gland neoplasia, therefore the horse was subjected to humane euthanasia. A computed tomographical scan was obtained post mortem and revealed a large multi-lobulated mass involving both guttural pouches, resulting in 80% occlusion of the naso- and oropharynx. Histopathology confirmed a parotid salivary gland carcinoma (papillary-cystic type). Salivary gland tumours are extremely rare in horses, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Treatment of these malignancies proves to be challenging, requiring complete parotidectomy or surgical debulkment, in combination with adjunctive therapy.

AB  - Abstract Identifying differential responses between sexes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) can elucidate the mechanisms behind disease pathology. Peripheral and central inflammation in the pathophysiology of TBI can increase sleep in male rodents, but this remains untested in females. We hypothesized that diffuse TBI would increase inflammation and sleep in males more so than in females. Diffuse TBI was induced in C57BL/6J mice and serial blood samples were collected (baseline, 1, 5, 7Â days post-injury [DPI]) to quantify peripheral immune cell populations and sleep regulatory cytokines. Brains and spleens were harvested at 7DPI to quantify central and peripheral immune cells, respectively. Mixed-effects regression models were used for data analysis. Female TBI mice had 77%?124% higher IL-6 levels than male TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, whereas IL-1? and TNF-Î± levels were similar between sexes at all timepoints. Despite baseline sex differences in blood-measured Ly6Chigh monocytes (females had 40% more than males), TBI reduced monocytes by 67% in TBI mice at 1DPI. Male TBI mice had 31%?33% more blood-measured and 31% more spleen-measured Ly6G+ neutrophils than female TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, and 7DPI, respectively. Compared with sham, TBI increased sleep in both sexes during the first light and dark cycles. Male TBI mice slept 11%?17% more than female TBI mice, depending on the cycle. Thus, sex and TBI interactions may alter the peripheral inflammation profile and sleep patterns, which might explain discrepancies in disease progression based on sex.

AB  - (Headache 2010;50:1262-1272) Objectives.? To determine the prevalence, characteristics, impact, and treatment patterns of headaches after concussion in US Army soldiers returning from a deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. Methods.? A cross-sectional study was conducted with a cohort of soldiers undergoing postdeployment evaluation during a 5-month period at the Madigan Traumatic Brain Injury Program at Ft. Lewis, WA. All soldiers screening positive for a deployment-related concussion were given a 13-item headache questionnaire. Results.? A total of 1033 (19.6%) of 5270 returning soldiers met criteria for a deployment-related concussion. Among those with a concussion, 957 (97.8%) reported having headaches during the final 3 months of deployment. Posttraumatic headaches, defined as headaches beginning within 1 week after a concussion, were present in 361 (37%) soldiers. In total, 58% of posttraumatic headaches were classified as migraine. Posttraumatic headaches had a higher attack frequency than nontraumatic headaches, averaging 10 days per month. Chronic daily headache was present in 27% of soldiers with posttraumatic headache compared with 14% of soldiers with nontraumatic headache. Posttraumatic headaches interfered with duty performance in 37% of cases and caused more sick call visits compared with nontraumatic headache. In total, 78% of soldiers with posttraumatic headache used abortive medications, predominantly over-the-counter analgesics, and most perceived medication as effective. Conclusions.? More than 1 in 3 returning military troops who have sustained a deployment-related concussion have headaches that meet criteria for posttraumatic headache. Migraine is the predominant headache phenotype precipitated by a concussion during military deployment. Compared with headaches not directly attributable to head trauma, posttraumatic headaches are associated with a higher frequency of headache attacks and an increased prevalence of chronic daily headache.

AB  - Aim To explore the association between social disadvantage and developmental diagnoses in pre-school children. Methods Between 2012 and 2015, 845 pre-school children were assessed by the Child Assessment Team at Campbelltown Hospital. A social worker interviewed 469 families and these children were eligible for inclusion in the study. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was confirmed in 290 children. Of those without ASD, 72 did not have global developmental delay (GDD) and were excluded from the study. The remaining 107 children with GDD were used as the comparison group. Social risk factors in the two groups were compared using ? 2 tests. Variables with statistical significance were then entered into a logistic regression. Results After logistic regression, children with ASD were more likely to be male (odds ratio (OR) 3.1, 95% CI 0.195?0.529; P?<?0.001) and their parents were more likely to have a clinically significant stress score (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.334?0.992; P?=?0.047). Children with GDD were more likely to live in a disadvantaged suburb (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.042?2.940; P?=?0.034), more likely to have a sole parent (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.062?3.082; P?=?0.029) and much more likely to have had involvement with child protection services (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.044?7.416; P?<?0.001). Conclusions Children with GDD without autism were more likely to be disadvantaged and to have had contact with child protection services than children with ASD. This has implications for the assessment, early intervention and support services for children with disabilities and their families.

AB  - Aim? Genetic testing in the epilepsies is becoming an increasingly accessible clinical tool. Mutations in the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit (SCN1A) gene are most notably associated with Dravet syndrome. This is the first study to assess the impact of SCN1A testing on patient management from both carer and physician perspectives. Method? Participants were identified prospectively from referrals to the Epilepsy Genetics Service in Glasgow and contacted via their referring clinicians. Questionnaires exploring the consequences of SCN1A genetic testing for each case were sent to carers and physicians. Results? Of the 244 individuals contacted, 182 (75%) carried a SCN1A mutation. Carers of 187 (77%) patients responded (90 females, 97 males; mean age at referral 4y 10mo; interquartile range 9y 1mo). Of those participants whose children tested positive for a mutation, 87% reported that genetic testing was helpful, leading to treatment changes resulting in fewer seizures and improved access to therapies and respite care. Out of 187 physicians, 163 responded (87%), of whom 48% reported that a positive test facilitated diagnosis earlier than with clinical and electroencephalography data alone. It prevented additional investigations in 67% of patients, altered treatment approach in 69%, influenced medication choice in 74%, and, through medication change, improved seizure control in 42%. Interpretation? In addition to confirming a clinical diagnosis, a positive SCN1A test result influenced treatment choice and assisted in accessing additional therapies, especially in the very young.
