AB  - Summary In the horse, the phalanges are the second most common location for the occurrence of osseous cyst-like lesions (OCLLs) after the medial femoral condyle of the stifle. Phalangeal OCLLs occur in a variety of locations, most of which are adjacent to, if not communicating with, a joint. The aetiology of these lesions is considered to be multifactorial by most authors. Horses with OCLLs demonstrate lameness of varying severity. Diagnostic analgesia should be used to localise the lameness. After localisation of the lameness, standard radiographic views of the isolated area should be performed. The radiographic characteristics of OCLLs are dependent on the stage of development of the OCLL; OCLLs may first be identified as a small lucent flattening or depression in the articular surface; however, they may progress to a circular, oval or conical single or multi chambered radiolucency within the bone. There may be a rim of radiodense sclerosis around the lucency. Diagnosis of some OCLLs may only be achieved using nonstandard radiographic views or may require advanced diagnostic imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment of phalangeal cysts may be conservative or surgical. Surgical treatment options generally aim to prevent cyst enlargement and promote filling of the lesion with osseous material. Depending on the cyst, this can be performed arthroscopically or via an extra-articular approach. Occasionally, the severity of proximal interphalangeal joint OCLLs warrants surgical arthrodesis. Overall the prognosis for return to performance for horses with OCLLs ranges from 30?90% but is dependent on the breed, age and intended use of the horse, surface area of weightbearing cartilage affected, concurrent osteoarthritis within the joint and treatment administered.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes how the systematic ACCEPT approach enables movements of ill and injured patients between or within hospitals. Centralisation of specialist services means more transfers for clinical reasons. Many of these transfers will be time critical, some will be intensive, and some will be both. The chapter provides an overview of the patient groups that typically will need to be transferred to specialist centres, some of their characteristics and associated specific clinical management. Some of these broad categories of patients includes: neurosurgery (traumatic brain injury, cerebral bleeds), trauma, burns, vascular surgery (abdominal aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic dissection, acute limb ischaemia), interventional radiology, cardiology (primary coronary intervention), nephrology (acute renal failure), obstetric, and level 3 transfers. However, early and effective communication between centres is essential to ensure that any specific treatments are administered before or during the transfer to optimise patient care.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a possible link between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obesity risk, which would have implications for the development of obesity-related diseases in this population. The present study examined the association between PTSD and obesity and whether this association differed by sex in a representative sample of the US population. A secondary objective was to determine whether the association between PTSD and obesity was mediated by binge eating disorder (BED). Data were from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), which comprises three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys that were conducted between 2001 and 2003. Logistic regression analyses weighted to represent the general US adult population were performed. In the total sample of 20,013 participants, rates of obesity were 24.1% for persons without a lifetime history of PTSD and 32.6% among persons with PTSD in the past year. Adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, depression, substance and alcohol abuse/dependence, and psychotropic medication status, past year PTSD was associated with greater likelihood of obesity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18, 1.95), with no differences by gender. BED did not statistically mediate the relationship between PTSD and obesity. The present study provides support for a link between PTSD and obesity. Findings further existing literature by indicating that the association is consistent across sexes and is not statistically mediated by BED.

AB  - Summary Vertebral fracture is usually the first osteoporotic fracture to occur and also the most common osteoporotic fracture, being present in 15% of women aged 50-59 years. Despite the clear clinical importance of vertebral fractures, they remain underdiagnosed in clinical practice. Good technique in performing spinal radiographs and a high level of observer experience in image interpretation are key to the reliable diagnosis of vertebral fractures. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) is being utilized increasingly for vertebral fracture identification. Density and structural parameters obtained by volumetric quantitative computed tomography (vQCT) can predict vertebral compressive strength ex vivo, and these parameters, together with nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) can also be applicable in vivo. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect minor acute or subacute vertebral fracture or re-fracture, determine fracture age, and distinguish between osteoporotic and neoplastic fracture with greater sensitivity than other imaging techniques.

AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.

AB  - Abstract This study used in-depth interviews to explore the experiences of parents who were re-contacted with new genetic results many years after the death of a child with a mitochondrial disorder. At the time of their child's illness, parents had consented to a tissue sample being taken to help with diagnosis of a suspected mitochondrial disorder, and subsequently further DNA testing identified the genetic cause. Parents did not express negative feelings about being re-contacted with new information, and hoped that continuing research might help other families. Positive aspects included relief from feelings of guilt over the cause of the child's disorder, and having accurate genetic information available for surviving children. Difficult emotional and psychosocial implications included contradictions to previous beliefs about inheritance, deciding how and when to communicate information to surviving children, and coping with new fears for the mother's health if a gene located in the mitochondrial DNA was identified. In half of the families the new results significantly altered the parents? understanding of the inheritance pattern. This study highlights the impact of new genetic information offered after a delay of several years, which has the potential to re-open feelings of grief and uncertainty and can present a new inheritance scenario for which research participants or their families are unprepared. Health professionals involved in conveying genetic research results can help to support families through this process.

AB  - The anatomy of the cervical spine musculature visible on magnetic resonance (MR) images is poorly described in the literature. However, the correct identification of individual muscles is clinically important because certain conditions of the cervical spine, for example whiplash associated disorders, idiopathic neck pain, cervical nerve root avulsion and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, are associated with different morphological changes in specific muscles visible on MR images. Knowledge of the precise structure of different cervical spine muscles is crucial when comparisons with the contralateral side or with normal are required for accurate description of imaging pathology, management and assessment of treatment efficacy. However, learning the intricate arrangement of 27 muscles is challenging. A multi-level cross-sectional depiction combined with three-dimensional reconstructions could facilitate the understanding of this anatomically complex area. This paper presents a comprehensive series of labeled axial MR images from one individual and serves as a reference atlas of the cervical spine musculature to guide clinicians, researchers, and anatomists in the accurate identification of these muscles on MR imaging.

AB  - Summary Clinical assessment instruments are useful tools for accurate diagnosis and differential diagnosis of mental disorders. After an introduction on the criteria used in current psychiatric classifications, the authors outline the rationale underlying the development of these instruments and describe the major instruments that have been developed over the past 20 years. These are: 1) diagnostic checklists, 2) semi-structured interviews for Axis-I disorders, 3) semi-structured interviews for personality disorders, 4) fully structured interviews, 5) diagnostic screening questionnaires, and 6) interviews for the assessment of disablement. Special emphasis is given to their clinical and psychometric characteristics and tables illustrate sample items of these instruments. The authors conclude with a discussion on reliability and validity issues and present criteria to guide the clinician or researcher in the choice of the best instrument.

AB  - Abstract Background Leprosy or Hansen's disease is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) or Mycobacterium lepromatosis (M. lepromatosis). In Europe, most of the leprosy cases are imported. However, occasionally a case is diagnosed in one of the old endemic foci. Leprosy is often not suspected because it is no longer emphasized in the medical curricula. Attention shifted from leprosy to tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus infections in the late 20th century, whereby the WHO leprosy programme was toned down in the conviction that leprosy was all but eliminated. The result of unawareness is a harmful doctor's delay. Material and methods This paper focusses on clinical diagnosis, complications and treatment based on literature and experience. Results It mentions the value of laboratory tests in classification, follow-up and detection of relapses. It discusses the etiopathology. Conclusion This is a position statement.

AB  - The intrauterine development of the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most interesting fields in perinatology. The brain has three-dimensional structure and rapidly changes its appearance during pregnancy. Therefore, the fetal brain should be evaluated three-dimensionally with consideration of gestational age. Sonoembryology has been established by high-frequency transvaginal sonography. Premature brain structure and ventricular system of early fetuses can be clearly demonstrated and prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies has been done earlier and earlier. Application of transvaginal approach to the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters has enabled brain imaging from fetal parietal direction through fontanelles and cranial sutures, and ?neurosonography? has been established. Recent introduction of 3D ultrasound in neurosonography produced skull imaging, serial parallel images of the brain structure, volume extraction of target organ and brain circulatory images. Furthermore, advanced technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate CNS morphology including the brain stem, which is not clearly depicted by sonography. By using all those technologies, prenatal diagnosis of CNS abnormalities has been more objective and accurate. Intracranial changes in cases with CNS anomalies have been objectively demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, intrauterine acquired brain damage such as periventricular leukomalacia, which is one of the controversial issues in perinatology, has been proven by sonography in a few cases. Further case studies will be required for investigation of CNS pathology in utero.

AB  - Dry eye conditions are prevalent with one in four to five patients presenting to eye care practitioners having dry eye signs and/or symptoms. An intimate relationship exists between the ocular surface and the tear film. The cycle of tear film instability and ocular surface damage characteristic of dry eye conditions suggests that dry eye represents a dysfunction of an integrated ocular surface-lacrimal gland unit. Therefore, dry eye is a multifactorial condition and an approach based on clinical subtypes is required for diagnosis and management. There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a contributing and exacerbating factor in dry eye conditions and anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy for chronic dry eye conditions may facilitate ocular surface healing. Other promising new treatments for dry eye include new generation artificial tear polymers and preservative systems, secretagogues, topical androgen supplements and surgical techniques for ocular surface reconstruction.

First, lifestyle and potentially interfering female factors should be corrected. Then, whenever an evidence-based therapy is available, any specific cause interfering with sperm output or function should be treated. Finally, although they are not evidence-based, assisted reproductive techniques can be used to alleviate long-standing male infertility

AB  - Abstract Cognitive deficits after a traumatic brain injury can result in significant functional limitations in all areas of daily living. An individual's ability to generalize learning may be limited, thus making it harder to live independently in the community. Assessing a client's metacognitive skills and awareness level may help to establish a baseline understanding about the supervision required and the most suitable living arrangements. This study describes a multicontextual, community re-entry occupational therapy programme directed at awareness training and compensation for cognitive problems in a 34-year-old man with traumatic brain injury. Intervention consisted of metacognitive training, exploration and use of effective processing strategies, task gradations and practice of functional activities in multiple environmental contexts. Strategies such as self-prediction, self-monitoring, role reversal and the use of checklists were used. Results after six months of intervention show improvements in the client's awareness level, enhancement of his occupational function, increased satisfaction with performance and a decrease in the level of attendant care. Additional studies are recommended to validate the findings. Copyright ? 2001 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Background Rapid and precise measurement of total and differential nucleated cell counts is a crucial diagnostic component of cavitary and synovial fluid analyses. Objectives The objectives of this study included (1) evaluation of reliability and precision of canine and equine fluid total nucleated cell count (TNCC) determined by the benchtop Abaxis VetScan HM5, in comparison with the automated reference instruments ADVIA 120 and the scil Vet abc, respectively, and (2) comparison of automated with manual canine differential nucleated cell counts. Methods The TNCC and differential counts in canine pleural and peritoneal, and equine synovial fluids were determined on the Abaxis VetScan HM5 and compared with the ADVIA 120 and Vet abc analyzer, respectively. Statistical analyses included correlation, least squares fit linear regression, Passing?Bablok regression, and Bland?Altman difference plots. In addition, precision of the total cell count generated by the VetScan HM5 was determined. Results Agreement was excellent without significant constant or proportional bias for canine cavitary fluid TNCC. Automated and manual differential counts had R2 < .5 for individual cell types (least squares fit linear regression). Equine synovial fluid TNCC agreed but with some bias due to the VetScan HM5 overestimating TNCC compared to the Vet abc. Intra-assay precision of the VetScan HM5 in 3 fluid samples was 2?31%. Conclusions The Abaxis VetScan HM5 provided rapid, reliable TNCC for canine and equine fluid samples. The differential nucleated cell count should be verified microscopically as counts from the VetScan HM5 and also from the ADVIA 120 were often incorrect in canine fluid samples.

AB  - Abstract Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell (PC) malignancy characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal PCs in the bone marrow and the production of large amounts of a monoclonal immunoglobulin or paraprotein. In the past years, new approaches in the diagnosis and treatment were introduced aiming to identify high-risk patients who need proper anti-myeloma treatment. Intensive therapy including autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the new agents bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide have improved patients? responses. Further optimalization of the different treatment schedules in well-defined patient groups may prolong their survival. Patient stratification is currently based on patient characteristics, extent of myeloma disease, and associated cytogenetic and laboratory anomalies. More and more gene expression studies are introduced to stratify patients and to individualize therapy.

AB  - Abstract Background? Fecal incontinence (FI) is a major part of illness and physical discomfort in the general population. Since the 1990s, sacral nerve stimulation has been well established in the treatment of neurogenic FI. The precise placement of the electrode is crucial for the success of the procedure. Eighty percent of the patients benefit from permanent treatment, but in 10?20% of the patients tested electrode placement proves impossible due to anatomical variations of the sacral foramina. In this study, we describe the technical requirements and a new method of electrode placement with reference to the anatomical (bone) landmarks in an animal model. Methods? With a small endoscope (Verres needle), we accessed the perirectal space to identify the nervous structures. A stimulated sphincter EMG was obtained for the experimental animals and muscle action potential (MAP/M-wave), latency time [ms], and the amplitude of the motor response [?V] were recorded. Electrodes were placed, the animals killed and dissected leaving the pelvic cavity untouched. The specimens were examined in a magnetic resonance scanner and in a multi-slice computed tomography scanner to detect the electrode material and possible surgical complications. After that the specimens were dissected. Key Results? In all eight cases in the four animals tested, we were able to stimulate the sacral nerve as demonstrated by the EMG findings. No major surgical complications were observed for the procedure. Conclusions & Inferences? Endoscopic sacral nerve root stimulation is a safe and effective method for delivering stimulation material in the pelvis of the sheep. It is a promising procedure to be tested in humans.
