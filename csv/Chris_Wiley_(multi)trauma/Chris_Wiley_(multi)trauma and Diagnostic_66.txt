AB  - Glandular and pseudoglandular tumors of the penile skin are extremely uncommon and can present diagnostic challenges. Primary adenosquamous carcinoma of the penis is an extremely rare tumor, composed of distinct areas of malignant squamous and glandular cells, making it a diagnostically challenging entity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes several subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), each with its own distinctive pathologic appearance, clinical associations and prognosis. Among these variants is the exceedingly uncommon adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC), representing 1%?2% of all SCC of the penis. Recent large studies have interrogated the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in malignant penile tumors and have shown specific morphologic patterns and clinical presentations to associate with HPV status. However, given the rarity of the adenosquamous variant of SCC, it has largely been excluded from these studies. The glandular components of these lesions can present a confusing appearance, particularly when a large tumor is represented on a small biopsy. Here we describe a difficult histologic presentation of this rare tumor, with the first published characterization of the HPV status of this subtype. This case represents a distinctly unusual case of metastatic HPV-positive primary cutaneous adenosquamous carcinoma of the penis.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric critical care. The Transfusion Requirements in Pediatric Intensive Care Units study randomized to either transfusion threshold 9.5?g/dL or 7?g/dL using leukocyte-reduced packed red blood cells (PRBC). Deaths, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), adverse events, ventilator days, and nosocomial infections were not significantly different in the two groups. When split into subgroups of pediatric cardiac surgery patients and pediatric general surgery patients, the restrictive PRBC transfusion strategy showed no increase in MODS. PRBC transfusions appear to be independently linked to increased risk of morbidity and mortality in critically ill pediatric patients. Pediatric intensivists have recognized that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children is different from ARDS in adults. Recurrent hypotension in a pediatric trauma patient occurs late and may be an ominous sign.

AB  - Background Smaller hippocampal volume in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents the most consistently reported structural alteration in the brain. Subfields of the hippocampus play distinct roles in encoding and processing of memories, which are disrupted in PTSD. We examined PTSD-associated alterations in 12 hippocampal subfields in relation to global hippocampal shape, and clinical features. Methods Case-control cross-sectional studies of U.S. military veterans (n = 282) from the Iraq and Afghanistan era were grouped into PTSD (n = 142) and trauma-exposed controls (n = 140). Participants underwent clinical evaluation for PTSD and associated clinical parameters followed by MRI at 3 T. Segmentation with FreeSurfer v6.0 produced hippocampal subfield volumes for the left and right CA1, CA3, CA4, DG, fimbria, fissure, hippocampus-amygdala transition area, molecular layer, parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, and tail, as well as hippocampal meshes. Covariates included age, gender, trauma exposure, alcohol use, depressive symptoms, antidepressant medication use, total hippocampal volume, and MRI scanner model. Results Significantly lower subfield volumes were associated with PTSD in left CA1 (P = 0.01; d = 0.21; uncorrected), CA3 (P = 0.04; d = 0.08; uncorrected), and right CA3 (P = 0.02; d = 0.07; uncorrected) only if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume was included as a covariate. A trend level association of L-CA1 with PTSD (F4, 221 = 3.32, P = 0.07) is present and the other subfield findings are nonsignificant if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume is not included as a covariate. PTSD-associated differences in global hippocampal shape were nonsignificant. Conclusions The present finding of smaller hippocampal CA1 in PTSD is consistent with model systems in rodents that exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior from repeated exposure to acute stress. Behavioral correlations with hippocampal subfield volume differences in PTSD will elucidate their relevance to PTSD, particularly behaviors of associative fear learning, extinction training, and formation of false memories.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the ability to obtain diagnostic cytology samples from appendicular bone lesions using ultrasound-guided needle aspirations. Secondary objectives were to compare cytological evaluations with histopathological results and to determine the utility of staining malignant mesenchymal cells for the presence of alkaline phosphatase. Methods: Aspirations from 36 aggressive appendicular bone lesions with histological diagnoses were included in the study. Ultrasound was used to guide the needle to the medullary cavity or the adjacent soft tissue mass. The smears stained with Wright-Giemsa and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate toluidine salt (NBT/BCIP) were examined. Results: A diagnostic sample was obtained in 32 of the 36 cases. Of the 32 diagnostic samples, cytology indicated sarcoma, with a sensitivity of 97 per cent (confidence interval: 83 to 100 per cent) and a specificity of 100 per cent (confidence interval: 16 to 100 per cent). When a diagnosis of sarcoma was made on cytology, alkaline phosphatase staining indicated osteosarcoma, with a sensitivity of 100 per cent (confidence interval: 87 to 100 per cent). Clinical Significance: The results of this study indicate that ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of aggressive bone lesions is a viable technique for identifying malignant mesenchymal cells and for diagnosing sarcomas. It is cost-effective and minimally invasive. Furthermore, identifying alkaline-phosphatase-negative malignant mesenchymal cells from a bone aspiration may rule out osteosarcoma, whereas alkaline-phosphatase-positive malignant mesenchymal cells are suggestive of osteosarcoma.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of suspected instability in dogs with vertebral fractures or subluxations. Eleven dogs that had MRI examinations of the spine prior to surgical stabilization of vertebral fractures and/or subluxations were included in the study. Nine dogs also had survey radiographs. Four dogs had cervical fracture or fracture-subluxation and presented with tetraplegia with intact nociception (n = 2) or nonambulatory tetraparesis (n = 2). Seven dogs had thoracolumbar fracture-subluxation or subluxation and presented with paraplegia with intact nociception (n = 5) or nonambulatory paraparesis (n = 2). A three-compartment model was applied to the interpretation of both the radiographic and MRI studies. Radiography identified compartmental disruption consistent with spinal instability in seven out of the nine cases radiographed. In MRI studies, rupture of the supportive soft tissue structures and/or fracture in at least two compartments could be visualized. Nine cases had spinal cord changes on MRI including signal intensity changes, swelling, compression, and intramedullary hemorrhage. Paravertebral muscle intensity changes were also visible at each trauma site. Magnetic resonance imaging provided helpful information on the location and extent of damage to supportive soft tissue structures and enabled assessment of spinal cord injury in this group of dogs with surgically confirmed vertebral fractures and subluxations.

AB  - Summary Accurate pharmacoepidemiologic study conclusions require assessment of valid data, regardless of whether the data originate from questionnaires, administrative claims, or electronic health records. This chapter provides an overview of current methodologic concerns in validation studies, including types and detection of measurement error, effects of error on the point estimate of association, and correction options. Validity issues for diagnosis and medication data, and how the accuracy of these data varies by patient and other characteristics, are also discussed. Two examples are provided to illustrate validation efforts for questionnaires and electronic data: nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and myocardial infarction and NSAIDs and gastrointestinal bleeding. Current solutions include steps to consider when designing and analyzing validation studies using either questionnaire or electronic data. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the continued need for validation studies, especially as research moves toward incorporation of new data sources, increase in data linkage, and use of unstructured data for pharmacoepidemiology research.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic odontoid fractures (TOFs) have been described as the most common injury affecting the C-spine in the elderly. Previous studies have identified degenerative changes and bone loss as important predisposing factors. However, their interaction and respective age-adjusted impact needs further clarification. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 5303 patients (aged ≥60 years) admitted to a level I trauma center between January 2008 and January 2016 who underwent CT imaging of the C-spine. Ninety-two patients with TOF and 80 patients with other cervical spine fractures (OCSF) were identified and a respective 3:1 age- and sex-matched control group without fractures after trauma was built. In all groups, cervical bone mineral density (cBMD) was determined using phantom calibration, and degenerative changes were evaluated in a qualitative manner. In all groups, the severity of degenerative changes of the C-spine increased with age (all p <?0.05) and was inversely correlated with cBMD (all p < 0.05). cBMD was the only significant predictor of a TOF in a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?3.066, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432?6.563 for cervical osteoporosis). An association between odontoid cysts and TOF reached significance only in Anderson and D'Alonzo (A 95% CI 1.012?1.890). Patients with OCSFs, compared with patients with TOFs, were younger (median 74 versus 83 years) and had a higher cBMD (median 208?mg/mL versus 172?mg/mL). No differences were observable when comparing cBMD and grades of degenerative changes between OCSFs and their control group (all p >0.1). Decreased cBMD is the major predisposing factor for the occurrence of TOF but not for OCSF in the elderly. The severity of odontoid cysts was found to be a cBMD-independent factor associated with A&D type II TOFs. However, degenerative changes in the odontoid neighboring joints seem to be an epiphenomenon of bone loss and older age but do not independently predispose for TOF. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine current clinical practices for managing behavioural emergencies within Victorian public hospital EDs. Methods A multi-centre retrospective study involving all patients who attended ED in 2016 at the Alfred, Ballarat, Dandenong, Geelong and Royal Melbourne Hospitals. The primary outcome was the rate of patient presentations with at least one restrictive intervention. Secondary outcomes included the rate of security calls for unarmed threats (Code Grey), legal status under the Mental Health Act at both the time of ED arrival and the restrictive intervention, and intervention details. For each site, data on 100 patients who had a restrictive intervention were randomly extracted for indication and methods of restraint. Results In 2016, 327?454 patients presented to the five EDs; the Code Grey rate was 1.49% (95% CI 1.45?1.54). Within the Code Grey population, 942 had at least one restrictive intervention (24.3%, 95% CI 23.0?25.7). Details were extracted on 494 patients. The majority (62.8%, 95% CI 58.4?67.1) were restrained under a Duty of Care. Physical restraint was used for 165 (33.4%, 95% CI 29.3?37.8) patients, 296 were mechanically restrained (59.9%, 95% CI 55.4?64.3), median mechanical restraint time 180?min (IQR 75?360), and 388 chemically restrained (78.5%, 95% CI 74.6?82.0). Conclusions Restrictive interventions in the ED largely occurred under a Duty of Care. Care of patients managed under legislation that covers assessment and treatment of mental illness has a strong clinical governance framework and focus on minimising restrictive interventions. However, this is not applied to the majority of patients who experience restraint in Victorian EDs.

AB  - Abstract Background The tendency to respond with fear and avoidance can be seen as a shared vulnerability contributing to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Although several studies have examined which specific symptoms of PTSD (re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal) are associated with chronic pain, none has considered this association within the framework of fear-avoidance models. Methods Seven hundred fourteen patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain were assessed. Of these, 149 patients were selected for the study based upon the following inclusion criteria: exposure to a traumatic event before the onset of pain (with scores equal to or higher than 8 points on the fear and hopelessness scales of the Stressful Life Event Screening Questionnaire Revised) and scores equal to or higher than 30 on the Davidson Trauma Scale. Results Structural equation modelling was used to test the association between PTSD symptoms and pain outcomes (pain intensity and disability) using the mediating variables considered in the fear-avoidance models. The results show that emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms, but neither re-experiencing nor avoidance, affected pain outcome via anxiety sensitivity (AS), catastrophizing and fear of pain. PTSD symptoms increased the levels of AS, which predisposes to catastrophizing and, in turn, had an effect on the tendency of pain patients to respond with more fear and avoidance. Conclusions This study provides empirical support for the potential role of PTSD symptoms in fear-avoidance models of chronic pain and suggests that AS is a relevant variable in the relationship between both disorders.

AB  - Background The ability to drive is a core function supporting independent living. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may impair driving capacity in numerous ways. Previous research has documented that individuals with TBI have more driving-related problems than other people and has identified predictors of driving status or capacity, mostly among civilians; however, no research has examined the implications of driving limitations for the well-being of individuals with TBI. Objective To examine the association between self-reported difficulty in driving with important domains of psychological well-being in veterans with TBI, with adjustment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and years since most recent TBI. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Veterans' homes. Participants A total of 61 veterans of the Global Wars on Terrorism diagnosed with TBI, all outpatients at a Veterans Affairs medical center rehabilitation service. Methods Home interviews as a baseline assessment for a larger randomized controlled trial. Main Outcome Measures Community reintegration (extent of social participation), depressive symptomatology, and role limitations due to physical health problems and those due to emotional problems. Self-rated competence in driving was the predictor, and sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis of PTSD, severity of TBI, and time since most recent TBI were covariates. Results Self-rated driving difficulty was associated with decreased community reintegration (? = .280, P =.028), greater depressive symptomatology (? = ?.402, P < .001), and greater role limitations due to physical problems (? = ?.312, P =.011) and to emotional problems (? = ?.324, P = .006), after we adjusted for PTSD and other variables. Discussion The self-reported ability to drive seems to be central to psychological well-being in veterans with TBI, showing clear associations with depression, community reintegration, and health-related role limitations. These associations cannot be attributed to comorbid PTSD. Conclusion Rehabilitation specialists should view driving difficulty as a risk factor for poor psychosocial outcomes in veterans with TBI and seek ways to compensate for the veteran's loss of driving if it is no longer advisable.

AB  - Telomeropathies involve a wide variety of infrequent genetic diseases caused by mutations in the telomerase maintenance mechanism or the DNA damage response (DDR) system. They are considered a family of rare diseases that often share causes, molecular mechanisms and symptoms. Generally, these diseases are not diagnosed until the symptoms are advanced, diminishing the survival time of patients. Although several related syndromes may still be unrecognized this work describes those that are known, highlighting that because they are rare diseases, physicians should be trained in their early diagnosis. The etiology and diagnosis are discussed for each telomeropathy and the treatments when available, along with a new classification of this group of diseases. Ethical and legal issues related to this group of diseases are also considered.

AB  - Summary Aims This study aimed at understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with inattention induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI). To eliminate the potential confounding caused by the heterogeneity of TBI, we focused on young adults postsports-related concussion (SRC). Methods Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data were collected from 27 young adults post-SRC and 27 group-matched normal controls (NCs), while performing a visual sustained attention task. Task responsive cortical activation maps and pairwise functional connectivity among six regions of interest were constructed for each subject. Correlations among the brain imaging measures and clinical measures of attention were calculated in each group. Results Compared to the NCs, the SRC group showed significantly increased brain activation in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and increased functional connectivity between right inferior occipital cortex (IOC) bilateral calcarine gyri (CG). The left MFG activation magnitude was significantly negatively correlated with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in the NCs, but not in the patients. The right hemisphere CG-IOC functional connectivity showed a significant positive correlation with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in patients, but not in NCs. Conclusion The current data suggest that abnormal left MFG activation and hyper-communications between right IOC and bilateral CG during visual attention processing may significantly contribute to behavioral manifestations of attention deficits in patients with TBI.

Risk factors examined fell into three main categories: pre-disaster child and family vulnerability factors, including childhood psychopathology; objective and subjective disaster-related experiences; and post-disaster factors, including results from screening questionnaires administered 5 months post-disaster, coping mechanisms adopted subsequently, life events, and availability of social supports. Developing PTSD following the disaster was significantly associated with being female, with pre-disaster factors of learning and psychological difficulties in the child and violence in the home, with severity of exposure to the disaster, survivors' subjective appraisal of the experience, adjustment in the early post-disaster period, and life events and social supports subsequently. When all these factors were considered together, measures of the degree of exposure to the disaster and of subjective appraisal of life threat, and ratings of anxiety obtained 5 months post-disaster, best predicted whether survivors developed PTSD. For those survivors who developed PTSD, its duration and severity were best predicted not by objective and subjective disaster-related factors, but by pre-disaster vulnerability factors of social, physical, and psychological difficulties in childhood together with ratings of depression obtained 5 months post-disaster, and whether survivors received post-disaster support at school. The implications of these findings are considered for targeting assessment and intervention efforts at survivors most at risk of developing difficulties in adjustment following similar traumatic experiences.

AB  - Abstract Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a rare inherited disorder in the methionine catabolic pathway, in which the impaired synthesis of cystathionine leads to accumulation of homocysteine. Patients can present to many different specialists and diagnosis is often delayed. Severely affected patients usually present in childhood with ectopia lentis, learning difficulties and skeletal abnormalities. These patients generally require treatment with a low-methionine diet and/or betaine. In contrast, mildly affected patients are likely to present as adults with thromboembolism and to respond to treatment with pyridoxine. In this article, we present recommendations for the diagnosis and management of CBS deficiency, based on a systematic review of the literature. Unfortunately, the quality of the evidence is poor, as it often is for rare diseases. We strongly recommend measuring the plasma total homocysteine concentrations in any patient whose clinical features suggest the diagnosis. Our recommendations may help to standardise testing for pyridoxine responsiveness. Current evidence suggests that patients are unlikely to develop complications if the plasma total homocysteine concentration is maintained below 120 ?mol/L. Nevertheless, we recommend keeping the concentration below 100 ?mol/L because levels fluctuate and the complications associated with high levels are so serious.
