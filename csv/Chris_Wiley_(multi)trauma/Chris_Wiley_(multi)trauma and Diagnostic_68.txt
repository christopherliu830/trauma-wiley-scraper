AB  - Summary Mesenteric ischaemia results from decreased blood flow to the bowel, causing cellular injury from lack of oxygen and nutrients. Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is an uncommon disorder with high morbidity and mortality, but outcomes are improved with prompt recognition and aggressive treatment. Five subgroups of AMI have been identified, with superior mesenteric artery embolism (SMAE) the most common. Older age and cardiovascular disease are common risk factors for AMI, excepting acute mesenteric venous thrombosis (AMVT), which affects younger patients with hypercoaguable states. AMI is characterized by sudden onset of abdominal pain; a benign abdominal exam may be observed prior to bowel infarction. Conventional angiography and more recently, computed tomography angiography, are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Correction of predisposing conditions, volume resuscitation and antibiotic treatment are standard treatments for AMI, and surgery is mandated in the setting of peritoneal signs. Intra-arterial vasodilators are used routinely in the treatment of non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) and also are advocated in the treatment of occlusive AMI to decrease associated vasospasm. Thrombolytics have been used on a limited basis to treat occlusive AMI. A variety of agents have been studied in animal models to treat reperfusion injury, which sometimes can be more harmful than ischaemic injury. Chronic mesenteric ischaemia (CMI) usually is caused by severe obstructive atherosclerotic disease of two or more splanchnic vessels, presents with post-prandial pain and weight loss, and is treated by either surgical revascularization or percutaneous angioplasty and stenting.

AB  - Summary Cytopathology, a branch of diagnostic pathology provides an alternative to histopathological examination and has several advantages. Specimen collection is relatively simple and quick, is much less invasive (does not require surgery) and processing is much faster that of the paraffin wax embedding method employed in routine histopathology. This chapter introduces the reader to the techniques employed in the Cytopathology laboratory from specimen collection and preparation to diagnosis. The fundamentals of cytomorphology and cytodiagnosis are described in brief. The history of the cervical screening programme is covered, from its introduction, through the limitations of specimen collection, the Papnicolaou (Pap) smear, via the pivotal role played by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in the progression to cervical cancer, to the introduction of Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) and the new HPV vaccine reaching market.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is now an accepted standard of care for specific patients with malignant melanoma. With this comes an increase in sensitivity of diagnosis of melanoma metastases but also possible false positive results. Proceeding to a formal lmyphadenectomy in sentinel node positive patients is accompanied by a large amount of morbidity and should not be undertaken lightly. Melan-A is one of the stains used to identify melanoma metastases in sentinel node biopsies. The dilemma arises when there is a small number of Melan-A positive cells or even a single Melan-A positive cell in the entire examined sentinel node. Do we proceed to formal lymphadenectomy or ?watch & wait?. The purpose of this projected study is to examine the sentinel nodes of patients without a diagnosis of melanoma. We aim to perform a Melan-A stain on these nodes and identify the incidence of Melan-A positive staining nodes in presumed melanoma free patients. These nodes will be taken from sentinel nodes of breast cancer patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the perioperative findings and outcome of dogs undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the management of pyothorax. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?14). Methods Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. Results Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n?=?2), migrating plant material (n?=?2), and idiopathic (n?=?10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved. One patient had recurrence of a pyothorax requiring revision surgery 17 months postoperatively. Conclusion VATS allows minimally invasive treatment of uncomplicated canine pyothorax. Preoperative thoracic CT may help identify candidates for VATS among dogs with pyothorax.

AB  - Summary Double aortic arch is the most common congenital anomaly of the aortic arch system, in which the trachea and esophagus are completely encircled by vascular segments of the aortic arch and its branches, often resulting in variable airway compression. One case of late diagnosis of this congenital malformation and long-term consequences of late surgical treatment with persistent tracheo-broncomalacia and dynamic airway obstruction is reported. This report emphasizes the importance of an early diagnosis to minimise the progressive airways damage and subsequent respiratory symptoms, that need an accurate medical follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to provide insight into survivor-reported negative and positive consequences of cancer during adolescence 10 years after diagnosis and compare these with consequences reported 3 and 4 years after diagnosis. Methods Three, 4, and 10 years after diagnosis, survivors of adolescent cancer were interviewed about negative and positive consequences due to their cancer experience. Manifest content analysis was used to identify categories of reported consequences. Categories of consequences 10 years after diagnosis were compared with consequences reported 3 and 4 years after diagnosis. Results Seven categories of negative consequences were identified: bodily concerns, existential thoughts about loss and life (new at 10 years), psychological problems, difficulties interacting with others, health worries (new), fertility concerns (new), and frustrations about health care (new); and six categories of positive consequences: positive view of life, positive view of self, compassion for others (new), close relationships, gained knowledge about disease and health care, and financial gains. Consistent with previous time points, bodily concerns were reported most often. The majority of survivors (n?=?22) reported both negative and positive consequences of their former disease. Few reported only negative (n?=?2) or only positive consequences (n?=?4). Conclusions Ten years after diagnosis, most survivors reported both negative and positive consequences. New themes, relevant to young adulthood and long-term survival, were identified. Health care professionals treating young adult survivors may anticipate and address problems regarding physical health, fertility, and health care but may also reinforce positive affect by addressing survivors' positive views of life, sense of self, and close relationships. ? 2014 The Authors.

AB  - ABSTRACT Survival for penile cancer is high but treatment can have a long-term detrimental effect on urological function and quality of life. Owing to its rarity, it is difficult to include men with penile cancer in research about their condition. The aim of this study was to identify aspects of their diagnosis and treatment that they would want explored in penile cancer research. The study employed a participative, mixed qualitative methods design; it utilized focus groups and patient-conducted interviews, combined into a 1 day ?pilot workshop?. The data were analysed using framework analysis. ?Early signs and seeking help?, ?disclosure of a ?personal? cancer? and ?urological (dys)function? emerged as three key themes. Men with penile cancer want research about their condition to explore early signs and helping seeking, disclosure of a ?personal? cancer and urological (dys)function. Research could use methodologies that include consideration of the chronological narrative of the experiences of men with penile cancer, which could be applied in clinical practice by integrating opportunities to explore specific aspects of their experiences at appropriate times along the care pathway.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to describe and discuss the diagnostic and treatment challenges related to tooth fractures primarily in the vertical plane, that is, the long axis of the crown and/or root. This includes when and how to identify and determine the extent of the fracture, when a coronal restoration should be placed, when root canal treatment is needed, and when a tooth or root should be extracted based on the location and extent of the fracture. The term ?longitudinal fractures? is used because they usually represent vertical extensions of fractures over distance and time. These fractures often present problems with diagnosis and treatment, but should be considered as findings only. They are not to be considered as pulpal or periapical diagnoses, but as pathways for bacteria that may induce pulpal and/or periapical inflammation or disease. Longitudinal fractures are divided into five definitive classifications, generally from least to most severe: (1) craze lines; (2) fractured cusp; (3) cracked tooth; (4) split tooth; and (5) vertical root fracture. These differ but have frequently been confused or combined in clinical articles, creating misunderstanding and resulting in incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. These classifications have been devised to provide global definitions that researchers and clinicians can use to eliminate this confusion. This review is subdivided into these five classifications as to incidence, pathogenesis, clinical features, etiologies, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention.

AB  - Abstract Periprosthetic joint infection is among the most common and severe complications in total joint arthroplasty. Today, a combination of different methods is used for diagnosis because no single method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity is available. In this study, we explored the usability of single-molecule microscopy to characterize synovial fluid samples from periprosthetic joint infections. Patients (n?=?27) that needed revision arthroplasty underwent the routine diagnostic procedures for periprosthetic joint infection of the University Hospital in Bonn. Additionally, the diffusion rate of two probes, dextran and hyaluronan, was measured in small volumes of periprosthetic synovial fluid samples using single-molecule microscopy. To evaluate the suitability of single-molecule microscopy to detect PJI the AUC for both markers was calculated. The diffusion rate of hyaluronan in periprosthetic synovial fluid from patients with septic loosening was faster than in samples from patients with aseptic loosening. Single-molecule microscopy showed excellent diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, and allowed the detection of periprosthetic joint infection in patients that would be challenging to diagnose with current methods. For the first time, single-molecule microscopy was used to detect periprosthetic joint infection. Our results are encouraging to study the value of single-molecule microscopy in a larger patient cohort. The speed and accuracy of single-molecule microscopy can be used to further characterize synovial fluid, potentially allowing intraoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections in the future.

AB  - Summary Oral (OP) and nail (NP) pigmentations may occur simultaneously in physiological or pathological conditions, and may be a sign of underlying syndromic conditions that necessitate further investigation and treatment. Interestingly, the nail unit and oral cavity show a clinical parallelism that may help the clinician to conduct a correct examination and reach a prompt diagnosis. Both OP and NP can manifest clinically with focal or diffuse involvement and are due to external factors (exogenous pigmentation, drug-induced pigmentation) or endogenous factors (racial pigmentation, post-inflammatory pigmentation, nevi, genetic conditions and other disorders). The most concerning differential diagnosis is melanoma. Here we report the pathogenetic basis of OP and NP, together with the description of similar clinical features. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to summarize and describe the causes of pigmentation of both the oral cavity and the nail unit.

AB  - Abstract Clinical criteria for the classification of symptomatic idiopathic (primary) osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands were developed from data collected in a multi-center study. Patients with OA were compared with a group of patients who had hand symptoms from other causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and the spondylar-thropathies. Variables from the medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiographs were analyzed. All patients had pain, aching, or stiffness in the hands. Patients were classified as having clinical OA if on examination there was hard tissue enlargement involving at least 2 of 10 selected joints, swelling of fewer than 3 metacarpophalangeal joints, and hard tissue enlargement of at least 2 distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. If the patient had fewer than 2 enlarged DIP joints, then deformity of at least 1 of the 10 selected joints was necessary in order to classify the symptoms as being due to OA. The 10 selected joints were the second and third DIP, the second and third proximal interphalangeal, and the trapeziometacarpal (base of the thumb) joints of both hands. Criteria derived using the ?classification tree? method were 92% sensitive and 98% specific. The ?traditional format? classification method required that at least 3 of these 4 criteria be present to classify a patient as having OA of the hand. The latter sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 87%. Radiography was of less value than clinical examination in the classification of symptomatic OA of the hands.

AB  - Purpose No randomized controlled trials of treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) exist. Since severely preterm neonatal survival has increased over time, survival as an outcome measure is confounded by calendar time. The diagnosis-to-delivery interval is a calendar year independent measure of success of treatment. We wished to evaluate whether treatment of TTTS is associated with a lengthening of the diagnosis-to-delivery interval. Methods MEDLINE search supplemented by careful reference review. All TTTS series were included where the following information on each patient was available: survival, fetal demise, gestational age (GA) at diagnosis and diagnosis to delivery interval in days. Inclusion criteria GA?≤?29?weeks and diagnosis by ultrasound in the absence of maternal symptoms. Cases undergoing multiple types of treatment were excluded. Data were evaluated by Kruskal?Wallis anova, logistic regression & Wilcoxon rank sum testing. Results The 8 publications used included the following cases: controls (n?=?16), amnioreduction (n?=?61), septostomy (n?=?12), and fetoscopic laser occlusion of chorioangiopagus vessels (FLOC) (n?=?51). FLOC therapy showed a significantly longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction (median 75 vs. 56?days) (p?=?0.01). There was no difference in overall survival, at least one survivor, or number of fetal deaths between the 4 groups. Logistic regression using at least one survivor as the dependent variable revealed a positive association with GA at diagnosis and with diagnosis to delivery interval, a negative correlation with fetal death, and no correlation with treatment group. Conclusions FLOC therapy for TTTS is associated with a longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction without a significant increase in survival. The lack of increase in survival appears to be due to a small sample size.

AB  - Background:? If a clinician has to make decisions on diagnosis and treatment, he or she is confronted with a variety of causal theories. In order to compare these theories a neutral terminology and notational system is needed. The Causal Modelling framework involving three levels of description ? biological, cognitive and behavioural ? has previously been used to compare causal accounts for dyslexia and autism. Method:? In this article we present this framework and explore its application to four causal theories of conduct disorder. We discuss the problems we encountered in this application and evaluate both the framework and the theories of conduct disorder. Conclusions:? It was possible to capture parts of the theories of conduct disorder in the Causal Modelling framework but a multi-model approach may be necessary for the alternative theories of conduct disorder we evaluate. The application of the framework helps to see the relationships among the various theories of aspects of conduct disorder and demonstrates the need for more explicitness in the causal theories.

AB  - Summary Digital radiography is the most common advanced dental technology that patients experience during diagnostic visits. The earliest uses of the computer in dentistry were in the business office and accounting. This chapter includes the discussion of some basic oral radiology terms, both conventional and digital. There are several principles of radiation safety: As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), justification, limitation, optimization, and the use of selection criteria. The chapter reviews these and then discusses how digital radiography plays a vital role in the improved safety of modern radiography. Dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is arguably the most exciting advancement in oral radiology since panoramic radiology in the 1950s and1960s and perhaps since Roentgen's discovery of X-rays in 1895. Low dose CBCT protocols can potentially bring the radiation dose of CBCT into the realm of panoramic imaging.

AB  - Abstract Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute gastrointestinal disorder that is the most common and requiring emergency hospitalization. Its incidence is increasing worldwide, thus increasing the burden of medical services. Approximately 20% of the patients develop moderate to severe necrotizing pancreatitis associated with pancreatic or peri-pancreatic tissue necrosis and multiple organ failure. There are many reports about the anti-inflammatory effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on pancreatitis and the repair of tissue damage. MSCs cells come from a wide range of sources, autologous MSCs come from bone marrow and allogeneic MSCs such as umbilical cord blood MSCs, placenta-derived MSCs, etc. The wide source is not only an advantage of MSCs but also a disadvantage of MSCs. Because of different cell sources and different methods of collection and preparation, it is impossible to establish a unified standard method for evaluation of efficacy. The biggest advantage of iMSCs is that it can be prepared by a standardized process, and can be prepared on a large scale, which makes it easier to commercialize. This paper reviews the present status of diagnosis and progress of MSCs therapy for AP.

AB  - Summary As compared with European practice, the American approach to resuscitation from traumatic haemorrhage de-emphasises pre-hospital interventions in favour of rapid transport to definitive care; limits initial surgical interventions under the damage control model; uses crystalloid as the initial fluid of choice; and follows an empiric 1:1:1 approach to transfusion with red cells, plasma and platelets in hemodynamically unstable and actively bleeding patients. The use of bedside visco-elastic testing to guide coagulation support is not as widespread as in Europe, while the early administration of tranexamic acid is more selective.
