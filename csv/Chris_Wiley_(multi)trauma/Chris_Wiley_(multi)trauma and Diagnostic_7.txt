AB  - Translations of summary This study deals with the individual and collective memory of Leningrad Siege survivors who experienced mass and prolonged wartime trauma during childhood (1941?44). While much has been published about the Siege, there has to date been no investigation by psychologists into the effects of extreme deprivation on Siege victims apart from one pilot study (Gulina et al., 2005). This study is still underway. Interviews with 80 participants (68 female and 12 male) are analysed and discussed here. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and content analysis are utilized. Unpublished archival writings by children caught in the Siege have been analysed. The principal method of interpretation is based on a psychoanalytic understanding of child development, mourning and the metabolizing of traumatic experience. The subjective meaning of the Siege experience to individual children is considered

AB  - Objective To describe the technique and findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? protocol in dogs suffering from trauma. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study on a new point-of-care ultrasound protocol on 64 dogs suffering from trauma and comparison of findings with radiology. Results Comparison of the results of this new ultrasound protocol for trauma patients with radiography findings for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, alveolar-interstitial syndrome and abdominal effusion revealed positive agreement of 89, 83, 100 and 87% and negative agreement of 76, 83, 76 and 92%, respectively. Novel findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? exam, which were not previously reported for dogs undergoing focused assessment with sonography for trauma, included alveolar-interstitial syndrome (suggestive of pulmonary contusions), diaphragmatic hernia, retroperitoneal effusion and tracheal injury. Our new technique may also help identify increased intracranial pressure via changes in optic nerve sheath diameter and haemodynamic instability through the evaluation of the caudal vena cava and cardiac function. Clinical Significance The described ultrasound examination protocol can be rapidly performed on dogs suffering from trauma during resuscitation and it may detect injuries previously undetectable using other veterinary point-of-care ultrasound protocols.

AB  - Summary Tranexamic acid is used both pre-hospital and in-hospital as an antifibrinolytic drug to treat or prevent hyperfibrinolysis in trauma patients; dosing, however, remains empirical. We aimed to measure plasma levels of tranexamic acid in patients receiving pre-hospital anti-hyperfibrinolytic therapy and to build a population pharmacokinetic model to propose an optimised dosing regimen. Seventy-three trauma patients were enrolled and each received tranexamic acid 1 g intravenously pre-hospital. A blood sample was drawn after arrival in the emergency department, and we measured the plasma tranexamic acid concentration using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and modelled the data using non-linear mixed effect modelling. Tranexamic acid was administered at a median (IQR [range]) time of 43 (30?55 [5?135]) min after trauma. Plasma tranexamic acid levels were determined on arrival at hospital, 57 (43?70 [20?148]) min after pre-hospital administration of the drug. The measured concentration was 28.7 (21.5?38.5 [8.7?89.0]) ?g.ml?1. Our subjects had sustained severe trauma; injury severity score 20 (16?29 [5?75]), including penetrating injury in 2.8% and isolated traumatic brain injury in 19.7%. The pharmacokinetics were ascribed a two-compartment open model with body-weight as the main covariate. As tranexamic acid concentrations may fall below therapeutic levels during initial hospital treatment, we propose additional dosing schemes to maintain a specific target blood concentration for as long as required. This is the first study to investigate plasma level and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after pre-hospital administration in trauma patients. Our proposed dosing regimen could be used in subsequent clinical trials to better study efficacy and tolerance profiles with controlled blood concentrations.

AB  - summary? The aim of this work was twofold: to evaluate the prevalence of different Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) diagnosis in an Italian population of subjects seeking TMD treatment in a tertiary clinic; and to compare data with those from similar studies in the literature. Participants in this study were 433 consecutive patients seeking TMD treatment at the Section of Prosthetic Dentistry, Department of Neuroscience, University of Pisa, Italy; mean age of patients was 38·8?years, with a female:male ratio of 2·6:1 (276 females, 73·2%; 101 males, 26·8%). RDC/TMD guidelines for examination were adopted to assign axis I diagnosis. The prevalence of RDC/TMD diagnoses was 38·2% (144/377) for group I disorders (muscle disorders), 52·3% (197/377) for group II disorders (disc displacements), and 52·6% (198/377) for group III disorders (arthralgia, osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis). The present investigation provided findings that, compared and integrated with literature data, can be useful to create a world-wide database, in accordance with the nature of the RDC/TMD classification system.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims Despite advances towards integration of care for women with co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low abstinence rates following SUD/PTSD treatment remain the norm. The utility of investigating distinct substance use trajectories is a critical innovation in the detection and refining of effective interventions for this clinical population. Design and Methods The present study reanalysed data from the largest randomised clinical trial to date for co-occurring SUD and PTSD in women (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network; Women and Trauma Study). Randomised participants (n?=?353) received one of two interventions in addition to treatment as usual for SUD: (i) trauma-informed integrative treatment for PTSD/SUD; or (ii) an active control psychoeducation course on women's health. The present study utilised latent growth mixture models (LGMM) with multiple groups to estimate women's substance use patterns during the 12-month follow-up period. Results Findings provided support for three different trajectories of substance use in the post-treatment year: (i) consistently low likelihood and use frequency; (ii) consistently high likelihood and use frequency; and (iii) high likelihood and moderate use frequency. Covariate analyses revealed improvement in PTSD severity was associated with membership in a specific substance use trajectory, although receiving trauma-informed treatment was not. Additionally, SUD severity, age and after-care efforts were shown to be related to trajectory membership. Discussion and Conclusions Findings highlight the necessity of accounting for heterogeneity in post-treatment substance use, relevance of trauma-informed care in SUD recovery and benefits of incorporating methodologies like LGMM when evaluating SUD treatment outcomes.

AB  - Summary Despite an increasing number of case reports published using computed tomography (CT) in foals only limited data on its diagnostic utility are available. Medical and imaging records of 10 foals that had a CT examination between May 2008 and December 2010 were retrieved and studied. Three out of 10 cases were examined for orthopaedic problems, 3 were referred for medical disorders, 3 for both orthopaedic and medical problems, and one case was presented for a follow-up of an abdominal mass. In this series CT was an accurate diagnostic tool in identifying abscesses, osteomyelitis, arthritis, physitis and fractures, bone ossification defects, intracranial haematomas and sinusitis. An indication for the best medical and/or surgical approach was obtained.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Controversial recommendations regarding the evaluation of dysphonia have been made in the absence of evidence related to clinical practice. This study aims to describe existing patterns of care for dysphonia to generate data for potential systemic improvement and provide a baseline for dysphonia recommendations. Study Design Retrospective review. Methods Information regarding the current complaint, including duration of hoarseness; inciting factors; number and type of previous physicians seen; Voice Handicap Index-10; and details of prior evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment was collected from patient records. Results A total of 259 patients complaining of hoarseness were evaluated. Of those, 35.1% presented directly to subspecialty care, whereas 61% were previously evaluated by another otolaryngologist. Median times (in months) from symptom onset to evaluation were as follows: initial evaluation, 3.0; laryngoscopy, 3.0; stroboscopic exam, 5.8; subspecialty evaluation, 6.6. A total of 64.5% of patients had at least one incoming diagnosis; 45% of all incoming diagnoses were revised on re-evaluation. Diagnoses most commonly revised included ?no abnormality,? edema or laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPR), infection or allergy, and muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) or behavioral disorders. Final diagnoses that most frequently differed from incoming diagnoses were paresis; MTD or behavioral disorders; malignancy; and sulcus, atrophy, or scar. Conclusions Patients received prompt laryngeal visualization. However, we observed high rates of diagnostic error. Initial diagnoses of LPR, edema, infection, and allergy appear to be particularly likely to be revised on further evaluation; and scar, sulcus, atrophy, and paresis are likely to be overlooked.

Diagnostic ultrasound demonstrated a fluid filled cavernous mass that was not clearly demarcated from the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. Contrast radiography with intralesional injection of contrast medium showed accumulation of the medium in the caverns of the mass and in the saphenous vein. Contrast enhanced computed tomography demonstrated 2 vascular meshes, one deep and one more superficially, closely associated with the mass. Surgical excision of the mass was performed and a vascular hamartoma was diagnosed based on histopathology. The horse showed no signs of recurrence 7 months after surgery.

AB  - Objectives:? This study examined: (i) the prevalence of trauma in a bipolar disorder (BD) sample, and (ii) how trauma histories mediated by interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence impact on the severity of BD. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its relationship to outcomes in BD were also examined. Methods:? Sixty participants were recruited from a geographically well-defined mental health service in Northern Ireland. Self-reported trauma histories, PTSD, interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence and were examined in relation to illness severity. Results:? A high prevalence of trauma was found. Trauma predicted the frequency of hospital admissions (R2?=?0.08), quality of life (R2?=?0.23) and inter-episode depressive symptoms (R2?=?0.13). Interpersonal difficulties, but not alcohol dependence, appeared to play an important role in mediating these adverse effects. While only 8% of the sample met criteria for active PTSD, this comorbid disorder was associated with BD severity. Conclusions:? This study indicates that awareness of trauma is important in understanding individual differences in bipolar presentations. The theoretical and clinical implications of evidence that trauma is related to more adverse outcomes in BD are discussed. The finding that interpersonal difficulties mediate the relationship between trauma and BD severity is novel. The need for adjunctive evidence-based treatments targeting interpersonal difficulties is considered.

AB  - Abstract Females typically report higher social phobia levels than males in community samples, and this may be due to sex bias in assessment measures. This study aims to establish whether patterns of responding to social phobia diagnostic criteria in the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) are comparable across males and females. A subsample of participants in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (1997) reporting at least one social fear were selected (n?=?1755). Analyses were conducted using a series of multi-group confirmatory factor analyses for categorical data, with unique steps to model invariance of residual variances. Partial, but not full, invariance was established, as males and females differed in their responses to items assessing physical anxiety symptoms at low levels of social fear. Whilst these differences were statistically significant, they are likely not to affect clinical practice or rates of social phobia diagnosis. This supports differences on this measure being interpreted as genuine, and strengthens findings females are more vulnerable to social phobia than males. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background:? In surgical patients, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are often measured as a marker of inflammation and infection. However, the diagnostic and prognostic value of a single initial CRP measurement in the acute presentation has not been well established. This study was performed to investigate the usefulness of measuring CRP in such a setting. Methods:? CRP levels were measured retrospectively in 473 surgical patients who presented to the Royal Adelaide Hospital emergency department. This was correlated with patient outcomes, defined by the need for imaging tests and/or surgical interventions, the length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality. Spearman's rank correlation and one-way analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis. Results:? Of 473 patients, 42% had a CRP test in the emergency department within 24?h of admission. Approximately 80% of patients required imaging for diagnosis and 40% required surgery, regardless of the initial CRP level. No correlation was evident between initial CRP level and length of hospital stay (r= 0.06). One-way analysis of variance revealed no variation in levels between patients who required imaging or had surgery compared to those who did not, with P-values of 0.76 and 0.85, respectively. Two patients died within 30 days of presentation. Conclusions:? CRP has poor diagnostic and prognostic capabilities as a single initial measurement in acute surgical patients. The statistical analyses imply that CRP levels are unable to accurately predict outcomes of such patients. Therefore, we suggest that CRP should not be used as a routine screening tool.

AB  - Background and Objectives Smoking rates are markedly higher among trauma-exposed individuals relative to non?trauma-exposed individuals. Extant work suggests that both perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies are independent mechanisms that link trauma-related symptoms and smoking. Yet, no work has examined perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies as potential explanatory variables for the relation between trauma-related symptom severity and smoking in a sequential pathway model. Methods The present study utilized a sample of treatment-seeking, trauma-exposed smokers (n?=?363; 49.0% female) to examine perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies for smoking as potential sequential explanatory variables linking trauma-related symptom severity and nicotine dependence, perceived barriers to smoking cessation, and severity of withdrawal-related problems and symptoms during past quit attempts. Results As hypothesized, perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies had a significant sequential indirect effect on trauma-related symptom severity and criterion variables. Conclusions and Scientific Significance Findings further elucidate the complex pathways through which trauma-related symptoms contribute to smoking behavior and cognitions, and highlight the importance of addressing perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies in smoking cessation programs among trauma-exposed individuals.

AB  - Abstract Background To investigate the prevalence of findings of spinal injury on computed tomography (CT) images of pediatric trauma patients and to define indicators for the possible presence of spinal injuries. Methods Spinal CT for pediatric trauma patients (age ≤ 12 years) over a 2-year period was retrospectively evaluated for the presence of findings suggestive of spinal injury. Results Of the 773 patients reviewed, 19 (2.4%) showed traumatic spinal lesions on their spinal CT images. These patients were significantly older than those without spinal lesions (mean age 7.9 ± 3.3 years vs 6.1 ± 3.3 years; P = 0.02). The prevalence of spinal trauma was significantly lower in patients aged 0?8 years than in those aged 9?12 years (P = 0.025). Spinal injury was significantly higher in female patients (P = 0.014). Most of the spinal injuries were located at the lumbar and sacral vertebral levels, and most did not cause neurological complications or require surgical treatment. Important indicators of the possible presence of spinal injuries were pain, tenderness, or ecchymosis over the spine, a low Glasgow Coma Scale score (≤12), head injury (for cervical injuries), or intrathoracic injuries and pelvic fractures (for lumbar and sacral injuries). Conclusions Most spinal CT examinations for the diagnosis of spinal injuries in children did not show positive findings. Thus, many children were exposed to an unnecessary high dose of radiation. New clinical evaluation criteria and indicators should be defined to diagnose spinal injuries and avoid unnecessary radiological examinations.

AB  - Abstract Objective Risk scores and accelerated diagnostic protocols can identify chest pain patients with low risk of major adverse cardiac event who could be discharged early from the ED, saving time and costs. We aimed to derive and validate a chest pain score and accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP) that could safely increase the proportion of patients suitable for early discharge. Methods Logistic regression identified statistical predictors for major adverse cardiac events in a derivation cohort. Statistical coefficients were converted to whole numbers to create a score. Clinician feedback was used to improve the clinical plausibility and the usability of the final score (Emergency Department Assessment of Chest pain Score [EDACS]). EDACS was combined with electrocardiogram results and troponin results at 0 and 2?h to develop an ADP (EDACS-ADP). The score and EDACS-ADP were validated and tested for reproducibility in separate cohorts of patients. Results In the derivation (n = 1974) and validation (n = 608) cohorts, the EDACS-ADP classified 42.2% (sensitivity 99.0%, specificity 49.9%) and 51.3% (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 59.0%) as low risk of major adverse cardiac events, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient for categorisation of patients as low risk was 0.87. Conclusion The EDACS-ADP identified approximately half of the patients presenting to the ED with possible cardiac chest pain as having low risk of short-term major adverse cardiac events, with high sensitivity. This is a significant improvement on similar, previously reported protocols. The EDACS-ADP is reproducible and has the potential to make considerable cost reductions to health systems.

AB  - Abstract This Case report illustrates the importance of coordinating various dental specialties in the successful treatment of the traumatized patient. The patient sustained multiple traumatic injuries to the anterior maxilla in the primary and permanent dentition stages of development. Orthodontic considerations involved in this case included an unerupted maxillary right central incisor with dilaceration of its root, severe malocclusion, and compromised esthetics. Endodontic concerns were directed toward the traumatized primary and permanent maxillary incisors with subsequent devitalization of the maxillary right permanent central incisor and calcification of the maxillary left permanent incisor. Oral surgery, oral pathology and general dentistry were also involved throughout the course of treatment.
