AB  - Summary The rapid rise of medical imaging reflects ongoing advances in technology and expanded applications in high-;tech modalities. This growth rate is abetted by reflexive acceptance of imaging as standard of care, without an evidence base to create formal practice guidelines. Major causes of inappropriate utilization of medical imaging include: 1) medical liability fears, 2) patient demand, 3) economically motivated in-;office self-;referral, and 4) physician inexperience and lack of support in the appropriate clinical application of diagnostic imaging. In this chapter we will describe the current status of tools such as computer-;based decision support tools.

AB  - Abstract Thirty-four (34) days after arrival at our facility, a recently imported rhesus macaque demonstrated a grade 4/5 reaction to intradermal testing with mammalian old tuberculin and a strong positive response in a serum interferon gamma (IFN-?) stimulation assay (Primagam?). The affected animal was euthanized to prevent further exposure of the other rhesus in the quarantine room. Necropsy revealed enlarged, caseating mediastinal lymph nodes. Further analysis confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms. Strict isolation measures were initiated and intensive testing of all animals in the affected room began immediately. After 13?weeks of additional testing, none of the animals in the room showed any positive response and all were released from quarantine. This case illustrates the importance of prolonged quarantine of non-human primates (NHP) and illustrates the usefulness of serology-based diagnostics as an adjunct to intradermal testing (molecular-based diagnostics typically refers to polymerase chain reaction, whereas this assay is really serology based, even though it is an in vitro IFN-? stimulation assay). It also demonstrates that with proper isolation procedures, the spread of tuberculosis can be prevented in NHP facilities.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to compare the sperm morphology and nuclear sperm quality (sperm aneuploidy and DNA fragmentation) in two groups of globozoospermic patients: DPY19L2-mutated patients (n = 6) and SPATA16-mutated patients (n = 2). Results for these two groups were also compared to a group of fertile men (n = 25). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed for chromosomes X, Y and 18. Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Sanger sequencing was performed for mutations screening of DPY19L2 and SPATA16 genes. Sperm analysis revealed a classic phenotype of total globozoospermia in DPY19L2-mutated group and a particular phenotype characterised by a predominance of double/multiple round-headed (39.00 ± 4.2%) and multi-tailed spermatozoa (26.00 ± 16.97%) in SPATA16-mutated group. FISH analysis showed a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in globozoospermic patients compared to controls (p < 0.05), and a higher rate was observed in SPATA16-mutated group compared to DPY19L2-mutated group (p < 0.05). DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in globozoospermic men compared to controls (p < 0.001), and there is no statistically significant difference between the two globozoospermic groups. We showed that SPATA16 defects could be associated with an abnormal meiosis leading to a particular morphological sperm defect of double/multiple round-headed and multi-flagella and a higher sperm aneuploidy rate than in case of DPY19L2-defects in classic globozoospermia.

AB  - Summary Objectives? Post-traumatic hypopituitarism is well described amongst adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of pituitary dysfunction after head injury in childhood. Design? Retrospective exploratory study. Patients: 33 survivors of accidental head injury (27 boys). Mean (range) age at study was 13·4?years (5·4?21·7?years) and median (range) interval since injury 4·3?years (1·4?7·8?years). Functional outcome at study: 15 good recovery, 16 moderate disability, two severe disability. Measurements? Early morning urine osmolality and basal hormone evaluation were followed by the gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and insulin tolerance (n?=?25) or glucagon tests (if previous seizures, n?=?8). Subjects were not primed. Head injury details were extracted from patient records. Results? No subject had short stature (mean height SD score +0·50, range ?1·57 to +3·00). Suboptimal GH responses (<5??g/l) occurred in six peri-pubertal boys (one with slow growth on follow-up) and one postpubertal adolescent (peak GH 3·2??g/l). Median peak cortisol responses to insulin tolerance or glucagon tests were 538 and 562?nm. Nine of twenty-five and two of eight subjects had suboptimal responses, respectively, two with high basal cortisol levels. None required routine glucocorticoid replacement. In three, steroid cover was recommended for moderate/severe illness or injury. One boy was prolactin deficient. Other basal endocrine results and GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH were appropriate for age, sex and pubertal stage. Abnormal endocrine findings were unrelated to the severity or other characteristics of TBI or functional outcome. Conclusions? No clinically significant endocrinopathy was identified amongst survivors of accidental childhood TBI, although minor pituitary hormone abnormalities were observed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the frequency, types, and risk factors for acute perioperative adverse events (AEs) in dogs that had ventral slot decompression (VSD) for cervical intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Design Retrospective, case?control study. Animals Dogs (n?=?546) with cervical IVDD treated by VSD; 54 cases experiencing AE and 492 controls. Methods Historical, clinical, diagnostic, operative, and outcome data were collected. AE were graded using a Spine Adverse Events Severity (SAVES) system. Associations between the development of AE and hypothesized risk factors were analyzed using bi- and multi-variable analyses. Results AE were observed in 54 dogs (9.9%). Minor AE (SAVES Grade 1?2) occurred in 3.5% (19 dogs) and major (SAVES Grades 3?5) AE in 6.4% (35 dogs). Deterioration in neurologic status (n?=?13), persistent pain (12), and intraoperative hemorrhage (7) were common major AE. NSAID administration, surgeon experience, C7?T1 disc location, and intraoperative hypotension were significantly associated with AE in multivariate analyses. Improvement of AE occurred in 48/54 (88.9%) of cases, although reoperative neurosurgery was required in 48.5% (17/35) of dogs experiencing major AE. Dogs with major AE had significantly longer hospitalization and worse outcomes than dogs with minor AE or controls. No fatal AE occurred, although 0.7% (4/546) of dogs were euthanatized postoperatively. Conclusions AE occurred in 9.9% of dogs that had VSD, and were significantly associated with perioperative hypotension, C7?T1 disc extrusions, surgeon experience, and NSAID usage. Identification of a major postoperative AE is an indication for immediate diagnostic imaging studies, as 50% of dogs experiencing major AE required reoperation.

AB  - Aims and objectives This study seeks to identify the factors that shape the communication networks of men who face a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer, and how these factors relate to their disclosure about their changing health status. Background Men facing a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer are in a challenging situation; the support benefits of disclosing their changing health status to others in their communication networks is set against a backdrop of the potential stigma and uncertainty of the diagnosis. Design All men on a prostate biopsy waiting list were eligible for inclusion in an exploratory and interpretive study. Methods Semi-structured interviews with 40 men explored their network structures and disclosure of health information. Thematic analysis highlighted the factors which contributed to their network structures and their disclosure about their health status. Results Four network factors shaped men's perspectives about disclosing their health status: (1) tie strength, comprising both strong and weak ties; (2) knowledgeable others, with a focus on medical professionals in the family; (3) homophily, which included other individuals with a similar medical condition; and (4) geographical proximity, with a preference for face-to-face communication. Conclusion Communication networks influence men's disclosure of their health status and in particular weak ties with medical knowledge have an important role. Men who use the potential for support in their networks may experience improved psychosocial outcomes. Relevance to clinical practice Using these four network factors-tie strength, knowledgeable others, homophily or geographical proximity-to forecast men's willingness to disclose helps identify men who lack potential support and so are at risk of poor psychosocial health. Those with few strong ties or knowledgeable others in their networks may be in the at-risk cohort. The support provided in communication networks complements formal medical care from nurses and other health professionals, and encouraging patients to use their communication networks improves the psychosocial health of the men themselves, their partners and their families.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis To describe the acoustic characteristics of voice in individuals with motor speech disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Study Design Prospective study of 100 individuals with TBI based on consecutive referrals for motor speech evaluations. Methods Subjects were audio tape-recorded while producing sustained vowels and single word and sentence intelligibility tests. Laryngeal airway resistance was estimated, and voice quality was rated perceptually. Results None of the subjects evidenced vocal parameters within normal limits. The most frequently occurring abnormal parameter across subjects was amplitude perturbation, followed by voice turbulence index. Twenty-three percent of subjects evidenced deviation in all five parameters measured. The perceptual ratings of breathiness were significantly correlated with both the amplitude perturbation quotient and the noise-to-harmonics ratio. Conclusions Vocal quality deviation is common in motor speech disorders after TBI and may impact intelligibility.

AB  - Abstract Neurotrauma in the form of traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts more Americans annually than Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease combined, yet few researchers have used neuroproteomics to investigate the underlying complex molecular events that exacerbate TBI. Discussed in this review is the methodology needed to explore the neurotrauma proteome?from the types of samples used to the mass spectrometry identification and quantification techniques available. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in neurotrauma, as applied for immediate TBI biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of how the brain responds to trauma. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of neurotrauma on society. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 25:380?408, 2006

Findings are divided into those that require (i) intervention/referral, (ii) monitoring, and (iii) no further evaluation. Methods Three hundred consecutive CBCT scans conducted in the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Clinic from January 1 to August 31, 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Findings were categorized into airway, soft tissue calcifications, bone, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), endodontic, dental developmental, and pathological findings. Results A total of 272 scans revealed 881 incidental findings (3.2 findings/scan). The most prevalent was airway findings (35%) followed by soft tissue calcifications (20%), bone (17.5%), TMJ (15.4%), endodontic (11.3%), dental developmental (0.7%), and pathological (0.1%). 16.1% required intervention/referral, 15.6% required monitoring, and the remainder (68.3%) required neither. Conclusion This study underscores the need to thoroughly examine all CBCT volumes for clinically significant findings within and beyond the region of interest.

AB  - Summary Bilirubin, bile acids, ammonia, and lactate are four substances measured in the blood for equine laboratory diagnostic purposes. Serum bilirubin quantitation is usually performed as part of a complete serum biochemical profile, while serum bile acids, ammonia, and lactate are ordered as individual tests, generally based on clinical suspicion for conditions that cause increases in blood content. For each analyte, this chapter discusses basic physiologic regulation, recommendations for sample collection and submission, and diagnostic applications and interpretation. Unique aspects of equine physiology present diagnostic challenges for the equine clinician. The also chapter addresses these challenges. Blood ammonia is most commonly measured as an indicator of liver dysfunction, typically when the animal has neurologic signs for which hepatic encephalopathy is a differential diagnosis. Horses with histopathologically confirmed liver disease and neurologic signs frequently have elevated blood ammonia, although values may transiently drop into the normal range as clinical signs wax and wane.

AB  - Abstract Aim To explore the experiences, concerns and priorities of patients newly diagnosed with advanced malignant spinal cord compression and had significant problems with mobility at presentation. Background The consequences of malignant spinal cord compression can be devastating. Patients and their families are under pressure to adapt quickly to the significant functional impairment that occurs while coping with a diagnosis of advanced cancer. Much of the literature has focused on diagnosis and treatment and little is known about patients' experiences, priorities and concerns. Design A descriptive qualitative methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews and Framework Analysis techniques. Method A semi-structured interview schedule was developed to explore patient's descriptions of their experiences leading up to diagnosis and during their admission to the cancer centre along with their thoughts and feelings about their future with malignant spinal cord compression. The interviews took place after completion of radiotherapy before discharge home. Interviews were carried out between April 2009?March 2010. Findings Ten participants were interviewed. A dual narrative was identified in which participants talked about their concerns and emphasized their ability to cope and maintain a positive outlook. Patients' concerns and priorities were identified. Maintaining hope emerged as an important element of coping. Uncertainty was a source of hope. Conclusion The study provides insights into the experience of malignant spinal cord compression from symptom occurrence to diagnosis and beyond. The findings highlight the importance of early discharge planning and family involvement in meeting patients' priorities for care.

AB  - Abstract Ankle and foot injuries are the most common musculoskeletal injuries presenting to Australian EDs and are associated with a large societal and economic impact. The quality of ED care provided to patients with ankle and foot fractures or soft tissue injuries is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common ankle and foot injuries in the ED. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English language articles published in the last 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 1242 articles, of which 71 were included in the review (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?35 systematic reviews and n?=?14 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the ankle and foot in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. Following a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of the Ottawa ankle rules, ED clinicians should not only provide a diagnosis, but rate the severity of soft tissue injuries, or stability of fractures and dislocations, which are the pivotal decision points in guiding ED treatment, specialist referral and the follow-up plan.

AB  - Abstract Background The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited, progressive, multi-system lysosomal storage disorders. Musculoskeletal manifestations include nerve entrapment syndromes, most commonly carpal tunnel syndrome. Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) has also been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical course of MPS patients with suspected TTS and to conduct a literature review of TTS in MPS. Methods A review of the Medline and EMBASE databases was conducted in accordance with published guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute of Evidence Based Medicine with search strategy developed by a librarian trained in systematic reviews. A medical record review was undertaken for all patients managed in the multi-disciplinary MPS clinic in a tertiary referral paediatric centre, identifying patients with a suspected or established diagnosis of TTS. Data regarding the demographics, investigations, presentation, management, and clinical course were collected. Results The literature review failed to identify any published papers regarding TTS in MPS, with conference proceedings only identified. Within a cohort of 19 MPS patients, four patients with a suspected diagnosis of TTS were identified (MPS I: two patients, MPS VI: two patients). Three patients underwent surgical tarsal tunnel decompression, two with good result. One patient had overlapping symptoms with spinal stenosis and improvement in suspected tarsal tunnel symptoms following spinal decompression and fusion.

AB  - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV - TR (DSM) is currently employed by the Mental Health Services of the Netherlands as the basis of an integrated system of keeping track of clients and their progress through psychotherapy. Using a story from a narrative therapy practice to illustrate the current situation, concerns about the use of the DSM and Routine Outcome Monitoring as policing strategies will be discussed. Ethical and moral issues relating to the medicalisation of psychotherapy practice in the Netherlands under this regime are considered.

AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.
