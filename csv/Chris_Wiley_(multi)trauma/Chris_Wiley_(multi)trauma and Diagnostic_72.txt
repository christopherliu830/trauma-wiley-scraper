AB  - Summary As an acute intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation/embolus injures the spinal cord to some degree, and may present as a traumatic incident, approach to diagnosis and management will be presented as an injury. Patients with spinal cord and vertebral injury or disease can exhibit myriad pain levels, in addition to frustration and anxiety. This anxiety and frustration can compound the pain level and pain scoring of a patient and should be taken into consideration. Before offering anti-anxiolytic medications, consider pain level and provide appropriate analgesia. Anesthesia-induced relaxation of the muscles that may be tensed to protect the injured area and inattentive handling of the patient during positioning for intubation, movement on/off gurneys, positioning for imaging/procedures can worsen the patient's pain and may even exacerbate the injury. Pathology may be due to ischemia, inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tumours or extradural compression resulting in persistent or intermittent somatic or visceral neuropathic pain.

AB  - Objective To test the clinical and sonographic predictors of testicular torsion (TT) with the aim of reducing negative exploration rates. Patients and Methods We performed a prospective study of all boys treated for ?acute scrotum? at our institute between January 2001 and April 2012 and clinical findings were documented. If available, ultrasonography (US) was added to the diagnostic evaluation. A prediction of the diagnosis was based on clinical and sonographic features, and was followed by surgical exploration in all patients. Results A total of 104 patients were included in the 16-month period of the study. No single finding excluded TT. The clinical features (pain <24?h, nausea/vomiting, abnormal cremasteric reflex, high position of the testis) appeared predictive (100% sensitivity) and the clinical scoring system was proven to be reliable, reducing the negative exploration rate by >55%. Ultrasound predictors alone were not able to identify all boys with TT. Conclusions It is safe to refrain from routine surgical exploration in every child with acute scrotum if the clinical score is applied, which results in a marked reduction of negative explorations. A reliable diagnosis could not be obtained based on US alone. As scrotal US is unpleasant for the child, we propose to refrain from this if the clinical score is positive. Patients with a negative clinical score are suitable candidates for US to establish and secure diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a rare inherited connective tissue disorder due to heterozygous pathogenic COL3A1 variants. Arterial, intestinal, and/or uterine fragility is the disease hallmark and results in reduced life expectancy. The clinical diagnosis is not always straightforward and patients? selection for molecular confirmation depends on the characteristics of applied criteria, that is, the Villefranche criteria (in use until 2017) and their revision according to the new EDS nosology. Herein, we reassessed the clinical features of 50 molecularly proven vEDS patients, diagnosed according to the Villefranche nosology between 2000 and 2016, using the 2017 classification in order to explore its clinical application. Our findings indicate that the Villefranche criteria were particularly valuable for symptomatic patients, even if with a limited specificity. Our study also suggests that the revised vEDS criteria, although expected to be more specific, might have a poorer accuracy, principally in terms of sensitivity. Both sets of criteria are less effective in presymptomatic young patients, especially in the absence of a clear-cut family history. For these patients, the careful evaluation of the cutaneous, articular, and dysmorphic features and, above all, genetic testing remain crucial to set-up proper follow-up and surveillance before catastrophic vascular and intestinal events.

AB  - Summary The transition of care for adolescents and young adults from a pediatric, family-centered model to an adult, patient-centered model marks an important milestone in the lives of patients with chronic disorders managed from a young age. The timing and tempo of transition require special consideration to physical, psychological and social changes occurring during young adulthood. Poor glycemic control is a common finding among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and places these young adults at increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, knowledge that should alert clinicians to carefully manage diabetes during concurrent acute illnesses. Other chronic endocrine disorders, such as primary adrenal deficiencies, congenital or autoimmune hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and hypopituitarism may follow a similar model of care. In addition to continued management of existing defects, patients with disorders such as autoimmune polyglandular syndromes will require continued surveillance for manifestations of new endocrinopathies through adulthood. The onset of adrenal insufficiency with adrenoleukodystrophy, x-linked adrenal hypoplasia and triple A syndrome is variable and patients may present in adrenal crisis as the initial manifestation of adrenal insufficiency during an acute illness. Endocrine causes account for a high proportion of cases of secondary hypertension, including acute onset of hypertension due to hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytomas, ganglioneuromas, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperthyroidism. Head trauma is common in young adults associated with risky behaviors and motor vehicle accidents. Patients with traumatic brain injuries are at risk for developing anterior and posterior pituitary defects. This chapter discusses transitional care of diabetes and chronic and evolving endocrine disorders, as well as the management, including emergency care, of endocrine disorders that commonly present in young adulthood.

AB  - Objective The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005) is a cognitive screening tool that aims to differentiate healthy cognitive aging from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Several validation studies have been conducted on the MoCA, in a variety of clinical populations. Some studies have indicated that the originally suggested cutoff score of 26/30 leads to an inflated rate of false positives, particularly for those of older age and/or lower education. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MoCA for differentiating healthy cognitive aging from possible MCI. Methods Of the 304 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. These studies were assessed across a range of cutoff scores to determine the respective sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive accuracies, likelihood ratios for positive and negative results, classification accuracies, and Youden indices. Results Meta-analysis revealed a cutoff score of 23/30 yielded the best diagnostic accuracy across a range of parameters. Conclusions A MoCA cutoff score of 23, rather than the initially recommended score of 26, lowers the false positive rate and shows overall better diagnostic accuracy. We recommend the use of this cutoff score going forward. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract This is a population-based prospective study to identify the long-term outcome of children with inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI). Twenty-two survivors were identified and followed up. Only 2 of 22 had no developmental problems at follow-up, 20 of 22 children were having different developmental problems, among them 3 of 22 were severely handicapped. Psychological tests passed 17 of 22, 5 did not pass due to severe handicap (3 children) or were too young (2 patients). Epilepsy was found in 7 of 22, being intractable in 3 cases. Serious motor problems were identified in 5 of 22. Ophthalmologic problems were found in 4 of 22. The most important predictor of adverse outcome was young age at the time of the insult. Conclusion: the outcome of these potentially healthy children is poor. The key question is prevention. Health care professionals should be more concerned about these problems.

AB  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) has been used to study tumor response to treatment for many years. In this study, the modified full width at half-maximum (mFWHM), calculated from the wash-in slope histogram, is proposed as a parameter for the evaluation of changes in tumor heterogeneity which respond to radiotherapy. Twenty-five patients with brain tumors were evaluated and divided into the nonresponder group (n?=?11) and the responder group (n?=?14) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All selected tumors were evaluated by mFWHM ratios of post- to pre-therapy (the ratio was defined as the therapeutic mFWHM ratio, TMR). The changes in kurtosis of the histograms and the averaged Ktrans within a tumor were also calculated for comparison. The receiver operating characteristic analysis and Kaplan?Meier curves were used to examine the diagnosis ability. The TMR values were significantly higher in nonresponders than in responders (p?<?0.001). When compared with the other two parameters, the proposed method also demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity. When adopting the TMR for the estimation of prognosis after therapy, there was a significant difference between the population survival curves. In conclusion, the derived mFWHM reflects tumor heterogeneity, and the ability to depict patient survival probability from TMR corresponds well with that from RECIST. The results reveal that, in brain tumors, progression may be exhibited not only by tumor size, but also by tumor heterogeneity. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?49) with AAI. Methods Medical records (2000?2010) of dogs with AAI that had modified ventral stabilization were reviewed. Data on pre- and postoperative neurologic status, diagnostic findings, and outcomes were retrieved. Age, neurologic grade, duration of clinical abnormalities, dens abnormalities, and MRI findings were evaluated as the potential predictors for recovery. Age and cancellous bone grafting were evaluated as the potential predictors of postoperative pin breakage. Results Two dogs died during the perioperative period. In 47 dogs with follow up (median: 29 months; range, 4?110 months), 46 dogs (94%) improved neurologically after surgery, but 1 dog did not become ambulatory. There were no long term complications that resulted in serious neurologic deterioration or that required additional surgery. Partial pin breakage (1?5 pins) occurred in 16 dogs at 1?27.5 months (median, 5 months) without neurologic deterioration. Only the nonambulatory preoperative grade was significantly (P?=?.002) associated with non/incomplete recovery compared with ambulatory dogs. Conclusions Adequate stabilization of the vertebrae and improved neurologic status were achieved in most dogs with AAI using a modified ventral stabilization technique with positively threaded profile pins and polymethylmethacrylate.

AB  - Abstract Background Prevalence of emotional, behavioral, and psychiatric outcomes in child and adolescent survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on a chemotherapy-only protocol were not well defined. Methods Self- and parent-reported emotional and behavioral symptoms were assessed for 161 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (51.0% female; mean [SD] age 12.1[2.6] years; 7.5[1.6] years post-diagnosis). Age- and sex-adjusted scores were calculated for standardized measures and compared with 90th percentile of norms. Frequencies of survivor psychiatric disorders from structured diagnostic interviews with parents were compared with the general population. Parent emotional distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed. Associations between child symptoms/disorders and parent distress were examined with log-binomial models, adjusting for highest parent education. Results Compared with population expectations (10%), more survivors self-reported symptoms of inattention (27.9; 95% CI, 21.0%-35.7%), hyperactivity/impulsivity (26.0%; CI, 19.2%-33.6%), and oppositional-defiant behavior (20.1%; CI, 14.1%-27.3%). Parents reported survivors with more symptoms of inattention (23.6%; CI, 17.2%-31.0%), higher frequencies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (10.3% vs 2%) and oppositional defiant disorder (16.0% vs 9.5%), but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (7.1% vs 7.8%) or generalized anxiety disorder (3.2% vs 4.1%), compared with national norms. Parent-report of child anxiety disorders was associated with parent self-reported emotional distress but not survivor self-report of anxiety. Conclusion A significant minority of survivors have long-term psychiatric morbidity, multi-informant assessment is important to understand these symptom profiles and to inform selection of appropriate interventions. Interventions targeting inattention and oppositional behavior in children and emotional distress in parents are warranted in families with survivors who display behavioral problems.

Numerous recent efforts to address this growing concern have focused on the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS). In the current study, we explored the relationships among reexperiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and the three components of the IPTS in a sample of deployed military personnel examined for traumatic brain injury. Results indicated that reexperiencing symptoms were directly related to the acquired capability for suicide, but their relationships to perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were statistically explained by general mental health distress. Results indicate that mental rehearsal of painful and provocative experiences may have an impact on suicide risk. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 67:1?10, 2011.
