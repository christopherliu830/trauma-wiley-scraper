AB  - Abstract Saturation transfer in cross-linked copolymer gels and excised intact and perforating trauma-induced cataract mouse lenses (4- or 8-week-old) were studied using intermolecular cross-relaxation rates (1/TIS(H2O); 1/TIS), monitored with f2-irradiation at ?8.79, ?4.00, and 7.13?ppm (?H2/2π???69?Hz). [1] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs dry weight [W (%)] profiles for hydrophilic copolymer gels were far steeper than those for hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the participation of an amount of bound water and a number of copolymer hydroxyl groups in the saturation transfer process. In contrast, the 1/TIS(?8.79?ppm) vs W (%) profiles exhibited little difference between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the major participation of molecular rigidity, i.e. W (%) in the saturation transfer process. [2] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) values for cataractous mouse lenses were larger than those for intact lenses, indicating the formation of large, immobile lens protein associates or aggregates containing a sufficient amount of bound water for the saturation transfer. [3] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs W (%) profiles for the hydrophilic copolymer gels exhibited similar characteristics to the intact and cataractous mouse lenses with regard to the saturation transfer process.

Data Sources Selected research and clinical articles in professional journals and online websites, peer review, educational technical bulletin from professional organization and the authors? professional clinical experiences. Conclusions Vulvar LS can manifest with varied symptoms that may mimic other common vulvar disorders such as infections. Careful assessment of the vulva and biopsy of any suspicious skin changes are needed for diagnosis and management of vulvar LS. Treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids may alleviate uncomfortable symptoms and reduce physical changes. Follow-up management is essential to check for progressing problems such as introital stenosis and to assess for skin changes that may indicate vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Implications for Practice Accurate diagnosis and successful management of vulvar LS requires thorough assessment of the genitalia, knowledge of the disorder and appropriate treatment and follow-up management.

AB  - Summary The majority of esthetic emergencies involve fracture of the clinical crown. Traumatic conditions such as avulsion, bony fracture, extrusive and lateral luxation, and root fracture are considered to be acute and demand immediate treatment. Subacute conditions, including intrusion, subluxation, pulpal concussion, and crown fracture with pulp exposure, necessitate treatment within 24?h. In most cases, the emergency-bonded composite restoration will be the definitive restorative treatment. In the case of an esthetic emergency shortly before a social engagement, a dislodged crown or fixed dental prosthesis can be temporarily retained through the application of a little denture adhesive. Although replacement of the prosthesis may ultimately be recommended, patients may need an immediate interim repair. The responsibility of the dentist is to facilitate the long-term preservation of the natural dentition, the supporting periodontium and bone, and the surrounding soft gingival tissues.

AB  - Summary Musculoskeletal imaging has advanced leaps and bounds from the time Roentgen utilized X-rays to obtain a plain radiograph in 1895. This chapter outlines the modalities commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging, including plain radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound (US). It discusses the applications of the above modalities in the diagnosis and management of traumatic injuries, infection, arthritis, and tumors. Plain radiography is a two-dimensional depiction of three-dimensional structures and as such, evaluation of complex areas such as the foot, pelvis, and spine can be suboptimal. CT is also useful for assessment of nontraumatic pathologies like arthritis. MRI is one of the more commonly used imaging modalities in musculoskeletal imaging. US is also useful in dynamic assessment of tendons, ligaments, and joints. Imaging plays a vital role in assessment of musculoskeletal trauma. Musculoskeletal tumors comprise benign and malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To identify clinical findings and predisposing conditions associated with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in ambulatory patients being evaluated for PE. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted. A standardized multicomponent data collection form was administered to ambulatory subjects being evaluated for PE. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed or excluded using a combination of scintillation lung scanning, lower-extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography, and selective use of pulmonary angiography. Results: Data collection was completed for 170 subjects, with 26 (15%) cases of PE. Subjects with PE were significantly older (56 vs 41 years, 99% CI for difference of 15 years [6 to 25 years]), were more likely to report unexplained dyspnea (92% vs 69%. 99% CI for difference of 23% [7% to 40%]), and waited longer after symptom onset to seek medical evaluation (73 vs 36 hours, 99% CI for difference of 37 hours [I1 to 63 hours]). No difference was found for multiple variables commonly associated with PE. Assignment to risk categories was of limited diagnostic utility. For example, low-risk assignment yielded 85% sensitivity, 20% specificity; high-risk assignment: 31% sensitivity, 85% specificity, with diagnostic accuracy below 80% in both categories. Conclusions: Among outpatients selected for evaluation for PE, further risk stratification demonstrated poor diagnostic utility. Clinical features alone cannot be used to differentiate presence or absence of PE in at-risk ambulatory patients. Key words: pulmonary embolism; diagnosis; outpatient; risk; clinical features.

AB  - Abstract:? Traumatic experiences of violence like those that were brought about by the communist regime of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) are still present as if they happened yesterday, causing severe disadvantages in everyday life even after all those years. Consequently, in cases of extreme traumatization induced by political imprisonment, persecution and applied psychological methods of disintegration, regressive processes take place which corrode the ego. The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the failure of empathic connection at the time of the trauma, is the strongest characteristic of severe traumatization. As a result of this destruction for the traumatized there is an inability to keep upright an inner empathic, emotional connection. As we try to grasp, from a Jungian point of view, the psychodynamics of severe traumatization, we can speak of a powerful pathogenous complex, which I call the ?Prometheus-complex?. Gustav Bovensiepen speaks of this complex as a sub-network, a limited fragment of the matrix of all internalized experiences, consisting of internal working models, feelings and patterns of anticipation which interact mutually. The human being, captured in such isolation and paralysis of the mind, can find himself ?in the therapist? on a mental level.

AB  - Objectives This study investigated the prevalence of, and multi-dimensional factors associated with, unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with regular male sexual partners (?regular partners?) and nonregular male sexual partners (?nonregular partners?) among newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Chengdu, China. Methods A total of 225 newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM were interviewed using a combined interviewer?computer-assisted method in Chengdu, China. Results The prevalence of UAI with regular and nonregular partners since diagnosis was 27.7% and 33.8% among participants reporting having sex with regular and nonregular partners (n = 159 and 133), respectively. Adjusted analysis showed that: (1) cognitive variables based on the Health Belief Model (perceived susceptibility to HIV transmission and perceived severity of the consequences of HIV transmission, perceived barriers and perceived self-efficacy related to consistent condom use), (2) emotion-related variables (worry about transmitting HIV to others), (3) psychological factors (post-traumatic growth) and (4) socio-structural factors (perceived partners? responsibility for condom use) were significantly associated with UAI with regular and/or nonregular partners. Conclusions Interventions are warranted, and should be designed with consideration of multi-dimensional factors and be partner type-specific.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case of 7 year-old female entire domestic short-haired cat with hair loss. It provides practical information in an easy-to-reference, well-illustrated format, so that students and practicing veterinarians can develop their clinical dermatology skills and test their knowledge. Flea bite hypersensitivity is the most likely diagnosis. Other causes of alopecia due to excessive grooming, apart from Demodex gatoi, cannot be ruled out at this stage. Performing a robust food trial needs commitment and perseverance from an owner, and atopic dermatitis is a diagnosis made by exclusion. A pragmatic approach is to assess the response to robust flea control before undertaking a food trial. The prognosis is good, if fleas can be effectively controlled on an ongoing basis. The chapter offers questions with detailed answers to enhance knowledge of differential diagnoses, diagnostic tools, and treatment options.

AB  - Objectives To assess the value of first trimester scanning for the diagnosis of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Population/methods An unselected group of 7447 pregnant women who had a first trimester scan in our unit. In all the cases an anatomical survey was performed and the nuchal translucency was measured. Four thousand and 84 women also had second trimester biochemical screening. We assessed the performance of first trimester scanning in the detection of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Results The incidence of anomalous fetuses was 1.4%, including 43 chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate for structural abnormalities was 59% (37/63). Seventy-eight percent of chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed at 11?14?weeks either because of a nuchal translucency measurement above the 99th centile or due to the presence of structural abnormalities. Second trimester biochemical screening detected half of the fetuses with trisomy 21 which were missed by first trimester screening, increasing the sensitivity to 90.5% (19/21; 95%C.I. 69.6% to 98.8%). However, the positive predictive value of the biochemical test was very low (0.5%). Conclusion First trimester NT measurement is an effective screening test for the prenatal detection of fetuses with structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the measurement of biochemical markers in the second trimester can detect additional affected fetuses this may be out-weighted by the delay in diagnosis, the extra visits and cost so that the right time for biochemical screening still needs to be determined. Second trimester anomaly scanning should continue to be an essential part of a prenatal screening programme.

AB  - Abstract Objective To characterise patients presenting to EDs for a bicycle-related injury, identify contributing factors to the injuries and describe the data gaps. Methods A retrospective study of bicycle-related injury presentations over the 5 year period 2010?2014 to two major metropolitan EDs. Data collected from the emergency presentation database consisted of patient demographics, presenting complaint, discharge diagnosis and details about the circumstances and mechanism of the accident. Results Bicycle injuries (n =?4144) increased from 20.0 to 25.2 per 1000 injury presentations over 5 years. Patients were 80% male across all age groups and 35% of presentations occurred at the weekend. Fractures accounted for one-third (34%) of all injuries, while injuries to the upper extremities and head resulted in 36% and 19% of cases, respectively. Admission rate was 17%. The number of falls exceeded collisions (1611 vs 937), and in the 13.3% of the fall cases where documentation was present for which how the fall occurred, over half were attributed to bike handling errors. Information related to type of bicycle, accident location, type of activity, protective clothing worn (including helmets) and visibility aids was not recorded for over 95% of the cases. Conclusion Bicycle injuries carry a considerable burden to the ED and the incidence of presentations appears to be rising. The current triage data, designed to provide a rapid assessment for medical urgency, are limited to describing broad demographics, trends and causes.

Materials and Methods A total of 215 normal subjects were scanned twice, at an interval of approximately 1 year, using two 3.0 Tesla (T) scanners of the exact same model. Both scanners were simultaneously upgraded during the study period. The subjects were divided into four groups according to the combination of scanners used at the two time points. Using VBM, we evaluated longitudinal changes in regional gray matter volume in each group and the effects of scanner upgrade on longitudinal changes. Results The use of different scanners at two time points significantly influenced longitudinal changes in regional gray matter volume. Regional gray matter volumes were relatively stable within the same scanner, but significantly different between the two scanners. Scanner upgrade had effects comparable to those of using different scanners at the two time points. Conclusion The results of our study indicate that, even with scanners of the exact same model, the use of different scanners at different time points significantly influences longitudinal morphometric results, and that scanner upgrade has effects comparable to those of using different scanners at different time points.

AB  - Summary Eruption consists of a series of events from initiation of coronal formation and the beginning of root formation until each tooth emerges into the mouth in a specific position. Certain diseases and syndromes can affect tooth eruption, predominantly delayed eruption. Eruption of each primary and permanent tooth is based on an exact and predetermined genetic plan. In the permanent dentition, local causes such as premature loss of the primary predecessor tooth or localized hemangiomata may lead to early eruption. Wrong positioning of the tooth bud may result in failure of eruption into the oral cavity. The presence of supernumerary teeth is a common cause of localized delayed eruption of permanent successors. Fibrotic frenula also can divert the teeth from their normal path of eruption. A resorption/apposition imbalance leads to loss of the periodontal ligament and direct bone cementum union, or ?ankyloses.? Normal occlusion is dependent on the normal eruption of teeth.

AB  - Diffuse cerebellar meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to haematogenous dissemination from an anaplastic solid mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in an old German shepherd dog suffering from seizures and rapidly progressing to stupor. A single computed tomography cerebellar scan identified an unusual homogeneous density area that was considered to be associated with a vascular disorder, in the absence of space-occupying lesions. At necropsy, nodular masses were observed in the mammary gland, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were affected by diffuse blood effusion. Histology showed a solid mammary tumour, characterised by anaplastic cells with a cytoplasmic keratin-positive and vimentin-negative immunoreaction. The tumour had spread to the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were diffusely infiltrated by the cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells. Even though computed tomography scan gave no evidence of meningeal carcinomatosis, it was considered that a cerebellar vascular disorder might be present. This was subsequently confirmed by neuropathological investigation and seen to be associated with a cerebellar leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB  - Although the general surgeon who takes emergency call may be confronted with a patient who has sustained a blunt liver injury, the decrease in road trauma and work-place accidents has meant that this will be an infrequent occurrence. Minimal exposure will, of necessity, extrapolate to difficulty in coping with a catastrophic event which comes unheralded, at an inconvenient time and usually when there is less than ideal support. During the past 15 years, there has been an evolution in the treatment of liver injuries which is exemplified by a non-operative approach in selected patients and more conservative procedures in those who require operative intervention. At present, ?damage control? is in vogue; do the least possible to control life-threatening injuries and come back another day. This is a cogent and admirable philosophy, provided that the pendulum does not swing too far and that a planned course of action is in place. This paper reviews the present status of managing blunt liver injuries, with an emphasis on the general surgeon who has little cause to be involved with surgery of the liver.
