AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Variability in clinical presentation among patients with neck pain disorders, in relation to symptom severity and the effect of the disorder on their physical and psychological function, has not been well documented. The present study examined the variability in pain intensity, physical and emotional or cognitive function in patients with non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain, and the extent to which these factors are associated at the time of referral for physiotherapy treatment. Method The study utilized a survey of patients referred for physiotherapy treatment for non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain. Seventy-two patients (mean age 58 years; SD 15.5 years) with a symptom duration ranging from four weeks to 30 years were recruited. Each completed measures of pain intensity using a visual analogue scale, and neck-pain related disability by use of the ?Neck Pain and Disability? scale (NPAD). Frequency distributions were calculated to examine variability in pain intensity, the total NPAD score and the effect of the disorder on different aspects of physical and emotional or cognitive function. Relationships between pain intensity, and physical and psychological function, were also examined. Results Pain intensity was normally distributed with a mean score of 6.3 cm (SD 2.5 cm). NPAD scores were normally distributed (mean 54.8%; SD 18%). Similar variability was noted in each of the NPAD factor scores for neck function, pain intensity, emotional or cognitive function and activities of daily living. Pain intensity was significantly (p<0.01) correlated with the total NPAD score (r = 0.55) and with each of the four effects of neck pain represented in the NPAD sub-domains (r = 0.42?0.63). Symptom duration was not significantly correlated with pain intensity, or with the severity of disability, as reflected in the total NPAD score. Conclusions The results highlight the variability between patients with neck pain, in relation to pain intensity and the effect of the disorder on physical and psychological function. Identifying the specific effects of the neck pain disorder in individual cases is important when defining the treatment objectives and selecting measures of treatment response.

AB  - ABSTRACT Based on data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,149), the current article provides the first large-sample investigation of associations between different forms of infant attachment insecurity and dissociative symptomatology from childhood through midadolescence as measured by scales based on the mother, teacher, and youth self-report versions of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments. Findings did not replicate the previously reported and highly cited evidence that infant attachment disorganization is associated with dissociative symptomatology. In contrast, correlations of small magnitude were observed between infant avoidance and dissociative symptomatology, as assessed by teachers and mothers (but not self-report). Results were not moderated by contextual risk. Limitations of the study included the absence of measures of maltreatment and interpersonal trauma, leaving open the possibility that infant attachment disorganization is a diathesis for later dissociation in the context of severe and/or chronic trauma. Nevertheless, the present results strongly indicate the need for additional research exploring the possible role of environmental factors in the development of dissociative symptomatology.

AB  - Abstract:? First described in the 1500s, scurvy is infrequently seen in industrialized countries today, although vulnerable patient groups remain. A 15-yr-old girl underwent liver transplantation at age 26?months for a primary diagnosis of biliary hypoplasia, and subsequently developed late allograft failure and progressive renal insufficiency culminating in listing for combined liver retransplantation and kidney transplantation at age 13?yr. She required regular hemodialysis treatment for 12?months prior to deceased donor organ availability, with a complicated clinical course including recurrent septic episodes and severe cachexia. Ten months after initiation of hemodialysis, she presented with severe bone pain, purpura, ecchymoses, gingival hyperplasia, mucosal bleeding, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Serial serum ascorbic acid levels were found to be extremely low (<10??mol/L) despite routine supplementation both in her dialysate and via regular oral supplementation. Histopathology from skin biopsy revealed purpura, hyper- and parakeratosis, and follicular plugging. She had ECG and 2D echocardiogram disturbances, as well as osteopenia and sclerosis of the extremities on radiological evaluations. Therapy with high-dose ascorbic acid (1?g/day orally) led to complete resolution of skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of awareness and recognition of this historic diagnosis, and particularly in children with end-stage organ disease with severely compromised nutrition.

AB  - Mortality associated with cancer remains high, but more people are surviving cancer. Some people experience long-term problems associated with cancer and its treatment, and there is a need to know how to support them. This systematic literature review explores primary research for psychosocial implications of long-term survival (≥5 years) following a cancer diagnosis and interventions designed to address psychosocial problems in the long term. A systematic search of BIDS, BNI, Cancer.gov, CINAHL, Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Science was conducted to identify research publications from 1960 to 2006. Papers were selected on the basis of pre-defined criteria and rated by three independent coders. Forty-three studies met the eligibility criteria. These indicated that most people experience few problems five or more years after their diagnosis of cancer. However, 20?30% of survivors consistently reported problems associated with cancer and its treatment including physical problems, poorer quality of life, psychological distress, sexual problems, problems with social relationships and financial concerns. Not all cancer types are represented in this review. Only two intervention studies met the eligibility criteria. Research is needed to establish appropriate interventions to support those experiencing problems in the long term to enhance well-being.

AB  - Summary Disease prevention and control involves the three interrelated processes of bioexclusion, surveillance, and biocontainment. Disease challenge management must be considered to be an integral part of any poultry business risk management program. It involves the development and implementation of a stringent biosecurity plan which comprises a hierarchy of components directed at preventing or limiting the risk and consequence of disease. Disease control strategies are designed to reduce the consequence of disease challenge by limiting challenge (bioexclusion), enhancing bird resistance (immunization), and preventing spread (quarantine). Preventing or reducing disease challenge requires a systematic approach to eliminating or decreasing the number of disease-causing organisms within the bird's environment. This is achieved through the implementation of cost-effective procedures to prevent pathogen movement across physical or imaginary barriers demarcating protection zones around the bird. Successfully treating a bacterial infection without any adverse effects involves many important factors when deciding to treat and the choice of antimicrobials.

AB  - Abstract The National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study (NVVLS) is the second assessment of a representative cohort of US veterans who served during the Vietnam War era, either in Vietnam or elsewhere. The cohort was initially surveyed in the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS) from 1984 to 1988 to assess the prevalence, incidence, and effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other post-war problems. The NVVLS sought to re-interview the cohort to assess the long-term course of PTSD. NVVLS data collection began July 3, 2012 and ended May 17, 2013, comprising three components: a mailed health questionnaire, a telephone health survey interview, and, for a probability sample of theater Veterans, a clinical diagnostic telephone interview administered by licensed psychologists. Excluding decedents, 78.8% completed the questionnaire and/or telephone survey, and 55.0% of selected living veterans participated in the clinical interview. This report provides a description of the NVVLS design and methods. Together, the NVVRS and NVVLS constitute a nationally representative longitudinal study of Vietnam veterans, and extend the NVVRS as a critical resource for scientific and policy analyses for Vietnam veterans, with policy relevance for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Acute suppurative thyroiditis and recurrent abscess formation due to third and fourth branchial anomalies typically present in children. However, thyroid abscesses in branchial anomalies may occur in adulthood as well. Failure to recognize and delayed drainage of a neck abscess may lead to a fulminant life-threatening outcome. Methods This is a retrospective case series. The study group comprised all patients presenting over a 12-month period from January to December 2012 with thyroid abscesses and a branchial cleft anomaly in two centres, one adult and the other paediatric. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, imaging, surgical management, definitive histology and outcomes were documented. Results Five patients were identified with a history of thyroid abscesses. Only one was a child (aged 9 years) with the other four being adults (aged 20, 34, 37 and 41 years). All patients had third or fourth left branchial cleft anomalies, presenting as suppurative thyroiditis with a left-sided thyroid abscess. Management options ranged from abscess drainage on initial presentation, primary thyroid lobectomy or delayed thyroid lobectomy following abscess drainage. Conclusion Acute suppurative thyroidits and thyroid abscesses is not just a paediatric diagnosis but may present at any age. In both children and adults, a thyroid abscess almost always arises from branchial cleft anomalies.

AB  - We reviewed the literature for disease-specific markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and evaluated their diagnostic and prognostic relevance in neurological diseases. High tau protein in combination with low amyloid ? levels has a high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (90%) for Alzheimer?s disease (AD) against normal aging and can predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD. The detection of 14-3-3 has a high sensitivity (80?90%) and specificity (90%) for the diagnosis of CJD. Low or undetectable CSF hypocretin-1 (orexin-1) levels constitute a diagnostic biomarker for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Detection of beta-2-transferrin indicates CSF contamination in oto- and rhinorrhoe with a sensitivity of >79% at a specificity of 95% similar to the beta-trace protein (sensitivity >90%, specificity 100%). However, beta-trace protein is faster and cheaper to perform. Possible future biomarkers are: elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor are relatively sensitive (51?100%) and specific (73?100%) for leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors and are associated with a poor prognosis in this condition. Elevated CSF neurofilament (Nf) levels probably reflect acute neuronal degeneration. The prognostic value of CSF Nf levels is highest in acute conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute optic neuritis and neuromyelitis optica.

AB  - Abstract The last in a series of four papers describing how individuals' minds and bodies are affected by severe stress. The purpose is to develop a deeper understanding of what happens to stressed individuals who come together to form stressed organizations and the impact of this stress on organizational leaders. The series also explores the parallel process that occurs when traumatized individuals and stressed organizations come together to form stressed societies. Part I focused on the basic human stress response. Part II explored the more extended impact of severe, chronic, and repetitive exposure to stress on the functioning of the emotional system and the ways in which human beings tend to adapt to adversity and thus come to normalize highly abnormal behavior. The focus of Part III was on the impact of chronic stress on memory, the ability to put words to feelings and the tendency to repeat the past automatically. Part IV reviews the way attachment schemas are disrupted by trauma and how the accumulative experience of stress leads to downward spirals of anxiety and, finally, alienation if the progress of this deterioration is not stopped.

AB  - Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been used in various problem-solving areas such as financial forecasting, credit analysis and medical diagnosis. However, conventional CBR has the limitation that it has no criterion for choosing the nearest cases based on the probabilistic similarity of cases. It uses a fixed number of neighbors without considering an optimal number for each target case, so it does not guarantee optimal similar neighbors for various target cases. This leads to the weakness of lowering predictability due to deviation from desired similar neighbors. In this paper we suggest a new case extraction technique called statistical case-based reasoning. The main idea involves a dynamic adaptation of the optimal number of neighbors by considering the distribution of distances between potential similar neighbors for each target case. In order to do this, our technique finds the optimal distance threshold and selects similar neighbors satisfying the distance threshold criterion. We apply this new method to five real-life medical data sets and compare the results with those of the statistical method, logistic regression; we also compare the results with the learning methods C5.0, CART, neural networks and conventional CBR. The results of this paper show that the proposed technique outperforms those of many other methods, it overcomes the limitation of conventional CBR, and it provides improved classification accuracy.

AB  - Accessible summary What is known on the subject: The physical and psychological trauma that can occur as a result of physical restraint is increasingly highlighted in the media and literature across the globe. Despite this, the use of physical restraint continues without a strong evdience base for its value or efficacy. What this paper adds to existing knowledge: A number of common defences for the use of physical restraint are outlined and considered in light of existing research in this area. The potential for adopting restrictive intervention minimization programmes of work is highlighted as a way forward. What are the implications for practice: The implementation of approaches to prevent and reduce physical restraint is required. A combination of factors including the use of advance planning tools, recognition of potential injury and death, and the importance of trauma informed care is necessary. Patients can be severely traumatized by the use of restraint, and there is an increasing drive to examine, reflect upon, and to reduce the use and impact of these. Abstract Aggression is reported to be prevalent in psychiatric inpatient care and its frequency towards healthcare professionals is well documented. While aggression may not be entirely avoidable, its incidence can be reduced through prevention and the minimization of restrictive practices such as physical restraint. This paper aims to explore three common ?defences? to account for the use of physical restraint; to challenge each defence with regard to the evidence base; and to identify how services are responding to the challenge of reducing the use of restrictive interventions. Following a number of investigations to highlight serious problems with the use of physical restraint, it seems timely to examine its efficacy in light of the evidence base. A combination of interventions to minimize the use of restraint including advance planning tools, and recognition of potential trauma is necessary at an organizational and individual level. Patients can be traumatized by the use of restrictive practices and there is a growing momentum to promote models that incorporate trauma informed care (TIC) and person centredness.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The present pilot study aimed to assess the practicality, safety and accuracy of performing CT coronary angiography (CT-CA) in the evaluation of acute chest pain of patients with low thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk scores. Methods:? The present prospective observational study was undertaken in a university teaching hospital between November 2004 and December 2005. Participants were a convenience sample of patients admitted to hospital for investigation of chest pain with TIMI risk scores <3. Consenting patients underwent CT-CA within 48?h of presentation. Outcomes of interest were practicality (proportion of diagnostic quality scans obtained and preparation time for CT-CA), rate of serious adverse events, and accuracy at the patient level using selective coronary angiography as the reference standard. Results:? Thirty-four patients were recruited. Diagnostic quality scans were obtained in 26/34 or 76% of patients (four failed CT-CA and four non-diagnostic scans). The median CT preparation time was 1.9?h (range 0.17?4.0). No serious adverse events were found. Fourteen of those 26 patients with diagnostic CT-CA subsequently had selective coronary angiography, of which nine were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of CT-CA in identifying patients with significant coronary artery disease were 9/9 (100%; 95% confidence interval 72?100%) and 4/5 (80%; 95% confidence interval 28?100%), respectively. Conclusions:? The majority of acute chest pain patients with low TIMI risk scores were successfully scanned with a 16-slice CT to produce CT-CA studies with good diagnostic quality and accuracy. No major adverse events were found. The place of CT-CA in diagnostic workup for chest pain remains to be defined.

AB  - Objective: To describe clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features in dogs with compressive cervical myelopathy due to acute suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion. Design: Retrospective case series. Animals: Ten dogs with compressive cervical myelopathy caused by acute suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion. Materials and Methods: Medical records and magnetic resonance images of dogs evaluated from 2005 through 2010 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were clinical signs compatible with cervical myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine performed within 48 hours after onset, magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with compressive suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion, complete medical records and follow-up information. Results: Six dogs were presented with acute onset tetraplegia and four dogs with acute onset of nonambulatory tetraparesis. Compromised respiratory function was present in three dogs. Compressive suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion was found on magnetic resonance imaging at the C4-C5 (n=6), C3-C4 (n=3) and C5-C6 (n=1) intervertebral disc spaces. Seven dogs underwent surgical treatment and three dogs were treated conservatively. All dogs except one regained ambulatory status within two weeks after the onset, and had a favourable outcome. Clinical Significance: Compressive myelopathy caused by acute suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion has not been reported previously and, even though neurological deficits can be severe on presentation, outcome is favourable.

AB  - Background:? A growing number of studies indicate that low income, African American men and women living in urban environments are at high risk for trauma exposure, which may have intergenerational effects. The current study employed psychophysiological methods to describe biomarkers of anxiety in children of traumatized mothers. Methods:? Study participants were recruited from a highly traumatized urban population, comprising mother?child pairs (n?=?36) that included school-age children. Mothers were assessed for childhood abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, as well as symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The children were measured for dark-enhanced startle responses and heart-rate variability. Results:? Dark-enhanced startle was found to be higher in children whose mothers had high levels of childhood physical abuse, as compared to children whose mothers had low levels of physical abuse. During the habituation phase of the startle experiment, children whose mothers had high levels of childhood emotional abuse had higher sympathetic system activation compared to children of mothers with low emotional abuse. These effects remained significant after accounting for maternal symptoms of PTSD and depression, as well as for the child?s trauma exposure. Conclusion:? These results demonstrate that children of mothers who have history of childhood physical and emotional abuse have higher dark-enhanced startle as well as greater sympathetic nervous system activation than children of mothers who do not report a history of childhood physical and emotional abuse, and emphasize the utility of physiological measures as pervasive biomarkers of psychopathology that can easily be measured in children.

AB  - Abstract Objectives A diagnosis of cancer during the teenage years arrives at an important stage of development, where issues of normality, identity and independence are crucial. Education provides opportunity for peer contact, achievement and development for teenagers. This systematic review examined the impact of a diagnosis of cancer on the educational engagement and school life of teenagers. Method Five electronic databases were searched, returning a total of 3209 articles. Inclusion criteria were broad to allow for the range of literature within this area. Following screening, 22 articles (inclusive of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies) were retained and subjected to independent review and quality assessment. Results Key areas involved in the impact of a cancer diagnosis on teenagers' educational engagement include school attendance, reintegration, peer relationships and long-term effects on education and employment. Conclusion School absences are a concern for teenagers, but do not necessarily lead to a reduction in educational and vocational attainment. It is important to involve health care and education professionals, as well as parents and teenagers themselves, in school reintegration if it is to be successful. Peer groups and body image are two areas that could mediate education engagement for teenagers. Further research needs to be undertaken to determine the overall impact of successfully maintaining education engagement specifically for teenagers, the role that peer groups play in this process and how education engagement contributes to the overall coping and well-being of teenage cancer patients.

AB  - Summary While the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying portosystemic encephalopathy may not be fully understood, management strategies are relatively well established. These include the identification and elimination of precipitating factors, in association with, or followed by, specific measures designed to reduce arterial ammonia levels. In many patients, liver transplantation may offer the only chance of effective management of this challenging clinical problem.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the clinical research priorities of Fellows of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) in order to inform the strategic research agenda specific to multicentre clinical research. Methods An anonymous survey of all ACEM Fellows (FACEMs) listed on the ACEM researcher database was conducted between January and March 2013. Results Of 108 FACEMs invited to participate, 54 (50%) responded. Over half of respondents (61%) had a higher research degree but only a minority (24%) had funded research positions. The top research categories identified as priorities were resuscitation, trauma, cardiology, ED ultrasound, acute behavioural disturbance and geriatrics. The most common specific sub-categories included anterior chest pain, fluid resuscitation in trauma, and drug therapy for both atrial fibrillation and acute behavioural disturbance. Several specific research questions related to chest pain, resuscitation/sepsis, stroke, paediatrics and pulmonary embolus. Conclusion The findings provide guidance and support for research areas amenable to collaborative multicentre clinical research within emergency medicine. Discussion rounds are planned to translate these perceived research priorities to actual priorities.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the psychological effects of violence and disaster in both adults and children, although much remains to be understood. Siblings of children who have undergone such experiences have been little studied. Such siblings may be bereaved or may experience changes in family circumstances, or may develop psychological sequelae. They may be affected by legal procedures and media coverage. This new understanding of the needs of siblings may have implications for service development, including health and education.

AB  - Abstract.? Bounameaux H (Division of Angiology and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland). Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions (Review). J Intern Med 2010; 268: 218?231. Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2?3. This initial period of 3?months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit?risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.
