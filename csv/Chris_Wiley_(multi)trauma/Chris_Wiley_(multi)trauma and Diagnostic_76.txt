AB  - Summary The past few decades have seen major advances in multidisciplinary obstetric care and management of gynecological conditions in women with bleeding disorders. Awareness of the impact of bleeding disorders has improved among the obstetric and gynecological community. Undiagnosed bleeding disorders can be the underlying cause for a significant proportion of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. They may also be the cause or a contributory factor for other gynecological problems, such as dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, and endometriosis. Hemostatic assessment should be considered in women referred for menstrual abnormalities if they have a positive bleeding history as quantified by bleeding assessment tools. The reproductive choices and options for prenatal diagnosis are also expanding for families with hemophilia with a drive toward achieving a non-invasive approach. Current non-invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques are limited to identification of fetal gender. Research is ongoing to overcome the specific diagnostic challenges of identifying hemophilia mutations, utilizing free fetal DNA circulating in maternal plasma. The management of obstetric hemorrhage has recently evolved to include a greater focus on the identification of and early treatment for coagulation disorders. Deficiencies in certain hemostatic variables are associated with progression to more severe bleeding; therefore, specific interventions have been proposed to target this. Evidence is still lacking to support such strategy, and future research is required to assess the efficacy and the safety of these hemostatic interventions in women with persistent PPH.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND There appears to be a growing movement in favor of core needle biopsy (CNB) over fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in detecting breast carcinoma in women. The authors compared the sensitivity and specificity of these two methods in patients who presented to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for evaluation of a palpable breast mass. METHODS One hundred and twenty-four women (mean age, 51 years; range, 28-86 years) with a clinically suspicious palpable mass (mean size, 4.4 cm; range, 1-12 cm) underwent concurrent FNA and CNB. For the FNA, an average of three needle passes were made. FNA was followed by three CNBs using the Bard Monopty needle. CNB samples were submitted for frozen section to determine adequacy, and an additional three cores were performed if the first batch was deemed inadequate. All patients ultimately had histologic confirmation of their neoplasms either by the core needle procedure or by definitive open surgical biopsy. Features of cases with discrepant diagnoses were examined in relation to tumor size and histologic type. RESULTS Specificity of both FNA and CNB was 100%. The sensitivity in detecting a malignant neoplasm was higher for FNA than for CNB (97.5% vs. 90%, P < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, FNA of palpable breast lesions is a more sensitive method for the detection of carcinoma regardless of tumor type, size, or differentiation. Contrary to other reports, not only was FNA alone more sensitive than CNB alone, the addition of CNB to an already negative FNA failed to increase sensitivity in the detection of carcinoma. However, CNB did contribute to a more definitive diagnosis in some cases. The authors also found FNA to be more cost effective than CNB for palpable breast lesions when time and effort are taken into consideration. This reinforces the benefit of FNA over CNB in the detection of early stage breast carcinoma. Cancer 1996;78:773-7.

AB  - Abstract.? Bounameaux H (Division of Angiology and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland). Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions (Review). J Intern Med 2010; 268: 218?231. Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2?3. This initial period of 3?months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit?risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - Objective.? To examine whether major depressive episodes (MDEs) are associated with an increased risk of migraine in the general population and to examine whether migraine is associated with an increase risk of MDE. Background.? Population-based cross-sectional studies have consistently reported an association between migraine and depression. However, longitudinal studies about this potentially bidirectional association are inconsistent. Methods.? This retrospective cohort study used 12 years of follow-up data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey (15,254 respondents, age >12). Stratified analysis, logistic regression, and proportional hazard modeling were used to quantify the effect of migraine on subsequent MDE status and vice versa. Results.? After adjusting for sex, age, and other chronic health conditions, respondents with migraine were 60% more likely (HR 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.9) to develop MDE compared with those without migraine. Similarly adjusting for sex and age, respondents with MDE were 40% more likely (HR 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.9) to develop migraine compared with those without MDE. However, the latter association disappeared after adjustment for stress and childhood trauma. Conclusions.? The current study provides substantial evidence that migraine is associated with the later development of MDEs, but does not provide strong causal evidence of an association in the other direction. Environmental factors such as childhood trauma and stress may shape the expression of this bidirectional relationship; however, the precise underlying mechanisms are not yet known.

AB  - Abstract Patients with supraventricular tachycardia commonly present to the ED. There is a lack of consensus regarding assessment of these patients. Our aim was to determine the utility of troponin and four other investigations (full blood examination, electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests and chest X-rays) commonly requested for these patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1992?March 2017) were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies (of sample size greater than 10). Our search strategy yielded no randomised controlled trials and seven observational studies with significant statistical heterogeneity among selected studies (I2 87.3%, P < 0.001). Included studies investigated a total of 1155 patients. All studies reported on the utility of troponin testing in this patient population. The pooled proportion of patients investigated with troponin was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.44?0.88). The pooled proportion of positive troponin tests was 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.23?0.41). Only one study reported on the utility of the remaining four investigations with abnormal results as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone 14%, haemoglobin 6%, white cell count 19% and chest X-ray 22%. Investigations are commonly requested for patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardia. Troponin testing is commonly performed with a high proportion of positive findings although these results did not appear to be associated with major adverse cardiac events. Heterogeneity among studies and low levels of evidence precluded conclusions on full blood examinations, electrolyte levels, thyroid testing and utility of chest X-rays in this patient population.

AB  - Background Child mental health services and related agencies are faced with an increasing challenge in responding to the influx of refugee children around the world. There is strong evidence on the prevalence and complexity of these children's mental health problems and broader needs. Aims To review the research literature on risk and protective factors, and associated mental health interventions for refugee children. Methods Peer-reviewed studies were included for the period 2004?2017; if they included refugee, asylum-seeking or internally displaced children under 18 years; and adopted a quantitative design. Vulnerability and protective factors for refugee children were considered in this context, followed by the respective types of interventions at pre-, peri- and postmigration stage, and across high- and low-/middle-income countries. Eighty-two peer-reviewed studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Results The existing body of literature is largely based on identifying risk factors among children with mental health problems and predominantly designing trauma-focused interventions to reduce their symptomatic distress. Recent research and services have gradually shifted to a broader and dynamic resilience-building approach based on ecological theory, that is at child, family, school, community and societal level. There is increasing evidence for the implementation and effectiveness of multimodal interventions targeting all these levels, despite the methodological constraints in their evaluation. Conclusions In high-income countries, child mental health services need to collaborate with all agencies in contact with refugee children, establish joint care pathways, and integrate trauma-focused interventions with family and community approaches. In low- and middle-income countries, where specialist resources are sparse, resilience-building should aim at maximising and upskilling existing capacity. A six-dimensional psychosocial model that applies to other children who experience complex trauma is proposed.

AB  - There is a potential role of ultrasound examination in the management of women with postmenopausal (PMP) bleeding. Because women with an endometrium = 4?mm at transvaginal ultrasound examination rarely have endometrial pathology, it may be justified not to sample their endometrium. However, endometrial pathology is common among women with endometrium = 5?mm. In our prospective study, 105 consecutive women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm underwent hydrosonography, hysteroscopy, D  Kappa 0.77), but neither hysteroscopy nor hydrosnography could reliably discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. In a randomized trial, 49 women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 4?mm were randomized to D & C and 48 to ultrasound follow up. 14 (29%) women in the D & C group and 22 (46%) in the ultrasound group had either rebleeding or manifested endometrial growth during a 12-month follow-up period. Endometrial pathology was not found in women with rebleeding unless the endometrium was?=?5?mm. Conclusion Women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm should undergo hydrosnography. If focal lesions are detected hysteroscopic resection should be carried out. In women with PMP bleeding, rebleeding during the first 12?months is an indication to sample the endometrium only if the endometrium measures = 5?mm at ultrasound examination.

AB  - Abstract Although the diagnosis of a diabetic foot infection is made based on clinical symptoms and signs, we also use blood laboratory, microbiological and radiological studies to make treatment decisions. All of these diagnostic studies have pitfalls that can lead to a delay in diagnosis. Such delays will likely lead to further tissue damage and to a higher chance of amputation. One of these pitfalls is that some clinicians rely on microbiological, rather than clinical data, to diagnose infection. Though subjective by nature, clinical signs predict outcome of foot infections accurately. Another pitfall is that microbiological data can be misleading. All wounds harbour microorganisms; therefore, a positive wound culture does not mean that a wound is infected. Furthermore, the outcome of cultures of wound swabs does not correlate well with culture results of tissue biopsies. Therapy guidance by wound swab will likely lead to overtreatment of non-pathogenic organisms. Genotyping might have a role in identifying previously unrecognized (combinations of) pathogens in diabetic foot infection, bacteria in sessile phenotype and non-culturable pathogens, e.g. in cases where antibiotics have already been administered. One more pitfall is that the diagnosis of osteomyelitis remains difficult. Although the result of percutaneous bone biopsy is the reference standard for osteomyelitis, some other diagnostic modalities can aid in the diagnosis. A combination of several of these diagnostic tests is probably a good strategy to achieve a higher diagnostic accuracy. Relying on a single test will likely lead to misidentification of patients with osteomyelitis with associated overtreatment and undertreatment. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare tumors of mesenchymal origin. About 50% of patients with STS experience relapse and more than 30% will die within 10 years after diagnosis. In this study we investigated circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and tumor-specific genetic alterations therein (circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA) as diagnostic biomarkers. Plasma concentrations and fragmentation of cfDNA was analyzed with quantitative PCR. Patients with STS (n?=?64) had significantly higher plasma concentrations and increased fragmentation of cfDNA when compared to patients in complete remission (n?=?19) and healthy controls (n?=?41) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Due to overlapping values between patients with STS and controls, the sensitivity and specificity of these assays is limited. Sensitive assays to detect genomic alterations in cfDNA of synovial sarcomas (t(X;18)), myxoid liposarcomas (t(12;16) and TERT C228T promoter mutation) and well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas (MDM2 amplifications) were established. ctDNA was quantified in nine liposarcoma patients during the course of their treatment. Levels of breakpoint t(12;16) and TERT C228T ctDNA correlated with the clinical course and tumor burden in patients with myxoid liposarcomas (n?= 4). ctDNA could detect minimal residual disease and tumor recurrence. In contrast, detection of MDM2 amplifications was not sensitive enough to detect tumors in patients with well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas (n?= 5). Genotyping of cfDNA for tumor specific genetic alterations is a feasible and promising approach for monitoring tumor activity in patients with myxoid liposarcomas. Detection of ctDNA during follow-up examinations despite negative standard imaging studies might warrant more sensitive imaging (e.g. PET-CT) or closer follow-up intervals to timely localize and treat recurrences.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the clinical characteristics, types of vascular ring anomalies (VRA), operative findings, complications, and survival after surgical treatment of cats with VRA. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional case series. Animals Client- or shelter-owned cats presenting to academic, referral veterinary institutions. Methods Medical records of cats with VRA that underwent surgical treatment were reviewed. Signalment, relevant medical history, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, complications, and survival were recorded. Results Twenty cats with VRA were included. Vascular ring anomalies were most commonly (75% [15/20]) diagnosed in cats less than 1?year old, with no breed or sex predilection. Regurgitation was the most common clinical sign, present in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. A persistent right aortic arch was diagnosed in 17 of 20 (85%) cats, with concurrent aberrant left subclavian artery in four of the cats. Surgical treatment was associated with survival to discharge in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. Persistent clinical signs were reported in nine of 13 (69%) cats, and radiographic evidence of megaesophagus persisted in four of 13 (31%) cats, with a median follow-up of 275?days after discharge. Conclusion Persistent right aortic arch was the most commonly diagnosed VRA in cats in this series, although multiple anomalies were observed. Surgical treatment of VRA in cats was associated with a high survival to discharge, although persistence of clinical signs and megaesophagus was noted in 69% and 31% of the cats, respectively. Clinical significance Surgical treatment of VRA in cats is associated with a high survival rate; however, persistence of clinical signs is an expected outcome.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND Psychological morbidity has been proposed as a source of distress in cancer patients. This study aimed to: 1) determine the prevalence of diagnosable psychiatric illnesses, and 2) describe the mental health services received and predictors of service utilization in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS This was a cross-sectional, multi-institutional study of 251 eligible patients with advanced cancer. Eligibility included: distant metastases, primary therapy failure, nonpaid caregiver, age ≥20 years, stamina for the interview, English or Spanish-speaking, and adequate cognitive ability. Trained interviewers administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) modules for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and a detailed questionnaire regarding mental health service utilization. RESULTS Overall, 12% met criteria for a major psychiatric condition and 28% had accessed a mental health intervention for a psychiatric illness since the cancer diagnosis. Seventeen percent had discussions with a mental health professional; 90% were willing to receive treatment for emotional problems. Mental health services were not accessed by 55% of patients with major psychiatric disorders. Cancer patients who had discussed psychological concerns with mental health staff (odds ratio [OR] = 19.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.90?41.50) and non-Hispanic white patients (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.01?7.43) were more likely to receive mental health services in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS Advanced cancer patients experience major psychiatric disorders at a prevalence similar to the general population, but affected individuals have a low rate of utilizing mental health services. Oncology providers can enhance utilization of mental health services, and potentially improve clinical outcomes, by discussing mental health concerns with their patients.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes several clinical prediction rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) rule was created to help emergency clinicians to determine whether PE should be part of the differential diagnosis when the clinician is really not sure whether testing is even merited. Patients investigated for PE in a hospital ward are likely to have a higher Wells score for PE, and a smaller proportion will score 'PE unlikely'. Rule application relies on accurate recall of individual components, a detailed understanding of each component definition, the conversion of positive and negative findings into points, and tallying of the total score. The clinician then has to convert the final score into a dichotomous category. Finally, a prospective study from France demonstrated that deviation from standardised diagnostic PE protocols resulted in a 6% increase in mortality when compared to those who had appropriate protocol driven investigation.

AB  - Objective Agonism of protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuro- and vasculoprotection in experimental neuroinjury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A-APC, reduces neurological injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A-APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A-APC in ischemic stroke patients. Methods The NeuroNEXT trial, RHAPSODY, used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360, and 540 ?g/kg of 3K3A-APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates. Results Between January 2015 and July 2017, we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest-dose 3K3A-APC tested, 540 ?g/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A-APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (p = 0.046) and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1 ± 5.8 ml in placebo to 0.8 ± 2.1 ml in the combined treatment arms (p = 0.066). Interpretation RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540 ?g/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant, 3K3A-APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.

AB  - Abstract Background Multigene panel sequencing (MGPS) is the first-line option in diagnostic testing for genetically heterogeneous but clinically similar conditions, such as neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). In this study, we aimed to assess the utility of comprehensive NMD MGPS and the need for updated panels. Methods All patients were analyzed by either of two versions of the NMD MGPS and by chromosomal microarray and karyotype testing. Four patients with negative NMD MGPS results underwent whole exome sequencing. Results In total, 91 patients were enrolled, and a genetic diagnosis was made in 36 (39.6%); of these, 33 were diagnosed by the comprehensive NMD MGPS, two were confirmed by chromosomal microarray, and one was diagnosed by whole exome sequencing. For MGPS, the diagnostic yield of Version 2 (19/52; 36.5%) was a little higher than that of Version 1 (14/39; 35.9%), and one gene identified in Version 2 was not included in Version 1. A total of 36 definitive and nine possible causative variants were identified, of which 17 were novel. Conclusion A more comprehensive panel for NMD MGPS can improve the diagnostic efficiency in genetic testing. The rapid discovery of new disease-causing genes over recent years necessitates updates to existing gene panels.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the features of dissociative schizophrenia and the clinical model and research data supporting its existence. In classical dissociative identity disorder (DID), the characteristic symptoms are due to full switches of executive control between highly structured, personified, and discrete ego states, or alter personalities. Typically, even in DID, much of the personality system is often structured and functions at the level of Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD). Dissociative schizophrenia fits into broader conception of dissociative disorders, as do the Schneiderian first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. The clinical implications of dissociative schizophrenia are the following: dissociative symptoms are common in schizophrenia and must be considered in treatment, some cases of schizophrenia may be treatable with psychotherapy, the environment can be the major aetiological factor in many cases of schizophrenia, and psychological trauma is a major theme in schizophrenia.
