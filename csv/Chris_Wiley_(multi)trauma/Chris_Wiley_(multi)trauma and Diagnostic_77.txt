AB  - Summary This chapter describes the features of dissociative schizophrenia and the clinical model and research data supporting its existence. In classical dissociative identity disorder (DID), the characteristic symptoms are due to full switches of executive control between highly structured, personified, and discrete ego states, or alter personalities. Typically, even in DID, much of the personality system is often structured and functions at the level of Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD). Dissociative schizophrenia fits into broader conception of dissociative disorders, as do the Schneiderian first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. The clinical implications of dissociative schizophrenia are the following: dissociative symptoms are common in schizophrenia and must be considered in treatment, some cases of schizophrenia may be treatable with psychotherapy, the environment can be the major aetiological factor in many cases of schizophrenia, and psychological trauma is a major theme in schizophrenia.

AB  - Summary: Thirty-three patients whc had had prosthetic valves inserted in the preceding four years were investigated to estimate the value of various laboratory tests in the assessment of traumatic red cell destruction. A combination of the findings of an elevation in serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and a fall in serum haptoglobir levels, was found to be a reliable and accurate pointer to the presence of red cell damage. This study indicates that the commonly used parameters of an increased reticulocyte count, a rise it serum bilirubin levels, the presence ol methaemalbumin (positive Schumm's test) and fragmented red cells in the peripheral blood, although very valuable in more severe cases, are not sufficiently accurate to be used as indicators ol minor degrees of red cell damage. Milc and clinically insignificant red cell destruction is very common in patients with artificial valves and only one case of the thirty-three studied showed no laboratory evidence of traumatic haemolysis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes after radical mandibulectomy in cats. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Eight cats were included. Methods Medical records were searched for cats with confirmed oral neoplasia treated with radical mandibulectomy. Data collected included demographics, surgical procedure, histopathological diagnosis, postoperative management, and outcomes. Results Ages ranged from 8 to 17?years. All cats had 75% to 90% of the mandible removed and feeding tubes placed. Seven cats had squamous cell carcinoma, and one cat had a giant cell tumor. Six cats ate on their own postoperatively. Three cats had local recurrence and tumor-related died at 136 and 291?days. Six cats had no recurrence, with survival times of 156, 465, 608, and 1023?days, and two cats were still alive at 316 and 461 days after surgery. The three long-term survivors died of causes unrelated to oral neoplasia. One cat died at 156?days due to aspiration of food material. The overall estimated mean survival time was 712 days. Conclusion After radical mandibulectomy, independent food intake was achieved in 6 of eight cats, and four cats lived longer than one year. Clinical significance: Radical mandibulectomy should be considered for the treatment of extensive oral neoplasia in cats. Successful long-term outcomes are possible with aggressive supportive care perioperatively.

AB  - Abstract Clinicians are charged with the significant task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted head trauma. Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and injury threshold best able to predict IH in 3?5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and injury threshold most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ. However, when predicting IH, the spring connector representation of the PCC had the best predictive capability for IH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% when ≥1% of all spring connectors had at least a peak strain of 0.31 mm/mm. These findings and reported methodology will be used in the development of a human infant FE model to simulate real-world falls and identify injury thresholds for predicting IH in infants.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:1) assess the relationship between a measure of condition-specific oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and the related normative need for dental treatments, and 2) test the diagnostic validity of the condition-specific OHRQoL measure for specific dental conditions in a group of primary school children. Methods:A cross-sectional study of all 11 to 12 year-olds carried out in a municipal area of Suphanburi province, Thailand. 1034 children (91.8%) were dentally examined to assess their normative needs for 6 types of treatment (dental caries, traumatic dental injuries, enamel defects, periodontal, orthodontic and prosthodontic treatment). OHRQoL was assessed using the Child-OIDP index and its Condition-Specific impacts measure for the 6 treatment types. Results:The prevalence of specific types of normative needs ranged from 3.2% (prosthodontic) to 97.0% (periodontal) and for Condition-Specific oral impacts from 0.7% (prosthodontic) to 50.6% (dental caries). Despite their statistically significant relationship for every treatment type except for periodontal treatment when need was indicated by a CPI score of 1, there were large differences between measures of normative need and oral impacts. High proportions of children had normative need without impacts and vice versa. The biggest differences were for appearance-related conditions (e.g. enamel defects and orthodontic treatment). For every type of treatment, oral impacts poorly predicted the normative needs of individuals. Conclusions:Although normative needs and OHRQoL are associated, when assessed appropriately, there was considerable discrepancy between them. OHRQoL measures cannot replace normative needs. Instead, both should be used in combination in order to cover different dimensions of oral health.

AB  - Cutaneous manifestations are a diagnostic criterion of Ehlers?Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type (EDS-HT) and joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS). These two conditions, originally considered different disorders, are now accepted as clinically indistinguishable and often segregate as a single-familial trait. EDS-HT and JHS are still exclusion diagnoses not supported by any specific laboratory test. Accuracy of clinical diagnosis is, therefore, crucial for appropriate patients' classification and management, but it is actually hampered by the low consistency of many applied criteria including the cutaneous one. We report on mucocutaneous findings in 277 patients with JHS/EDS-HT with both sexes and various ages. Sixteen objective and five anamnestic items were selected and ascertained in two specialized outpatient clinics. Feature rates were compared by sex and age by a series of statistical tools. Data were also used for a multivariate correspondence analysis with the attempt to identify non-causal associations of features depicting recognizable phenotypic clusters. Our findings identified a few differences between sexes and thus indicated an attenuated sexual dimorphism for mucocutaneous features in JHS/EDS-HT. Ten features showed significantly distinct rates at different ages and this evidence corroborated the concept of an evolving phenotype in JHS/EDS-HT also affecting the skin. Multivariate correspondence analysis identified three relatively discrete phenotypic profiles, which may represent the cutaneous counterparts of the three disease phases previously proposed for JHS/EDS-HT. These findings could be used for revising the cutaneous criterion in a future consensus for the clinical diagnosis of JHS/EDS-HT. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of subclinical abnormalities reported in thoracic (CT) scans of cats and to investigate associations between respiratory signs and CT signs. METHODS Retrospective review of signalment, indications, respiratory signs and reported CT findings in a series of cats. Associations between patient variables, respiratory signs and CT signs were analysed using multi-variable regression methods. RESULTS Records of 352 consecutive cats were reviewed. Abnormalities affecting thoracic structures were reported in CT scans of 138/179 (77%) cats that did not have respiratory signs; the most prevalent CT findings were pulmonary collapse (41%), evidence of bronchial disease (24%) and space-occupying lesions (21%). Dyspnoea, cough and tachypnoea were associated with space-occupying lesions. Dyspnoea was also associated with pulmonary consolidation and atelectasis. Increasing body weight was associated with pulmonary atelectasis and increasing age was associated with evidence of bronchial disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Abnormalities were commonly detected in thoracic CT scans of cats that did not show respiratory signs. The most prevalent abnormality ? pulmonary atelectasis ? is probably a temporary effect of sedation or anaesthesia. A high prevalence of subclinical abnormalities and limited correlations between clinical signs and CT findings will complicate diagnosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Melorheostosis is a rare non-hereditary condition characterized by dense hyperostotic lesions with radiographic ?dripping candle wax? appearance. Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 have recently been identified as a cause of melorheostosis. However, little is known about the development, composition, structure, and mechanical properties of the bone lesions. We performed a multi-method phenotype characterization of material properties in affected and unaffected bone biopsy samples from six melorheostosis patients with MAP2K1 mutations. On standard histology, lesions show a zone with intensively remodeled osteonal-like structure and prominent osteoid accumulation, covered by a shell formed through bone apposition, consisting of compact multi-layered lamellae oriented parallel to the periosteal surface and devoid of osteoid. Compared with unaffected bone, melorheostotic bone has lower average mineralization density measured by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (CaMean: ?4.5%, p?=?0.04). The lamellar portion of the lesion is even less mineralized, possibly because the newly deposited material has younger tissue age. Affected bone has higher porosity by micro-CT, due to increased tissue vascularity and elevated 2D-microporosity (osteocyte lacunar porosity: +39%, p?=?0.01) determined on quantitative backscattered electron images. Furthermore, nano-indentation modulus characterizing material hardness and stiffness was strictly dependent on tissue mineralization (correlation with typical calcium concentration, CaPeak: r?=?0.8984, p?=?0.0150, and r?=?0.9788, p?=?0.0007, respectively) in both affected and unaffected bone, indicating that the surgical hardness of melorheostotic lesions results from their lamellar structure. The results suggest a model for pathophysiology of melorheostosis caused by somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1, in which the genetically induced gradual deterioration of bone microarchitecture triggers a periosteal reaction, similar to the process found to occur after bone infection or local trauma, and leads to an overall cortical outgrowth. The micromechanical properties of the lesions reflect their structural heterogeneity and correlate with local variations in mineral content, tissue age, and remodeling rates, in the same way as normal bone. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research

AB  - Echocardiography in the emergency room presents exciting practice possibilities that can facilitate prompt and reliable diagnostic evaluations in patients with suspected cardiovascular emergencies. Echocardiography has the diagnostic potentials to evaluate the entire spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities short of delineating coronary anatomy and evaluation of the conduction system. By reliably assessing the global and regional function, visualizing the cardiovascular structures from multiple tomographic planes, and quantitating hemodynamic abnormalities, echocardiography should be able to assist emergency room physician's evaluation and triage of the patients with chest pain syndrome, unexplained dyspnea, hypotension, shock, chest trauma, and cardiac arrest, whereby hopefully minimizing the unnecessary admission to the hospital and facilitating inhospital evaluation of the admitted patients with echocardiographic information. However, the optimal echocardiography practice in the emergency room requires well trained sonongraphers and echocardiographers who can respond to the clinical needs at anytime. Whether an emergency room physician can perform and interpret echocardiographic examinations satisfactorily will depend on his/her level of training and continuing education in this area. Currently, there is no established guideline for performing echocardiography in the emergency room. Further clinical investigations are necessary to define the most optimal and economical utilization of this versatile imaging and hemodynamic diagnostic modality in the emergency room.

AB  - We studied the value of dynamic sonography in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder joint in patients with clinically suspected frozen shoulder. The sonographic criterion of adhesive capsulitis was continuous limitation of the sliding movement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion of the scapula. Arthrography was regarded as a gold standard in the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis against which the sonographic results were compared. Among 23 patients with arthrographically documented adhesive capsulitis, sonographic examination showed limitation of movement of the supraspinatus tendon in 21. This sonographic sign therefore has a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 92% for detecting adhesive capsulitis, making dynamic sonography a reliable technique for the diagnosis of this condition.

AB  - Summary Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by an acute onset of severe headache and multi-focal segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries resolving within 12 weeks. Diagnostic criteria include normal or near-normal findings in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, especially leucocyte levels < 10/mm?. Distinguishing RCVS from primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is essential to avoid unnecessary and sometimes unfavourable immunosuppressive treatment. We reviewed retrospectively the clinical and diagnostic data of 10 RCVS patients who presented in our neurological department from 1 January 2013 to February 2017. The main purpose was to verify whether CSF leucocyte counts < 10/mm? serve to discriminate RCVS from PACNS. Five of six patients who underwent lumbar puncture presented with CSF leucocyte levels ≥ 10/mm?. Two patients had a history of misinterpretation of CSF pleocytosis as cerebral vasculitis and of immunosuppressive treatment. A complete restitution of cerebral vasoconstriction was evident in all. No patient had further cerebral strokes or bleedings without immunosuppressive treatment over more than 12 weeks. Despite the established diagnostic criteria, RCVS can manifest with CSF leucocyte levels > 10/mm?. Careful anamnesis and the response of ?vasculitis-like angiography? to nimodipine given as a test during angiography and as oral medication are key to differentiate RCVS from cerebral vasculitis.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - ABSTRACT A relatively simple computerised emergency department (ED) attendance record was installed at the Western Hospital with no increase in staffing. The system allows for the entry of patient information and file creation, triage classification, diagnosis and disposition details. A McDonnell Douglas ED module (1988 version), upgraded at Western Hospital, was installed one year prior to the study period. Such systems have the potential to allow data from the 4,000,000 ED annual attendances in Australia to be analysed productively. The recent interest in workload indices and casemix funding formulae has added impetus to the need to computerise ED attendance records. Data entry was performed by clerical staff at the time of registration and following discharge. Diagnostic coding was performed by hospital medical officers. The introduction of the computerised attendance records was associated with no increase in staffing and was accepted by the staff with minimum difficulty.

AB  - Summary Dogs and cats, like all other mammals, have a variety of bacteria that normally inhabit their skin surface. This chapter discusses bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcal bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, the Staphylococcus species found on the dog. Staphylococcus schlieferi and Staphylococcus aureus can also cause canine and feline pyodermas. The chapter then provides a discussion on clinical features, diagnostic tests, and treatment for surface pyodermas, superficial pyodermas, and deep pyodermas. It is important that clients understand the secondary nature of bacterial skin infections. Patients with recurrent or chronic skin infections who have received multiple courses of antibiotics are at increased risk for methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. Diagnosis and control of the underlying disease are essential in the management and prevention of these bacterial infections. Most clients want to be actively involved in their pet's treatment, and the veterinary staff must listen to and address their concerns as early as possible.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the extent that acute asthma is inappropriately treated with antibiotics in Japanese emergency departments (EDs). Objectives: We examined the proportion and predictors of inappropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute asthma in the Japanese EDs. Methods: We conducted a chart review study in 23 Japanese EDs. Subjects were ED patients aged 18 to 54 years with acute asthma between 2009 and 2011. To examine predictors of inappropriate antibiotic use, we performed multi-level logistic regression analysis at both the patient- and ED-level modeling EDs as a random variable. Results: Among 1380 patients in the overall study, the analytic cohort comprised 1311 patients. Overall, antibiotics were inappropriately prescribed for 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4%?5.7%). In the multi-level logistic regression analysis, higher annual ED asthma visit volume was significantly associated with a lower proportion of inappropriate antibiotic use (odds ratio per 100-visit increase, 0.3 ; 95%CI, 0.2?0.6). Conclusions: In this large multicenter study in Japan, we found that approximately 4% of ED patients with acute asthma were inappropriately treated with antibiotics. We also demonstrated that the inappropriate use of antibiotics largely differed across the EDs and was less common in EDs with a more annual ED asthma visits. Organized knowledge translation initiatives are warranted to address this gap in emergency asthma care.
