AB  - Research suggests that 90% of youth in the juvenile justice system have experienced at least one traumatic event (Arroyo, ). One such traumatic event is the commercialized sexual exploitation of children and youth (CSEC). Over the past decade, governmental organizations and community agencies have recognized that the sexual exploitation of children is a significant problem in the United States. In California alone, human trafficking task forces have identified 1200 youth as victims of sexual exploitation from 2010 to 2012 (Walker, ). Youth who have experienced sexual exploitation often become involved in the juvenile justice system and present with unique challenges and needs. This article reviews recent public policy and community responses related to the needs of CSEC youth involved in the juvenile justice system. A case example from Sacramento, CA, is used to illustrate the key components, innovations, multidisciplinary collaborations, and challenges of creating a specialized court.

AB  - Objectives To determine if serum cardiac troponin I concentrations ? measured with both a first-generation assay and a high-sensitivity assay ? were greater in dogs with generalised seizures than in controls and to identify clinical variables associated with cardiac troponin I concentration. Materials and Methods Prospective study of 30 dogs with recent generalised seizures and 30 healthy controls. Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was measured using two commercially available assays, and the correlation of clinical factors with concentration was examined. Results Serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I were higher in dogs that had recent seizures compared to controls when measured by both assays. The predictors most clearly associated with cardiac troponin I concentration were number of seizures and age. Both predictors were positively associated with increasing concentrations of troponin I. Clinical Significance Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was significantly elevated in dogs that had recent generalised seizures when compared to controls, and concentrations were higher in dogs that experienced more seizures. This association may indicate that generalised seizures are associated with damage to the myocardium.

AB  - Objectives Following a paediatric burn, parents commonly experience high levels of acute psychological distress, which has been shown to increase child psychological distress as well as child procedural distress. The influence of psychological stress and perceived pain on wound healing has been demonstrated in several laboratory and medical populations. This paper investigates the influence of parental acute psychological distress and procedural behaviour on the child's rate of re-epithelialization, after controlling for child procedural distress. Design A prospective observational study with longitudinal outcome. Methods Eighty-three parents of children 1?6 years old reported acute psychological distress (post-traumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], guilt, pre-procedural fear, general anxiety/depression symptoms) in relation to their child's burn. A researcher observed parent?child behaviour at the first dressing change, and parents and nurses reported child procedural distress (pre-, peak-, and post-procedural pain and fear). These variables, along with demographic and injury information, were tested for predicting time to re-epithelialization. Date of re-epithelialization was determined by the treating consultant. Results Days to re-epithelialization ranged from 3 to 35 days post-injury. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis found wound depth and size significantly accounted for 28% of the variance in time to re-epithelialization. In Block 2, child peak-procedural pain significantly accounted for 6% additional variance. In Block 3, parental PTSS significantly accounted for 5% additional variance. Conclusions Parental PTSS appears to be an important but under-recognized factor that may influence their child's burn re-epithelialization. Further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms contributing to this association. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Psychological stress delays wound healing, and this relationship has been found in paediatric burn populations with procedural pain. Parental psychological stress is often present after a child's burn and is related to the child's procedural coping and distress. What does this study add? Parental post-traumatic stress is related to delayed child burn re-epithelialization. This association is in addition to procedural pain delaying re-epithelialization.

AB  - Abstract The outcomes of posterolateral multilevel spine fusion in difficult clinical settings, such as in an aged multi-diseased osteoporotic patient, remain unpredictable. The osteoprogenitor cells in bone marrow decrease with ageing without losing their osteogeneic potential. Autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) from iliac crest aspirate can be concentrated in the operating room and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) can be obtained from a peripheral blood as a source of autologous osteoprogenitor cells and growth factors, respectively. We present the case of an 88 year-old multi-diseased osteoporotic patient affected by cervical stenosis and subjected to C3?C7 posterior decompression, instrumentation and posterolateral fusion, using an intraoperative ?tissue-engineered? composite made of corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from iliac crest aspirate enriched with PRF from peripheral blood. Lateral dynamic X-rays and CT scan showed consolidation signs at 3 months follow-up, with solid C3?C7 fusion at 6 months follow-up. This paper describes a simple and effective method for potentially improving the fusion rate in aged osteoporotic patients by using corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from the iliac crest, enriched with PRF from peripheral blood, rapidly obtained before the surgical procedure.

AB  - Abstract Background Approximately 80?000 children and young people in the UK suffer from depression, but many are untreated because of poor identification of early warning signs and risk factors. Aims This study aimed to derive and to investigate discrimination characteristics of a prediction model for a first recorded diagnosis of depression in young people aged 15?24?years. Method This study used a matched case?control method using electronic primary care records. Stepwise conditional logistic regression modelling investigated 42 potential predictors including symptoms, co-morbidities, social factors and drug and alcohol misuse. Results Of the socio-economic and symptomatic predictors identified, the strongest associations were with depression symptoms and other psychological conditions. School problems and social services involvement were prominent predictors in men aged 15?18?years, work stress in women aged 19?24?years. Conclusion Our model is a first step in the development of a predictive model identifying early warning signs of depression in young people in primary care.

AB  - Abstract:? Portal hypertension leads to a wide variety of complications, which lead to significant morbidity and mortality and are some of the leading reasons for liver transplantation in children with chronic liver disease. Evidence-based approaches to the management of adults with portal hypertension exist and have been comprehensively reviewed in a series of international meetings, including the Baveno meetings. Similar evidence-based approaches for the management of portal hypertension in children do not exist and as such international meetings on portal hypertension have not focused on this problem in children. On October 7, 2005 at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, a panel of pediatric experts reviewed the most recent Baveno statement and crafted a statement modified with their opinions vis a vis approaches to the management of portal hypertension in children.

AB  - A three-year-old neutered female Labrador cross was presented for investigation of two corneal epithelial inclusion cysts affecting the left eye. The aetiopathogenesis of the cyst formation was suspected to be traumatic. The cysts were removed successfully by superficial keratectomy, followed by a third eyelid flap. Histologically, both lesions were represented by cystic formations lined with multi-layered squamous epithelium, consistent with stromal inclusion of surface corneal epithelium. Complete recovery was achieved, and there was no recurrence at six month follow-up.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the association between different subjective and objective assessments of ankle function in a population of athletes with or without functional ankle instability (FAI). 29 athletes with a history of ankle spraining were divided into two groups according to their ankle status: 16 with FAI (initial ankle sprain with residual functional instability) (age 24.6?±?3.1 years), and 13 COPERS (initial ankle sprain without residual instability) (age 25.3?±?4.4 years). The assessment of each individual's ankle function was based on three approaches: The ?functional-ankle-ability-measure? (FAAM) assessing subjective ankle functionality, measures of sensorimotor control as objective functional measurements and MRI-based T2-mapping as a quantitative marker of compositional joint status. Pearson's product-moment-correlation coefficient, student's t-test and analysis-of-variance were used for statistical analysis. Significant group differences existed for subjective ankle function (FAAM, p?=?0.04) and MRI-data mainly in the medial compartment of the ankle joint (p?≤?0.05). We found unique associations between T2-mapping results and sensorimotor scores in the COPER (r?=??0.756?0.849), and ?FAI?-group (r?=?0.630?0.657). The location and magnitude differed between groups. No correlations existed between these measures and the FAAM. This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential interrelations between various diagnostic measures of ankle function and structure in individuals with and without FAI. We found associations between MRI-results and selected measures of sensorimotor control, indicating a potential link between loss of ankle function and early joint degeneration. Despite these interrelations, each of the different assessment options appears to contain unique information on ankle functionality important in a clinical assessment. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation is usually the pathological consequence of skin trauma. And hypertrophic scars (HSs) frequently occur in people after being injured deeply. HSs are unusually considered as the result of tissue contraction and excessive extracellular matrix component deposition. Myofibroblasts, as the effector cells, mainly differentiated from fibroblasts, play the crucial role in the pathophysiology of HSs. A number of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of HS occurrence. Currently, with in-depth exploration and clinical research of HSs, various creative and effective treatments budded. In here, we summarize the progress in the molecular mechanism of HSs, and review the available biotherapeutic methods for their pathophysiological characteristics. Additionally, we further prospected that the comprehensive therapy may be more suitable for HS treatment.

Abstract The use of appropriate resuscitation targets or end-points may facilitate early detection and appropriate management of shock. There is a fine balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, and when this is perturbed, an oxygen debt is generated. In this narrative review, we explore the value of global haemodynamic resuscitation end-points, including pulse rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure and mixed/central venous oxygen saturations. The evidence supporting the reliability of these parameters as end-points for guiding resuscitation and their potential limitations are evaluated.

AB  - Abstract Haemodynamic targets, such as cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure and central venous oxygen saturations, remain crude predictors of tissue perfusion and oxygen supply at a cellular level. Shocked patients may appear adequately resuscitated based on normalization of global vital signs, yet they are still experiencing occult hypoperfusion. If targeted resuscitation is employed, appropriate use of end-points is critical. In this review, we consider the value of directing resuscitation at the microcirculation or cellular level. Current technologies available include sublingual capnometry, video microscopy of the microcirculation and near-infrared spectroscopy providing a measure of tissue oxygenation, whereas base deficit and lactate potentially provide a surrogate measure of the adequacy of global perfusion. The methodology and evidence for these technologies guiding resuscitation are considered in this narrative review.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an electrophysiological technique used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) to evaluate the functional integrity of the descending motor fibres in the spinal cord. Successful application of the technique was reported in horses with spinal cord compression. However, limited data are available on the correlation of TMS with histopathological changes. Objectives To determine sensitivity of TMS for assessing the integrity of the spinal cord in horses with compressive lesions of the spinal cord. Study design Case series. Methods The study was conducted on 6 horses with spinal ataxia grade III-V/V admitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. The horses underwent TMS, radiography of the cervical or thoracolumbar vertebral column, and myelography (4/6). All horses were subjected to euthanasia and the spinal cord examined histopathologically. Results In 5/6 horses MMEPs with abnormal onset latencies in both extensor carpi radialis muscles and cranial tibialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a cervical spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed cervical vertebral malformation (4/5) with cervical vertebral canal stenosis (3/5) and tumour/osteomyelitis (1/5). In 1/6 horse MMEPs with normal onset latencies in extensor carpi radialis muscles and prolonged onset latencies in tibialis cranialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed deformation of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae. Myelography showed reduction in dural diameter and dorsal contrast column (4/4). Histopathological examination of the spinal cord confirmed compressive type lesions in all 6 horses with degenerative changes in the white matter of all funiculi, ballooning of myelin sheets, swollen axons, loss of axons and astroglial activation. Conclusions In this case series abnormal function of descending motor pathways as registered by TMS showed 100% sensitivity with the histopathological characteristics of compressive lesions in the spinal cord, but the number of horses is limited and further research is warranted. Ethical animal research:?Research ethics committee oversight not currently required by this conference: the study was performed on material collected during clinical procedures. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Source of funding:?Not applicable. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract Background To understand whether patient-reported experiences with lung cancer may create teachable moments (TM) for their relatives as evidenced by shifts in their risk perceptions, affective response, and self-image and in turn, motivation to quit smoking. Methods Patients at a comprehensive cancer center (n?=?152) completed a survey within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis to assess their cancer-related symptoms and openness and enumerated relatives who were smokers. Relative smokers (n?=?218) then completed a survey assessing their risk perceptions, affective response, and self-image as a smoker related to the patient's diagnosis (TM mechanisms), and their motivation to quit smoking. Cross-sectional mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to explore the links between patient-reported experiences, and relatives' TM mechanisms, and motivation to quit smoking. Results Relative-reported affect was a significant mediator of the association between patient-reported symptoms and relative smoker's desire to quit. Relatives' self-image was a significant moderator of the association between patient-reported symptoms and relative smoker's desire to quit, such that patients' reported symptoms were associated with relatives' desire to quit only when the relative smoker reported a generally positive self-image as a smoker. No evidence was found for moderated mediation. However, the link between symptoms and negative affect was moderated by perceptions of risk. Conclusion Whether smokers experience a family member's lung cancer as a TM is influenced by multiple interrelated cognitive and affective factors that warrant further exploration. Clearer understanding of these factors could inform how to re-invigorate and sustain this motivation to promote concrete actions toward smoking cessation. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Jaw fractures occur commonly in cats and dogs as a result of vehicular trauma, falls from heights, or by, objects, dog fights, and/or an altercation with another animal. With jaw fracture repair it is essential to maintain normal occlusion. The goal of the jaw fracture repair is to return the patient's mouth to normal function as soon as possible. Multi-modal analgesia must be applied to prevent pain in the patient. The use of tape muzzles or commercial nylon muzzles is suitable and sufficient for certain jaw fractures in some patients. Nylon or tape muzzles are also a nice additional support for other types of jaw fracture repair. Interdental bonding, interdental wiring, and acrylic reinforcement are other options for jaw fracture repair that are relatively inexpensive and not as technically challenging as some of the more invasive methods of jaw fracture repair, and are considered adequate in many jaw fracture cases.

AB  - Objective To report the diagnosis, treatment, and short-term outcome in dogs with suspected persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) undergoing thoracoscopy with concurrent esophagoscopy. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with suspected PRAA (n=9). Methods Medical records were reviewed from 2012 to 2016. Dogs undergoing thoracoscopy for PRAA at 3 referral hospitals were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, anesthesia protocol (including the use of one-lung ventilation), surgical approach, complications, and short-term outcome were recorded. Dogs underwent a left-sided intercostal thoracoscopic approach with concurrent intraoperative esophagoscopy. The ligamentum arteriosum (LA) and constricting fibers were divided using a vessel-sealing device using a 3 or 4 port thoracoscopy technique. Visualization and dissection of the LA was aided by transesophageal illumination by esophagoscopy. Results Thoracoscopy confirmed PRAA in 9 dogs, with an aberrant left subclavian artery (LS) identified in 5 dogs. Major complications occurred in 2 dogs: postoperative hemorrhage from the LS and esophageal perforation, which resulted in euthanasia. Median follow-up was 250 days (range, 56?1,595). Regurgitation resolved in 4 of 8 surviving dogs. One dog had recurrence of regurgitation 1,450 days postoperatively, esophageal compression by the LS was identified, and regurgitation resolved following LS transection. Conclusion Esophagoscopy aided identification and dissection of the LA in all cases. Due to the potential for the LS to cause clinical esophageal constriction postoperatively, a recommendation for LS transection may be warranted. Vascular clips can also be considered as an alternative for vessel ligation to avoid complications associated with vessel-sealing device use.

AB  - Comorbidity of substance use disorders with physical and mental disorders was investigated among 1249 consecutive psychiatric consultation patients admitted to six general hospitals in Finland. Of the patients 354 (28%) were diagnosed with substance use disorders (ICD-10), of which 22% were due to use of at least two different types of psychoactive substances. Alcohol dependence (117/226) in male patients and acute drug intoxication (49/128) at a similar rate as alcohol dependence (44/128) in female patients were the most common clinical conditions. With few exceptions, all substance use disorders were comorbid and in 63% of affected patients comprised a ?triple diagnosis? (i.e., physical, mental, and substance use diagnoses concurrently). Poisonings and personality disorders in both sexes, digestive system diseases in men, and injuries in women were related to substance use disorders. Conclusions for service provision were: (1) the high level of co-occurrence of physical and mental disorders with substance use disorders calls for comprehensive, multi-disciplinary assessment of any substance use problems ascertained in psychiatric consultations; (2) poisoning with substance use involvement and mental comorbidity was the most common combined clinical condition justifying provision of addiction psychiatric emergency consultations in general hospitals; (3) polydrug use indicating severe problems and complex treatment needs should be identified; and (4) psychiatric referrals of patients with physical alcohol-related disorders should be ensured in general hospitals.
