AB  - Allergic skin diseases are amongst the most common reasons for the presentation of dogs and cats to a veterinarian. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of similarity in the clinical signs associated with these diseases. In this article, the role of intradermal and serological allergy testing in the diagnosis and management of allergic skin diseases is reviewed, together with other diagnostic approaches.

AB  - Objective To report the diagnosis, treatment, and short-term outcome in dogs with suspected persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) undergoing thoracoscopy with concurrent esophagoscopy. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with suspected PRAA (n=9). Methods Medical records were reviewed from 2012 to 2016. Dogs undergoing thoracoscopy for PRAA at 3 referral hospitals were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, anesthesia protocol (including the use of one-lung ventilation), surgical approach, complications, and short-term outcome were recorded. Dogs underwent a left-sided intercostal thoracoscopic approach with concurrent intraoperative esophagoscopy. The ligamentum arteriosum (LA) and constricting fibers were divided using a vessel-sealing device using a 3 or 4 port thoracoscopy technique. Visualization and dissection of the LA was aided by transesophageal illumination by esophagoscopy. Results Thoracoscopy confirmed PRAA in 9 dogs, with an aberrant left subclavian artery (LS) identified in 5 dogs. Major complications occurred in 2 dogs: postoperative hemorrhage from the LS and esophageal perforation, which resulted in euthanasia. Median follow-up was 250 days (range, 56?1,595). Regurgitation resolved in 4 of 8 surviving dogs. One dog had recurrence of regurgitation 1,450 days postoperatively, esophageal compression by the LS was identified, and regurgitation resolved following LS transection. Conclusion Esophagoscopy aided identification and dissection of the LA in all cases. Due to the potential for the LS to cause clinical esophageal constriction postoperatively, a recommendation for LS transection may be warranted. Vascular clips can also be considered as an alternative for vessel ligation to avoid complications associated with vessel-sealing device use.

AB  - Summary A 17-year-old Irish Sport Horse gelding was referred to the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital for low-grade colic that had been nonresponsive to medical treatment. Diagnostic investigation revealed a marked septic peritonitis. The inciting cause was detected by gastroscopy to be a perforating foreign body in the pylorus of the stomach from a briar of a blackthorn plant (Prunus spinosa spp.). Successful removal of the foreign body was achieved surgically via gastrotomy. The horse subsequently developed a multi-drug resistant abdominal incision site infection, which was successfully managed over a 2-month period. Abdominal incisional herniation occurred thereafter. Six months post-operatively, the horse was back in light work and no further adverse sequelae had been noted.

AB  - Abstract Pupil examination has been used as a basic measure in critically ill patients and has great importance for the prognosis and management of disease. An automated pupillometer is a computer-based infrared digital video system by which the accuracy and precision of the pupil examination are markedly improved. We conducted an observational study of pupil assessment with automated pupillometry in clinical liver transplantation settings, including pretransplant evaluations and posttransplant surveillance. Our results showed that unconscious patients (grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy) had a prolonged latency phase (left side: 283 ± 80 milliseconds; right side: 295 ± 96 milliseconds) and a reduced pupillary constrictive ratio (left direct response: 0.23 ± 0.10; left indirect response: 0.21 ± 0.07; right direct response: 0.20 ± 0.08; right indirect response: 0.21 ± 0.08) in comparison with normal and conscious patients. After liver transplantation, the recovery of pupillography in these patients was slower than that in conscious patients. However, the surviving recipients without major complications all had a gradual recovery of pupillary responses, which occurred on the first or second posttransplant day. We also reported 4 cases of futile LT in the absence of pretransplant pupillary responses and other pupillary abnormalities revealed by automated pupillometry in our study. In conclusion, patients with grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy had a sluggish pupil response and a delayed recovery pattern after LT. An automated pupillometer is potentially a supplementary device for pretransplant screening and posttransplant monitoring in patients undergoing LT, but further prospective studies are required.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify strengths and weaknesses in current studies with a view to carrying out a major multi-center study in Australia. Methods:? The literature was reviewed using standard Medline and Ovid methods. Bibliography of well known key recent papers were used to identify further papers. Results:? Studies evaluating persistent pain after breast cancer surgery have been small and few were prospective controlled studies with adequate power. Like Jung et?al[1] we found that the literature was inconsistent in defining chronic pain and differentiating the breast cancer surgery pain syndromes. Marked variations in prior studies are due to differences in: study size (n?=?22 to 282 patients), methodology, diagnostic criteria, pain assessment instruments, and distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics in the samples studied. Unfortunately the largest study to date, the ALMANAC Trial (n?=?1031) which compared sentinel node biopsy vs ?standard axillary dissection? evaluated arm and shoulder function and quality of life, but not pain[2]. From the current literature, it appears that neuropathic breast and arm pain are most common. Widely varying prevalence estimates of different neuropathic pain syndromes have been reported: phantom breast pain (3?44%); intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICBN) (16?39%); ICBN in breast conserving surgery (14?61%); and ?neuroma pain? (23?49%). The most established risk factors for surgically related neuropathic pain syndromes are intraoperative nerve trauma, severe acute postoperative pain, and high use of postoperative analgesics[1]. Psychosocial distress is reported to be a risk factor and a consequence of chronic pain[1]. Conclusions:? Well-designed large multi-center studies are required to identify prevalences of various pain types, associated risk factors and treatment success for pain after breast cancer surgery. Such a study is in progress through the collaboration of our group with the Sentinel Node vs Axillary Clearance (SNAC) Study of 1000 women following breast surgery, conducted by the Royal Australian College of Surgeons (RACS).

AB  - Summary Vascular anomalies encompass a broad spectrum of tumours and malformations as classified by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. Despite being one of the most common congenital abnormalities, they are often misunderstood in clinical practice: use of the term ?haemangioma? to denote any vascular anomaly still occurs. They are found frequently in the head and neck, often as complex lesions that require multidisciplinary management which necessitates an accurate diagnosis. Precise radiological assessment is therefore crucial. This pictorial review will briefly discuss the current classification system of vascular anomalies and the optimal radiological tools for their evaluation.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate subchondral joint space width measurements (SJSW) and CT-osteoabsorptiometry (CTOAM) measurements in the elbow of dogs with naturally occurring fragmented medial coronoid process (FMCP) preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively, and to compare these to normal dogs. Study Design Prospective randomized clinical trial. Animals Large breed dogs <1 year of age (n?=?15). Methods Arthroscopic FMCP debridement was performed, followed by randomization to a proximal ulnar ostectomy with IM pin (PUO). CTs were performed pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively. CTOAM and SJSW measurements were acquired in 7 locations within the joint and compared to an age-matched normal control group. Pearson correlation was performed on SJSW and CTOAM measurements. A linear mixed model determined the effect of disease and treatment on SJSW and CTOAM measurements. Results Fifteen dogs (28 elbows) with FMCP participated (11 arthroscopic FMCP removal, 17 with additional PUO). Data were normally distributed. Pearson correlation between CTOAM and SJSW measurements showed moderate to strong negative correlation in the control dogs. Preoperatively, affected elbows had lower medial compartment and higher lateral coronoid process CTOAM values than normal elbows. After treatment, CTOAM values of the medial compartment increased to normal. Treatment with PUO did not affect SJSW or CTOAM. Conclusions Our data agree with these previous studies suggesting lower subchondral plate mineralization in dogs affected by FMCP. Arthroscopy may result in higher CTOAM values secondary to increased loading.

AB  - Objective In this trial, we compared the relative efficacy of dialogical exposure group treatment using Gestalt empty-chair method with a supportive group in the treatment of symptoms stemming from traumatic loss in a post-war society. Methods One-hundred and nineteen women whose husbands were either killed or registered as missing during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were quasi-randomized to seven sessions of group treatment with dialogical exposure or to an active control condition. Results Both interventions resulted in significant improvement from baseline to post-treatment for both kinds of loss, in terms of post-traumatic symptoms, general mental health and grief reactions, with the exception of depression and traumatic grief in the control condition. Regarding mean effect sizes (Cohen's d), pre-treatment to post-treatment improvements were moderate (d?=?0.56) for the dialogical exposure group and small (d?=?0.34) for the supportive group. Treatment gains were maintained at least until the 1-year follow-up. In controlled comparisons, dialogical exposure was superior concerning traumatic grief (Cohen's d?=?0.37) and post-traumatic avoidance (d?=?0.73) at post-treatment. Conclusions Results show that short-term dialogical exposure group treatment was moderately effective in treating traumatically bereaved women. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Research attests to high levels of symptoms among post-war civil populations, in particular, when a loved one was killed, which can lead not only to trauma reactions but also to severe separation distress. Grieving the loss of a loved one is hampered if the death remains unconfirmed. Unconfirmed loss could be conceptualized as unfinished business in terms of Gestalt therapy, which offers empty-chair dialogue for resolving unfinished business and grief. Dialogical exposure therapy (DET) supports the client in gaining awareness of and expressing his or her inner dialogues concerning the traumatic event, using Gestalt empty-chair method. Short-term DET was effective in treating traumatically bereaved women but showed little additional effects in comparison with a supportive group treatment, so further research is warranted.

AB  - Massive transfusion protocols became common practice between 2006 and 2010. The terminology of ?massive transfusion protocol? was improved to ?massive haemorrhage protocol (MHP)? with the astute recognition that at the start of such a protocol, it is unclear which patients will meet the definition of massive transfusion (10 U/24 h). Despite the majority of the literature being reported from the trauma population, hospitals have generally adopted a single MHP for all patients. It remains unclear whether the same protocol can be used for all patients. MHPs assist with the prevention and management of the acute coagulopathy of trauma/shock (ACOTS). The goals of a MHP are to improve haemostasis, communication and patient outcomes. The protocol must be specific for an individual hospital, depending on factors such as prehospital transport times, distance from laboratory to trauma and operating rooms, patient populations served and types of tests available. The key components of a MHP are the 6Ts: triggering of the protocol, laboratory testing, tranexamic acid, temperature maintenance, transfusion support and termination of the protocol when haemostasis is achieved. The evidence and importance of each of these steps will be discussed in detail. It is also critical that a quality assurance programme supports the MHP. Poor compliance with the institutional MHP is associated with inferior survival. Each MHP activation should be followed by a formal debrief by the team. Audits should be performed to determine compliance and to inform annual update of the MHP. Formal training and/or simulation should be a core part of the policy.

Some three years after his accident, he brought an action for damages arising out of the accident. His solicitor, on the recommendation of, the consultant psychiatrist, contacted the SLT requesting his views as to whether Mr. J's speech difficulties were due to the injuries sustained and requesting recommendations for further treatment. The SLT saw Mr. J and concluded that he had problems at all communication levels, the greatest being an articulatory impairment. Some reports' suggested a psychological basis for his problems and others, including the psychiatrists', suggested an organic basis.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of the study was to describe patients' experiences of emotional adaption following treatment for oesophageal cancer from diagnosis to 6 months after surgery. Design A qualitative interview study using an inductive approach was carried out. Methods Participants were recruited from two university hospitals in Sweden. Ten patients who had been operated for oesophageal cancer with curative intent 6 months earlier and consented to participate in the study were included. Patients who had a disease recurrence were not eligible for inclusion. Participants were interviewed with a semi-structured interview approach. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results One overarching theme was identified; Experiencing a crisis reaction, which comprised three key categories; (a) From emotionally numb to feeling quite alright; (b) From a focus on cure to reflections about a whole new life; and (c) From a severe treatment to suffering an emaciated, non-compliant body, derived from 14 distinct sub-categories. Conclusion This study highlights the process of emotional adaptation following oesophageal cancer surgery that patients describe when reflecting back on the first 6 months postoperatively pointing to a crisis reaction in this early postoperative period.
