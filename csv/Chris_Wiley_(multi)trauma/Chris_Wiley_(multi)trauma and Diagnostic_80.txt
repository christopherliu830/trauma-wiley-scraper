AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of the study was to describe patients' experiences of emotional adaption following treatment for oesophageal cancer from diagnosis to 6 months after surgery. Design A qualitative interview study using an inductive approach was carried out. Methods Participants were recruited from two university hospitals in Sweden. Ten patients who had been operated for oesophageal cancer with curative intent 6 months earlier and consented to participate in the study were included. Patients who had a disease recurrence were not eligible for inclusion. Participants were interviewed with a semi-structured interview approach. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results One overarching theme was identified; Experiencing a crisis reaction, which comprised three key categories; (a) From emotionally numb to feeling quite alright; (b) From a focus on cure to reflections about a whole new life; and (c) From a severe treatment to suffering an emaciated, non-compliant body, derived from 14 distinct sub-categories. Conclusion This study highlights the process of emotional adaptation following oesophageal cancer surgery that patients describe when reflecting back on the first 6 months postoperatively pointing to a crisis reaction in this early postoperative period.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a robust, non-invasive means of defining aspects of human neurochemistry. After more than two decades, it is clear that in addition to its scientific interest, MRS has diagnostic value in tumor diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic outcome, dementia diagnosis and prognosis, multiple sclerosis, infections, trauma, development, stroke, perinatal ischemia, xenobiotics and inborn errors (as determined from a meta-analysis included in this paper). However, in many healthcare systems, a new radiological technique requires evidence-based medicine (EBM) before it is recommended for reimbursement. Much of the reason why MRS is thought to be non-reimbursable in the USA is due to recent announcements that this 15-year-old technique is still considered ?investigational? by these EBM assessments. An analysis is presented of the technology assessments that brought about this situation. Based on the conclusions of the EBM assessments, strategies are suggested that involve all entities responsible for spectroscopy including the scientists' role in ensuring the future for clinical spectroscopy.

AB  - Summary Many neurological disorders that require pharmacotherapy in human patients are similar to those that require pharmacotherapy in veterinary patients. This chapter focuses on the most common veterinary neurological disorder that requires pharmacological treatment: epilepsy. Ketogenic diets have been used for managing epilepsy in people for decades. The goal of seizure management is to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures while minimizing adverse drug effects. Seizures are a common neurological disorder in dogs and cats. Diagnostic testing is dependent on the cause of the seizure. Polytherapy is considered when seizure control and quality of life are not achieved with monotherapy. In people, the classification and diagnosis of seizure type are critical to selection of the specific antiepileptic drug (AED). Monotherapy is preferred over polytherapy when initiating AED therapy. Due to pharmacokinetic variability and sensitivity to adverse drug effects, most veterinary patients are started at the lower end of the dose range initially.

AB  - Objective: To describe the radiographic appearance of pulmonary oedema in cats with cardiac failure. Methods: Thoracic radiographs of 23 cats presented to a first opinion practice with signs of cardiac failure were reviewed. All cats had tachypnoea and/or dyspnoea and enlarged left atrium on echocardiography. Results: Pulmonary oedema was characterised radiographically by an increased opacity associated with a range of patterns and variable distribution. All cats had evidence of a reticular or granular interstitial pattern. This occurred in combination with alveolar pattern in 19 (83 per cent) cats, including six with air bronchograms, with increased diameter of pulmonary vessels in 16 (71 per cent) cats and with bronchial pattern in 14 (61 per cent) cats. The distribution of pulmonary oedema was considered to be diffuse/non-uniform in 14 (61 per cent) cats, diffuse/uniform in four (17 per cent) cats, multi-focal in four (17 per cent) cats and focal in the remaining one (4 per cent). Nine (39 per cent) cats were considered to have a regional distribution of oedema, including five (22 per cent) with a ventral distribution, three (13 per cent) with a caudal distribution and one (4 per cent) cat with a hilar distribution. The distribution of pulmonary opacities was bilaterally symmetrical in five (22 per cent) cats. Clinical Significance: The variable appearance of feline pulmonary oedema is likely to complicate its radiographic diagnosis.

AB  - Summary A 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding was referred for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging due to chronic left hindlimb lameness localised to the foot. On presentation, a previously undiagnosed draining tract was identified at the plantar aspect of the pastern. Radiographs revealed severe osteolysis of the navicular bone. Positive contrast MR fistulography was performed using a gadolinium based contrast agent following conventional MR imaging of the left hind foot. Fistulography allowed characterisation of a fistulous tract, which was closely associated with the deep digital flexor tendon, navicular bursa and osteomyelitis of the navicular bone.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To perform baseline T2 mapping of the hips of healthy volunteers, focusing on topographic variation, because no detailed study has involved hips. T2 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that evaluates cartilage matrix components. Materials and Methods Hips of 12 healthy adults (six men and six women; mean age = 29.5 ± 4.9 years) were studied with a 3.0-Tesla MRI system. T2 measurement in the oblique-coronal plane used a multi-spin-echo (MSE) sequence. Femoral cartilage was divided into 12 radial sections; acetabular cartilage was divided into six radial sections, and each section was divided into two layers representing the superficial and deep halves of the cartilage. T2 of these sections and layers were measured. Results Femoral cartilage T2 was the shortest (?20° to 20° and ?10° to 10°, superficial and deep layers), with an increase near the magic angle (54.7°). Acetabular cartilage T2 in both layers was shorter in the periphery than the other parts, especially at 20° to 30°. There were no significant differences in T2 between right and left hips or between men and women. Conclusion Topographic variation exists in hip cartilage T2 in young, healthy adults. These findings should be taken into account when T2 mapping is applied to patients with degenerative cartilage. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2007;26:165?171. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Meningococcal infection remains a significant health problem in children, with a significant mortality and morbidity. Prompt recognition and aggressive early treatment are the only effective measures against invasive disease. This requires immediate administration of antibiotic therapy, and the recognition and treatment of patients who may have complications of meningococcal infection such as shock, raised intracranial pressure (ICP) or both. Encouragingly, its mortality has fallen in recent years. This is the result of several factors such as the centralization of care of seriously ill children in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs), the establishment of specialized mobile intensive care teams, the development of protocols for the treatment of meningococcal infection, and the dissemination by national bodies and charities of guidance about early recognition and management. We will review the pathophysiology and management of the different presentations of meningococcal disease and examine the possible role of adjunctive therapies.

AB  - An eight-year-old mixed-breed dog was presented with progressive paraparesis. Neurological examination revealed a painful diffuse lesion between spinal cord segments T3 and L3. Magnetic resonance images displayed multi-focal contrast enhancing spinal cord and meningeal lesions. Cytology of these lesions revealed a malignant tumour prompting euthanasia of the dog. Histopathology confirmed the cytological diagnosis and a final diagnosis of a glioblastoma multiforme was made based on immunohistochemistry.

AB  - A case of central nervous system protothecosis in a dog is reported. A three-year-old male Maremma sheepdog was referred with a two month history of diarrhoea associated with progressive tetraparesis, depression and right circling. Stupor, severe proprioceptive deficits, bilateral decreased thoracic limb flexor reflexes and bilateral deficit of the menace reaction were detected on neurological examination and a multi-focal neurological localisation was suspected. Histopathological evaluation revealed multi-focal granulomatous foci in the thalamus, hippocampus and caudal brainstem containing numerous oval-rounded organisms with a thick, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and Gomori?s methenamine silver-positive cell wall, a basophilic cytoplasm and one nucleus. Scattered sporangia containing two to four endospores were also observed. Morphological features were consistent with Prototheca species. Ultrastructurally, numerous degenerated algae were present within macrophages mainly lacking nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. Generally, protothecosis in dogs is characterised by systemic signs because of a multi-organ involvement, and haemorrhagic colitis or ophthalmologic signs are the most frequent presenting signs. However, protothecosis should be added, also in Europe, to the list of the differential diagnoses in adult dogs with a multi-focal neurological localisation even in absence of other clinical signs.

AB  - Objective Describe clinical and radiographic features of sigmoid sinus wall anomalies (SSWA) associated with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) and determine factors predictive of response to surgery. Methods Preoperative diagnostic imaging and treatment response were reviewed after surgical repair of 40 ears among 38 consecutive patients presenting with PT associated with SSWA who underwent transtemporal sinus wall reconstruction. Results Twenty-three ears had isolated sigmoid sinus dehiscence, and 17 had diverticulum. The rates of transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) and empty sella, 66% and 32% respectively, were significantly higher than in historical controls (P?=?0.02 and 0.001). Thirty-six out of 40 subjects (90%) had complete resolution of their PT following surgery, including all those with a diverticulum. For subjects with dehiscence alone without diverticulum, a favorable response to surgery was strongly associated with the presence of TSS (P?=?0.01) and empty sella (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Sigmoid sinus diverticulum and dehiscence are a clinically important cause of PT. Women of childbearing age with an elevated body mass index (BMI) are commonly affected, and there is a high rate of associated TSS and empty sella. Transtemporal sinus wall reconstruction has a high rate of success in appropriately selected patients. Patients with isolated sinus wall dehiscence without diverticulum, TSS, or empty sella are less likely to respond to transtemporal sinus wall reconstruction. These data imply a multifactorial cause of PT in at least some patients with SSWA. Level of Evidence: 4 Laryngoscope, 128:S1?S13, 2018

AB  - Objective To report successful surgical correction of concurrent angular and torsional metatarsal deformities in a calf using a cylindrical osteotomy and locking compression plate (LCP) technology. Study Design Case report. Animals A 10-week-old composite bull calf. Methods Using Paley's principles of angular limb deformity correction, a cylindrical osteotomy was performed to concurrently correct varus deformity and external torsion of the metatarsus. The limb was aligned and stabilized using two 3.5?mm broad LCP with locking head screws. Results The calf was immediately weight bearing after surgery and did not experience any postoperative complications. Follow-up radiographs 5 months postoperatively revealed complete osteotomy healing and remodeling. The limb was in good alignment, the calf was fully weight bearing, and client satisfaction was very high. Telephone follow-up with the owner 16 months after surgery revealed continued full use of the operated limb and the bull was being used in a pasture breeding program. Conclusions Cylindrical osteotomy with LCP stabilization can provide a favorable outcome in angular and torsional metatarsal deformity correction in cattle.

AB  - Objectives To determine if total serum cholesterol concentrations were altered in dogs with osteosarcoma. To evaluate association of total serum cholesterol concentration with clinical outcomes in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective, multi-institutional study on 64 dogs with osteosarcoma. Control population consisted of dogs with traumatic bone fractures (n=30) and healthy patients of similar age and weight as those of the osteosarcoma cases (n=31). Survival analysis was done on 35 appendicular osteosarcoma patients that received the current standard of care. Statistical associations were assessed by univariable and multi-variable analysis. Information about age, sex, primary tumour location, total cholesterol concentration, monocytes and lymphocyte counts and alkaline phosphatase were also included. Results Total cholesterol was elevated above the reference interval (3·89 to 7·12?mmol/L) (150 to 275?mg/dL) in 29 of 64 (45·3%) osteosarcoma-bearing dogs, whereas similar elevations were found in only 3 of 30 (10%) fracture controls (P<0·0001) and 2 of 31 (6·5%) similar age/weight controls (P=0·0002). Elevated total cholesterol was significantly associated with a reduced hazard ratio (0·27, P=0·008) for overall mortality in dogs with osteosarcoma. Clinical Significance These results suggest that elevated total cholesterol is associated with canine osteosarcoma and may have prognostic significance.

AB  - Patellofemoral instability (PFI) is one of the most disabling conditions in the knee, often affecting young individuals. Despite its not uncommon presentation, the underlying biomechanical features leading to this entity are not entirely understood. The suitability of classic physical examination manoeuvres and imaging tests is a matter of discussion among treating surgeons, and so are the findings provided by these means. A potential cause for this lack of consensus is the fact that, classically, the diagnostic approach for PFI has relied on statically obtained data. Many authors advocate for the study of this entity in a dynamic scenario, closer to the actual situation in which the instability episodes occur. In this literature review, we have compiled the available data from the last decades regarding dynamic evaluation methods for PFI and related conditions. Several categories are presented, grouping the related techniques and devices: physical examination, imaging modalities (ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and combined methods), arthroscopic evaluation, and others. In conclusion, although a vast number of quality studies are presented, in which comprehensive data about the biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are described, this evidence has not yet reached clinical practice universally. Most of the data still stays in the research field and is seldom employed to assist a better understanding of the PFI cases and their ideal treatment targets.

AB  - Summary The respiratory system is complex. Although it consists of upper and lower respiratory tracts, the former is the focus of this chapter. The primary function of the upper respiratory tract is to conduct air from the external environment into the lower airway. This process begins at the external nose. Air moves through the nares and into paired nasal cavities. Air is cleansed, warmed, and humidified during its passage through the upper respiratory tract. A small amount of serous nasal discharge can be considered normal in the companion animal patient. However, copious amounts of serous nasal discharge may be indicative of pathology. Nasal discharge is a common complaint in companion animal practice. Its presentation is immensely variable in terms of color, translucency, and consistency, but it is most frequently described by cellular content as being mucoid, mucopurulent, serohemorrhagic, or hemorrhagic. Onset of nasal discharge may be acute, chronic, or recurrent. Nasal discharge may be unilateral or bilateral, or laterality may change with disease progression. It may occur in isolation of systemic signs of disease? or the patient may be systemically ill. Each fact deduced from history taking and every finding on physical examination provides a clue as to the likelihood of the underlying cause. Nasal discharge is particularly frustrating to the veterinary client and clinician alike when it is chronic. In such cases, secondary bacterial infection is common, and although antibiotic therapy may provide transient resolution of clinical signs, recurrence is likely without having identified or addressed the primary issue. A definitive diagnosis requires a multifaceted approach. Signalment, case history, and physical examination findings collectively assist with disease localization and prioritization of differential diagnoses. However, ancillary diagnostic tests are invaluable. A combination of cytology, histopathology, bacteriology, mycology, and imaging studies may be necessary to rule out infectious, inflammatory, and/or neoplastic disease. Idiopathic rhinitis and sinorhinitis are relatively common among companion animal patients. Nasal disease may also be congenital, genetic, or iatrogenic in origin.

AB  - Objective To describe clinical outcome and technical outcome assessed using computed tomography (CT) in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLSS) treated by dorsal laminectomy, partial discectomy, and transarticular screw fixation. Study Design Retrospective observational case series. Animals Dogs with DLSS (n?=?17). Methods Dogs with neurologic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings compatible with DLSS treated by dorsal laminectomy, partial discectomy and transarticular screw fixation were enrolled. Pre- and postoperative neurologic status was compared. Lumbosacral (LS) angle in extension and misalignment in preoperative MRI were compared with the postoperative CT. Residual mobility of the LS joint after fixation was also evaluated. Status of screws, presence of new bone formation over screw heads/articular facets and presence of adjacent segment disease (ASD) were assessed. Results Median CT follow-up was 12 months. Clinical improvement was seen in 13 dogs, 2 dogs had intermittent LS pain, and 2 dogs needed revision surgery. In 5 dogs, screws were either pulled out or broken. Reduction of LS angle in extension and misalignment was achieved. Residual mobility of the LS segment was present and ASD was not recognized. Conclusions Transarticular screw fixation in dogs with DLSS is associated with a considerable number of technical failures and does not result in rigid stabilization; however, this did not significantly adversely influence clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract Aims? Many patients treated for substance use disorders (SUDs) who become involved in 12-Step self-help groups have improved treatment outcomes. However, due to high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and major depressive disorder (MDD), among SUD patients in particular, concerns have been raised over whether these benefits extend to dual diagnosis patients. This study examined the influence of comorbid MDD among patients with SUDs on 12-Step self-help group involvement and its relation to treatment outcome. Design? A quasi-experimental, prospective, intact group design was used with assessments completed during treatment, and 1 and 2?years postdischarge. Participants? A total of 2161 male patients recruited during in-patient SUD treatment, of whom 110 had a comorbid MDD diagnosis (SUD-MDD) and 2051 were without psychiatric comorbidity (SUD-only). Findings? SUD-MDD patients were initially less socially involved in and derived progressively less benefit from 12-Step groups over time compared to the SUD-only group. However, substance use outcomes did not differ by diagnostic cohort. In contrast, despite using substantially more professional out-patient services, the SUD-MDD cohort continued to suffer significant levels of depression. Conclusions? Treatment providers should allocate more resources to targeting depressive symptoms in SUD-MDD patients. Furthermore, SUD-MDD patients may not assimilate as readily into, nor benefit as much from, traditional 12-Step self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, as psychiatrically non-comorbid patients. Newer, dual-diagnosis-specific, self-help groups may be a better fit for these patients, but await further study.

AB  - Summary Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) often occurs in patients with associated autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, but it can also occur in patients without other associated autoimmune disease. Studies of women with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-related complications show that women with thrombotic complications of APS have higher rates of pre-term delivery. Women with APS need close monitoring throughout pregnancy. Uterine artery Doppler scanning is recommended at 20-24 weeks, to check for evidence of bilateral uterine arterial notching, which has been shown to be predictive of placental dysfunction in women with APS. If bilateral notching is detected, serial growth scans are performed to monitor for intrauterine growth restriction. Patients present with multi-organ failure due to widespread thrombosis, and there is an associated high mortality rate. They require aggressive management, usually in an intensive care setting, with a combination of steroids, anticoagulation and/or plasma exchange.

AB  - Abstract We tested the hypothesis that race may influence clinical presentation and symptomatology in combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). African-American and Caucasian veterans were administered the Psychotic Screen Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), and other psychometric measures at a Veterans Affairs outpatient PTSD clinic. Subjects were consecutive referrals who were not matched for level of combat trauma or preexisting trauma; however, there were no group differences in other relevant demographic or diagnostic variables. Significant racial differences, with modest effect sizes, were found on clinician ratings of psychotic symptoms, MMPI-2 scale 6 (?paranoia?), and a measure of dissociation. No significant differences were found for the MMPI-2 scale 8 (?schizophrenia?), or on measures that might suggest comorbid depression or anxiety. African-Americans with PTSD endorsed more items suggesting positive symptoms of psychosis, without higher rates of primary psychosis, depression, or anxiety than Caucasians.
