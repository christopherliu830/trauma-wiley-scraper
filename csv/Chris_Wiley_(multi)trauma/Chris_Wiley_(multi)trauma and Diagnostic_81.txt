AB  - Summary Patients referred to a nephrologist are subjected to a bewildering array of diagnostic tests and procedures. This chapter explains the procedures commonly undertaken in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease. It covers the tests including those involving blood and urine, radiological tests, invasive investigations, and methods of evaluating glomerular filtration rate. The chapter discusses investigations that are carried out prior to initiating anaemia treatments, such as erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), as well as those used in cases of diminished response to ESAs. It evaluates the nurse's role in post-procedure care. The World Health Organization published guidelines on best phlebotomy practices, recommending standards for quality care that include laboratory sampling and the maintenance of quality control. Nurses must complete the necessary training before carrying out a new role, such as venepuncture.

AB  - A 10-month-old, neutered female Yorkshire terrier was presented with a 6-month history of inspiratory dyspnoea, coughing and exercise intolerance. Tracheoscopy revealed marked lateral-to-lateral fixed collapse of the cervical trachea and mild collapse of the thoracic trachea. Surgical exploration revealed a marked reduction in lateral tracheal width and multiple malformed tracheal rings. Placement of extraluminal ring prostheses around the cervical trachea resulted in widening of the tracheal diameter and an immediate improvement in clinical signs. 6?years postoperatively the patient was reported to have an excellent quality of life with complete resolution of clinical signs.

AB  - Abstract We tested the hypothesis that race may influence clinical presentation and symptomatology in combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). African-American and Caucasian veterans were administered the Psychotic Screen Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), and other psychometric measures at a Veterans Affairs outpatient PTSD clinic. Subjects were consecutive referrals who were not matched for level of combat trauma or preexisting trauma; however, there were no group differences in other relevant demographic or diagnostic variables. Significant racial differences, with modest effect sizes, were found on clinician ratings of psychotic symptoms, MMPI-2 scale 6 (?paranoia?), and a measure of dissociation. No significant differences were found for the MMPI-2 scale 8 (?schizophrenia?), or on measures that might suggest comorbid depression or anxiety. African-Americans with PTSD endorsed more items suggesting positive symptoms of psychosis, without higher rates of primary psychosis, depression, or anxiety than Caucasians.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome of dogs with presumptive echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion treated with thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study (2011-2017). Animals Eighteen dogs. Methods Records were searched for dogs with pericardial effusion and no identified cause by preoperative echocardiography and subsequent thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Collected data included presenting complaint, physical examination, laboratory results, imaging, and operative findings. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and/or recheck examination. Results No evidence of mass lesions or cause for the effusion was identified in any of the dogs by preoperative echocardiography. Nine dogs had unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results. Nine dogs had pericardioscopic abnormalities consistent with masses, nodules, or adhesions. Median survival time (MST) for the 9 dogs with abnormalities identified by pericardioscopy was 66 days, whereas MST for the 9 dogs with unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results was not reached (P?=?.0067). Median survival time for dogs based on histopathologic diagnosis alone was not different between dogs with a diagnosis of neoplasia and dogs with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.1056). Among dogs with lesions identified during pericardioscopy, MST did not differ between those with a diagnosis of malignancy and those with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.78). Conclusion Dogs with presumptive idiopathic pericardial effusion without evidence of masses, nodules, and/or adhesions during thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy lived longer than dogs in which abnormalities were identified during pericardioscopy. Clinical significance Thoracoscopic pericardectomy/pericardioscopy and targeted biopsy of the pericardium and pleura are recommended in dogs with echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers the common causes, clinical features, diagnostic evaluation and management of hypothalamo-pituitary disease. The advent of new technologies such as whole exome and whole genome sequencing has resulted in an expanding list of genetic factors involved in human hypothalamo-pituitary disease. The chapter lists examples of genetic factors involved in isolated or multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. The close proximity of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to various vital structures means that acquired damage to this area can easily lead to hypopituitarism. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is based upon a combination of clinical assessment, looking for the presence of not just endocrine-related symptoms and signs but also for other features related to the presence of a congenital syndrome or a suprasellar mass. Confirmation of hypopituitarism is a stepwise process, usually beginning with a baseline pituitary function screen, followed by dynamic pituitary function tests.

AB  - During the penalty phase of capital trials, defendants may introduce mitigating evidence that argues for a punishment ?less than death.? In the past few years, a novel form of mitigating evidence?brain scans made possible by technological advances in neuroscience?has been proffered by defendants to support claims that brain abnormalities reduce their culpability. This exploratory study assessed the impact of neuroscience evidence on mock jurors' sentencing recommendations and impressions of a capital defendant. Using actual case facts, we manipulated diagnostic evidence presented by the defense (psychosis diagnosis; diagnosis and neuropsychological test results; or diagnosis, test results, and neuroimages) and future dangerousness evidence presented by the prosecution (low or high risk). Recommendations for death sentences were affected by the neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence: defendants deemed at high risk for future dangerousness were less likely to be sentenced to death when jurors had this evidence than when they did not. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence also had mitigating effects on impressions of the defendant. We describe study limitations and pose questions for further research.

AB  - Abstract Parametric subtracted post-ictal diffusion tensor imaging (pspiDTI) is a novel imaging technique developed at our center to visualize transient, patient-specific, ictal-associated water diffusion abnormalities in hippocampal-associated axonal tissue. PspiDTI can elucidate putative connectivity patterns, tracing ictal propagation following a partial-onset seizure without generalization secondarily. PspiDTI compares two DTI volumes acquired during the early post-ictal period (<4 hr), and baseline inter-ictal interval (>24?hr post-seizure). This technique performs a voxel-wise parametric test to identify statistically significant transient ictal-associated changes in water diffusivity involving white matter (WM). Our technique was applied to six patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy who were candidates for direct cortical responsive neurostimulation (RNS) therapy. Global and region-specific fractional anisotropy decreases, relative to baseline, were detected in all patients with a 17.01% (p <?.01) relative mean decrement, while trace increases were found in 6/6 (100%) patients with a 13.30% (p <?.01) relative global mean increment. Changes in diffusivity were anatomically compared with transient hyper-perfusion as detected by subtracted ictal SPECT co-registered to MRI (SISCOM). In 5/6 (83.33%) patients, alterations in WM diffusivity were detected adjacent to the SISCOM signal localized predominantly in gray matter. In 4/6 patients, post-implant RNS electrocorticography revealed early ictal propagation between implanted RNS depth leads guided by pspiDTI, hence validating concordant abnormal diffusivity regions detected by our technique. PspiDTI can complement the conventional pre-surgical evaluation to provide additional crucial information regarding WM ictal-propagation pathways between predominantly gray matter ictal-onset zones. When incorporated into a multi-modality pre-surgical workflow, pspiDTI can aid in defining critical nodes between ictogenic regions. This information can be used to strategically implant a limited set of two RNS depth leads for maximizing the extent to which direct cortical RNS can modulate a potentially extensive epileptogenic network.

AB  - Acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure is a known complication of patients undergoing burns resuscitation. It can progress rapidly in the absence of primary abdominal pathology, causing multiple organ dysfunction. This is known as secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Intravascular fluid replacement and decompressive laparotomy form the standard management practices for ACS. Despite these measures, survival rates of secondary ACS in burns patients remain extremely poor. The medical records of four severely burnt patients are reviewed. All four patients underwent decompressive laparotomy. Three patients had either vacuum-assisted closure therapy or a Silastic bowel bag inserted and temporary abdominal wound closure was gained using an absorbable synthetic mesh. There was one survivor. Early recognition and alternatives to standard therapy may result in possible decrease in mortality figures. However, the poor outcome may be intrinsic to the severe burn injuries rather than a reflection of current practices. Patients that survive open laparotomy face a new set of complications on road to recovery that are often ignored.

AB  - Objectives To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. Methods Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based on a neutrophil concentration <1·5?109 cells/L on a minimum of two complete blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and that had a haematocrit of ≥29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts performed after initiation of therapy, were included. Results Information on 35 dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0·5?109 cells/L in most cases (21 dogs), 0·5 to ·99?109 cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1·49?109 cells/L in three. Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49·9?109 cells/L) in three. [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33 dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. Clinical Significance Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of immunosuppressive medications.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To evaluate multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in hanging and manual strangulation cases and compare them with forensic autopsy results. Materials and Methods Postmortem MSCT and MRI of nine persons who died from hanging or manual strangulation were performed. The neck findings were compared with those discovered during forensic autopsy. In addition, two living patients underwent imaging and clinical examination following severe manual strangulation and near-hanging, respectively. For evaluation, the findings were divided into ?primary? (strangulation mark and subcutaneous desiccation (i.e., soft-tissue thinning as a result of tissue fluids being driven out by mechanical compression) in hanging, and subcutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhage in manual strangulation) and ?collateral? signs. The Wilcoxon two-tailed test was used for statistical analysis of the lymph node and salivary gland findings. Results In hanging, the primary and most frequent collateral signs were revealed by imaging. In manual strangulation, the primary findings were accurately depicted, with the exception of one slight hemorrhage. Apart from a vocal cord hemorrhage, all frequent collateral signs could be diagnosed radiologically. Traumatic lymph node hemorrhage (P = 0.031) was found in all of the manual strangulation cases. Conclusion MSCT and MRI revealed strangulation signs concordantly with forensic pathology findings. Imaging offers a great potential for the forensic examination of lesions due to strangulation in both clinical and postmortem settings. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objective To determine whether the current Finnish screening method using a single flexed mediolateral view as scored by osteophyte is sufficient to diagnose mild elbow dysplasia in Labrador retrievers and to determine if an additional craniocaudal oblique projection would result in improvement in the screening protocol. Materials and Methods Thirteen dogs with one mildly affected elbow joint and one elbow joint without radiological evidence of osteophytes were studied. Radiographic and computed tomography studies were performed and the results compared with each other. Results Medial compartment disease was observed in 14 of 26 joints based on computed tomography. The sensitivity and specificity of the grading based mainly on osteoarthritis was 79 and 92%, respectively. A strong association existed between elbow dysplasia based on computed tomography and medial humeral epicondylar osteophytes on the craniocaudal projection. Clinical Significance A single mediolateral flexed radiograph is reliable in diagnosing mild elbow dysplasia in Labrador retrievers. However, the craniocaudal oblique projection increases the specificity of the diagnosis, and it is proposed that it be included in the radiographic protocol in this breed.

AB  - Primary urethral carcinoma (PUC) is a rare malignancy accounting for <1% of genitourinary cancers, with a predilection for men and African-Americans. The sites and histology of urethral carcinoma vary by gender and anatomical location. Squamous cell carcinoma is most common among both genders but adenocarcinomas are noted in 15?35% of cases among women. Obstructive or irritative symptoms and haematuria are common modes of presentation. Clinical evaluation includes cystourethroscopy with biopsy and examination under anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging provides a highly effective method to image the primary tumour while def?ning the potential involvement of surrounding structures. Most tumours are localised, with regional metastases to nodal sites seen in up to 30% of cases in both genders, while distant metastases at presentation are rare (0?6%), but occur in up to 40% of cases with recurrent disease. Among men, the two most important prognostic factors are disease location and stage. Low-stage tumours (T1?2) and tumours involving the fossa navicularis or the penile urethra have a better prognosis than higher stage tumours (>T2 or N+) and lesions involving the bulbomembranous urethra. In women, in addition to stage and location, the size of the tumour has also prognostic implications. While surgery and radiation therapy (RT) are of benefit in early stage disease, advanced stage PUC requires multimodal treatment strategies to optimise local control and survival. These include induction chemotherapy followed by surgery or RT and concurrent chemoradiation with or without surgery. The latter strategy has been used successfully to treat other human papillomavirus-related cancers of the vagina, cervix and anus and may be of value in achieving organ preservation. Given the rarity of PUC, prospective multi-institutional studies are needed to better define the optimal treatment approach for this disease entity.

Methods A prospective observational study at Royal Perth Hospital of every patient attending ED for the 168-h period commencing 08.00?hours Monday 1 December 2014. Patient presentations were classified as alcohol-related (alcohol-positive) using predefined criteria. These patients were compared to alcohol-negative patients on a range of demographic and clinical descriptors. Results Two hundred and thirteen (15.2%) of 1403 patients screened were alcohol-positive. Compared with alcohol-negative patients, alcohol-positive patients were more likely to be male (148/213, 69.5% vs 636/1190, 53.4%, P?<?0.001) and younger (mean 38 years vs 48 years, P?<?0.001). They were more likely to arrive in police custody (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3?9.5, P?=?0.005), and be admitted to the State Adult Major Trauma Unit (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1?8.3, P?<?0.001). Forty-two (19.7%) of 213 patients had injuries suspected to be caused by an alcohol-affected third party. The ED length of stay and admission rate were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions 15.2% of patient presentations over the study week were alcohol-related. These patients were more likely to present with injury; one in five having injuries suspected to be caused by a third party affected by alcohol. This is a significant public health problem.
