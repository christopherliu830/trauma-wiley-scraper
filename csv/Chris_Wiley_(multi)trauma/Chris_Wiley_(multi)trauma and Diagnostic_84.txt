AB  - Objective To identify factors associated with a history of suicide attempt in medical students. Methods A Web-based survey was sent out to a sample of medical students. A multi-predictor Poisson regression was performed to identify factors associated with a history of suicide attempt. In addition, an elastic net regularization was used to build a risk calculator to identify students at risk for attempted suicide. Results A total of 4,840 participants were included in the study. Prevalence of suicide attempts in the sample was 8.94%. Risk factors associated with past suicide attempt in the multi-predictor Poisson regression were as follows: female gender (P < 0.001); homosexuality (P < 0.001); low income (P = 0.026); bullying by university peers (P = 0.006); childhood (P = 0.001) or adult (P = 0.001) trauma; family history of suicide (P = 0.005); suicidal ideation within the last month (P < 0.001); daily tobacco use (P = 0.037); and being at severe risk for alcohol abuse (P = 0.023). Our elastic net model performed well with an AUC of 0.83. Conclusions This study identifies a number of key factors associated with a history of suicide attempts among medical students. Future longitudinal studies should assess the causal relationship between these factors and suicide attempts. Additionally, these results demonstrate that current available data on suicide attempts among medical students can be used to develop an accurate risk algorithm.

AB  - Psychiatry research has long experienced a stagnation stemming from a lack of understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of phenomenologically defined mental disorders. Recently, the application of computational neuroscience to psychiatry research has shown great promise in establishing a link between phenomenological and pathophysiological aspects of mental disorders, thereby recasting current nosology in more biologically meaningful dimensions. In this review, we highlight recent investigations into computational neuroscience that have undertaken either theory- or data-driven approaches to quantitatively delineate the mechanisms of mental disorders. The theory-driven approach, including reinforcement learning models, plays an integrative role in this process by enabling correspondence between behavior and disorder-specific alterations at multiple levels of brain organization, ranging from molecules to cells to circuits. Previous studies have explicated a plethora of defining symptoms of mental disorders, including anhedonia, inattention, and poor executive function. The data-driven approach, on the other hand, is an emerging field in computational neuroscience seeking to identify disorder-specific features among high-dimensional big data. Remarkably, various machine-learning techniques have been applied to neuroimaging data, and the extracted disorder-specific features have been used for automatic case?control classification. For many disorders, the reported accuracies have reached 90% or more. However, we note that rigorous tests on independent cohorts are critically required to translate this research into clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the utility of the disorder-specific features found by the data-driven approach to psychiatric therapies, including neurofeedback. Such developments will allow simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders using neuroimaging, thereby establishing ?theranostics? for the first time in clinical psychiatry.

AB  - Liver transplantation (LT) with donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors has been associated with a high rate of ischemic-type biliary strictures (ITBSs) and inferior graft survival. To investigate the impact of an intraoperative tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on outcomes following DCD LT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of DCD LT at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) and the Ochsner Medical Center (OMC). Between 2009 and 2013, 85 DCD LTs were performed with an intraoperative tPA injection (n?=?30 at TGH, n?=?55 at OMC), and they were compared with 33 DCD LTs without a tPA. Donor and recipient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion requirement (3.2?±?3.4 versus 3.1?±?2.3 U, P?=?0.74). Overall, biliary strictures occurred less commonly in the tPA-treated group (16.5% versus 33.3%, P?=?0.07) with a much lower rate of diffuse intrahepatic strictures (3.5% versus 21.2%, P?=?0.005). After 1 and 3 years, the tPA group versus the non-tPA group had superior patient survival (97.6% versus 87.0% and 92.7% versus 79.7%, P?=?0.016) and graft survival (96.4% versus 69.7% and 90.2% versus 63.6%, P?<?0.001). In conclusion, a tPA injection into the hepatic artery during DCD LT reduces ITBSs and improves graft and patient survival without increasing the risk for bleeding.

AB  - Summary.? Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are being increasingly diagnosed in systemic and cerebral vessels in children. Systemic VTE are increasing in children as a result of therapeutic advances and improved clinical acumen in primary illnesses that previously caused mortality. The epidemiology of systemic VTE has been studied in international registries. In children older than 3?months, teenagers are the largest group developing VTE. The most common etiologic factor is the presence of central venous lines. Clinical studies have determined the most sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing upper system VTE are ultrasound for jugular venous thrombosis and venography for intrathoracic vessels. However, the most sensitive diagnostic methods for lower system VTE and pulmonary embolism (PE) have not been established. Treatment studies for VTE consist of inadequately powered randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The long-term outcome of systemic VTE, post-thrombotic syndrome, has been reported in children. Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is becoming increasingly diagnosed in children due to the recognition of the associated subtle clinical symptoms and improved cerebrovascular imaging. The etiology of CSVT includes thrombophilia, head and neck infections, and systemic illness. Estimates of the incidence and outcome of childhood CSVT have recently become available through the Canadian Pediatric Ischaemic Stroke Registry. Clinical studies have not yet been carried out in children to determine the best method of diagnosis or treatment. There have only been case-series studies carried out in the treatment of CSVT. Properly designed clinical trials are urgently required in children with systemic VTE/PE and CSVT to define the best methods of diagnosis, treatment and long-term management.

AB  - ABSTRACT The surgical fracture fixation of the odontoid process (dens) of the second cervical vertebra (C2/axis) is a challenging procedure, particularly in elderly patients affected by bone loss, and includes screw positioning close to vital structures. The aim of this study was to provide an extended anatomical knowledge of C2, the bone mass distribution and bone loss, and to understand the implications for anterior screw fixation. One hundred and twenty standard clinical quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans of the intact cervical spine from 60 female and 60 male European patients, aged 18?90 years, were used to compute a three-dimensional statistical model and an averaged bone mass model of C2. Shape and size variability was assessed via principal component analysis (PCA), bone mass distribution by thresholding and via virtual core drilling, and the screw placement via virtual positioning of screw templates. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a highly variable anatomy of the dens with size as the predominant variation according to the first principal component (PC) whereas shape changes were primarily described by the remaining PCs. The bone mass distribution demonstrated a characteristic 3D pattern, and remained unchanged in the presence of bone loss. Virtual screw positioning of two 3.5?mm dens screws with a 1?mm safety zone was possible in 81.7% in a standard, parallel position and in additional 15.8% in a twisted position. The approach permitted a more detailed anatomical assessment of the dens axis. Combined with a preoperative QCT it may further improve the diagnostic procedure of odontoid fractures. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aim Surgical treatment of high anal fistulas is associated with the potential risk of faecal incontinence and recurrence. The primary aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of three-dimensional endoanal ultrasound (3D-EAUS) in the assessment of height and type of anal fistulas, compared to the intra-operative findings (gold standard). The secondary aim was to evaluate the inter-observer reproducibility of 3D-EAUS. Method The study design was a prospective analysis of retrospective data. 299 patients (202 men), mean age 45.3 years, who underwent surgery for anal fistulas, were included. All patients were preoperatively assessed by 3D-EAUS. Two readers independently reviewed the volumes to determine the type and height of fistulas. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, proportion of agreements and Cohen's kappa coefficient (?) were calculated for both examiners. Ultrasound findings were compared with intra-operative data (reference standard), evaluated blindly by the surgeons. Results At surgery, 201 (67%) were transsphincteric, 49 (16%) suprasphincteric, 47 (16%) intersphincteric and two (1%) extrasphincteric fistulas. Intra-operatively, 177 (59%) were low and 122 (41%) high fistulas. The overall accuracy of 3D-EAUS was 91% for fistula type (271/299 fistulas: 97% transsphincteric, 100% intersphincteric, 57% suprasphincteric, 0% extrasphincteric) and 92% for fistula height (275/299 fistulas: 80% high and 100% low). Both readers reported very good agreement with surgery in the assessment of fistula type (proportion of agreement 0.88, ? = 0.89) and height (proportion of agreement 0.90, ? = 0.91). Conclusions 3D-EAUS is an accurate and reproducible modality for the assessment of type and height of anal fistulas.

AB  - Background and Objectives Prior research has revealed a strong relationship between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and alcohol misuse. However, previous attempts to understand nuanced associations between PTSD symptom clusters and alcohol misuse within military veteran samples have produced mixed results. In an attempt to better understand the associations between PTSD and alcohol misuse, the current study examined the unique relationships between the newly classified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) PTSD symptom clusters and alcohol misuse in an outpatient sample of military veterans seeking treatment for PTSD and Substance Use Disorders. Methods Veterans (N?=?100) were administered a brief battery of self-report questionnaires prior to receiving psychological services to aid in diagnostic assessment and treatment planning. Results Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that PTSD intrusions (cluster B), negative alterations in cognition and mood (cluster D), and arousal/reactivity (cluster E) symptoms were associated with alcohol misuse. Discussion and Conclusions The positive association between alcohol misuse and PTSD symptom severity is consistent with a broader body of literature demonstrating the co-occurrence of these disorders, particularly in military samples. Scientific Significance Increased alcohol consumption may interfere with current front-line treatments for PTSD, which encourages patients to experience a full range of emotions. As such, future research should explore the impact of substance use on the effectiveness of trauma focused treatments in the alleviation of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. (Am J Addict 2018;27:23?28)

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To examine whether the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) screening tool can satisfy Rasch model expectations and therefore be transformed into an interval level measurement scale, suitable for use as an outcome measure in clinical studies. Design.? Rasch analysis (using the software RUMM2020) of LANSS data from both a random selection of all chronic pain patients and also specific chronic pain diagnostic categories. Patients.? Original LANSS data from a previous study of 2,480 patients with chronic pain were used. Specific diagnostic groups examined included diabetic neuropathy, postsurgical pain, osteoarthritis, posttraumatic injury, and low back pain. Outcome Measures.? The following assessments were made: fit to the Rasch model, scale reliability, scale multi-dimensionality, and differential item functioning. Results.? The overall fit to the Rasch model was only acceptable in two groups; diabetic neuropathy and chronic postsurgical pain. For these groups, the scale is unidimensional (measures a single construct) and there is no evidence of differential item functioning across gender and age groups. The scale only has reliability consistent with use at the group level. Conclusions.? Neuropathic screening tools such as the LANSS have been used as outcome measures in clinical studies. Rasch analysis demonstrates that the LANSS can be used as such in specific populations of patients with neuropathic pain, however it's reliability in this context does not support use at the individual level and it cannot be used as a generalised measurement tool across pain diagnostic groups. The LANSS remains primarily a diagnostic tool.

AB  - Abstract Bacterial skin and soft tissues infections (SSTI) often determine acute disease and frequent emergency recovering, and they are one of the most common causes of infection among groups of different ages. Given the variable presentation of SSTI, a thorough assessment of their incidence and prevalence is difficult. The presence of patient-related (local or systemic) or environmental risk factors, along with the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, can promote SSTI. These infections may present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and different severity, and can be classified according to various criteria. Many bacterial species can cause SSTI, but Gram-positive bacteria are the most frequently isolated, with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The diagnosis of SSTI requires an extended clinical history, a thorough physical examination and a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis is particularly important in complicated infections, which often require laboratory studies, diagnostic imaging and surgical exploration. SSTI management should conform to the epidemiology, the aetiology, the severity and the depth of the infection. Topical, oral or systemic antimicrobial therapy and drainage or debridement could be necessary, along with treatment of a significant underlying disease. This review discusses the epidemiology, the pathogenesis and the classification of bacterial SSTI, describes their associated risk factors and their clinical presentations. The authors provide a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to SSTI in respect of antibiotic resistance and currently available antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Exercise-induced changes of transverse proton relaxation time (T2), tissue perfusion and metabolic turnover were investigated in the lower back muscles of volunteers by applying muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) before and after as well as dynamic 31P-MRS during the exercise. Inner (M. multifidus, MF) and outer lower back muscles (M. erector spinae, ES) were examined in 14 healthy young men performing a sustained isometric trunk-extension. Significant phosphocreatine (PCr) depletions ranging from 30% (ES) to 34% (MF) and Pi accumulations between 95% (left ES) and 120%?140% (MF muscles and right ES) were observed during the exercise, which were accompanied by significantly decreased pH values in all muscles (?pH?≈??0.05). Baseline T2 values were similar across all investigated muscles (approximately 27?ms at 3?T), but revealed right?left asymmetric increases (T2,inc) after the exercise (right ES/MF: T2,inc?=?11.8/9.7%; left ES/MF: T2,inc?=?4.6/8.9%). Analyzed muscles also showed load-induced increases in molecular diffusion D (p?=?.007) and perfusion fraction f (p?=?.002). The latter parameter was significantly higher in the MF than in the ES muscles both at rest and post exercise. Changes in PCr (p?=?.03), diffusion (p?<?.01) and perfusion (p?=?.03) were strongly associated with T2,inc, and linear mixed model analysis revealed that changes in PCr and perfusion both affect T2,inc (p?<?.001). These findings support previous assumptions that T2 changes are not only an intra-cellular phenomenon resulting from metabolic stress but are also affected by increased perfusion in loaded muscles.

AB  - Abstract Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are diagnosed in at least 10?40% of the patients seen for long-term monitoring of epilepsy, and it is no surprise that patients with PNES are often treated for epilepsy. Given the substantial economic costs and mental health burden of misdiagnosis, it is imperative to establish early identification, correct diagnosis, and effective treatment of PNES in order to provide the greatest opportunity for remission of events, improved psychological functioning, and social-vocational outcome. This article outlines an informed, practical approach to diagnosing this common condition and provides a summary of factors, based on medical history and semiology, that may suggest PNES. We discuss also the issues of communicating the diagnosis to the patient and making treatment recommendations which should ideally be coordinated using a multi-disciplinary team approach, involving the disciplines of neurology, psychiatry, psychology, social work, and nursing.

AB  - Abstract The functional significance of changes in nuclear structure and organization in transformed cells remains one of the most enigmatic questions in cancer biology. In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.

AB  - This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report examines how the use of biomarkers may influence the AD diagnostic process and estimates of prevalence and incidence of the disease. An estimated 5.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's dementia. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's dementia every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's dementia is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2014, official death certificates recorded 93,541 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Between 2000 and 2014, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 21%, 14%, and 9%, respectively, whereas deaths from AD increased 89%. The actual number of deaths to which AD contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from AD recorded on death certificates. In 2017, an estimated 700,000 Americans age ≥65 years will have AD when they die, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by AD. In 2016, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.2 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at more than $230 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with Alzheimer's or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with dementia are estimated to be $259 billion. In recent years, efforts to develop and validate AD biomarkers, including those detectable with brain imaging and in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, have intensified. Such efforts could transform the practice of diagnosing AD from one that focuses on cognitive and functional symptoms to one that incorporates biomarkers. This new approach could promote diagnosis at an earlier stage of disease and lead to a more accurate understanding of AD prevalence and incidence.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although tuberculosis is mainly managed medically today, thoracic surgery continues to play a key role in its diagnosis and treatment in selected subgroups of patients. In certain scenarios such as multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, advanced tuberculous empyema and symptomatic bronchial stenosis, modern thoracic surgery may represent the only effective means of management in selected patients. Advances in thoracic surgery in recent years, in particular the use of Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery, not only reduce postoperative morbidity for individual patients, but may potentially allow a wider range of tuberculosis patients to benefit from surgery. Respiratory physicians and thoracic surgeons should continue to work together to ensure that tuberculosis patients who may benefit from surgery are identified for prompt and effective intervention.
